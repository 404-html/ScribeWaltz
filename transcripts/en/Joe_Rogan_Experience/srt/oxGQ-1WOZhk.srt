1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,980
Who won?
Brian Kalin,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,470
[inaudible] survivor and,
and wearing a sky blue shirt please.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,530
If I call you terrorist survivor,
how much hate do you think I'll get?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,710
It seems like a nice green light for
people to get upset for no reason.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,030
Well,
you know,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,190
I think that everybody wants to be,
if you've not been affected by it,

7
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,620
but you were there,
you want somehow credit.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,860
Like I found myself,
I was 800 feet exactly away from the

9
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:30,861
blast because I was at the Gotham Comedy
Club Two oh eight w I think west 23rd

10
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,700
and the volume was at one 33.
It's hard for me to think of how big 800

11
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,350
feet is.
So like when I'm on my block,

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,610
half a block,
if you look it on,

13
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,940
if you will,
if you actually close,

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,390
if you look at on your Google maps,
it's Av block.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,480
And um,
so you were about to go on stage.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,730
I was about to go on stage and I was
with Jimmy Burke,

17
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:49,680
the national treasure.
That is Jimmy Burke.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,100
I love Jimmy.
Of course you do.

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,920
Who doesn't?
And we were talking in the front of the

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,050
club.
So I was literally right behind the

21
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,500
front door and the Gotham comedy club,
you have to walk all the way down and go

22
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,300
into the room.
So,

23
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,590
um,
probably about 25 yards.

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,180
So I'm literally on the street,
but with the door in front of us and we

25
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:12,480
just hear about boom.
And that's sickening sound.

26
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:12,901
Well,
you know,

27
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:13,651
it's a bomb,
you know,

28
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,660
it's not a manhole cover.
You know what I mean?

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,570
You just know it's just too long.
I've ever heard a bomb.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,690
It's horrifying.
And it was 800 feet away before that.

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,570
You did when you were,
cause I lived in Lebanon.

32
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,100
Right.
So I had,

33
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,710
uh,
in fact I remember going back to

34
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,630
Lebanon,
I can't remember the year,

35
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,890
but they shot a missile.

36
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,310
It was a test fire,
a missile over our head on the beach.

37
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,660
I will never forget this.
It was so loud that we fell down on the

38
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:40,800
ground.
We were on the beach.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,500
It was so loud.
I don't know if that was because it was

40
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,710
shot over our heads in the sonic boom,
but we fell down.

41
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,960
It May and it was either a shell or
something.

42
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,820
But I remember,
and you don't see it though.

43
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,180
You don't see the,
you know,

44
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,330
the,
the shell because it's going so fast.

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,390
But what you do is you hear this
insanely loud noise.

46
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,690
And I remember looking around and
everybody fell down and I fell down.

47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,441
I,
you know,

48
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:01,801
you,
you,

49
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,634
you know,
um,

50
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,650
it's not even like a fall down.
You are,

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,000
it's like you lose your balance and
you're,

52
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,550
you're reaching for something to hold
onto,

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,180
but then you go down your hands and
knees.

54
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,460
And it was really strange thing.
So,

55
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,070
um,
and I remember being a kid in Lebanon

56
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,170
and seeing,
uh,

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,290
uh,
planes,

58
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,920
Bama gas station from the balcony,
and then we had to go downstairs and

59
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,390
sleep in the,
in the garage.

60
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,550
But,
um,

61
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,780
so I,
I heard loud noises as a kid,

62
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,160
very loud noises,
but this,

63
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,990
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

64
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,110
I'm not a seasoned terrorism expert
here.

65
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:31,711
Uh,
you know,

66
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,780
a experience her and I don't think
anybody is,

67
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,150
and it certainly wasn't think about
this,

68
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:40,890
this was a pressure cooker.
This was not a car bomb and that was 800

69
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,960
feet away,
which is how many football fields

70
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,450
explain,
cause it was the same sort of bomb the

71
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,890
used in the Boston marathon bombings
right to go,

72
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,020
right.
Same kind of thing.

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,540
And I believe it was hooked up to a cell
phone.

74
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,570
Yeah.
That's how it was activated.

75
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,870
Your cell phone.
Yeah.

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,140
And when that thing went off you just
knew it was a mom.

77
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:02,200
And the crazy that the sickening thing
was before that they said you got four

78
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,700
minutes,
he's coming off in four minutes.

79
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,640
And I,
I ended up,

80
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,690
we were in the front there and Jimmy and
I were talking and I said,

81
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,790
no problem.
And this bomb goes off.

82
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,350
And I said to Jimmy,
I go,

83
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,510
that was a bomb.
And he goes,

84
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,850
yes it was.
And we'd go outside and I see smoke and

85
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,260
it's quiet,
you know,

86
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,750
because there's this pause before the
storm sort of,

87
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,140
and it just,
I saw smoke and you could smell this

88
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,020
sort of um,
like a burning thing,

89
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,120
you know,
it smelled like smoke um,

90
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,540
quickly and then you then instead of
people running towards you in screaming,

91
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,380
they were jogging New Yorkers like ah,
the fuck man,

92
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:41,660
come on.

93
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,191
That's right.
You know,

94
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,710
and they were jogging.
So your instinct is to go toward the

95
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,530
blast,
you know,

96
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,580
make sure everybody's okay.
But the sixth thing is that when your

97
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,090
instinct is a,
for me,

98
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:52,220
because I thought there's no way people
aren't injured or killed as well.

99
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:54,070
I'm fine.
I got to be on stage.

100
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,070
But you know,
this is obviously all encompassing and

101
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,440
do you have any new material you're
working on?

102
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,100
I did and that's why I had to let them
fend for themselves.

103
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,010
I had to fill out.
It's always about our folks.

104
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:08,270
It's just a bar.
Hey guy here,

105
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,910
good to be here tonight.
Where are you from sir?

106
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:13,210
You look like Jersey.
What was really bizarre was that we were

107
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,871
running toilet.
I said,

108
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,370
Jim,
we got to go back inside because I was

109
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,680
afraid it was another mom,
right?

110
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,350
Because in Lebanon they used to always
set off an explosion.

111
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,320
The old trick was to have people run
toward another explosion.

112
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,940
Right.
I know that from,

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
you know,
and my mother used to always say,

114
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,850
be careful of that.
That sounds terrible.

115
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,460
Piece of information to carry around in
your head when you were a child.

116
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,110
It's also important.
I know,

117
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,110
it's horrible.
It's hard because it's so maniacal cause

118
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,390
it,
they're trying to injure people and,

119
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,480
and that's an old technique,
right?

120
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,500
So you,
you create a small explosion,

121
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,970
get people to run toward the bigger
explosion.

122
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,140
There's just something incredibly fucked
up about people's ability to just attack

123
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,050
and kill random people that they don't
know.

124
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,940
Well,
that was playing around out that the

125
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,980
terrorism is,
the idea is to spread fear and get

126
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:56,410
people to behave differently.
You're not gonna win the war with big

127
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,860
bombs,
but you can get people to change their

128
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,240
routine,
their life,

129
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,380
and the way they think.

130
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,760
And even like I told you when I was in
the Chelsea market five hours before

131
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,560
that,
it was so crowded and it was so,

132
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,590
I just great food people were at a spice
market in clothing and just beautiful

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,750
people and I thought to myself,
I'm going to get out of here because

134
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:20,320
this feels like the place that I would
bomb if I was a terrorist and it was

135
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,180
just a premonition.
I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.

136
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,450
My thinking is different because of the
world we live in,

137
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,460
so they've changed the way my energy og
roughy,

138
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,500
they changed the way I behave the way I
think we know what,

139
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,500
regardless of whether I want to admit
that or not,

140
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,260
I found myself to be nervous in that.
In that,

141
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,500
in that space,
do you think that you would have had

142
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,760
that same feeling anyway of no bomb went
off or do you really think that there

143
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:44,440
was a premonition or one of those things
where you sort of connect to feeling

144
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,140
like,
I don't believe in premonitions.

145
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,810
I mean,
maybe I do if you can read signals and

146
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,070
stuff,
but that wasn't the case for me.

147
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,930
I just said I have an act of
imagination.

148
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,010
My take on that kind of stuff is maybe,
you know,

149
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,410
it's right.
I don't want say,

150
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,330
I don't know,
because there's not a goddamn way to

151
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,770
measure it.
There's no,

152
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:03,380
but there are weird moments where people
have weird thoughts,

153
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,710
but just wondering if you really,
yes.

154
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,781
Well,
the answer is there.

155
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,170
There,
there are two books that were,

156
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,810
had been,
this has been studied and thinking fast

157
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,620
and slow by Daniel Kahneman.
He won a Nobel Prize for economics and

158
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:17,270
behavioral economics.
And then,

159
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,390
uh,
in Malcolm Gladwell's book blink there

160
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,800
are,
and for that matter,

161
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,670
Josh Waitzkin,
his book,

162
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,700
the art of learning,
all three great books that I recommend

163
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:29,450
to everybody because there are signals a
human being,

164
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:32,300
and soldiers talk about this when
they've experienced a lot of IED,

165
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,110
they get very good when their life
depends on it at reading signals,

166
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,410
the stillness in the air behavior that
they can't explain.

167
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,670
But why are those people acting a little
bit differently?

168
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,130
Why are the women not out?
Why are the women not out?

169
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,530
Why can't I see any women out?
Why is it just men?

170
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,420
Why are the windows being shut right
now?

171
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,680
They pick up on all these little signals
and in blink and in thinking fast and

172
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:58,610
slow,
there are,

173
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
there are things we pick up on very
quickly.

174
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,850
We just have pattern recognition.
There are other things that take a long

175
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:05,750
time to think about,
right?

176
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:08,150
So a math problem like 48 times,
you know,

177
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,110
36 would take a long time.
It's a slow process and you can't do a

178
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:16,040
lot else when you're doing that.
But you can recognize if somebody is

179
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,100
running at you screaming with their eyes
open and their hands up that they're

180
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:22,400
probably going to do something physical
to you or something.

181
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,230
We registered these in very quickly.

182
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,950
The same goes for,
you know,

183
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,960
any kind of a situation.
Probably when something's about to

184
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,390
happen,
there may be a change in behavior.

185
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,710
There may be,
uh,

186
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,810
this doesn't look right.
Why does that road,

187
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,300
why is that bump in that road that
wasn't there last time?

188
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:43,220
Those kinds of things that soldiers talk
about.

189
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,880
So for me,
I think this was just simply the idea

190
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:51,020
that I was closed in,
everything was really great and I felt

191
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,760
like I have coffee running to my body.
I'm,

192
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,190
I'm on a caffeine high,
I did my yoga,

193
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,900
I feel good.
This is too good to be true.

194
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm going to turn around in case a bomb
goes off and blows my head off that,

195
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,750
that's more just paranoia.
But in this case,

196
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,170
after the bomb,
I ran and I said to Jimmy,

197
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,850
I said,
come back inside,

198
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,770
come back inside.

199
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,390
That could be a second bomb.
And he said,

200
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,201
yeah,
you're right.

201
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,290
And so we ran back inside and they go
Juran and now I go,

202
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,360
but there was a bomb and they'd go,
what?

203
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,070
And I said,
the a bomb went off and they go,

204
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,890
well,
you know that the full house sold that

205
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:24,890
house.
So I run on stage and the real worry was

206
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,830
my cousins were coming to see the show
and I thought that they were,

207
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,940
you know,
right there.

208
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,490
So that's what I,
so I had to kind of get myself together

209
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,350
and do stand up and my heart was beating
fast,

210
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,750
but it was more depression.
It wasn't,

211
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,670
it was less than fear than more
depression at the world.

212
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:40,520
We live in that sound.
So then I did stand up and in halfway

213
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,420
through or three quarters of the way
through an off duty cop who works there

214
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,610
walked on stage cause he stopped the,
the,

215
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,590
the soldiers that came in with the
machine guns.

216
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,790
He said,
let me get him off stage.

217
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,190
Don't,
don't raid the comedy club please.

218
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,040
And Hope Bizarre.
Yeah.

219
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,270
So he walks on,
literally walks on and I turned and I

220
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,230
went,
oh no.

221
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,850
I just said,
oh no.

222
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,890
Cause I was confirmed.
I knew something was bad,

223
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,900
you know.
And he said he took the mic out of my

224
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:04,711
hand.
He said,

225
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,120
sorry folks,
we have to get you out of here.

226
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,850
And then we left.
It was just depressing,

227
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,350
man.
Wow.

228
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,640
I'm not a terrorism survivor,
but I witnessed on blue.

229
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,870
What did that feel like going on stage
right after you knew that a bomb went

230
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,300
off 800 feet away.
You know,

231
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,510
I asked Jimmy who was there and I said,
well did it seem like I was nervous?

232
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,020
He said,
nope,

233
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,760
you just went right into pro mode.
You know,

234
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,280
I've been doing it so long and I,
and I,

235
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,080
I,
it was a full house and I just said,

236
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,160
you got to get it together.

237
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,790
Wow.
I think,

238
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,170
I think anybody who's been doing standup
the way as long as I have or you have,

239
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,221
I,
you know,

240
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:36,420
we,
we'd figure our way through.

241
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,750
You know,
I probably was speaking faster.

242
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,020
I could feel my heart beating,
but it was also just,

243
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,060
it's terrifying man.
When you,

244
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:45,511
when,
when,

245
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,400
when it's that real,
you know,

246
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:47,940
when,
when,

247
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,810
when you think about the fact that
people are walking through their lives,

248
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:52,830
life is hard,
right?

249
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,700
Like just accomplishing shit.
Keeping yourself on the straight and

250
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,760
narrow flossing,
fucking working out,

251
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,140
going for your dreams anymore.
It was like a study.

252
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,570
Oh I heard about that.
You know,

253
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,240
this is flossing is bullshit.
Good.

254
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,630
Cause I use a toothpick cause I'm a man.
Good for you.

255
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,370
And then,
and then something,

256
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:14,160
the random can happen and all those
plans go out the fucking window.

257
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,990
Yeah.
That's the strangest aspect of it,

258
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,320
isn't it?

259
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,410
The randomness of it.
But all of a sudden these moments

260
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,570
unexpected or introduced into the world
and they change everything,

261
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,910
you know?
And we only see our,

262
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,570
our side of it.
Obviously this is happening all over the

263
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:34,590
world to varying degrees.
We're just so insulated from this kind

264
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,980
of stuff that when a random act like
this does happen,

265
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,070
it's so shocking.
But if this was in,

266
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,210
you know,
the worst aspects are the worst parts of

267
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,580
the world,
they're probably experiencing these

268
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,320
kinds of things.
How to daily all the time.

269
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:52,680
And not only that,
if you look at the great artistic

270
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,440
expressions,
like look at Picasso and take a look at

271
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:58,230
what he lived through.
Look at the world that those people live

272
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,520
to.
Giacometti who,

273
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,010
you know,
he made these sculptures of,

274
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,180
um,
it looks like people who have been

275
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,220
through a holocaust to it,
to a nuclear holocaust,

276
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,230
they were very,
very,

277
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,000
you know,
political commitment in the 20th

278
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,300
century.

279
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,160
It wasn't something you could not have.
Right.

280
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,130
And,
and they witnessed world wars and

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,440
nuclear weaponry and all kinds of
things.

282
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,110
Probably Influenza that killed 20
million people worldwide,

283
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,040
all kinds of stuff.
And they let it inform their,

284
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,190
their artistic expression informed their
behavior.

285
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,020
Look,
you've talked to a world war two

286
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,940
veterans.
I've talked to old guys.

287
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:31,580
I said,
what was it like when you came back?

288
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,690
They said,
you're just more serious and there's

289
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,560
more of an urgency to get things done.
You don't have as much time.

290
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,270
Don't make sense.
Yeah.

291
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,480
And,
and so the idea is to whatever happens,

292
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,400
whatever happens,
you can react in a way that it in a form

293
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:51,960
of paralysis or you can allow it to kind
of get you to think,

294
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,973
I don't know,
a lot of,

295
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:53,980
and

296
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,060
it's such a catch 22 in many ways
because our society has never been

297
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:00,610
safer.
It's never been easier to exist in the

298
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,020
west,
at least in America.

299
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,090
It's never been easier,
you know?

300
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,490
I mean,
we have more healthcare,

301
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,440
we have more access to information.
There's less violent crime,

302
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,850
there's less.
Everything.

303
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:14,710
Cars are safer.
There's so much.

304
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,070
But because of that,
every little thing gets blown out of

305
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,760
proportion.
That's right.

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,380
Things like this is horrible as they are
are a wakeup call.

307
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,730
I remember in nine 11 right after nine
11 like within the next year,

308
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:35,731
we filmed fear factor in Manhattan and
everyone was so nice.

309
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Everyone was so nice.
It was really fascinating.

310
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,590
It's like everyone was happy and they
were so nice and they were so happy when

311
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:47,260
they saw cops and firemen,
firemen and cops were fucking

312
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:51,850
superheroes for like a good solid two
years like they should be.

313
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,310
If people had perspective like,
Hey,

314
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:57,400
there's a bunch of people that are there
to save your life,

315
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,210
you should be so thankful and happy that
there as opposed to,

316
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,490
oh my God,
I saw that guy that hits the ball with a

317
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,470
stick.
He's amazing.

318
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:07,660
Yeah.
I was sweating when I was near him.

319
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,880
There were fucking crazy man.
We are crazy and as soft as things get,

320
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,570
when they get softer things get more and
more added.

321
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:19,090
A perspective like that Matt Leblanc
story that we're talking about before

322
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,970
the podcast folks,
this is like the height.

323
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,590
This is the height of the craziness of
people getting upset at fucking nothing.

324
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,290
I'm gonna give you the height right now.
Re pull that,

325
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,430
pull that up.
Cause this is,

326
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,760
this is so classic example of people who
lose perspective on what really matters.

327
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:38,620
They just,
they don't have any real existential

328
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:41,950
threats out there to their own lives and
their way of life.

329
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,030
So they have to find an enemy.
And this is a classic example of being

330
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:48,160
outraged at something you shouldn't be
outraged by.

331
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,580
Here's the article.
It says Matt Leblanc was disgusting on

332
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,820
the Emmy's red carpet and can leave
showbiz now.

333
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,270
Now in this person's defense,
the author,

334
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,300
I have no idea if that is what she
actually wrote as her actual title

335
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:07,510
because I know that editors change
things and you know,

336
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,780
they try to make things more
inflammatory and if it's so much easier

337
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:12,600
to make something more inflammatory when
it's,

338
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,580
you're an editor and you take someone's
work and you add some stuff to it,

339
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,710
you add a title to it.
Who knows if that's what happened.

340
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,930
Just to,
just to clarify,

341
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,960
because that is a possibility.
So this is what he says.

342
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,520
Um,
they're talking to,

343
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,760
he's on the red carpet with a,
the,

344
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,950
the woman from game of thrones,
Emilia Clarke,

345
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,870
who plays a Khaleesi,
right?

346
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,290
Yeah.
And she says he's objectifying women,

347
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,870
but let me,
he's got disgusting characteristics.

348
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,520
Let's just say his,
his,

349
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:41,320
his actual statement,
he goes,

350
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,630
I saw the first season,
then kind of fell out of touch with it.

351
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,910
And I guess that's when she started
getting naked.

352
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,190
So I need to catch up.
That's it.

353
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,173
Yes.
All he said.

354
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,770
Yeah.
So I would say in a,

355
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,010
that's all he

356
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,160
said.
And he is a comedic actor.

357
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,770
He's doing an interview.
He's trying to be funny.

358
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,420
That's right.
He's just being silly.

359
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,850
I mean,
I think Dan was like the nicest,

360
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:05,210
most polite way of being pervy I've ever
read.

361
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,430
But she called him,
she called him and he shares some of his

362
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,450
characters.
Disgusting,

363
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,820
disgusting characteristics like
objectifying women.

364
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,170
So that's,
that's,

365
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,150
that's why,
what is her name,

366
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,280
the woman who said that?
It's unbelievable.

367
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,220
So her name is,
uh,

368
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,840
Lauren holter.
I wonder really with people like this,

369
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,510
you're right.
I wonder what their historical

370
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:27,560
perspective is on things.
We've come a long fucking way and I

371
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,720
mean,
in women's rights and you know,

372
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,470
Obama had a great speech that I listened
to listen to it.

373
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,960
[inaudible] 2016 he gave it to Howard
College,

374
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,210
which is a black college.
And yes,

375
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,200
yes,
there are,

376
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,790
there are race issues by Obama said,
yeah,

377
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm going to say some controversial
things were all way better off.

378
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,760
And Oh,
by the way,

379
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,670
uh,
so our race relations when I graduated

380
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:52,970
in 1983,
it was a lot harder and there are more

381
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:56,570
opportunities.
And to not give the that credit,

382
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,480
and then I'm give to not suggest that we
are better off.

383
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:02,090
It doesn't mean there doesn't mean you
get complacent and it doesn't mean there

384
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:06,200
isn't work to do,
but please understand that there we have

385
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,690
come a long way.
And to not give credit for that.

386
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,880
It's not give credit to the foot
soldiers that did all that work from

387
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,640
1983 until now,
many of whom were people of color.

388
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,150
So when you say,
you know,

389
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,390
it's things that never been worse,
you're wrong.

390
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,260
You don't have historical perspective.
And I'll give you another perspective

391
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,170
that New York Times had this interesting
editorial and whether this is true or

392
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:30,410
not,
but if you define war as countries going

393
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,950
to war over territory,
resources with national armies,

394
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,080
five out of six people on this globe are
not living in countries at war.

395
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,990
One in six are in conflict,
uh,

396
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,710
war torn areas.
And those,

397
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,310
those areas go from Nigeria to Pakistan.
Now,

398
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,600
uh,
that's,

399
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,960
that is a large part of the globe,
primarily in Middle East,

400
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:58,460
primarily the Muslim world.
That area is in strife and at war and

401
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:00,950
there's a lot of tragedy.
But please keep in mind,

402
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:05,951
that's one in six people in the globe,
Latin America in the 70s and the 80s,

403
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
our lifetime,
we're military dictatorships.

404
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,190
Nicaragua was a communistic t and not
even a communist dictator,

405
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,690
but it was a communist country where
there was a huge insurgency,

406
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,150
huge wars being fought,
insurgencies,

407
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:18,390
lots of death.
Uh,

408
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,650
no democracy whatsoever.
Latin America has a lot of problems,

409
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:24,200
but let me tell you,
at least they are run by civilian

410
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:27,710
governments as corrupted as they may be.
That's big progress.

411
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,640
So you've got to kind of measure,
you've got to measure where progress has

412
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:34,040
been made,
give it credit and,

413
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,550
and then don't let that make you
complacent because there's always work

414
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:39,440
to do.
But at least give it credit.

415
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,860
I completely agree with you,
but I think you're giving her statement

416
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,330
way too much credit.
I agree.

417
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,000
I think what she's doing brought in
Pakistan and Nigeria falls.

418
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,920
I mean,
I think she's probably laughing that

419
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,430
were ridiculous.
We're studying

420
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,310
what's obviously like a clickbait
bullshit.

421
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah,
you're right.

422
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,250
I mean it's,
you're right.

423
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,660
She's looking to be outrage.
She's got to write a story.

424
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,730
This is a story here.
I got something here.

425
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:00,720
Let's run with it.
Yeah.

426
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,870
I mean that's what a lot of what's going
on with these internet sort of website

427
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:06,480
stories.
That's a lot of it is just,

428
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,280
I just took the bait at night.
Well,

429
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,840
there's a lot of fake ones.
I mean,

430
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:13,560
you've seen fake ones and it just
completely fake to some make up a story.

431
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,040
They made up a story about,
um,

432
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,670
me disarming some person at the comedy
store,

433
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,160
some person with a gun,
and I got a text from a buddy of mine

434
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,110
who's a cop and he's like,
did you,

435
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,360
did you take out a,
uh,

436
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,210
you know,
God,

437
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,220
congratulations.
That's very difficult to do.

438
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

439
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,720
And people ask me if you had actually
killed a mountain lion with your bare

440
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:31,800
hand.
And I was like,

441
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,110
absolutely.
How much money do you think they could

442
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,520
make for those fixed stories?
I mean,

443
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,980
what do they,
is it real money in that a click,

444
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:40,050
a couple hundred bucks or something?
Probably not.

445
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm not under probably just a way of
getting attention,

446
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,820
but there's,
there used to be,

447
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,330
used to be like the onion,
the onion would say shit.

448
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,040
That was,
you would read the headline and go,

449
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,790
ah,
and then you would read what you knew to

450
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,490
be satire.
You knew parrot,

451
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,950
you knew that would be fake was funny.
It was absurd.

452
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,190
Now there's a bunch of websites that
have taken with them.

453
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,580
They'd done and made it way less obvious
that they're trying to be funny.

454
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,110
Yeah.
It's just weird.

455
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,930
But that,
but I do think that we live in a time

456
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,410
and there's probably kind of a blow back
now.

457
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,780
It's interesting,
but we do live in a time where people

458
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,300
are just way too sensitive and it's,
and it's certain loud mouths in the

459
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,110
media.
I mean,

460
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,360
when Alec Baldwin wrote an article
saying,

461
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,090
I think I quit and it was like he was
leaving Hollywood.

462
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,541
He,
no,

463
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,660
he's done so much for gay rights and
he's always been a really liberal guy.

464
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,950
But he called the guy a cock sucker
because the guy ended up taking pictures

465
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,920
of him and his wife and then you know,
and I guess they consider that to be

466
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:38,400
homophobic and he got just lambasted by,
you know,

467
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,870
fucking,
you know,

468
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,460
the sort of lunatic fringe.
But it was really bad and it hurt his

469
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:47,250
feelings and he was like,
you guys are pointing your guns at that

470
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,380
wrong enemy.
I'm not your enemy,

471
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:53,490
I'm your advocate.
But you're so you're so caught up on

472
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,420
your power trip.

473
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,020
It's what happens to any group,
any like Greenpeace is a good example.

474
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,210
The guy used to be part of Greenpeace
said,

475
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:02,160
look,
we've got a lot of stuff done.

476
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,220
But there were a lot of people that
weren't willing to let it go because,

477
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,530
and they needed a new closet in new
costs cause they were addicted to the

478
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:10,110
power.
It wasn't so much about saving the

479
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,300
whales anymore.
It was about the fact that they,

480
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,360
they had a sense of identity and they
had power and they could really shake

481
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:22,701
things up and cause good people who were
involved in doing good work to have to

482
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:24,120
stop and go,
Huh,

483
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,430
why?
Well that's what a lot of people are

484
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:29,340
doing by writing blogs,
whether they realize it or not,

485
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,250
that's what they're doing.
You're trying to claim your own space by

486
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,770
jumping in and trying to get a reaction.

487
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,770
And in that case that Matt Leblanc cake
case,

488
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:42,771
it's one of the most obvious blatant in
bizarre what like if that really,

489
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,460
that captivates a moment of your time
other than laughing or not laughing at

490
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:48,400
that moment.
Right.

491
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,850
First of all,
let's break down what he's saying he

492
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,700
needs to catch up because uh,
she started getting naked.

493
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,550
Are we supposed to pretend that we don't
like looking at her naked?

494
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,590
Is that is so a man standing next to a
woman who has been paid to be naked on

495
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,680
television show?
Was he supposed to pretend that that's

496
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,080
not an enjoyable thing to look at?
How I get,

497
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,220
I get confused because if a woman is
standing next to a man and says the

498
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:15,810
exact same thing,
I guarantee you no one gives a fuck

499
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,250
course.
And everyone might laugh if amy Schumer

500
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:23,020
said that next to a Brad Pitt,
what if he said this?

501
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,820
What if he had said,
I'm not going to watch it?

502
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:25,870
Uh,
uh,

503
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,270
she takes her clothes off and it
objectifies women and I,

504
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:31,690
and I refuse to actually,
I'm afraid I may enjoy it if I watch it.

505
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,790
And so out of respect for her and her
privacy,

506
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,270
even though she's taking off her clothes
and,

507
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,990
and it's an artistic expression and a
great TV show,

508
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,350
I don't approve because I don't think
women should take their clothes off now.

509
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,270
Now you're a pure,
now you're puritanical.

510
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,890
Do you really want to live in a world
like that?

511
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,040
Because I'll tell you something.
There are a lot of countries,

512
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,360
a lot of countries like for example,
Saudi Arabia and a lot of other

513
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,640
countries that are,
you know,

514
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,880
not,
not the,

515
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,460
not at the forefront of women's rights
that would,

516
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:02,470
uh,
we'd be outraged and wouldn't let you

517
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:04,240
see that and would censor that.

518
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,610
So what are we talking about here?
What are we talking about?

519
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:08,860
We're talking about a joke that
objectifies women.

520
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,210
Have you seen that Cosmo,
the two comparisons of the cosmo covers

521
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,020
one of them,
it says why men who objectify women are

522
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,990
the effing worst.
And then in the next one,

523
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,970
it's all about men's packages in
bikinis.

524
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,750
Really.
Just their cocks in became,

525
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:27,730
it's great.
I mean,

526
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:32,731
it is literally just an object.
It's not even a full person could just

527
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:36,130
focusing on Cox in Bikinis,
same magazine.

528
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,810
But what,
what do you mean by objectify women?

529
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:39,250
What does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.

530
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,590
I think women that are naked or
beautiful,

531
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,230
well objectifying,
treating them as objects instead of

532
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:45,040
people.
Well,

533
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,810
I'm not trying to start a relationship
with her.

534
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm trying to look at her naked in
dragon movie.

535
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,830
Yeah.
You know,

536
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,360
she rides dragons around,
right?

537
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,710
It's a dragon lady.
She's the mother,

538
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:54,201
right?
Yeah.

539
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:55,360
Mother of dragons.
Yeah.

540
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,250
I'm trying to look at her naked.
Is that okay?

541
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,420
If you don't want me to look at her
naked,

542
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:02,980
how about you don't show it is,
oh look at that wealth by the way.

543
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,030
36 silver Olympic bulges that deserve
gold and it's all just dicks.

544
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,510
Just hogs in Bikini was in men's
kidneys.

545
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,790
This is awful.
This is so silly.

546
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,870
And they're looking at just raised.
But the other one confirmed dot.

547
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:18,940
Dot.
Men who objectify women are effing

548
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,490
horrible.
So it's a woman looking straight at the

549
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,420
camera.
I like,

550
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:23,530
she's like,
girl,

551
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:26,440
you know it's true.
I'm going to fucking tell you.

552
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,090
And you know,
and the other girls got to be like,

553
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,490
fuck yeah,
them pieces of shit men.

554
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,220
And look at the guy in the background.
They couldn't have picked a douchey or

555
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,660
looking guy.
He looks,

556
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,940
I'm sure pissed Aspen.
And by the way,

557
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:38,990
he's got his,
he's so beaten down.

558
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,260
He's got a sheet over his head.
The poor guy pop out.

559
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:42,790
He's got his clothes on.
So does she,

560
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,280
and they were under the covers.
This is a disaster of a relationship.

561
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,010
It has nothing to

562
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,430
do with the men objectifying women.
You if he objectifies women,

563
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:52,640
how the fuck did he trick you to the
point where you're both with no clothes

564
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:56,030
on or with clothes on under the covers.
What is going on here?

565
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,220
What cc you're making poor choices as
well.

566
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,181
Yeah,
I see.

567
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:02,870
When I think about objectifying women,
I think about this like I think about,

568
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,950
uh,
you know,

569
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,530
cause I think it's great.
I've been to strip clubs,

570
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,450
I've,
I've paid money to watch girls,

571
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,160
uh,
take their clothes off.

572
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,010
Maybe I've even been moaning to him.
Essentially girls,

573
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,360
I dunno Joe,
there's a lot of people are listening

574
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,950
and I have children.
Here's the point.

575
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,180
Here's the point.
When I was younger.

576
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,720
Um,
but I think when I think of objectifying

577
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:21,380
women,
yeah.

578
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,121
Cause me,
I'm,

579
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:24,380
I'm a,
you can call me a feminist in terms of

580
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,940
like,
if you can do the job,

581
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,940
I don't give a fuck once you look like,
you know,

582
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,860
um,
but for me,

583
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,740
objectifying women I suppose would be,
well,

584
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,000
she's got a,
she's just good for banging.

585
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,850
She's,
that's just three holes or two holes

586
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:44,090
depending on what you're into.
Treating them as a nonperson.

587
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,080
Yeah.
And then,

588
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,180
and then of course,
uh,

589
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,310
dialing them up and not really allowing
them to realize their potential.

590
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,600
Maybe supporting policies or thoughts
that don't sort of,

591
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,100
um,
allowing them to do that.

592
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:02,150
I can understand how women have suffered
from that and continue to,

593
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,410
I get it,
you know,

594
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:06,290
Russia and they talk about what it's
like to be a woman in Russia.

595
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,260
And I,
I know that there are issues like that,

596
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:11,030
but come on,
man,

597
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,440
humor is really important in including
humor that objectifies women.

598
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,780
It's fucking important.
It's,

599
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,480
it just makes it less of an issue.
I think

600
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,630
it really does.
Well,

601
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:25,720
it completely depends upon what is the
humor,

602
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:27,820
what is the joke,
what is the context?

603
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:29,620
It's,
there's a long,

604
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:34,621
broad range of of variables.
When we talked about comedy material and

605
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:39,490
that quote Unquote objectifies women,
but that a flippant off the cuff

606
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:43,660
humorous remark at some sort of a
ridiculous little red carpet interview

607
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:44,920
thing.
You know those things,

608
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:46,160
those things are ridiculous.
The will,

609
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,950
you have to apologize.
Oh God,

610
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,570
I hope he doesn't.
I hope he doesn't,

611
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:51,250
but he works.
He's a working actor.

612
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:55,300
He's not comedian.
See working actors are always subject to

613
00:25:55,301 --> 00:26:00,010
the will of people that are out there
that are looking to hire people.

614
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,160
You're always going to have to audition.
You're always going to have to get

615
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,410
approved.
When Matt Leblanc is up for things is

616
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:09,580
probably a few other guys that are like
really high profile guys that are up for

617
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:12,160
it too.
And if one of them is involved in some

618
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:16,570
sort of scandal or some,
someone thinks that they're objectifying

619
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:20,320
women and their effing horrible,
they should leave show business if that

620
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:23,410
catches any momentum,
this horrible things that people have

621
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:26,200
done right.
Like admittedly horrible that they

622
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:29,830
themselves just fell apart like Kramer.
Right.

623
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,570
Perfect example.
That was a career killer that killed

624
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:35,460
that guy.
Yup.

625
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,930
Like from then on he is not the same
guy.

626
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,230
No,
there's does just that was a a monster

627
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:44,010
whopper awful thing that went down

628
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,560
so which I'm more sympathetic to because
if you made that mistake,

629
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,620
if you did that,
if you made that mistake,

630
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,360
you better be ready for the
consequences.

631
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,530
That was offensive.
Right?

632
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,570
I mean I think he had an outburst.
He had a moment but you,

633
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:57,960
you can't have,
it's like saying I had an a moment and I

634
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,060
punched that guy in the face,
then stomped him in the head and he

635
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:02,880
can't walk the same.
Everybody has moments where you want to

636
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,120
do certain things but you got to pay the
price for that.

637
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,420
I also think,
and this is a complete a rumor,

638
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,960
but this is what I had heard was that
cocaine was involved.

639
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,480
Now if that's true,
it may not have been if it,

640
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,340
if it wasn't,
I apologize.

641
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,330
Legal Shit out of the way.
If cocaine was involved,

642
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,400
people that are on coke get ridiculously
confident and they say ridiculous shit.

643
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,490
That just does not jive with everyone
around them because the other people

644
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:34,730
around them aren't on coke.
They're not on coke in,

645
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,910
especially if you're on coke,
it seems like you're all about yourself.

646
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,310
It seems like it becomes a very sort of
a selfish,

647
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,040
isolated little sort of environment
protecting,

648
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,250
you
know,

649
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,180
wasn't sure.
Certainly that's what I'm saying,

650
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,340
but I'm saying he thought he could get
away with that.

651
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,060
He thought he could talk like that and
who knows what they had said to him.

652
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,230
I don't know.
You know,

653
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:57,060
the whole thing was him getting
frustrated.

654
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:00,270
The fact that he's really just not a
very good comic and he was getting

655
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:01,680
heckled and we're saying,
you're not funny.

656
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,180
This isn't funny.
Yeah.

657
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,040
The,
when someone tells you you're not funny.

658
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,290
And I've had it happened to me,
I've had someone tell me,

659
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:10,980
oh not funny when I was bombing and you
agree with them,

660
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,780
it's like there's nothing you can do.

661
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,260
You agree with them.
And so I think with Kramer was trying to

662
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:21,261
do is hurt their feelings and that was
how he thought he could hurt their

663
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:22,890
feelings.
I'm sure.

664
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,090
I don't think that he's,
I don't think he's a racist.

665
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:27,501
He's like,
I,

666
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,670
I if you said to cram,
if you think that because people have

667
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:31,470
more melanin in their skin,
they should be,

668
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,550
you know,
Blah Blah Blah.

669
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,780
I don't think that's how he thinks.
I don't think he's that dumb.

670
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,880
And I don't think,
but again,

671
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,540
again that that's hey,
that's like the Mel Gibson thing to look

672
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,730
when you get drunk or you're on blow or
whatever.

673
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,740
If you then decide that the Jews are the
reason everything sucks and you shout

674
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,880
shouting that to a Jewish cop,
uh,

675
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,290
or,
or that you know,

676
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,390
you hope your girl gets,
you know,

677
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,030
has had,
is forced to have sex with in the 19

678
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:00,620
black theaters.

679
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,260
But using the n word.
I don't,

680
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,470
I've never look,
I,

681
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:08,200
you know,
I've never really had those kinds of out

682
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,790
that this is kind of me man.
It's also kind of like it's called.

683
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,960
So it's also,
what's the other word?

684
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,090
Um,
it's blatantly fucking racist page.

685
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,850
Well,
you live in a world where you just can't

686
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:18,810
say that Shit,
man.

687
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,910
It's the words of a crazy person.
Yes.

688
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,110
Because as times goes on and you become
older and you meet more people,

689
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,590
you realize there are a bunch of
variables when it comes to people's

690
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:33,180
behavior and what they do.
But those variables are usually based on

691
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:35,850
culture,
on economics,

692
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,350
on the society that they live in,
the family they grew up with.

693
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,980
And you're going to meet people that

694
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,190
you love,
that fill all of the blanks.

695
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,260
Asian,
Caucasian,

696
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,850
European.
You're going to meet people you love

697
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:52,240
that are all in there because they're
just extraordinary people and you're

698
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,150
going to meet people that are fucking
cunts and they're going to be in all

699
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,520
those things too.
There's just no way around that folks.

700
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:02,410
And if you start siding on one gender or
one race or one patch of dirt,

701
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,650
your fucking missing the whole thing.
The whole thing is we are globally one

702
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,140
super organism that does not have the
ability yet to communicate in real time

703
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,870
across the board with each other in a,
in an incredibly honest way.

704
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,480
We can't really do that yet.
You could speak a certain amount of

705
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:22,420
languages if you're a fucking super
wizard and you can figure your way

706
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,400
through a lot of countries if you know
their cultures,

707
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,730
but they're not necessarily gonna
understand ours unless they can read our

708
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,564
fucking minds.

709
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,560
We all speak to any different languages.
We live in too many different places.

710
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,470
We're so used to one way of life that
anything,

711
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:36,970
any variations,
any breakups,

712
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:40,210
and then one way of life throws
everything into a fucking tizzy and no

713
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:43,090
one knows what to do about it.
Whereas the rest of the world is

714
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,160
experiencing all sorts of different
strife.

715
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,570
I was watching this show the other day
called uncharted and this guy was a,

716
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,100
I've taught,
I've talked about this before,

717
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,560
but it's just,
it was so harsh to watch.

718
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,500
He,
his name's Jim shockey and he goes to

719
00:30:56,501 --> 00:31:00,400
all these really remote villages and
stays with the local people.

720
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:03,400
And in this one they were getting killed
by crocodiles.

721
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Oh yeah.
These people are going to the river and

722
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:09,520
every time they would go to the river,
they would have to set up these nets and

723
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,230
the crocodiles,
they target people.

724
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,210
So when a crocodile starts targeting
people,

725
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:16,570
they have to go and shoot it.
And everyone in the village was fucked

726
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:16,991
up,
man.

727
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,230
Everyone in the village was losing his
missing him blends three fucking third

728
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:22,480
or fourth person at a giant bite taken
out of them.

729
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,390
It's crazy.
And they just live right next to this

730
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:28,570
river and they survive off that river.
Did they live in these little huts and

731
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:33,571
shit and he's thinking like you are
complaining about the wispy joke might

732
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,870
not have been the best joke,
but I would have laughed if I was there.

733
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,711
Sure.
If he said that,

734
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:42,940
I would have shot that with silly and
the fact that we're trying to pretend

735
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:46,440
that this is some sort of an outrage and
that this person she defending,

736
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,190
who is she trying to defend here?
What is she trying to do it that.

737
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:49,920
That's the other thing.

738
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,820
It's more about her though situation.
Well,

739
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:55,240
it's recreational outrage.
It's a thing that people are doing.

740
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,190
It's a thing that people are,
that's great.

741
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,390
That's,
I've never heard that.

742
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:01,210
I love that expression.
It's recreational outrage.

743
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,540
Recreational outreach.
They have decided to be out.

744
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,210
If your outrage at that,
that is really filling up your time like

745
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,730
I am going to fuck this terrorist
attack.

746
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,220
I am not as Lama phobic.
I am not writing about the terrorist

747
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,020
attack.
I am going to write about Matt Leblanc

748
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,280
being a piece of shit.
Yeah,

749
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,950
he should leave the now he's the
problem.

750
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,510
He's the,
he's the problem.

751
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,510
It wasn't a bomb went off.
I went and well Matt Leblanc is sexist.

752
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,090
Here's the thing.
Stop saying the worst.

753
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,730
Everybody.
Everybody stopped saying the worst

754
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,480
because that is like that.
There's no better symbol of our

755
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,850
sheltered time than people saying the
worst.

756
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,900
I was reading this account of how
certain people were tortured with these

757
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,500
to skin them alive with sea shells.

758
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,450
They would take like an oyster shell and
they would skin these people alive.

759
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,830
They would tie them down and skin them
alive with oyster shell.

760
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,370
It's got to feel good.
Yeah,

761
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,430
so that's the worst.
Yeah.

762
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:50,600
That would be the worst.
That's the worst.

763
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,570
Not I'm with you on that.
I would have to say that that would be

764
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,130
the worst.
It's the worst.

765
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,780
I think a good way.
You know another,

766
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,040
here's a question really is there's this
tendency that we all have,

767
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,120
right?
So when this guy,

768
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,680
you find this guy who fucking bomb
people in Chelsea and you,

769
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,030
you,
you want him to die or you want him to

770
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:10,070
go to jail forever and I hope he suffers
and all that.

771
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,560
The the,
the way to look.

772
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,420
There's another way to look at things
which might be not only more helpful,

773
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,420
but might lead us to better solutions.

774
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,330
And I don't know if this is true,
but that's a good way to look at human

775
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:24,860
beings.
We all have the same hardware.

776
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,840
There's been a lot of science,
a lot of work on this.

777
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,310
You know,
we have a lot of,

778
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,440
we,
we basically have the same hardware.

779
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,320
Um,
if you look at the way human beings are,

780
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:36,500
if you draw through lines,
even with cultures that have been not

781
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,210
very,
not exposed to a lot,

782
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,620
but there's been a lot of work done on,
regardless if you're a highlander in

783
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,290
Papa New Guinea or you're northern
European,

784
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,710
you know,
senator have,

785
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,490
you know,
a member of government and you've been

786
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:51,560
exposed to a lot.
We recognize certain things.

787
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,350
Um,
most cultures have a tradition of

788
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:56,180
humorous in salts.
Uh,

789
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,720
human beings.
It's seems innately can tell the

790
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:02,770
difference between joy and discussed.
Um,

791
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,490
and happy and sad.

792
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,330
We have,
we essentially have the same hardware.

793
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,690
It's why you can't really look at
someone's skin or if someone's racial

794
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:19,040
features and you know,
realize what they're capable of.

795
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,990
Well,
what could that guy be a scientist?

796
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:21,651
Well,
he's black.

797
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:23,180
He couldn't be because there aren't a
lot of stuff.

798
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,950
You just can't do that.
And we all know that.

799
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,820
So really what it is is software
culture.

800
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,340
What you have been exposed to,
your belief system,

801
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,760
what you've been told is true.
What you've been told is right.

802
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,920
What you've been told is good versus
evil.

803
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,840
That is,
uh,

804
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,910
essentially what motivates people to do
good and bad things.

805
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,540
You know,
Freud said that man goes to war because

806
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:53,580
he hates people well or he,
that he has a lot of aggression,

807
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,463
hatred.
Well,

808
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,660
there are a lot of other scholars would
say,

809
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,340
maybe not.
In fact,

810
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,830
men don't go to war out of hatred.

811
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,210
They go to war out of love.
They go to war because they love the

812
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:06,500
country.
They are defending.

813
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,620
They go to war under symbols and
propaganda.

814
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:14,621
They go to war under and for an idea
that they are defending because men and

815
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:19,490
countries define themselves along the
lines along certain lines that they are.

816
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,180
If you think about any man,
we all have a line and we all have a

817
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:24,980
line that we're willing to,
at least in our mind,

818
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,020
that we're willing to defend with our
lives.

819
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,440
Probably at the front door of our house
if somebody coming in and try to get to

820
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:32,570
our kids,
but certainly our country and this

821
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:34,880
country is very nationalistic.
If you start talking about,

822
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:36,050
you know,
um,

823
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,680
you Americans get very nationalistic,
have you started making,

824
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,740
you know,
making fun of the flag?

825
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,030
There it is.
Look at that flag.

826
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,550
Hey,
it's Dan.

827
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,570
Hey.
So it's better sometimes to think to

828
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:51,360
yourself,
I wonder what kind of software went into

829
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,030
this,
this guy's head,

830
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:55,890
this guy who just did the bombings in
New York?

831
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,750
What kind of software was he exposed to?
Obviously it wasn't good software and it

832
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:04,680
might make us,
I don't know if compassion is the word,

833
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:09,681
but it might make us more understanding.
And so if you understand your enemy or

834
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,240
the enemy,
which may not be people,

835
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:17,040
but rather an ideology,
maybe that's the best way to then fight

836
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:17,874
it.

837
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,890
I always try to look at perspective as
like a large creation that's made with

838
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:27,850
little tiny lego blocks.
And with every life experience that I

839
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:31,570
have,
I try to add a few more lego blocks and

840
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:34,360
they might not change me radically.
But over time,

841
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:38,250
those lego blocks can build and become a
significant structure.

842
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,000
Something that you could see and look at
and measure.

843
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,670
That's cool.
And every time one of these things

844
00:36:42,671 --> 00:36:46,570
happens,
I always try to think of a,

845
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,820
there's perspective that I had when,
uh,

846
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:54,450
when my kids start walking and talking
to them and seeing them go from coming

847
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:57,910
out of their mother's body to being a
little person I could talk to,

848
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,740
I started realizing,
okay,

849
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,140
it seems like my thought was always that
people were static,

850
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,550
that I meet,
you know,

851
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:09,130
Mike McGee and he's 32 years old.
Hey Mike,

852
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:09,670
how are ya?

853
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,200
Nice to meet you.
This is Mike McKee.

854
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:14,140
He's 32.
Mike was a baby at one point in time.

855
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,990
It came out of his mother's body and
help us a little thing like all of us

856
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:21,310
did.
And then through all sorts of weirdness,

857
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,660
life experiences that are completely
random and people that probably were

858
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:29,560
totally unqualified teaching them things
and growing up with a bunch of other

859
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:33,760
kids that were similar in a lot of ways,
similarly getting fucked up by their

860
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:36,110
parents and their upbringing and their
religion and their,

861
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,093
uh,
uh,

862
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,950
a million different variables.
Right?

863
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:43,000
And then there's all these alpha
chimpanzee jockeying positional things

864
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:47,140
that go on in these relationships with
kids and kids bully kids.

865
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:48,700
And sometimes those kids that are
bullied,

866
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,610
it ruins them for the rest of their life
and they just,

867
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:55,330
they're devastated for like literally to
the grave from some shit that happened

868
00:37:55,331 --> 00:37:56,164
when they were 10.

869
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,320
So we're,
we're subject to so many different

870
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:02,860
variables and so many different points
of data entry.

871
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,330
Like data can come at us in so many
different ways was his physical data,

872
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,410
whether it's just reading the news and
trying to understand like why would

873
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:15,880
someone go to a nightclub in Orlando and
just start shooting gay people?

874
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,800
Why would someone drive a truck in,
in France and just drive over those

875
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,120
people?
Why would someone do that?

876
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:22,690
I'm like,
what?

877
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,330
What is that was a baby at one point in
time,

878
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,600
something has led to that and we have to
look at all the things that influence

879
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,350
us,
all of them,

880
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,280
whether it's behavioral things,
whether it's things that are were beaten

881
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:41,050
into you by just life's hard lessons.
And then the big one that nobody wants

882
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:43,840
to discuss.
Ideologies.

883
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,670
Yeah,
call them whatever you want.

884
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,710
You want to call them religions,
you want to call them cults,

885
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,730
calm,
whatever you want.

886
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,350
But at the bottom line is they're
incredibly structured patterns of

887
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:57,640
behavior that you are forced to follow.
That can be real dangerous if people

888
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:59,890
don't follow them.
And nobody wants to admit that.

889
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:04,420
Nobody wants to admit that when you
leave this pattern of behavior,

890
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,000
you're supposed to be killed.
No one wants admitted.

891
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:10,420
If you vary from this pattern of
behavior and do no one any harm like

892
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,940
homosexuals,
you're,

893
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,360
you're to be killed.
I mean,

894
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:14,980
there's some really,
and you know,

895
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,840
oh,
this is,

896
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,430
this Islamophobia on this show has got
to stop.

897
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,110
I'm scared of rats,
scared a lot of dogs.

898
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,180
So let me just tell you what,
I'm scared of.

899
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:25,020
Scare a lot of people.
I'm scared of questions.

900
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,160
I'm scared.
I'm scared of,

901
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:27,310
uh,
ex cons.

902
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:29,290
I'm scared of pis and vans driving
around.

903
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,360
I was scared of clowns.
It's kind of a lot of shit.

904
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,190
So this,
this idea of being,

905
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,520
having a phobia over a,
you know,

906
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:40,700
a particular ideology or I'm fuck me
over pattern recognition to you.

907
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,331
You,
you,

908
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:42,610
you can pattern,
right?

909
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,400
Will you stay alive by being able to
recognize patterns?

910
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,800
Yeah.
And it's the,

911
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,630
but the important aspect of it is,
and this is always what's important,

912
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,080
is that most people that are practicing
that on hurting anybody,

913
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,390
right?
Most people that are practicing Muslims

914
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,640
aren't hurting anybody because there's
so many of them.

915
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,520
If they were,
if there was a war between Muslims and

916
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:03,010
Christians and would just spilling out
into the streets every day,

917
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,200
Jesus Christ would be a blood bath
everywhere,

918
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,420
every one in a million,
300 million Muslims,

919
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,180
I think it would be insane.
So the,

920
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,500
the,
the problem is not a particular ideology

921
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,560
in much in as much as it's a particular
strain of the ideology,

922
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,840
whether it's a Christian that goes to an
abortion clinic with a fucking high

923
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:24,730
powered rifle and starts taking people
out,

924
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,050
whatever it is.

925
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,290
Somebody who has the thinks they have
the truth with a capital t,

926
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:32,350
which is called a fundamentalist.
And we're all fundamentalists.

927
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,840
You know,
we all have aspects of our personalities

928
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:36,400
and our belief systems that are
fundamentalists.

929
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,190
If you asked me about sugar,
I'll wax poetic.

930
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,290
I'll tell you all about the evils of
sugar.

931
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44,980
And I really believe I'm right now,
I have a lot of data and science behind

932
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:46,780
me,
but I,

933
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,150
you know,
I have all kinds of ideas about why

934
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:52,150
sugar is bad and fat and protein is good
for you because you know,

935
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:55,240
I've lived in and I've done it and I'm
sure you have your own point of view.

936
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,360
I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
today and it was damn good and it was

937
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:00,910
damn good and you didn't hurt anybody,
including you probably didn't hurt

938
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,130
yourself.
So sometimes cause you're not a

939
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:04,930
fundamentalist cause every now and then.

940
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,190
Thank you.
Thank you.

941
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:06,931
Some milk.
Ooh,

942
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,950
it was good.
But the other glass of milk I hope has

943
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,140
raw milk.
Raw cause you're going to want,

944
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,270
but I love raw milk.
Raw milk is the shit.

945
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:18,640
I get the rock coat milk from Erewhon
and coat deep.

946
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,240
You know you can get to hold it.
Hold on your horses and I think it's

947
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:23,980
about $35.
I've never bought it.

948
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,900
But you can get camel milk.
Whoa.

949
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,920
Oh yeah.
What?

950
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,640
Talk about the Middle East.
The Bedouin famed for their sexual

951
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:34,970
prowess lived on camel milk.
Do you mean milk like as in titty milk

952
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:36,450
or sucking cocks?
No,

953
00:41:36,451 --> 00:41:36,710
no,
no.

954
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm talking about,
God dammit.

955
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,630
No,
I meet titty milk.

956
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:40,630
Almond Milk Crates,
wink.

957
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,660
Wait,
go man.

958
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,900
I'm not talking about Dick Milk.
I'm talking about,

959
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,800
I'm not talking about guy cream.
You fuck.

960
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:50,750
I'm talking about fucking camel milk
from their utters in a Australia day

961
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:53,510
hunt camels and the,
they have no,

962
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,650
like Australia is kind of a crazy place
and Australia,

963
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,540
New Zealand are very similar in that
they don't really have any natural

964
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:02,810
predators because they were,
they were separated from the rest of the

965
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,240
planet when that whole Pangea thing
happened.

966
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,820
So all they have is like they have
crocodiles,

967
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,860
but crocodiles are,
for the most part,

968
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,510
they only get things that are really
stupid.

969
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,300
They get things that are,
that are forced to go through rivers.

970
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,280
That's what they get.
They get things through to close to the

971
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:18,500
water.
Guys are fishing in waist deep water,

972
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,490
but they have so many animals that
crocodiles are just not going to get

973
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:23,870
like Kangaroos.
They're not going to kill all the

974
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,340
Kangaroos.
It's just not going to happen.

975
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,730
So they have to bring in people to kill
camels.

976
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,410
That's crazy.
They have to bring in people to kill a

977
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:33,650
lot of on camels are indigenous to
Australia or where they brought their,

978
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,290
they were brought there.
Here's what's crazy man.

979
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,370
All the animals were brought there.
They tried to turn Australia and New

980
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:44,110
Zealand into some incredible hunting
destination for old school.

981
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:46,290
He rich dudes and like the 18 hundreds
really?

982
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,130
Yeah.
They totally violated the all the laws

983
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,330
of ecosystem.
No,

984
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:50,991
that,
yeah,

985
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:55,190
because they brought these animals over
and they didn't bring over companion

986
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:58,940
predators.
So you have wild stags where they've

987
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:02,750
never had any Predator Chai.
They're roaming through the woods and

988
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:05,960
you know how to take care of them.
They fly overhead with helicopters and

989
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,970
gun them down and let them rot.
Really?

990
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:09,500
Yeah.
They have to control the population.

991
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,580
They literally sometimes are forced with
some of these animals to gun them down

992
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,280
and just leave them there.
It's delicious meat.

993
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,310
They don't have a problem with me.
They have a surplus of me.

994
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,470
You know?
Most of the venison that we get is from

995
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,940
New Zealand.
When you get elk,

996
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:24,650
it's from New Zealand and they brag
about it.

997
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,490
And New Zealand elk filet.
Yes.

998
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,680
Yeah.
Colorado's right there.

999
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,600
Like how was it?
What the fuck is going on over there?

1000
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,580
I tell you what's going on over there.
No mountain lions.

1001
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,410
No bears,
no wolves,

1002
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,140
no coyotes.
And know people,

1003
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,900
put a couple of families,
wolves out there.

1004
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,800
It was,
it just kill the shit out of everything.

1005
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,790
I leave till the shit out of everything.
It's like,

1006
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,260
Hey,
let's have some fun today.

1007
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,090
There was an interesting story that I
posted,

1008
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,940
um,
a couple of days ago that I read on one

1009
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:50,774
of the,
um,

1010
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,873
I think,
uh,

1011
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:56,120
uh,
one of them outdoorsy type websites,

1012
00:43:56,121 --> 00:44:00,050
but it was about a guy talked about how
his dog got killed by wolves and that he

1013
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,030
wasn't mad at the walls.
He found his dog's head.

1014
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:04,970
He couldn't find the dog and she was
like 18 years old German shepherd.

1015
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,550
And he went walking,
trying to find her and then found her

1016
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,780
head and it was like,
oh my God,

1017
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:10,550
who did that?
Why would anybody do that?

1018
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,710
He thought it was a person,
like some crazy serial killer.

1019
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,370
And then he realizes he got further on a
lot of evidence of a wolf attack.

1020
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,120
If you've ever seen,
you know what a wolf does?

1021
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:24,440
We came pawn,
I'm a wolf calf that had been killed,

1022
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:26,250
not a wolf cafe,
a moose calf,

1023
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,850
others that had been killed by wolves
in,

1024
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:31,380
um,
in Canada when I was there about a year

1025
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:34,200
and a half ago.
It was actually two years ago now.

1026
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,390
Um,
and it was really weird because I didn't

1027
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:38,790
expect to see all the hair and I was
like,

1028
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,740
Oh yeah,
of course they'd have to like get rid of

1029
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:41,630
the hair.
Yeah.

1030
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,550
Well they say spit it up and they chew
it up.

1031
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,610
But it was,
I always just thought like when you

1032
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:49,620
would find a carcass,
then it'd be just like torn apart.

1033
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,160
It's not just torn apart like Harry's
everywhere.

1034
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,880
Yeah.
It's like all over [inaudible] balm.

1035
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,753
Yeah.
Yeah.

1036
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,410
Did you see,
I have that picture up there.

1037
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:01,410
See if you could find the moose calf
killed by a,

1038
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,020
I've seen that.
Have you seen that in living in the

1039
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:05,010
wild?
What?

1040
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:06,120
Did you see?
A hair everywhere?

1041
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,280
Um,
I can't remember.

1042
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:10,350
I saw,
I saw it was something in Topanga

1043
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:13,830
Canyon.
Actually we are coyote gets a hold of a

1044
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,870
um,
a rabbit and there was right in Topanga,

1045
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,020
there was a deer that had been killed by
a mountain lion.

1046
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,360
Whoa.
Bones.

1047
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,640
And look at that.
Look at all that hair.

1048
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,070
It's like a,
like a blanket of hair.

1049
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,590
That's crazy.
Like hey in the bottom of a farmer or a

1050
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:32,760
barn or something.
But look,

1051
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:34,500
they had chewed all the meat off the
face.

1052
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:35,480
Everything.
Hazing.

1053
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,580
It's from a night.
It's from 96 weeks ago.

1054
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,780
Wow.
Look at that fucking picture.

1055
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,680
That,
it's crazy.

1056
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,840
We found that because of crows
crows were,

1057
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,860
yeah,
we were walking down this road and these

1058
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:53,520
crows started circling overhead and my
friend Mike Hawk Ridge,

1059
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,530
he's like,
let's go see what they're squawking

1060
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:57,330
about.
So you don't want to walk with your dog

1061
00:45:57,331 --> 00:46:00,420
on trails then in Wolf territory?
Well you know what man?

1062
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:02,310
Wolves for the most part we'll avoid
people.

1063
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,790
A dog usually means just people.
But if the dog gets crazy and goes

1064
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,040
chasing after him gets away,
they'll take that thing out.

1065
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,350
And even if they're not even trying to
eat it,

1066
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,930
they might take it out.
Cause it's a competing Predator,

1067
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,840
right?
Like I'm,

1068
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,240
I'm reading this Dan Flores book,
um,

1069
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,500
called the coyote America and it's all
about,

1070
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,720
I found out about them from Rinella,
his podcast.

1071
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:25,230
He was Vanillas,
I'm a natural history professor,

1072
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:26,490
I think.
You think he's a,

1073
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,720
he's,
he's a,

1074
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:32,070
either a wildlife historian,
one of those.

1075
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:37,130
But his whole deal is,
I'm studying the history of an animal in

1076
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:41,250
a certain part of the world is coyote
book is fucking fast.

1077
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:41,751
And why,
what,

1078
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:43,410
what does he talk about?
First of all,

1079
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,720
they're all the same thing.
Coyotes or wolves.

1080
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,220
Yeah,
they're all wolves.

1081
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,250
So like when people would talk to them
about these coy wolves,

1082
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:55,710
those coy wolves would probably like a
red wolf or an eastern wolf.

1083
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,010
Fuck the coyote and that thing.
Fuck the coyote.

1084
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,150
Wow.
And they're all like,

1085
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,010
like 20%.
Yeah.

1086
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:04,330
There's like 10% wove and 20% well
there,

1087
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,490
there's not like a 50 50 thing going on.
There's like all these crazy inner

1088
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:10,350
breeds.
And the bottom line is they're all the

1089
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:12,600
same animal.
All wolves is Haman.

1090
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,840
Not only that,
all canines emanated in North America.

1091
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,590
How about this?
All horses evolved in North America,

1092
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:21,390
including the same from the US.

1093
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,730
They came from the Asian steppes.
I thought so too.

1094
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:26,370
They all have,
they all made it over there millions of

1095
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,620
years ago from America.
Here's the really fucked up thing.

1096
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,640
They don't know why they went extinct in
America.

1097
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:35,770
Horse has started in America when
extinct in America thrived in other

1098
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,020
parts of the world and were reintroduced
to America.

1099
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,760
That's so weird.
It's crazy.

1100
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,890
Yeah.
And I showed the video of me being

1101
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:43,510
surrounded by coyotes.
No,

1102
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:45,670
I'll start it yet.
Um,

1103
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,410
can you sound Jamie and I'll play it and
let me,

1104
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,640
let me try to find it.
Yeah.

1105
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,630
But the,
the point being is that there's this

1106
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,720
really nutty history that I had no idea
about.

1107
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,440
All of these animals,
jackals in Africa emanated from North

1108
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:02,140
America,
started out as canines here.

1109
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,100
Those fucking things spread everywhere.
I've Seen Fox,

1110
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,691
uh,
and,

1111
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:09,100
and uh,
here in California when I was hiking and

1112
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,710
I've seen Bobcat,
I've seen Fox in Colorado,

1113
00:48:11,711 --> 00:48:13,030
but I've seen bobcats out here.

1114
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,930
But here's the deal.
The,

1115
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,250
the really crazy thing about coyotes
versus a,

1116
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,640
any of these other animals,
because the fact that gray wolves were

1117
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:23,650
like their competitors,
they're the bigger dog.

1118
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,230
They used to kill them.
They developed all these different

1119
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:29,470
methods of staying alive.
And one of them is when they scream out,

1120
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,290
you know that that's a role call.
That's what they're doing.

1121
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,520
They're really roll call.
Yeah.

1122
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,650
Because some shit's gone down.
Maybe they've killed something.

1123
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,030
We want to make sure everybody's around.
And when someone's missing,

1124
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,370
when someone doesn't respond,
it goes missing.

1125
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:46,240
The female produces more pups in her
litter significantly.

1126
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,330
Yeah.
There's some sort of a biological effect

1127
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:53,560
when one goes missing and she can go
from four if it's a healthy population

1128
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,140
to like 16.
So here's,

1129
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,070
here's what,
how they,

1130
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,570
one of the ways that they know that this
is a fact that these wolves are capable

1131
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:05,800
of doing this is that when they
introduced wolves to yellowstone,

1132
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,770
wolves hadn't been in yellowstone since
they eradicated them.

1133
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,080
Right?
So these people came across North

1134
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,090
America,
killed all these wolves.

1135
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,990
And the way they would do it is through
using their system of uh,

1136
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,480
communicating and using their,
um,

1137
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:23,950
the fact that they're there,
these tight knit groups and these packs

1138
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:25,630
and their families and they stick
together.

1139
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:30,220
So they would kill one wolf rub.
It's sent all over a carcass,

1140
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,640
inject the carcass of a horse who would
shoot a horse and Jack the horse would

1141
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:36,570
strychnine so that way they're killing
two birds with one stone right there.

1142
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:39,220
We're getting rid of the wild horses,
which had become a real problem.

1143
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,620
And they are still a problem today.
Like wild horses.

1144
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:43,660
They kill wild horses in America all the
time.

1145
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,100
Yeah,
I didn't know that either,

1146
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,660
dude.
It's nuts.

1147
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,740
And the fact that there's thousands,
tens of thousands of wild horses in

1148
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:53,490
North America right now to the point
where they're the thousands,

1149
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,520
tens of wild horses in America.
There are people that are advocating for

1150
00:49:57,521 --> 00:50:00,700
the hunting season of wild horses.
I'm real.

1151
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,770
Yeah,
that's a lot of meat.

1152
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,690
It's a lot of meat.
It's like an elk.

1153
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,610
Yeah.
It's funny because if you'd shot,

1154
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,240
that'd be a great deal of protest
properly.

1155
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,250
Cause we know horses,
we ride them.

1156
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,810
It's like dogs man.
Yeah.

1157
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,890
Yeah.
But these animals all started here.

1158
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,580
It's really bizarre.
That is so strange there.

1159
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,710
This he gets into on Renell's podcast,
the mass extinctions that occurred

1160
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,310
somewhere in the range

1161
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,670
of the last ice age and maybe some time
even before that,

1162
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:34,790
some of them and how,
how little they know about what killed

1163
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:37,520
mall cat.
And there's all this speculation.

1164
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,570
Is that the eye,
there's speculation that when the

1165
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,150
buffalo,
you know started to go extinct,

1166
00:50:44,151 --> 00:50:48,560
they had already started.
Well apparently the native Americans

1167
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:53,330
that were on horseback and we're riding
and with followed the buffalo were

1168
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,120
killing.
They weren't like that sustainable with

1169
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:57,580
their practices.
Yes.

1170
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,930
Well this was when they started hunting
with rifles on horseback was rifles.

1171
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,300
So this is all Dan Flores.
This is he,

1172
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,160
he advocates the,
the possibility,

1173
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,510
not advocates but he brings up the
possibility that they could have

1174
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:15,190
possibly extra painted those animals
from there.

1175
00:51:15,191 --> 00:51:20,191
Their areas just based on rifles and
horsebox without the market meat farm.

1176
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,180
So they're marketing beings,
market hunting.

1177
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,360
When when they started market hunting
that's when everything went fucked up.

1178
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,410
Cause they would kill apparently
thousands and thousands of buffaloes and

1179
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:32,870
just cut the tongue's out.
Really?

1180
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,830
Yup.
Why?

1181
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,580
Cause the tongues were worth money.
People like to eat buffalo tongues.

1182
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,910
It's like a delicate one.
I will not eat brain or tongue.

1183
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,320
I can't find my coyote.
Steph.

1184
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:43,170
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

1185
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,140
Let's put it down.
I can't find,

1186
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:47,060
I,
I can't eat tongue or brain.

1187
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,770
I'm down for either.
It doesn't,

1188
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:50,700
I like things really.
Tom.

1189
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,790
Oregon's.
I don't need Oregon's either.

1190
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,710
I'm not into kidney.
You ate liver.

1191
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,640
I,
I'll eat liver.

1192
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,930
But even liver I eat because you know
I'm there and I'm not sure what men,

1193
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,730
yeah,
let's eat liver.

1194
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,560
But overall,
fuck off.

1195
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,710
Fuck off with your organs.
I'll eat heart heart's not bad.

1196
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,460
That road deer I killed in London,
in England and I would shoot and things

1197
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:15,230
in London.
It was ridiculous.

1198
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,730
But he's got,
my friend has so much property,

1199
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:17,750
has to kill 21 dear.

1200
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,910
He has to kill 21 deer on his property
every year.

1201
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,560
Wow.
That's how rich he is.

1202
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,940
Yeah.
And uh,

1203
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,070
so she ate it.
Yeah,

1204
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,150
we ate it.
And it was the crunchiest and it made me

1205
00:52:29,151 --> 00:52:32,570
sick and the warden said,
hey,

1206
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,390
that's a road dear.
You got to hang that for three weeks.

1207
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,470
Could you just skin it,
cut it up and eat it with a good glass

1208
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:40,010
of wine?
I was like,

1209
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,910
yeah.
He goes,

1210
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,400
no,
no,

1211
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,560
not with that kind of mean.
What's wrong with the meat?

1212
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,750
It's,
and I'm not exaggerating,

1213
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,910
it's crunchy.
Like,

1214
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,650
like,
like um,

1215
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,160
like the way you would if you just cut
it up and put it in a plant and fried it

1216
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:57,110
with butter.
It crunches almost like a carrot.

1217
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:58,700
How about that?
Yeah.

1218
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,160
That's how hard the meat is.
Why?

1219
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,250
Huh?
That's why he got to hang it for three

1220
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,140
weeks and let it break down.

1221
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,550
You cannot eat that deer meat like that.
It's a Roe.

1222
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:11,370
Deer heard that before.
Well I,

1223
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,330
I would imagine deliver that tastes like
that word crunches.

1224
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,780
And the same thing with this,
and I'm talking about the muscle meat.

1225
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,940
The Muslim,
we both got sick.

1226
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,850
I was,
I wasn't right for three days.

1227
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,700
Really.
My buddy wasn't ready for a week and the

1228
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:28,560
game warden was like,
you got to hang that.

1229
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,900
That's a road dear.
You got to hang that.

1230
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:35,490
Somebody I'm sure knows about this,
but Zana practice hanging meat is oh

1231
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,490
three waiting for things to rot minimum
of three weeks.

1232
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:41,580
I know a lot of guys who do that in
their frigerator they do their own

1233
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:44,500
version of a dry age age.
Yeah.

1234
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,240
Yeah.
You're putting it on like a flat tray

1235
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:51,930
with like a Napkin underneath it.
Fucking delicious.

1236
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:54,110
By the way.
Fucking Galicia.

1237
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:54,780
It's so weird.

1238
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,270
When you go to the butcher,
if you ever go to whole foods and you

1239
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:59,310
pass by the butcher,
you can look in that window into that

1240
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:02,880
dry aging room and just look at rock.
Like my kids were like,

1241
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:05,210
what the fuck is that?
I'm like,

1242
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,230
that is um,
that's rot.

1243
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,850
It's on the,
on the outside of the meat.

1244
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:11,460
They're going to cut that away and yeah,
that's what it looks like.

1245
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:15,630
Cheese cheese is just full of mold and
cheese is full of mold,

1246
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,180
but it does.
We don't identify with cheese,

1247
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,010
no cheese,
just some foreign substance.

1248
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,320
When you look at that steak,
like you understand that that's supposed

1249
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:26,070
to be red,
like meet amazing as it's a bizarre

1250
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:29,130
practice.
Five day dry look at it,

1251
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,980
starting to shrivel up.
God,

1252
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,050
it's weird.
Right down.

1253
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,430
Break it then fuck it is weird.
Right?

1254
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,110
It's weird that people figured that out.

1255
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,420
Yeah,
I didn't know that about roe deer.

1256
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,120
So they must be like super muscular or
something.

1257
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,920
There's not a lot of meat and they're
small and they're heart.

1258
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,440
It's not,
you shouldn't and you're not,

1259
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:48,840
you don't feel very good.
It's like the size of a fucking,

1260
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,960
you know,
like a midsize dog.

1261
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,580
Shit,
I'm going to lose like a collie and plus

1262
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:57,400
they're not really hot.
It's,

1263
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,690
I didn't know what was really going on.
It was nibbling away and it wasn't,

1264
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:01,320
you know,
I was like,

1265
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,460
aw man.
I had this,

1266
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,700
I had this $15,000 a German,
a sniper rifle.

1267
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:10,100
It's called a Blouser,
I think.

1268
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:15,270
Blouser Lahser and uh,
and I had a,

1269
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,460
and he had,
I was d I shot at standing up,

1270
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:21,040
I had a stand.
You saw the video and you know,

1271
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,390
listen,
it wasn't very far away.

1272
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:25,230
If dude,
there's a video apparently this thing of

1273
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:28,880
roe deer and it goes back to the same
thing we were talking about with um,

1274
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,800
Australia not having any natural
predators.

1275
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,980
These roe deer,
they bring in snipers to take them out

1276
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:38,550
in England.
High speed video footage where they blow

1277
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:40,920
their heads off their brother heads off
with plastic bullets.

1278
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,611
Oh,
I didn't know that.

1279
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:42,091
The plastic,
yeah,

1280
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:43,530
these plastic bullets.
Yeah,

1281
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,190
because I saw that guess plastic bullets
just don't make it through there and hit

1282
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:49,500
anything else.
Like once they hit that,

1283
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:50,750
it probably just explodes.
Yeah.

1284
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:53,100
But the heads explode.
I mean,

1285
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,760
have you seen it?
I'd like to see like a child's toy.

1286
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:59,490
You know those child's toys that you
squeeze and the eyes poked out of the

1287
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:00,151
head like that.
I was like,

1288
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:03,630
well yeah,
that's what's sick is that I've not only

1289
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:05,580
seen it many times,
I've thought about it,

1290
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,500
you know,
as recently as a week ago,

1291
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,950
you have to think about it.
It's just like a crazy thing that here's

1292
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,550
this deer moving around and then here's
its head exploded and anything would

1293
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:19,020
happen to the human being does and they
have to do it or those things will

1294
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:22,470
overpopulate.
So it's like either that or do you,

1295
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,010
I'm sure you've seen that video because
it was

1296
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,410
really interesting video,
how wolves change rivers.

1297
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,000
It was about the yellowstone wolves
being reintroduced into yellowstone and

1298
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:35,590
how they've changed the course of the
rivers because they've killed deer,

1299
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:39,760
which allowed these plants to grow that
didn't grow before and change the course

1300
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:40,690
of the re.
Yeah,

1301
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:42,850
really interesting stuff.
Really interesting stuff about the

1302
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:45,880
reintroduction of wolves.
But it's essentially what biologists

1303
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:48,850
were trying to do by reintroducing
wolves was introduced,

1304
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,600
uh,
a natural ecosystem because this is how

1305
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:54,880
it's supposed to be.
There's not supposed to be like the

1306
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:56,590
hunters got upset because all of a
sudden these,

1307
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,650
uh,
elk herds are devastated and there's

1308
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,140
like 50% of them.
But in many ways it's kind of like a

1309
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:07,141
selfish feeling because although I side
with them and I understand what they're

1310
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:09,250
saying,
I don't want to wolves to be a problem

1311
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:11,530
with people,
but they are,

1312
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,240
they're a part of that whole thing.

1313
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,670
They were there when the elk were there.
There's never elk without the wolf.

1314
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:19,540
And when there are elk without the wolf,
you get what you got to New Zealand,

1315
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,280
yet people flying overhead with
helicopters,

1316
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:23,420
gutting them down and sletten the meats.
No top Predator.

1317
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:24,130
Right.
And it's,

1318
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,160
it also feels fucked up.
Like if you,

1319
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,920
if you were over in New Zealand,
we're going hunting and as we're going

1320
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:30,611
up the hill,
man,

1321
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:33,160
what a beautiful countryside and let all
of these animals,

1322
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,300
and then we hear a helicopter fly
overhead and one one ridge over there

1323
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:41,380
just gone and down stacks.
And we go over the top of the hill.

1324
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:42,610
And this is like what we're,
you know,

1325
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:45,010
we romanticize his trip.
We're going to go there.

1326
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:46,370
We're going to live off the land,
right?

1327
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,820
We're going to take a stag.
You.

1328
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,630
Thank you stag for giving me your life.

1329
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,610
Your,
your flesh will feed my meanwhile,

1330
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,120
there's a fucking helicopter just
indiscriminately gunning him down

1331
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,950
because there's too many of them.
Shit in the grass.

1332
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:57,650
Dot,
dot,

1333
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,001
dot,
dot,

1334
00:57:58,001 --> 00:57:58,811
dot,
dot,

1335
00:57:58,811 --> 00:57:59,141
dot,
dot,

1336
00:57:59,141 --> 00:57:59,441
dot,
dot.

1337
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:00,820
And they just let them run up there,
man.

1338
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,450
And it's a Chi being there with my knife
taken off a bunch of steak and that's

1339
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,600
what we'd be doing.
We'd camp right,

1340
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,350
but we'd be bummed out and we wouldn't,
I wouldn't shoot an animal.

1341
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:08,951
I'd be like,
well,

1342
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:11,050
I can't eat.
There's no way I could justify shooting

1343
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:12,630
an animal.
There's no way this is,

1344
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,950
there's meet here.
It's just killed.

1345
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,240
We're done.
Right?

1346
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,400
So we're just going to chalk this off to
an experience.

1347
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,480
That's it.
Just be a bit,

1348
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,040
we talk about on stage,
oh,

1349
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:23,600
here's the deer's head.
Exploded.

1350
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,790
Cute.
That's very cute.

1351
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:25,900
When it might been a fall.

1352
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,910
Is it a button by going?
Good Lord has got a good shot.

1353
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,980
He shot.
That's what the plastic bullet.

1354
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,750
Yeah.
Apparently they use plastic bullets

1355
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:38,040
because they're doing them in urban
environments because they're using rf

1356
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,090
suppressors,
plastic bullets.

1357
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,990
And Bob Lang take it out.
Yeah.

1358
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,370
Yeah.
There's a place in Pennsylvania where

1359
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:49,930
they allow deer hunting all throughout
the year because there's so many fucking

1360
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:53,290
deer and people set up.
Tree stands in their backyards and the

1361
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:58,291
higher hunters or or like advertise for
punters to come and shoot their deer.

1362
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,260
My mother in Connecticut,
we had,

1363
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:05,830
she would plant flowers and she was
obsessed with our flowers and the deer

1364
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:10,831
would come in and eat them and my mother
in very soon walked into my room and

1365
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:12,694
said,
listen to me,

1366
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,800
I'm going to buy a crossbow and you're
into this shooting stuff.

1367
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,290
I want you to kill the deer.
And I said,

1368
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,340
okay,
uh,

1369
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,680
it's very illegal though.
And she says,

1370
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:27,560
I know so you're going to have to be
very careful.

1371
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:28,761
I said,
I know,

1372
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:31,700
but I think it's super early like we can
get in big trouble.

1373
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,040
She said,
that's not the point.

1374
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,470
I want you to kill the deer that are
eating my flowers.

1375
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,304
I said,
you do it.

1376
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,950
I didn't because I talked her out of it.
I was like,

1377
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,020
listen,
you got to put a fence over your fucking

1378
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:46,760
flowers because I think we could get
fine like $100,000 or something crazy

1379
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:48,860
for your flowers and that's probably not
worth it.

1380
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,180
Yeah,
you can go to jail.

1381
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,330
But I know a lady,
I wasn't,

1382
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,140
I didn't know how to use a crossbow.
I just,

1383
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:55,280
I didn't know.
I was like,

1384
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:56,840
it'd be cool.
But that's the beautiful thing about

1385
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:58,670
crossbows.
You don't have to do the learning curve

1386
00:59:58,671 --> 00:59:59,540
super short.

1387
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,610
Just as long as you're resting it on
something,

1388
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,950
you don't punch the trigger.
This is all you have to learn how to do

1389
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:04,830
it across what?
Ready,

1390
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,160
Eh,
Eh,

1391
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,890
don't jerk it.
Don't jerk it.

1392
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,060
Cause there's an instinct to juggle.
Just go like that's his goal.

1393
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,630
Glitter it out.
Three quarters of the witch schoolies

1394
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,430
gently Vega all on the trigger sooner.
Just moves.

1395
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,240
Chigger doesn't even know what's going
on the trip.

1396
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:21,921
You just,
just,

1397
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:23,270
just push,
push,

1398
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:24,030
push,
read.

1399
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,260
The real reason I didn't do it,
I remember is a not because I didn't

1400
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:31,130
think I could do it.
It was more because I figured if I shot

1401
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:33,440
the deer with a crossbow or a bow and
Arrow,

1402
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,490
it would run and I'd have to track it
and it would run into somebody else's

1403
01:00:37,491 --> 01:00:39,410
yard.
And then they'd find a deer that had a

1404
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:41,280
bow and Arrow and then they'd come and
find,

1405
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:41,930
they trace it back.

1406
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,730
I heard a story about a rich lady in
Malibu.

1407
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:46,910
They may have done the exact same thing,
trimming letter actually shot a fucking

1408
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,250
deer in her backyard with a crossbow.
Really?

1409
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,320
Because it was eating her flowers may or
may not have.

1410
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,370
Yeah.
It's May or may not have.

1411
01:00:52,371 --> 01:00:54,980
It's one of those weird stories you're
hearing from other moms and you know,

1412
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:56,450
people talk to them.
You know what Mary did?

1413
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,920
Oh,
she got a chronicle meet.

1414
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,800
You know,
I wouldn't do that if I could get away

1415
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:03,140
with it.
It's good meat seat.

1416
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,120
It,
it's,

1417
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,600
it's,
it's a good move.

1418
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,560
It's,
you know,

1419
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:11,330
it goes to that age old problem that a
lot of us have with the idea of death.

1420
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,160
I don't want anybody to kill me and eat
me,

1421
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,510
you know?
So why,

1422
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:16,670
why do I want to kill that animal and
eat that animal?

1423
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,930
And we have this very strange
relationship with these animals now,

1424
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,550
sort of.
We've like,

1425
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,960
we've contracted all of our food
collection off to other people.

1426
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,950
Yeah.
And that's something that just didn't

1427
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:36,810
exist for most of human history.
So over the last x amount of years,

1428
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,870
we've contracted all of our food
acquisition.

1429
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,890
I love the fact that I could just get
this plastic thing of water and I know

1430
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,570
it's legit crocodiles.
I to hear this,

1431
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:47,610
listen,
Hey,

1432
01:01:47,611 --> 01:01:49,980
that little snap,
that means nobody poisoned it.

1433
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:51,050
It's fresh.
Yeah,

1434
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,570
it's sealed fresh from the factory.
And I can have a nice glass of water.

1435
01:01:54,571 --> 01:01:57,000
I don't have to go to a river.
I didn't have to pump.

1436
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,320
I don't have to have a,
well,

1437
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,150
it's,
it's way better this way.

1438
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:05,180
But the problem is by us not being in
nature at all by not interacting with

1439
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,940
animals at all.
We've allowed these monsters to develop

1440
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:11,700
these slaughterhouses.
He's houses of horror.

1441
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:15,720
He's a factory farm mechanisms like
we've really fucked up.

1442
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,710
We've gotten so big,
or the cities that don't make food,

1443
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:24,270
need so much food on a daily basis,
that we've completely removed ourselves

1444
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,810
from the process of,
of growing things of,

1445
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,250
uh,
of we've like,

1446
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:32,610
it's one of the most important things
about being a person as eating healthy

1447
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:33,251
food.
Yeah.

1448
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:35,820
It's one of the most important things.
If you don't have healthy food,

1449
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,890
you're not going to be healthy.
It's really that simple,

1450
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:40,200
right?
Like if you eat fucking just peanut

1451
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:41,730
butter and jelly sandwiches like I did
today,

1452
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,040
if you have that all day,
every day for the rest of your life,

1453
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:45,930
you're gonna have a shitty short fucking
life.

1454
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,270
You're not going to make it.
There's not enough nutrients in that,

1455
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,450
but we don't,
we don't think about it,

1456
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:53,970
man.
We're so busy with stocks and with

1457
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,690
marriage and with fucking,
I want to get,

1458
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,990
where are we going to thinking about,
um,

1459
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,760
making an addition on the house.

1460
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,690
No,
we're going to get that man cave

1461
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,400
anytime.
It's easy though.

1462
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:05,170
We've got,
we have figured out a way to get a lot

1463
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:09,100
of protein in people's bodies had cheap
for cheap and he used to be that meet

1464
01:03:09,101 --> 01:03:13,900
with something that countries I remember
and a lot of countries that I lived in,

1465
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:14,980
uh,
we were like,

1466
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:17,140
for example,
you would eat and meet twice a year,

1467
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:18,670
the bedouin,
you know,

1468
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:21,520
who are very healthy people.
They lived on dates and bread and,

1469
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:24,250
and go a camel milk and stuff.
But they,

1470
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:26,320
the traditional indigenous people of
Saudi Arabia,

1471
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:28,900
for example,
they would eat meat twice,

1472
01:03:28,901 --> 01:03:30,220
three,
four times a year,

1473
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,890
meet with a real delicacy.
It was very expensive.

1474
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:34,030
You'd,
you'd have a goat.

1475
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,370
But it was,
it was not easy to come by.

1476
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,470
There was very little water and stuff
like that.

1477
01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:43,090
So in a way we have,
we've given ourselves a food problem,

1478
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,920
you know,
it's just the pendulum has,

1479
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,340
we have people at eat obviously too
much.

1480
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,480
And then you have lobbying efforts to
get as much corn syrup and things like

1481
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:54,300
that into people's bodies.
And you know,

1482
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,480
it's,
it's,

1483
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,760
it's an interesting thing.
I think you're right though.

1484
01:03:57,761 --> 01:04:02,761
We've gotten away from a lot of the
stuff that just is easy to do to make

1485
01:04:03,191 --> 01:04:05,530
yourself healthy.
Like sleep and water.

1486
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,180
That's a big part.
Those are giant.

1487
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,740
The sleep of water,
a giant.

1488
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,450
I just think we're,
so,

1489
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:15,460
I think we're way too removed from what
I think is an essential aspect of life.

1490
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:20,110
The process of food acquisition,
I think it makes people really confused.

1491
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,220
I think,
uh,

1492
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,990
you know,
I could look at it as an enthusiast and

1493
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:26,920
I can look at it as someone who enjoys
being outside.

1494
01:04:26,921 --> 01:04:28,690
I enjoy,
I enjoy the woods,

1495
01:04:28,691 --> 01:04:32,830
I enjoy fishing and all that stuff.
I enjoy catching something in the water

1496
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:34,240
and then cooking it and eating it.

1497
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,820
I enjoy this so much.
You don't have to show his money in the

1498
01:04:36,821 --> 01:04:39,100
food business and then it good and bad.
I mean,

1499
01:04:39,101 --> 01:04:41,170
you know,
I don't want to make the food companies

1500
01:04:41,171 --> 01:04:42,470
have to be,
but I was going to say is,

1501
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,970
but I don't want to do it every day and
I don't want it to be the only way I can

1502
01:04:45,971 --> 01:04:48,160
survive because it's too hard to do
anything else.

1503
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:51,310
So we figured out a way to make it
really easy to get food.

1504
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:54,250
The hardest part of life now becomes the
easiest part of life.

1505
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,450
Well,
I mean,

1506
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:59,740
when they talk about why did philosophy,
why were the Greeks,

1507
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,590
you know,
able to sit around and think,

1508
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:05,830
so you had plato and socrates and
Aristotle.

1509
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:06,840
Well,
you know,

1510
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:10,180
William McNeil I think wrote this book
about the fact that,

1511
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:14,140
you know,
the Greeks had access to timber,

1512
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:19,120
olive oil and wine,
and they were to export those things and

1513
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,850
exchange them for goods that they
needed.

1514
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:24,790
So it meant that they didn't have to
live a subsistence lifestyle.

1515
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:28,570
They also lived in a temperate climate,
so they didn't have to spend so much

1516
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:30,820
time getting ready for the winter flip.
Also,

1517
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:32,200
super busy.
But fuck,

1518
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:35,570
they were doing a lot of butt fucking as
well before there were,

1519
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,130
there were any probably diseases,
but they didn't have any diseases back

1520
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:39,730
then.
Now.

1521
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,450
Yeah,
right.

1522
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:43,600
Just died by plagues,
but entire civilizations.

1523
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,760
But you know the,
in a way,

1524
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:48,850
when you're able to get your food
quickly like that water,

1525
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,330
it leaves time for other things like God
casting.

1526
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,530
Oh yeah.
No,

1527
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:53,920
it's,
it's,

1528
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,000
look,
it's an awesome thing.

1529
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,630
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
I think it would be real nice if we

1530
01:05:58,631 --> 01:06:03,340
could all in some way reconnect the,
it'll give us a little bit more

1531
01:06:03,341 --> 01:06:08,341
perspective on things because the w the
world that we have right now is the best

1532
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:10,810
world that's ever lived for sure that
ever lived,

1533
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:11,890
that ever existed.

1534
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:12,521
I mean,
this,

1535
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:15,010
this,
this civilization that we're existing in

1536
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:16,180
right now,
no question.

1537
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,500
Best ever.
There's no question.

1538
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:21,310
It's just so much easier to be informed.
So much easier to improve yourself.

1539
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,520
So much easier to get feedback.
So much easier to communicate with

1540
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:26,950
people,
get to know things and there's trust.

1541
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,670
There's trust in institutions.
I've,

1542
01:06:28,671 --> 01:06:30,010
at least in this country that,
you know,

1543
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,430
when you just said I,
this is freshwater from a factory,

1544
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,650
you know,
you don't know what went into it,

1545
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:38,260
but you trust that when you drink that
water,

1546
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,860
it's from whole foods.
You're not going to die of.

1547
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,700
Yeah.
Nobody poisoned that water.

1548
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,340
Nobody took shortcuts.
There's not feces in that water.

1549
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,950
A lot of countries you couldn't say that
because you don't know who's taking,

1550
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,790
who's running control and who's got the
government,

1551
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:52,930
their pocket.
But we're really lucky in this country

1552
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:55,900
that we have institutions we can trust
like a police force.

1553
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,570
We can trust overall.
I know there's certain crops,

1554
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,450
the FBI,
there are uh,

1555
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,500
the courts.
There is objective law.

1556
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:07,030
Those things are fucking,
we're so lucky that we all have things

1557
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:09,670
like due process and representative
government.

1558
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:12,070
I don't have to worry about a police
force knocking on my door.

1559
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:14,140
Sometimes you do.
I guess if you've been up to stuff,

1560
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:16,480
but I don't have to worry about it.
Somebody who has more power than me

1561
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:19,570
buying a government official who can
then knock on my door and put me in jail

1562
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:21,940
on trumped up charges.
Are there examples of that?

1563
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:23,470
Maybe,
but for the most part other than a

1564
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:25,240
country where that's not the case.
Thank God.

1565
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:29,320
I don't know why I just took this one.
A Fox News rent.

1566
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:30,460
You should get that Gig,
bro.

1567
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,230
That's right.
That's going to get you the Fox News

1568
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:32,980
Gig.
I can't,

1569
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,730
well,
Fox News,

1570
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,490
if they could just take Donald Trump to
task a little more polite.

1571
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,880
How about you right next to Alex Jones
and you'd be like the voice of reason,

1572
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,370
you know,
like they have a hannity and colmes it

1573
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:43,760
callen and Jones.
Oh,

1574
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,250
well listen,
I,

1575
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,480
I just read your boy Michael Schirmer's
book skeptic,

1576
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:47,840
which I really liked.
Yeah,

1577
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,020
he's awesome.
And Michael Shermer is created at,

1578
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:52,030
taken on the conspiracy theorists.
Well,

1579
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:53,860
you know,
he's great at being reasonable about

1580
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:54,820
things like he was,
uh,

1581
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,300
he broke down the whole fire walking
thing and he explained how he did it and

1582
01:07:58,301 --> 01:08:01,150
he was explaining in a scientific way
that's about conductivity.

1583
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,180
It's like there's a reason why we don't
cook on the coals themselves because

1584
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,040
they're not very good conductors of
heat.

1585
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:10,120
It's why heat up metal and the metal
grate that goes over your grill.

1586
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,130
You Cook on that.
Yeah.

1587
01:08:11,131 --> 01:08:12,430
You don't want to walk on that.
He's like,

1588
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:15,680
when you walk on those coals,
it's like it takes a while for you as

1589
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,700
long as you move quickly.

1590
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,070
Yep.
You don't spend too much time with one

1591
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,510
spot,
you're going to get all right.

1592
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,970
He's like heels.
He gave us an actual scientific

1593
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:23,720
breakdown.
He goes,

1594
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,330
after about 10 to 15 feet,
it kind of gets crazy.

1595
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,070
Yeah.
Cause then it's just too much time of

1596
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:30,440
you touching the coals,
but he's like eight to 10 feet.

1597
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:32,570
You're okay.
Him and Sam Harris,

1598
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:33,890
who?
My favorite guests on your pocket.

1599
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,780
They're both great.
They're both great.

1600
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,480
They're both fascinating in their own
right.

1601
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,070
They're both,
uh,

1602
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,410
you know,
guys that we really,

1603
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:45,320
really need where there's,
there's a lot of nutty shit out there.

1604
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,990
Like they came on or he came on rather
Michael Shermer.

1605
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:50,660
One of the things that he wanted to talk
about with this increased presence of

1606
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:54,020
people that honestly believe that there
is some sort of a conspiracy,

1607
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:57,110
that the earth is flat and that can't
even get,

1608
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:58,880
I can't,
I don't have the energy.

1609
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,000
I do.
Ah,

1610
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:03,410
I have the attorney just to,
would you look at it and quick bursts

1611
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,660
like the same thing.
I have the energy to hold my breath.

1612
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:10,790
That's my same energy for flat earth.
Hold my breath and I'll watch like a few

1613
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:13,070
minutes of a youtube video that I go,
yeah,

1614
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,850
I have to shut it off like you're going,
you're saying a bunch of shit that

1615
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:20,090
doesn't make any sense.
Why does water spin to his fee attached

1616
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:23,270
with spending goal?
If we really worse round water would

1617
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:24,730
spill over the side.
Fuck,

1618
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,000
listen,
you're not a fucking,

1619
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,120
you know,
you're not a physicist,

1620
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,400
you know,
you know,

1621
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,110
going up on our Youtube Channel,
oh,

1622
01:09:31,111 --> 01:09:35,150
it drives me to hates coming.
I've met more people mad at me and I

1623
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:39,230
retweeted one the other day.
I put up a real tweet from a real person

1624
01:09:39,231 --> 01:09:40,310
that believes the earth is flat.

1625
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,440
She shot me.
He was saying it was a sell out.

1626
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,090
I know where your checks being cashed,
bro.

1627
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,720
How come I hashtag flat earth like
Hashtag flat earth is a real thing.

1628
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,690
14 listen.
Schermer sets on a great schirmer said,

1629
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:55,980
you know when you have people reaching
the same conclusion from independent

1630
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:00,800
lines of inquiry,
you got so many different independent

1631
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:02,750
lines of inquiry.
People are doing their own research and

1632
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:07,670
they all converge on one conclusion.
If you are then coming in to say,

1633
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:10,720
well this is my idea.
If you're a conspiracy theorist said,

1634
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,320
well yes,
but there's all this unexplained

1635
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:14,420
phenomenon,
that's fine.

1636
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,700
But you know when I asked for it
evidence,

1637
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,410
you know what I always get when I say
why did it happen?

1638
01:10:18,411 --> 01:10:19,610
And they go,
it's been covered up dude.

1639
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:23,990
People are being killed with now is a
bunch of Liars and 1100 scientists lied

1640
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:25,430
about the earth moon landing.

1641
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,413
I mean,
come on,

1642
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,840
sorry,
a Christmas letter obviously.

1643
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:34,770
Who's signing your checks now?
They spelled q three from an island.

1644
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,990
I think they do that in England too.
Maybe flatter doesn't need a washed up

1645
01:10:38,991 --> 01:10:42,680
failure anyway,
Hashtag flat Earth Ah man.

1646
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,060
But here's the thing,
there's video taken from the space

1647
01:10:47,061 --> 01:10:50,510
station of the earth being round and
have them circling the earth.

1648
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,570
There's time lapse video.
You could see time lapse video of the

1649
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:56,210
Sun rising and falling,
like you could see it.

1650
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,670
I'm not even talking about this.
I know,

1651
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,560
but I mean,
what do they think that is?

1652
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:01,550
That's all fake,
right?

1653
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:04,250
Then all those people are liars.
One has ever gone up.

1654
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:07,370
Their satellites aren't real.
Did you know that's another one they do?

1655
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:08,240
No.
Yeah.

1656
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,730
They think that satellites are actually
low flying planes.

1657
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,760
I find they're probably just at the end
of the day,

1658
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,500
they need to belong to a group and they
want to be exclusive.

1659
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,830
It's a little bit like,
it's a little bit like the modern art.

1660
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:26,460
When Ann Rand I ran was walking through
the museum of modern art and they were,

1661
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:31,020
a bunch of people were kind of clustered
around that broom that had been stuffed

1662
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:35,550
into a pail and everybody was like,
that's not interesting.

1663
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:37,860
And uh,
it was really expensive.

1664
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:41,520
Then they went in and there was just a
three light bulbs that had been strung

1665
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:44,200
together,
hanging and,

1666
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,233
and when,
when,

1667
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,880
wait a minute,
I know what the fuck is going on here.

1668
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:53,090
These people are all trying to belong to
an exclusive group and they're not

1669
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:58,710
really even looking at this art.
They just want to be,

1670
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,590
you know,
part of the cool kids that get it.

1671
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,110
You don't get it cause you're not
sophisticated.

1672
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,080
But I,
I get that they don't play chess and

1673
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:08,430
they don't collect wine.

1674
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,410
So this is their shot.
This is their shit.

1675
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:12,720
It's a community.
You have to go to Lacma.

1676
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,000
Uh Huh.
Oh sure.

1677
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:16,050
How to La,
what is it?

1678
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:19,590
La County Museum of art.
What does that a white tapestry.

1679
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,780
You mean?
He just took a light tapestry and framed

1680
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:22,710
it,
but it's,

1681
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,900
it's the,
it's the texture of the wine.

1682
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:28,380
It's eggshell white.
They had a plexiglass box.

1683
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:29,970
Of course they did.
It was a,

1684
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:33,810
is there like an amber colored?
It was a small box.

1685
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,200
It was about maybe two feet high,
maybe three or four feet wide.

1686
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:40,170
And it was,
it was a roped off with wire.

1687
01:12:40,171 --> 01:12:43,080
You couldn't get close to the touch it
because it was art.

1688
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,550
Well this I,
I spoke to this amazing artists who owns

1689
01:12:47,551 --> 01:12:50,230
the comedy cellar in New York City.
She owns the building and the comedies

1690
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,550
[inaudible] and her name is a Alva and
she has her,

1691
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,810
have you ever been to the comedy store
in New York?

1692
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,670
Sure.
So I'm sorry.

1693
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,190
The comedy cellar she had,
if you look on the wall,

1694
01:12:59,191 --> 01:13:02,340
there are all these amazing awe,
awe.

1695
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,430
That's amazing.
Yeah,

1696
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,420
it's amazing.
It's,

1697
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,590
people were sitting on it though,
so they had a rope it off.

1698
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:09,390
Genius.
You can't sit on art.

1699
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:12,660
It'd be good to sit on amazing in a
really uncomfortable way.

1700
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:14,610
It's an amazing piece.
That's amazing.

1701
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,140
Incredible.
In your home front swap the Bel Air

1702
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,420
Home,
I'm just thinking creates amber.

1703
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,180
You could maybe put it like right at the
front door.

1704
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:25,740
Like they walk in your house,
they're like,

1705
01:13:25,741 --> 01:13:29,610
look at what you're into.
I mean you're in for a crazy night.

1706
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:33,090
Likud friends while box.
You were an artist back in the seventies

1707
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,920
days and you do portraits are really
cool.

1708
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:37,740
Like figures that you could identify
with like this.

1709
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:40,650
Grow out with an amazing woman.
She's an amazing painter.

1710
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,550
I mean like you,
well you go,

1711
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:46,230
you want to buy that stuff.
She said there was no way back in the

1712
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:47,160
day that she could even,
like,

1713
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:51,210
people wouldn't even really teach you
how to draw human famous.

1714
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,070
It was too literal.
Too literal.

1715
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,530
You,
you weren't getting into a school,

1716
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:59,400
you were getting into Cooper Union or
anything because you were just too

1717
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,860
literal.
You were not part of this ICT guys.

1718
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:05,580
That is the abstract movement and that's
how human beings are.

1719
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,520
Did you,
when you see like a Jackson pollock,

1720
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,080
did you ever,
you ever go,

1721
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:11,800
wow,
that would be cool to have or do you go,

1722
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:12,190
what

1723
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,170
in the fuck?
I don't know enough about art,

1724
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,110
which I with point of view,
but he was,

1725
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,950
he was,
he was a groundbreaker I guess in some

1726
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:23,230
ways in that he said he was doing
something,

1727
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,890
get the fuck out of here.
Yeah.

1728
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:30,070
He was a groundbreaker in splashing
paint like a little kid would do well,

1729
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,700
but then he did,
he was doing something,

1730
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,030
you know,
I don't know.

1731
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:35,020
I don't want,
man.

1732
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,390
All you have to do is like get in with
the right group.

1733
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,480
You know,
you do acid and below woody allen,

1734
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:42,490
you smoke cigarettes.
He yell at your secretary,

1735
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:43,990
I paint would go,
he's brilliant.

1736
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:45,850
He's brilliant.
He's amazing.

1737
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,760
The guy's just standing over at this
point and you know,

1738
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:50,620
hey man,
if you're one of those guys out there

1739
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:52,150
that you like,
fuck you Joe Rogan.

1740
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:55,630
I'm a big Jackson pollock fan.
You don't know shit about art obviously.

1741
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,111
No,
no.

1742
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:59,680
He had something else about art.
But the difference between how I see

1743
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:02,530
things and how other people see things,
I'm sure he had did something else.

1744
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,810
He was doing something actually much
more deliberate than that.

1745
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,570
So you ready for my Jackson pollock,
a education here?

1746
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,220
I believe Jackson pollock was painting
fractals.

1747
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,470
I think that there was a,
there were so,

1748
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:18,560
so a fractal would be,
if you look at the coastline of a,

1749
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,610
of a country,
and then you look at the micro,

1750
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,500
um,
what is it,

1751
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:24,890
the micro sort of,
uh,

1752
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,930
uh,
lines in that particular,

1753
01:15:27,931 --> 01:15:30,400
it,
they mimic the larger picture,

1754
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:33,130
the larger coastline.
That would be a fractal,

1755
01:15:33,131 --> 01:15:35,860
I believe.
And Jackson pollock was different

1756
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:37,900
because not only it was the first guy to
start doing that,

1757
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:42,250
but he was deliberately creating what
other painters were not able to do,

1758
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:44,080
which was fractals,
please.

1759
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,260
Uh,
please somebody tell me that I'm right

1760
01:15:47,261 --> 01:15:50,830
about that personal reflections on
Jackson pollock.

1761
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,590
So is that the case,
Jamie?

1762
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:57,490
Is that what they're showing color
Palette painted nightdress fractals.

1763
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,473
Huh?
I had to be,

1764
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,740
well,
what fractals,

1765
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:03,940
the best way to describe fractals is
it's a geometric pattern that as you get

1766
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:06,160
closer to it,
you see the,

1767
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,130
like if you look at it from a distance,
you see a very particular shape.

1768
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,620
Like the Mandelbrot set is a perfect
example of,

1769
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:13,720
of a,
an amazing fractal.

1770
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:17,950
And it was one of the ones that the,
the really nutty people used as proof

1771
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:22,951
that crop circles were from extra
terrestrials because mathematicians had

1772
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:25,890
only figured out the Mandelbrot set.
I just,

1773
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:30,900
I want to say less than a year before
this crop circle appeared with a perfect

1774
01:16:31,751 --> 01:16:36,751
mandelbrot set in some wheat field and
the idea of this pull up a Mandelbrot

1775
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:37,450
set.

1776
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:40,540
So you could see this actually an
animated version of the Mandelbrot set,

1777
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:44,710
which is really the best way to look at
it because as it goes closer you can see

1778
01:16:44,711 --> 01:16:47,560
that it's the same thing on the outside
in a smaller scale.

1779
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,500
And then it go you a closer than that
and it's the same thing you saw on the

1780
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:54,040
outside but in a much smaller scale and
then it goes on and on.

1781
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,810
That's apparently what what pollock was
able to do that other painters have not

1782
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:00,040
been able to do.
So there was something,

1783
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,750
here's the animation of the Mandelbrot
set,

1784
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:06,751
so it's just crazy looking weird thing
that as you get closer to it and it

1785
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:08,110
expands,
you start,

1786
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,790
it starts revealing itself.
It's end.

1787
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,660
It starts revealing how bizarre it is.
Like as you see all these little things

1788
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:18,060
that stick out of these circles,
these giant circles and smaller circles

1789
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:21,350
and then even smaller circles that are
attached to that giant circle and each

1790
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:24,020
one of those gets infinitely smaller,
keeps repeating.

1791
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,880
It's exactly,
and it never ends.

1792
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:29,390
You keep going deep into these things
and you find another small circle and it

1793
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:32,990
has smaller circles on it and you go to
Ed and the smaller circles and it just

1794
01:17:32,991 --> 01:17:34,970
keeps going on and on and on and on and
on.

1795
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,950
It's fascinating.
So pull up the crop circle Mandelbrot

1796
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,990
set and see if you could find the
history on it.

1797
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:43,880
Cause I think it was like,
it was like one of those things where

1798
01:17:43,881 --> 01:17:46,010
they were like,
look someone who's doing these either

1799
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:51,011
the hoaxer is very educated and some
sort of a mathematician and understands

1800
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:56,260
the proportions in making a correct
manner or reasonably correct mandelbrot

1801
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,380
set or daily.
I'm going with aliens,

1802
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,180
I'm going with the audience to do more
fun.

1803
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:03,370
Look at that.
Isn't that crazy though?

1804
01:18:03,371 --> 01:18:06,620
It's a beautiful looking little thing
someone made in the wheat field,

1805
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,670
you know,
but the idea that it's impossible to

1806
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:15,110
walk and not leave trails like oh
there's all these lines in there.

1807
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:19,940
He fucks like what about those roads
like go up like it's impossible to walk,

1808
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:22,010
like go to the image and make that
larger.

1809
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,050
It's impossible to walk in there and not
be detected.

1810
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,190
Um,
I see roads.

1811
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,220
Do you see those fucking roads?
Yeah,

1812
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,850
that's the problem.
These fucking people,

1813
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:30,740
they never want to see everything.
I know.

1814
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:33,290
They always want to like look at only
the conspiracy.

1815
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,730
Why?
Because it's fun.

1816
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,320
I used to be one of those people.
Yeah.

1817
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,720
And Michael Shermer,
his book he talks about in Spanish

1818
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,060
skeptic,
he talks about Thomas Eager,

1819
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:43,820
I think mit professor who talks about
yes,

1820
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,620
jet fuel that Burns at 2,700 degrees
and,

1821
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:47,900
and steal,
you know,

1822
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:49,890
it doesn't melt a,
I can't remember,

1823
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,090
I,
Jeff Still Burns at 1200 degrees and the

1824
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:55,640
steel,
the structural steel in the World Trade

1825
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,860
Center,
that doesn't melt until it's 2,700

1826
01:18:57,861 --> 01:18:59,270
degrees and say,
you're right,

1827
01:18:59,271 --> 01:19:01,760
the jet fuel may have gotten up to 1400
degrees.

1828
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:05,120
Here's the thing,
at 1200 degrees or 1400 degrees,

1829
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:10,150
steel loses 50% of its integrity.
Structural steel and the steel.

1830
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:13,100
And this was this guy from mit who is an
actual,

1831
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,550
you know,
professor of engineering when it comes

1832
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:17,700
to metallurgy.
You know,

1833
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,420
and when you're at the Massachusetts
technology,

1834
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:22,250
you know some shit,
you know when you're a professor.

1835
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,890
That's why I hated that argument.
It doesn't have to just melt.

1836
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:25,701
He said,
he said,

1837
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:28,670
he'd say when,
when there's irregularities in that

1838
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:30,090
structure over,
you know,

1839
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:33,750
hundreds of feet and there are hundreds
of degrees of reg and regulators.

1840
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:36,560
It will buckle.
It'll that things will buckle.

1841
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,810
It'll break the clamps off.
And the next thing you know,

1842
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,240
do you know what percentage,
how about this crazy thing?

1843
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,880
This is also from Thomas Ego who is at
mit professor,

1844
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:48,110
do you know what percentage of the World
Trade Center Tower,

1845
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:52,190
one of them was of air?
Like what percentage was made up of the

1846
01:19:52,191 --> 01:19:52,850
air?

1847
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:56,360
You think it was 50%.
20% meaning like if you look at the

1848
01:19:56,361 --> 01:20:00,040
whole structure on the outside,
how much of the inside is made of Aser?

1849
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,960
Well,
good percentage of every building's made

1850
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:03,890
of air,
right?

1851
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:05,300
Cause it's like a honeycomb.
Sure.

1852
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,590
Going on.
Yeah,

1853
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,280
I don't,
what's a normal building?

1854
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,473
Uh,
well,

1855
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,430
normal buildings have a lot of concrete
and they're made it.

1856
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,720
This is no,
this is an incredible building that was

1857
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:18,630
able to,
it was basically a giant sail and it was

1858
01:20:18,631 --> 01:20:21,930
able to take an incredible amount of
force,

1859
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,110
not only from planes but from wind,
like 300 mile an hour,

1860
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:25,973
you know,
crazy,

1861
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,620
crazy,
crazy stuff.

1862
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:33,390
And so it was an incredible feat of
engineering designed by this Japanese,

1863
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:38,391
a architect and it was 110 stories high.
95% of that structure was air 95% which

1864
01:20:40,741 --> 01:20:41,700
is incredible.
Right.

1865
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:45,060
And so when it pancake that it,
yeah,

1866
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:46,280
it felt,
it felt,

1867
01:20:46,281 --> 01:20:48,180
that's why it fell down that way.

1868
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:48,931
But yeah,
for sure.

1869
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:50,880
Stop making buildings that are that big.
Right.

1870
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,370
Well,
he's settle the fuck down.

1871
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,750
It couldn't.
It was,

1872
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:56,790
yeah.
You have to make it so big.

1873
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:57,810
It's big.
That's a big building.

1874
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,030
It seems silly.
How about you make two smaller

1875
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:01,110
buildings?
You fuck,

1876
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,490
I know that,
you know,

1877
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:05,460
it was a feat of Manhattan and they want
to do something awesome and revitalize

1878
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:08,120
the neighborhood.
It was a revitalization project there.

1879
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,590
The real problem with conspiracy
theories is it,

1880
01:21:10,591 --> 01:21:13,470
some of them are true.
That's the real problem.

1881
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:18,590
When you start going over history,
you can get paralyzed by all the

1882
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:23,100
possibilities because so many things
have been conspired and were pulled off

1883
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:25,770
throughout history.
It's just a common thread throughout

1884
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:29,340
history,
but the problem is when you're looking

1885
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:33,240
at things today like towers falling and
buildings catching on fire and

1886
01:21:33,241 --> 01:21:36,660
collapsing and all these conspiracies
get thrown around,

1887
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:42,110
you will lose a massive amount of your
life watching youtube videos and reading

1888
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:43,750
websites.

1889
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:46,170
No,
you ever six taking down rabbit holes

1890
01:21:46,171 --> 01:21:49,110
and websites,
I think dedicated to the nine 11

1891
01:21:49,111 --> 01:21:50,310
conspiracy.
Oh,

1892
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,350
that's a small number,
but it's,

1893
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,020
it's again,
it's one of those things where people

1894
01:21:55,021 --> 01:21:59,130
don't want to see both sides of it.
They don't want to see both sides of it.

1895
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:04,730
I feel like for sure there was some
incompetency for sure.

1896
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:10,170
There was some failure to understand the
threat.

1897
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:12,600
Sure.
Whether that was an intelligence failure

1898
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:13,920
who,
I don't know,

1899
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:16,830
whatever it was,
there were some,

1900
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,360
there was some failure.
Right,

1901
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:19,920
and that allowed that whole thing to
happen.

1902
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,840
Now,
when any fun,

1903
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:23,550
when anything happens throughout
history,

1904
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,550
there's two,
there's one,

1905
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,060
there's two primary things that happen
when something goes down.

1906
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:34,020
Number one is people capitalize on it.
If there's an enormous event,

1907
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,880
there's something that happens,
we get attacked and you know,

1908
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,780
they know what happens and they,
there's,

1909
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:42,510
there's this,
there's this moment now in time,

1910
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:44,820
right,
where they have this potential to do

1911
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:48,450
things they couldn't do before because
the mood of the country has shifted.

1912
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,200
The mood is on revenge movies on
preventative measures,

1913
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:55,320
and then you can do things like go to
Iraq and invade Iraq.

1914
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,230
That's a hundred percent fact that that
is why they did that.

1915
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:00,510
They did not do that cause they thought
our rack was going to attack us.

1916
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:03,630
There's no evidence whatsoever.
They didn't know the weapons of mass

1917
01:23:03,631 --> 01:23:05,140
destruction was all horse shit.
Right?

1918
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,480
So the whole reason why they did is they
look okay,

1919
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:10,510
we've got a tag,
but on the good side we've got a fucking

1920
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:14,050
nice chance to go to Iraq here.
Now the people that are looking and

1921
01:23:14,051 --> 01:23:17,170
conspiracies,
they all start to add things.

1922
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:22,060
So they'll start to say they engineered
those attacks so they could go to Iraq.

1923
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:26,290
That's not necessarily true and way up
way unlikely.

1924
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,960
It's also giving the government or a
group of people,

1925
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:32,560
a lot of credit for organizing being
that organizations and people keeping

1926
01:23:32,561 --> 01:23:33,080
their mouth shut.

1927
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah,
I mean that's,

1928
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:37,540
that's it.
Government incompetence and random

1929
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:41,680
events and momentum are probably the
reason a lot of things that things

1930
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,810
happen.
People do have agendas.

1931
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:47,920
I do think there was a group of people
that had an agenda that wanted to take

1932
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:49,480
out the fourth largest army in the
world,

1933
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,110
uh,
Iraq because Iraq was posed a threat.

1934
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:54,340
But,
but,

1935
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:56,650
um,
those people probably got into the

1936
01:23:56,651 --> 01:24:01,150
decision makers ear like George W.
Bush and not a very wise guy.

1937
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,920
And uh,
you know,

1938
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:04,660
so there,
there were people that influenced,

1939
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:09,130
I think the invasion of Iraq who were
smarter than the decision makers.

1940
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:10,810
Yes.
That's what I,

1941
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,750
Bill Hicks had a great bit about the
fourth largest army in the world thing.

1942
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:14,621
He's like,
yeah,

1943
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:17,760
but after the first three armies,
there's a real big dropoff.

1944
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:19,510
Yeah.
He goes,

1945
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,850
yeah,
the fifth largest army is a salvation

1946
01:24:21,851 --> 01:24:22,490
army.
Yeah.

1947
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:25,000
Yeah.
I think that the one of the right main

1948
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:29,650
reason after nine 11 was the idea was
let's go into Iraq to show any other

1949
01:24:29,651 --> 01:24:31,150
country like Pakistan,
North Korea,

1950
01:24:31,151 --> 01:24:36,151
that if they think there's any value in
giving a weapon of mass destruction to

1951
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:39,750
an enemy like Okaydo,
that it'll be the end of their country.

1952
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,200
Here's appears proof.
You know,

1953
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,150
there was certainly probably a little
bit of that,

1954
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,630
but also oil money,
oil was a big factor.

1955
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:50,450
The ability to sort of engineer and
control the environment of budgets.

1956
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,910
Correct.
Engineering Control Lid was on lesson

1957
01:24:52,911 --> 01:24:53,201
one,
but a,

1958
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:53,681
well,
no,

1959
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:56,100
because other than that doesn't hold
water because the oil,

1960
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:01,030
there was money in a war effort,
but oil is a commodity traded on the

1961
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:02,920
open market.
So if you actually look at the way oil

1962
01:25:02,921 --> 01:25:03,620
is traded,
there's,

1963
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:07,060
there's a a tanker with oil and it's a
war.

1964
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:08,350
It's a commodity.
So it's,

1965
01:25:08,351 --> 01:25:13,351
it's an attack on an oil tanker can be
on its way to a country and then it's

1966
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:18,430
that tanker is bought by a broker and it
has to turn course and go back to

1967
01:25:18,431 --> 01:25:21,340
another place.
So oil is traded on the open world

1968
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:22,090
market.
There's,

1969
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:25,210
there's oil that's about it.
So the idea of the United States wanted

1970
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:29,650
to control the Iraqi oil is actually
bogus because we lost a shitload of

1971
01:25:29,651 --> 01:25:32,680
money and we don't,
we don't get that oil money.

1972
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:36,560
We also produce enough of our own oil
with fracking and things to always

1973
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,420
support it.
Yeah.

1974
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:39,700
No we didn't done but let's look,
but hold on a second.

1975
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:44,701
Cause look at it practically.
Does Iraq hold fucking untold billions

1976
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:46,023
of gallons of oil?
Yeah.

1977
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:48,760
Yes.
And isn't it a great idea to be in

1978
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:51,400
control of a place that has billions of
gallons of oil?

1979
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:56,200
Aren't we in control of Iraq to invade
and overthrow their government?

1980
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:57,550
We did,
but we're not in control of it.

1981
01:25:57,551 --> 01:25:58,630
Right?
Well we're not in control,

1982
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:01,750
but we essentially overthrew their
government and then gave control to

1983
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:03,770
other people if we decide to take it
back.

1984
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,410
If there was some sort of an event in
the United States decided to go in and

1985
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,740
take it back.
There's,

1986
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:11,000
it's not like they're,
they're going into North Korea.

1987
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,050
It's not like they're going into some
established country with a powerful army

1988
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:16,220
like Russia.
You know,

1989
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:18,530
they're going into some thing that we
essentially broke down.

1990
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:22,100
We broke down,
created a civil war between two rival

1991
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:25,250
factions of Islam,
which nobody even predicted.

1992
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,760
I had no idea you'd be new about the
area a lot more than a lot of people

1993
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:30,530
that we're talking about it because you
grew up there.

1994
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,990
I remember you talking to me about that.

1995
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,150
I remember you explained to me at the
difference between the Shia and the

1996
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:38,360
Sunni and that these people do not
fucking get along.

1997
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:42,170
And this is going to,
and that it's a sodom was same guy being

1998
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,360
a psychopath and a fucking maniac.
He is.

1999
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:47,090
He was also a nonreligious person.
Yeah.

2000
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,220
And because he was secular,
sort of bathurst is essentially

2001
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:54,320
essentially mean as much as you can be
to exist in that area,

2002
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,450
you know.
But because of that,

2003
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,540
you know,
he kind of like controlled those people

2004
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:04,070
from going after each other.
So my point being is there's a lot of

2005
01:27:04,071 --> 01:27:06,470
fucking money to be made in Iraq in oil
a lot.

2006
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:10,010
And the idea that that wasn't some form
of motivation and how we see,

2007
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,050
we see these conversations that people
have.

2008
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:13,540
It's one of the things about these wiki
leaks,

2009
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,380
uh,
documents that you get.

2010
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:20,660
You get to see the connections at some
of these people have with arms sales and

2011
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:25,010
with donations to the Clinton Foundation
and with oil and big money,

2012
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,920
big money and so much wanting
reconstruction,

2013
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:31,100
big money in weaponry,
big money in oil drilling.

2014
01:27:31,101 --> 01:27:36,020
There's big money in all of that stuff.
And everybody's got their hand in the

2015
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:36,740
Pie.
Everybody's,

2016
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,570
and then,
then what happens is,

2017
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,640
you know,
you have other countries,

2018
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:42,470
for example,
look at Pakistan.

2019
01:27:42,471 --> 01:27:46,970
Pakistan has dizzy or I love the way you
say that Pakistan has zero interest in

2020
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,860
having a peaceful Afghanistan.
I can't even say that France falls

2021
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:54,020
without making phone calls if you have
enough phones.

2022
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:56,570
Uh,
so then you have other countries like

2023
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:00,050
that that have less of an interest in
keeping that country stable.

2024
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:04,970
So they foster conflict by supporting
criminal networks,

2025
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:08,930
by supporting other vested interest in
those country,

2026
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:11,030
keep those country's in turmoil.

2027
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:13,000
And then you have a real problem.
And,

2028
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:14,780
and the biggest issue with Eh,
you know,

2029
01:28:14,781 --> 01:28:16,700
if you wanted to get into a conspiracy,
my God,

2030
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,930
this,
the Iraq invasion,

2031
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:23,240
2003 was good for Iran,
made Iran a bigger player,

2032
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:28,390
probably made Russia more influential
and certainly made the Shia in Iraq,

2033
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:34,180
the people that finally had some power
and had control of oil over the Sunni

2034
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:36,840
minority.
That is,

2035
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:37,930
remember what the British,
British,

2036
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:40,100
British used to always do this right?
The British would go into,

2037
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:41,830
for example,
in Syria and things like that,

2038
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:46,310
that the Alawites in Syria are empower.
The Alawites are a minority.

2039
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:50,600
That's what Bashar Al Assad is.
And I believe the Alawites are Shia

2040
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,230
where majority of the country is Sunni.
I believe it might be the other way

2041
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:56,750
around,
but the British always would go into a

2042
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:59,060
country when they would take over,
kind of colonize a country and they'd

2043
01:28:59,061 --> 01:29:01,740
find them minority and they would give
that minority

2044
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,980
a lot of power.
And here was the genius of that.

2045
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,950
They would,
they would prop them up and because now

2046
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:12,951
the minority in that country had to be
loyal to the British because if they

2047
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:14,750
weren't,
if they,

2048
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:19,870
if they chose to now kind of side with
any kind of a revolution side with any

2049
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:24,930
kind of an independence movement,
the minority also knew that once that

2050
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,290
was over,
the majority that they had been

2051
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:33,390
suppressing that they had been given
favor over would then turn on them.

2052
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:37,830
So that was always a way of dividing and
conquering.

2053
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:42,860
Find who the minority in the country is
and go ahead and give them power so that

2054
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:47,340
they will,
they will have to be loyal to us because

2055
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:49,560
they're survivable will depend on it.

2056
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,300
Well,
there's been really bizarre moments in

2057
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:55,380
history where leaders have actually
contemplated how to keep the population

2058
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:57,540
under control in the event that there's
no war.

2059
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:00,930
That's one of the big fears is the event
that peace breaks out.

2060
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,680
I mean it's one of the reasons why they
constructed the,

2061
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:05,610
the game of football.
They,

2062
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,450
they made football to deal with the fact
that people weren't going to war.

2063
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:12,930
And you had all these young men,
they were ready to fuck a girl to kick

2064
01:30:12,931 --> 01:30:15,000
some ass.
And there was no ass to keck.

2065
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:16,740
You know,
they had conquered America.

2066
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:20,520
They had wiped out all the native
Americans and put them into reservations

2067
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:23,610
and that.
So that was a sort of unspoken war.

2068
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:26,700
And then there was the wars with the
British and the wars with the Spa

2069
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,870
Spanish and all this different shit that
went on for how many hundreds of years.

2070
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:34,160
And I'll throw out the question men,
what was that?

2071
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:36,320
The great article a,
I can't remember his name,

2072
01:30:36,321 --> 01:30:37,910
but he wrote an article goes,
I don't,

2073
01:30:37,911 --> 01:30:39,620
I never trust anybody.
Hasn't been punched in the face.

2074
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:42,830
And he said,
civilization is an agreement among men

2075
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,440
to behave well.
And you know,

2076
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:49,670
when you got civilization it's fine.
But look at the simulated violence at

2077
01:30:49,671 --> 01:30:53,330
all of us have to engage in I at 49
going box,

2078
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,460
look at the UFC.
I never miss a fight.

2079
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:56,360
I,
you know,

2080
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,920
I want to see it.
I,

2081
01:30:58,010 --> 01:31:01,070
there's something about that.
I think mma,

2082
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:04,490
I've heard this is one of the fastest
growing sports among young men all over

2083
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:05,420
the world.
Oh,

2084
01:31:05,421 --> 01:31:08,480
it's surprising when you see two men
should kill each other with their bare

2085
01:31:08,481 --> 01:31:10,070
hands.
There are triggers.

2086
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:13,160
Visual triggers.
The same as like with pornography,

2087
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:14,600
it's just visual triggers,
right?

2088
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,690
You're just like,
there's that taps into my caveman there.

2089
01:31:17,691 --> 01:31:19,460
There's certainly some of that.
Yeah.

2090
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,360
So we've covered a lot of ground here
and I,

2091
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:26,060
I feel good about it and know that the
age of most of your father's,

2092
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:28,160
and I hope you've written down
everything I fucking said.

2093
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:30,010
Mm.
I'm going to be an Ottawa.

2094
01:31:30,011 --> 01:31:31,190
Oh by the way,
Ottawa.

2095
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,500
What are you doing in Ottawa?
I'm doing a college there.

2096
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,080
Uh,
September 30th and two colleges.

2097
01:31:36,081 --> 01:31:39,140
Do you think that I would remember cause
since we get such a wide,

2098
01:31:39,141 --> 01:31:41,900
you have such a fine line.
I should tell everybody where I'm going

2099
01:31:41,901 --> 01:31:43,580
to be.
Do I know I'm hopeless.

2100
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:45,530
Just text me and I'll tweet it.
All right.

2101
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,930
And we'll be in a,
we're sold out in San Jose.

2102
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,390
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

2103
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:52,670
This September,
20 seconds and shy so she will go,

2104
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:54,320
Joe Rogan is and lied to me.
I'm like,

2105
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:56,630
I didn't say I was going to be there and
her job and I find it and get it in

2106
01:31:56,631 --> 01:31:59,000
October 13th.
Tickets available.

2107
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,780
Bria Bria

2108
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:04,420
in California this weekend.
This weekend.

2109
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:05,980
Uh,
we are going this Thursday.

2110
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:08,710
I'm going to be in San Jose.
What about Friday and Saturday?

2111
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,510
I'm around.
You want to work?

2112
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,150
Actually Friday,
Saturday I have cakes and son of a,

2113
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:15,730
by no Friday I'm in Ventura.
Not Know where you are.

2114
01:32:15,731 --> 01:32:18,820
If I am adventure at Saturday,
I am at uh,

2115
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,730
UC Santa Barbara doing standup to
another college.

2116
01:32:21,731 --> 01:32:23,110
Yeah,
he smarty pants.

2117
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:26,260
Do you get out there with a book and
start reading and you don't want to be a

2118
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:28,240
little edgy and I like to see how far I
can push it.

2119
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:30,460
Like last time I did you see UC Santa
Barbara?

2120
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,570
I said,
um,

2121
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:33,880
maybe don't think,
I know you guys think that you're the

2122
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:34,990
center of the universe.
Maybe.

2123
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:37,360
Maybe put yourself last in all
categories.

2124
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:39,460
Maybe you're not that important.
It might be good.

2125
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,690
We,
it was this unempowering.

2126
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:41,620
I don't like the way you think.

2127
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:42,250
Well,
but,

2128
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:44,550
but we live in a world where it says
self my kids,

2129
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,020
I'm gonna fucking yell at the school.
You're not that important.

2130
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:49,780
Your dreams are going to important.
Mike kids went down there to get an

2131
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:52,810
education,
not to be taught by some fucking 49 year

2132
01:32:52,811 --> 01:32:54,250
old burn out,
but you're not in Paul.

2133
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,130
But he looks a lot younger than 49.
He's got tight fitting skin from a

2134
01:32:57,131 --> 01:32:58,920
distance,
from a distance,

2135
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:02,140
from a homes.
I think about getting old.

2136
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:03,340
Yeah,
you should.

2137
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:04,500
You're getting old.
It's why training.

2138
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:06,610
That's why I do my yoga has no getting
around it buddy.

2139
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:08,860
I know.
It is what it is.

2140
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,080
Um,
I think we saw it a lot of the problems

2141
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:12,710
I think,
I don't think we solve shit and I don't

2142
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:17,320
think this is what I think.
I think the world's perspective is a lot

2143
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:19,660
like my lego pile that I was talking
about.

2144
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:23,680
Little tiny legos get put on all the
time and sometimes we have to take legos

2145
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:26,470
off sometimes.
Like we've created areas of protection

2146
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:27,970
where we don't really need any
protection.

2147
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,830
The big,
big one being humor.

2148
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:32,710
I can people try to dissect humor and
pretend that these are actual

2149
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:34,810
statements,
like you're giving a fucking affidavit

2150
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:37,810
in court or something like that.
Like people say ridiculous things.

2151
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:40,360
They don't really mean.
That's why you laugh at them cause you

2152
01:33:40,361 --> 01:33:42,160
know they don't really mean it.
You know,

2153
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:45,010
and the,
the idea that you're allowed to get

2154
01:33:45,011 --> 01:33:48,280
triggered by these things and you know
you're allowed to protest to get upset.

2155
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,370
It's,
it's just a symptom of us being too

2156
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:53,710
soft.
Just a symptom of life being too soft

2157
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:57,010
and gentle snowflakes.
I couldn't agree more fragile

2158
01:33:57,011 --> 01:34:00,100
snowflakes.
I couldn't agree more so scared but get

2159
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:01,420
some perspective.
Yeah,

2160
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:06,250
they can't so much worse if shit went
down just like it did on nine 11 then

2161
01:34:06,251 --> 01:34:09,920
you get this beautiful community of
people that are happy and,

2162
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:13,480
and truly thankful,
but it's almost like shit has to go down

2163
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:17,350
for us to remember or you've got to do
something really hard.

2164
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,410
I think that's one of the great things
about exercise.

2165
01:34:20,411 --> 01:34:22,750
Like,
sometimes I'll come out of a workout and

2166
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:25,510
I fucking love everybody.
I want to hug people.

2167
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,700
I just love endorphin trying to your
body.

2168
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:30,430
Yeah,
I'm high as fuck on endorphins and on

2169
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:35,290
top of the endorphin thing,
it's also like just a release of stress

2170
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,820
and it's working out is so difficult
sometimes that when it is over,

2171
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,170
like you have this uh,
you know,

2172
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:46,180
like the struggle of a peak training
session.

2173
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:49,540
Like say if you're doing rounds on the
bag right and you know you're going to

2174
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:54,250
do seven rounds in the bag and you hit
that fourth round and you are fucking

2175
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:55,820
exhausted.
Yes.

2176
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,760
And you know,
you have do three more rounds and you

2177
01:34:58,761 --> 01:34:59,210
know,
in,

2178
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:01,040
you've got to go have to go hard.
Like when it's,

2179
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:04,520
it's so hard to do when you're in the
moment when your pr you're heaving and

2180
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:07,670
you're looking at the clock and is still
a minute and 45 to go and you're,

2181
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,970
and you're just breathing fire and
trying to pace yourself.

2182
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,160
That's so much more difficult than
everything else.

2183
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:14,990
Then once you get out,
everything else is like,

2184
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,210
ah,
vince,

2185
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:20,720
Vince Lombardi said fatigue makes
cowards of us all.

2186
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:21,613
Yeah,
I love that.

2187
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:25,070
Yeah.
I think you said of men and specific.

2188
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:25,701
Hold on.
Listen,

2189
01:35:25,701 --> 01:35:28,520
that's back in the old days.
I'm going to be at the hook on and I

2190
01:35:28,521 --> 01:35:30,970
know you're going to be mad him up.
No cause I didn't want you to cause I

2191
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,310
get made you guys make fun of me for not
being good at marketing.

2192
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:36,370
Get on it.
Oh I'm going to be at the Algonquin

2193
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:38,120
Commons theater and Ottawa.
Yes.

2194
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,270
Friday,
September 30th I'll gunk when Commons

2195
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:42,070
theater.
Wow.

2196
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,580
That was so I'm not doing it cause it's
a con.

2197
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:46,190
It's a theater.
What might be out of college sometimes.

2198
01:35:46,191 --> 01:35:48,500
Like they'll hold things like for the
whole community.

2199
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:51,410
I decided have you been to Ottawa?
You had been to Ottawa.

2200
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,090
I love Ottawa.
I love Canada.

2201
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:56,420
Canada.
I'm a big fan of Toronto of sure for

2202
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:57,320
sure.
I'm excited.

2203
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:00,080
Algonquin common stuff.
The big fan of Vancouver,

2204
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:03,170
big fan of Montreal.
I just like it up there and I like the

2205
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:06,320
people better let me too.
They're nicer when shit hits the fan.

2206
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,120
That's where I go.
Let's go out there.

2207
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,730
We want to go hunt.
Toronto's cold as fuck cold together.

2208
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:12,650
We've got to meet you.
Have you met my friend?

2209
01:36:12,651 --> 01:36:14,570
The Rivets?
They'll move in in Alberta.

2210
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,370
No,
they live way the fuck up there.

2211
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:18,910
They live in a log house and they shoot
bears every day.

2212
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:20,930
Really?
It's just too far up there.

2213
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:23,740
How about that?
The get all their meat from the woods,

2214
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:25,360
man,
they're way up there.

2215
01:36:25,361 --> 01:36:27,440
There are two and a half hours outside
of Edmonton.

2216
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:28,910
Ooh,
yeah,

2217
01:36:28,911 --> 01:36:30,710
maybe more.
It might be like 300 I spend a lot of

2218
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:31,544
time in Edmonton.

2219
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:37,340
It's a fun town too and I think there's
something about the fact that those

2220
01:36:37,341 --> 01:36:40,220
people have to endure on godly
temperatures.

2221
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:43,970
They bond together.
It's incredible and they do a lot of

2222
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:47,240
drugs,
lot of drugs,

2223
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,500
which kind of drugs?
Cocaine and I was at,

2224
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,240
if I was a toot head,
if I wanted a tune up,

2225
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:53,891
I'd be,
oh,

2226
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:57,200
I've been,
I've been offered more below in tr and

2227
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:59,090
Edmonton.
God bless those people.

2228
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:01,460
How do you think they get it in?
If you think about it,

2229
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:03,200
right?
Canada's is way the fuck up there and

2230
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:06,020
you can't even grow coke in North
America.

2231
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:07,183
There's,
you know that.

2232
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:09,800
No,
I think you can't be grown in the United

2233
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,110
States Google if that's possible.
But if that's true,

2234
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:15,890
I've been repeating that all my life and
I'm pretty sure I got it from an ice tea

2235
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:16,724
song.

2236
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,580
My really,
my feeling is talking about conspiracy.

2237
01:37:22,581 --> 01:37:25,640
I'm sure with that kind of money,
they're probably people that are border

2238
01:37:25,641 --> 01:37:28,760
control and stuff or getting,
it's just too easy to let it through.

2239
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:33,200
I think it's from the song high rollers
and whether it be a high roller,

2240
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:38,300
does cocoa beans?
Truth is cocoa beans do grow in the u s

2241
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:41,930
but only in very limited areas.
Typically cocoa beans are grown in a

2242
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:45,200
narrow band referred to as the coca belt
or chocolate belt.

2243
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:47,780
His band exists.
It's 20 degrees of latitude.

2244
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:48,561
Coca.
No,

2245
01:37:48,561 --> 01:37:52,400
but that's Choco.
We're talking about coco cocoa beans.

2246
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,950
That's chocolate.
Chocolate's legal.

2247
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:56,040
Know that.
Yeah.

2248
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,010
Now we're talking about cocoa beans.
We'll actually call him about leaves.

2249
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:01,590
Jamie.
It's not it's cocaine.

2250
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:03,220
Coca plant.
Yeah.

2251
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,810
Cocoa clients.
Yeah.

2252
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,740
We,
so we added the OAA,

2253
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:10,380
which is the chocolate stuff,
which is weird because it doesn't taste

2254
01:38:10,381 --> 01:38:10,950
good.

2255
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:12,440
You ever have like raw cocoa?
Yes.

2256
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:14,850
It's really good for you.
But it does not taste that good.

2257
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:15,991
No,
it doesn't.

2258
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:17,810
It's bitter.
Don't we have this some shit that we're

2259
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:18,810
putting in our,
um,

2260
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,770
butter from cocoa or something like
that?

2261
01:38:20,771 --> 01:38:21,840
What does it a cow.
Cow.

2262
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:22,441
Cow.
Oh,

2263
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:23,200
that's right.
Yeah.

2264
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,760
But,
but Coco Coco was first processed with

2265
01:38:26,761 --> 01:38:31,160
milk and sugar.
That was a real kind of that,

2266
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,690
cause we got it from South America.
Right.

2267
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:36,940
And then they took it back to you,
but it didn't say illegal.

2268
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,130
Awesome.
If you could grow it.

2269
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,490
Yeah.
But it said it right below that or you

2270
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:41,760
pull it back up,
you could see it.

2271
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,830
People grow.
Do people grow cocaine?

2272
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:45,090
Right.
Their board straight dope.

2273
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:46,590
I don't know.
See if that,

2274
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,630
but that's just a message board and I
start trying to find,

2275
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:49,590
I have a question for you.

2276
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,030
Please do.
Um,

2277
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:52,230
I,
I,

2278
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:55,140
what do you think of when we do legalize
marijuana?

2279
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:56,400
Right.
If it does get legalized,

2280
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:58,890
it'd be a lot of,
there'd be a lot of the lobbying efforts

2281
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,710
and stuff like that.
But why do you feel about marijuana use

2282
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:03,690
and teenagers?
I don't think it's good idea,

2283
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:05,060
but I would do it.
Yeah.

2284
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,210
Yeah.
I was 15.

2285
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:10,470
I don't think it's a good idea that for
a growing mind cause I think that we'd

2286
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:14,550
contend to.
I think thc is still an mind altering

2287
01:39:14,551 --> 01:39:19,230
substance and just like anything else
and it has its benefits.

2288
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:23,640
But I think as you're growing,
it feels like it can be for the most

2289
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:25,080
part,
for a young mind,

2290
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:27,300
a motivation.
Keller it could be.

2291
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:32,430
I think there's a lot of factors that
could play into the big picture of who

2292
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:34,980
you become.
It certainly could be one of them to

2293
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:37,500
deny that it's not influential.
I think it's kind of silly.

2294
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:41,700
Um,
and also to a really truly understand

2295
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:43,740
the effects of it's,
uh,

2296
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,140
the way thc if

2297
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:49,650
affects the developing mind.
It's not completely understood and it's,

2298
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,800
it's definitely under debate.
You know,

2299
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,500
there's,
there's a lot of studies that have shown

2300
01:39:53,501 --> 01:39:56,830
that it's actually not bad at all.
For a woman to be smoking it while her

2301
01:39:56,831 --> 01:39:59,200
baby's in the womb,
which is really contrary to what a lot

2302
01:39:59,201 --> 01:40:00,120
of people think.
Right?

2303
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,210
But whether or not it's beneficial for a
young kid,

2304
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:06,580
first of all,
it's probably,

2305
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,753
it's,

2306
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:13,510
if you think of how old you are when you
actually are an adult,

2307
01:40:13,511 --> 01:40:14,650
I mean we have this number,
right?

2308
01:40:14,651 --> 01:40:17,800
The numbers 18 right?
But your brain doesn't really fully

2309
01:40:17,801 --> 01:40:21,160
form,
it's not fully formed to your early

2310
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:21,940
twenties right?
Yeah.

2311
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:24,220
So there's,
there's a bunch of shit going on and if

2312
01:40:24,221 --> 01:40:24,930
you're altering

2313
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:28,210
nat,
who knows what the consequences are,

2314
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,880
you know,
like I'm find why we have laws against

2315
01:40:30,881 --> 01:40:33,500
drinking when you're under aged or
smoking,

2316
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:35,770
not all countries seeing other
countries,

2317
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:37,203
they have

2318
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:42,010
less instances of alcohol abuse per
capita because it's not this forbidden

2319
01:40:42,011 --> 01:40:43,410
taboo thing.
I,

2320
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:47,290
there's a real argument for that too,
is that kids don't like being told what

2321
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:51,220
to do and when you can get away with
your friends and someone sneaks a little

2322
01:40:51,221 --> 01:40:54,040
fucking flask of whiskey and we all
around drinking in our

2323
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,240
clubhouse like,
Ooh,

2324
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:56,720
we're cool.
But if,

2325
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:00,520
if it was legal and easy to get,
we might not be so inclined to do that.

2326
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,890
I Dunno.
I Dunno either.

2327
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:05,140
I don't know.
I know France doesn't have the same

2328
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:06,280
issues,
but Russia does.

2329
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,700
Russia being Russia and wouldn't be that
fun.

2330
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:10,770
You know,
those are winters,

2331
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,060
the winters and the fact that,
you know,

2332
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:16,960
they got conquered by the Mongols for
200 fucking years also being run by it.

2333
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:19,250
You also being controlled by the czar
right now and putting some,

2334
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:21,280
sorry,
he's a terrifying person.

2335
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:26,020
They keep fucking shooting guys that
know a lot about Russian doping for the

2336
01:41:26,021 --> 01:41:29,410
Olympics to keep shooting these dope and
scientists and journalists.

2337
01:41:29,411 --> 01:41:31,030
Yeah.
But the doping scientists,

2338
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:33,010
they're dropping like flies and didn't
pay attention to that.

2339
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:34,450
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

2340
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:35,890
There you got,
there was a conspiracy.

2341
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,180
Oh,
that's a real one.

2342
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:37,650
Yeah.

2343
01:41:37,650 --> 01:41:39,460
Someone's murdering those fucking
people.

2344
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:42,520
They know too much and they're being
taken Russian intelligence.

2345
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:45,940
Whoa.
Poisoning you with odorless,

2346
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:49,450
tasteless substances that the KGB is
very good at,

2347
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:52,460
or the fsm or whatever it's called now.
Uh,

2348
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:56,320
and now apparently putting is revamping
the intelligence [inaudible] DOMESTICA

2349
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:58,270
intelligence agency.
Putin knows that.

2350
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:01,540
We know he has botox on his forehead.
I didn't know that he did.

2351
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:04,810
I'm not going to admit or deny that.
As far as the way to shiny.

2352
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:06,880
Yeah.
It's like an old lady at the beauty

2353
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:09,070
power.
There's this journalist that wrote an

2354
01:42:09,071 --> 01:42:11,770
article in 2012 about him.
She's still alive but she has been

2355
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:13,440
harassed.
But she basically,

2356
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:15,610
you know,
talk about a gutsy woman.

2357
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:19,060
Like she just basically wrote this expo
Zahn him done a lot of call him a small

2358
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:23,380
mean simple minded man.
There's a lot more than that man.

2359
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,600
What Putin is is like a throwback,
you know,

2360
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,660
Jocko willink.

2361
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:33,750
My friend is a former navy seal Jockos.
He's got a good sense of like the way he

2362
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:36,520
classified,
it's like perfect goes.

2363
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:38,380
He's a gangster.
Both.

2364
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:40,270
Both uses of the word.
That's right.

2365
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:42,490
Like the guys is running the country by
himself,

2366
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:47,050
like gangster and he's also a real,
he's a real gangster.

2367
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:51,430
He's one of the rare like actual
dictators where it's like,

2368
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,860
oh you go,
he's got like a little thing in front of

2369
01:42:53,861 --> 01:42:55,480
him.
He's pretending that he's but the

2370
01:42:55,481 --> 01:42:55,991
reality,
oh,

2371
01:42:55,991 --> 01:42:57,970
he's the king.
He's the king of her people.

2372
01:42:57,971 --> 01:42:59,650
But that,
that did that since they love him.

2373
01:42:59,651 --> 01:43:01,330
Yeah,
he's got 80% approval rating or

2374
01:43:01,331 --> 01:43:02,830
something.
People love trump too.

2375
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:05,140
There's something about,
first of all,

2376
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,960
the 80% approval rating is probably a
lot like Kim Jong.

2377
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:09,700
Ooh and shout a hundred percent approval
rating.

2378
01:43:09,701 --> 01:43:11,670
You know,
like the choices.

2379
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,450
Well,
that Gas Kasparov,

2380
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:14,920
you ever hear what he said?

2381
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:17,320
Yeah.
He said that to governor pence.

2382
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:19,030
Uh,
trump's running mate,

2383
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:21,120
trump's running mate said,
uh,

2384
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,600
uh,
he's a strong leader.

2385
01:43:22,601 --> 01:43:25,210
You can't deny it's a strong leader.
And Garry Kasparov said,

2386
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,070
Mister [inaudible],
Mister pence,

2387
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:31,330
governor pence saying a flattened me
Putin is a strong leader is like saying

2388
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,960
arsenic is a strong drink.
Your country should be ashamed of you.

2389
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:38,380
I couldn't agree more because you do
need to know the difference.

2390
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:41,050
You didn't need to know that when,
when you talk about a strong leader,

2391
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:43,390
a strong man in that context,
what you're really talking about is a

2392
01:43:43,391 --> 01:43:46,240
man who thinks he's above the
institutions of that country.

2393
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:49,930
He's above the rule of law.
You are at his whim and what a strong

2394
01:43:49,931 --> 01:43:51,160
men do.
I'll create.

2395
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,500
As long as you give me all your money,
I'll create security.

2396
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:57,380
As long as you give me all your freedom,
I'll create security as long as you say

2397
01:43:57,381 --> 01:43:58,580
nothing bad about me.

2398
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:01,040
What was that Dan Carlin,
my favorite quote,

2399
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:04,280
they Romans created a wasteland and
called it peace.

2400
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,490
Russia.
Russia is a one crop economy.

2401
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,560
When's the last time you bought a
Russian?

2402
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:09,500
Good.
Give me one thing.

2403
01:44:09,501 --> 01:44:11,330
You ever buy a restaurant up here?
Everything is from Russia.

2404
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:13,610
Russian car rush,
rush,

2405
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:15,440
and I'm washing machine.
Yes.

2406
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:17,750
Russian.
You know nanotechnology by those big

2407
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:20,150
hats.
A lot of hats with the flaps that come

2408
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:21,350
down the side.
Vodka.

2409
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:24,230
She isn't even that good anymore.
We make it better.

2410
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:26,000
So we'd make us better.
And then you've got to dare you.

2411
01:44:26,001 --> 01:44:27,200
I don't even know what you're saying.
Oil.

2412
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:28,890
I don't agree with any of this.
All right.

2413
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,230
No,
you're right.

2414
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:32,930
His pocket.
I think that there's also this game that

2415
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:34,370
that pence guy has to play.
I mean,

2416
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:37,820
he's been playing the small time
politics game now he's going global.

2417
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:42,350
I mean there's this game that this guy
has to play where he has to say Nice

2418
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:46,010
things about people that Donald Trump
has said nice things about,

2419
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:48,440
you know,
Donald Trump has said that he's a fan of

2420
01:44:48,441 --> 01:44:48,980
Putin.

2421
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:50,390
Yeah.
Robert Gates.

2422
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:51,440
Yeah.
Robert Gates.

2423
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:53,420
You know Robert Gates,
who was secretary of defense,

2424
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:55,700
who served eight presidents over 50
years.

2425
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,290
Okay,
Robert,

2426
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:58,461
sorry.
Robert Gates,

2427
01:44:58,461 --> 01:45:00,800
right.
Wrote an article in the New York Times.

2428
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:03,380
This is a guy who served Republican
administrations.

2429
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:05,510
Look up Robert Gates for a second.
Hold on.

2430
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:07,400
Look at this art.
I know,

2431
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:10,910
I know it says Mike Pence as it's
inarguable that Putin is a stronger

2432
01:45:10,911 --> 01:45:12,180
leader than Obama.
He's in.

2433
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,670
He's for me.
You're,

2434
01:45:13,671 --> 01:45:14,060
you're,
uh,

2435
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:16,640
you're an ignorant miss when you say
things that are irresponsible.

2436
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:21,910
Robert Gates said that Donald Trump is
not only unfit but dangerous for the

2437
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:25,180
defense of this country.
He has zero idea,

2438
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,830
the nuances that go into geopolitics,
what it takes.

2439
01:45:27,831 --> 01:45:29,330
He's just a,
he worked,

2440
01:45:29,331 --> 01:45:31,670
he operates on his gut,
his gut level,

2441
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:35,120
and I think that the guy isn't even
interested in knowing what he doesn't

2442
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:37,070
know.
He's telling me fried chicken with a

2443
01:45:37,071 --> 01:45:37,850
fork and knife.

2444
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:39,880
Can't stand him.
Some collar with mom.

2445
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:41,690
I don't like Hillary either.
Be honest because I'm more of a

2446
01:45:41,691 --> 01:45:42,740
libertarian,
but it'll taste thing.

2447
01:45:42,741 --> 01:45:45,230
I don't like that guy.
He's an EGOMANIAC and I think he's

2448
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:47,150
dangerous.
Beyond repair,

2449
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:51,050
do you think that he thought that this
was ever going to really work out this

2450
01:45:51,051 --> 01:45:52,760
way?
That he would actually be the Republican

2451
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:53,630
nominee?
Question.

2452
01:45:53,631 --> 01:45:55,580
Unless he was doing it for his own
brand.

2453
01:45:55,581 --> 01:45:56,960
I can see him.
He's so,

2454
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:00,530
everything comes back to that guy.
It's all about him,

2455
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,030
right?
It's all about him.

2456
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,980
And I wouldn't be surprised if,
yeah,

2457
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,840
he said,
I'm going to run.

2458
01:46:05,841 --> 01:46:08,570
It's going to be good for my brand.
It's going to get make me more famous,

2459
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:11,360
which is all he's ever been interested
in seams and it'll be,

2460
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:13,040
it'll be good for my company and all
that.

2461
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,840
And all of a sudden he went and hold on
man,

2462
01:46:14,841 --> 01:46:16,730
I'm,
I'm actually going to do this.

2463
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:18,680
But I don't think he wants to work that
hard.

2464
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:21,680
The presidency of the United States.
That's a hard thing to,

2465
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,110
well,
I would assume that he has a ton of

2466
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:26,240
obligations always.
Right.

2467
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:30,050
And I assume all those obligations make
him a substantial amount of money.

2468
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:33,740
Unlike being the president,
the president is not a substantial

2469
01:46:33,741 --> 01:46:37,670
amount of money in,
in well you names like after the fact

2470
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,680
put his money and he put his company in
a trust under his kid's name and that's

2471
01:46:42,681 --> 01:46:44,530
not,
that's not the issue.

2472
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:47,870
But I mean you really think he wants to
step away from everything and run the

2473
01:46:47,871 --> 01:46:50,340
country for half a million bucks a year.
I don't know.

2474
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:52,410
I think that he doesn't,
I think that's a good question.

2475
01:46:52,411 --> 01:46:56,700
400 president has earned $400,000 annual
salary along with a $50,000 annual

2476
01:46:56,701 --> 01:47:00,180
expense account,
a $100,000 non taxable travel account

2477
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:03,040
and the $19,000 for entertainment.
Hmm.

2478
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:05,550
Hmm.
19,000 a year from entertainment.

2479
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,440
Yeah.
I spend a lot more than the most recent

2480
01:47:07,441 --> 01:47:09,780
raisins.
Salary was approved by Congress and

2481
01:47:09,781 --> 01:47:14,781
President Bill Clinton in 1999 went into
effect in 2001 so Clinton was balling.

2482
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:19,170
How convenient that motherfucker ball
and you wanted that 400 grand,

2483
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,120
400 grand back then was probably a lot
of money.

2484
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:24,750
I think Sam Harris Today on your
podcasts did a great job of describing

2485
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:25,920
Donald Trump.
He said,

2486
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:28,680
I don't know if he's ever said anything.
I've,

2487
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,580
and I've listened to everything he said.
I mean,

2488
01:47:30,581 --> 01:47:33,870
I tried to listen to the speeches.
I try to listen to these interviews and

2489
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:36,630
I agree with them.
I don't think that Donald Trump has ever

2490
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:40,080
sent anything profound or insightful.
I've never heard him say even anything

2491
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:44,370
substansive about what he would do,
about major challenges in this country

2492
01:47:44,371 --> 01:47:45,960
other than the fact that he would build
a wall.

2493
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:47,610
Very general.
Good luck with that.

2494
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:49,050
And,
and uh,

2495
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,510
and get tough.
He get tough on law and order.

2496
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:53,640
It's going to get tough luck.
Demagogues,

2497
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:57,120
all demagogues in history always talked
about law and order and how we have to

2498
01:47:57,121 --> 01:47:59,460
get tough.
And that is another way of saying,

2499
01:47:59,461 --> 01:48:01,950
give me more power.
Give me more guns.

2500
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:04,980
I'm going to keep things.
I'm going to enforce the law because

2501
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:09,981
apparently our cities are hell holes.
But that's not true.

2502
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,350
It's not true.
The cities have become places where a

2503
01:48:13,351 --> 01:48:16,560
lot of people go and they've never been
safer in the history of this country,

2504
01:48:16,561 --> 01:48:17,730
in New York City,
et cetera.

2505
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:18,840
So,
you know,

2506
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:23,340
this guy is,
he's got lots of sensationalist things

2507
01:48:23,341 --> 01:48:25,620
to say,
but there's very little substance long

2508
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:28,230
unstylish short on substance.
But he's always been that guy.

2509
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:31,620
That's his whole marketing campaign.
Well,

2510
01:48:31,621 --> 01:48:33,750
he's,
he was a salesman.

2511
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,270
He sells himself.
He puts his name everywhere.

2512
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:37,950
He brands things.
He's got this,

2513
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:40,200
this look,
he wears nice suits.

2514
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:42,480
You know,
he's got to look even with his hair.

2515
01:48:42,481 --> 01:48:44,090
Come on.
He knows he could cut his hair better

2516
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:44,820
than that.
Yeah,

2517
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:48,510
he does that shit on purpose.
He does that shit because he knows it's

2518
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:51,300
like his whole thing.
His whole thing is just the whole

2519
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:53,370
wackiness of it all.
Yeah.

2520
01:48:53,371 --> 01:48:57,750
But my issue becomes more about like
when people say he's got to be smart

2521
01:48:57,751 --> 01:48:59,280
because he made a lot of money.
Okay.

2522
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:04,530
So we extrapolate.
We make these sort of large claims and

2523
01:49:04,531 --> 01:49:05,760
even I would do that.
Look,

2524
01:49:05,761 --> 01:49:07,680
he's an entrepreneur.
He does run a company.

2525
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,280
He has created some value in his brand.
He did have luxury apartment.

2526
01:49:11,281 --> 01:49:13,530
When I think of trump,
I think of Nice hotels and nice

2527
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:15,170
apartments.
I don't want to take everything away

2528
01:49:15,171 --> 01:49:15,840
from him.

2529
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,360
He's had mistakes.
Entrepreneurs make mistakes.

2530
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:21,150
So I don't begrudge them that.
Well,

2531
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:25,020
here's the deal.
What is this becomes a problem with that

2532
01:49:25,021 --> 01:49:27,630
word smart.
Whether or not you just decide this

2533
01:49:27,631 --> 01:49:28,920
person's smart,
he's gotta be smart.

2534
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:30,240
This person's smart,
she's smart,

2535
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:31,490
he's smart.
And then he tried like,

2536
01:49:31,491 --> 01:49:32,910
Whoa,
he's got 130 Iq.

2537
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,920
What does that mean?
You're really good at problem solving.

2538
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:36,270
How good are you socially?
You know,

2539
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:39,490
how good are you understanding people?
How good a conversationalist are you?

2540
01:49:39,790 --> 01:49:41,840
There's a lot of variables when it comes
to what is smart,

2541
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:46,350
what's not smart.
Obviously that guy is fairly good at

2542
01:49:46,351 --> 01:49:48,060
making fuckloads of money,
right?

2543
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:51,510
He's fairly good at running casinos and
hotels and restaurants is in menial

2544
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:55,900
things fall apart and drop and you know
there's people lose money.

2545
01:49:55,901 --> 01:49:58,360
There's a lot of ups and downs when it
comes to business.

2546
01:49:58,361 --> 01:50:00,430
But you know,
he's flying around in jets.

2547
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:01,930
He's got big houses and Shit.
I mean,

2548
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:04,930
there's a lot of success there.
It's not like he lost all of his money

2549
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:07,360
and he's poor.
He inherited about $200 million in,

2550
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:10,270
had it whole apparatus,
including lawyers and political

2551
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:11,690
connections in New York.
But he'd,

2552
01:50:11,691 --> 01:50:12,240
he'd,
you know,

2553
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:12,781
he'd say,
well,

2554
01:50:12,781 --> 01:50:14,730
what I see that with a number of years,
200 millions,

2555
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:17,500
but he had money before that.
You get inherited that money.

2556
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:20,380
No,
before he was given like 2 million bucks

2557
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:22,810
by his parents,
his alone start at first.

2558
01:50:22,811 --> 01:50:26,230
But this is ridiculous.
His father was a huge developer and he'd

2559
01:50:26,231 --> 01:50:29,200
always followed his father around.
His father was a giant developer in New

2560
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,330
York and he inherited essentially not
only,

2561
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:34,360
not only the money,
but also the political apparatus to

2562
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:35,500
connections.
You know,

2563
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:37,450
so much of,
of trump's,

2564
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,670
uh,
when he bought so many of those

2565
01:50:39,671 --> 01:50:42,790
buildings in New York and he,
I think at the center of his empire,

2566
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:46,690
15 buildings in New York City,
he bought those buildings and he got

2567
01:50:46,691 --> 01:50:48,730
huge tax breaks.

2568
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,360
Again,
I don't begrudge that developers work

2569
01:50:52,361 --> 01:50:55,000
deals with the city and they get big tax
breaks.

2570
01:50:55,240 --> 01:51:00,240
But remember a lot of those deals came
from deep inside political connections

2571
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:05,170
and connections to construction
companies,

2572
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,920
many of which were owned by gangsters.
That's just the way you do business in

2573
01:51:08,921 --> 01:51:09,641
New York City.
Again,

2574
01:51:09,641 --> 01:51:13,660
I don't criticize that,
but please don't act as though you

2575
01:51:13,661 --> 01:51:18,661
weren't using the political system and
greasing the political palms to get and

2576
01:51:21,611 --> 01:51:25,480
make and hold on to your money when you
criticize other people.

2577
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:27,910
But it's kind of admitting that he did
and he's saying he understands how the

2578
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:30,580
system was.
Like we was talking about how we went to

2579
01:51:30,581 --> 01:51:33,550
Hillary Clinton's wedding relate,
like he gave her money,

2580
01:51:33,551 --> 01:51:35,110
he gave her money and went to her
wedding.

2581
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,990
Yeah,
it's great lived,

2582
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:37,601
which is,
by the way,

2583
01:51:37,601 --> 01:51:38,950
when you watch those,
those debates,

2584
01:51:38,951 --> 01:51:40,360
he's really entertaining.

2585
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:41,651
I mean,
he is.

2586
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:42,820
You can't,
you can't,

2587
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:46,690
you can't begrudge people.
I don't think it's good to say that all

2588
01:51:46,691 --> 01:51:48,900
people that support trump are dumb or
rednecks.

2589
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:52,540
I think that's prejudice and ridiculous.
There are people that are really fed up

2590
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:55,930
with the way things were working.
The system democratic and Republican is

2591
01:51:55,931 --> 01:51:59,050
not working for them.
And there are a thousand reasons and

2592
01:51:59,051 --> 01:52:01,480
they're gone,
at least this guy speaking his mind and

2593
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:03,250
he's just different,
you know,

2594
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:05,230
I get it,
but please man,

2595
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:06,370
please,
he's,

2596
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:07,570
he's not the answer.
Plus,

2597
01:52:07,571 --> 01:52:09,130
it's kind of fun.
He's fun.

2598
01:52:09,131 --> 01:52:11,050
It's kind of fun when this,
this guy,

2599
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:13,000
well,
the whole thing fun for us to hang out

2600
01:52:13,001 --> 01:52:13,691
with.
You know what I mean?

2601
01:52:13,691 --> 01:52:15,130
He's a guy,
you know?

2602
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:18,340
Maybe if we can be assured that he
wasn't being recorded,

2603
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:21,310
you could feel free.
We got a couple of pops in him.

2604
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:22,210
Yes.
Yeah,

2605
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:25,150
maybe.
But there's a bunch of issues with

2606
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:26,800
Clinton as well,
you know,

2607
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:30,370
and you look at all the stuff that's
attached to her and all the people that

2608
01:52:30,371 --> 01:52:34,280
think that there's something wrong with
her and what she represents and it's,

2609
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:36,670
there's not one ideal choice.
And then,

2610
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,840
okay,
Jill Stein,

2611
01:52:37,841 --> 01:52:42,070
who the Green Party candidate,
she just says that she thinks that 16

2612
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:46,370
year old should be allowed to vote,
which is hilarious.

2613
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:47,360
Yeah.
Um,

2614
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:50,540
no,
they would vote for new UNICORNS and

2615
01:52:50,541 --> 01:52:52,580
Narnia.
The children,

2616
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,210
they're teenagers.
Teenagers shouldn't be able to decide

2617
01:52:56,211 --> 01:52:58,820
their friends or future of the world.
It's crazy.

2618
01:52:58,821 --> 01:53:01,310
They're children.
They're living at home still like stop.

2619
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:01,911
No,
no.

2620
01:53:01,911 --> 01:53:03,500
You don't get to decide how the world
board.

2621
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,960
That's crazy.
That's so good.

2622
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:09,080
I take about the way I thought when I
was 25 versus now.

2623
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:13,310
I mean 16 I was such a monkey was a
monkey.

2624
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:16,020
The idea that anybody could ask me any
questions other than wise,

2625
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:19,640
my dick hard all the time.
I don't have any answers.

2626
01:53:19,641 --> 01:53:21,500
I don't know what the fuck's going on.
My God,

2627
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:23,300
I agree.
All these people that are running for

2628
01:53:23,301 --> 01:53:26,420
president are all silly.
They're all silly people.

2629
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:29,570
You need like,
like literally would need like a Sam

2630
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:31,400
Harris and then he would,
you know,

2631
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:36,140
you'd need like a really smart guy who
could be pragmatic about things and then

2632
01:53:36,141 --> 01:53:37,880
he could appoint people who are
qualified.

2633
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:40,310
I don't need to nominate Sam cause he
doesn't want to do it.

2634
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,240
But you know what I'm saying?
Yam has his limits.

2635
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:43,123
You know,
Sam,

2636
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:47,570
what's interesting about Sam Harrison,
I there Sam Harris's that Sam's model

2637
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:52,430
for human behavior and Sam's model for
the way things should work is that

2638
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,860
essentially people are rational.
You know,

2639
01:53:54,861 --> 01:53:56,910
that,
that he'll cause his arguments for

2640
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:58,970
against religion,
if you listened to some of his speeches

2641
01:53:58,971 --> 01:54:03,710
are listen now are this is the problem
is that,

2642
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,790
you know,
Jonathan Heit,

2643
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:08,570
who's a great thinker and they had a
debate and Jonathan Heights' set that

2644
01:54:08,571 --> 01:54:09,560
Sam Harris,
Sam,

2645
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:12,230
you're a model for human beings.

2646
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:15,050
It's a little bit outdated because
you're assuming human minds are

2647
01:54:15,051 --> 01:54:16,140
rational.
Uh,

2648
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,010
human beings are intuitive.
We are emotional.

2649
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,950
And in fact we're,
we're emotional and we will create

2650
01:54:21,951 --> 01:54:24,980
rationality around those impulses and
those emotions.

2651
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:29,150
So even he has his limitations on how
human beings work.

2652
01:54:29,151 --> 01:54:31,520
And I'm sure we'd be criticizing his
point of view as well.

2653
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:34,010
But I agree with it.
Stop right there because that's a giant

2654
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:36,320
generalization.
Whenever someone says human beings are

2655
01:54:36,321 --> 01:54:39,260
this,
there's a giant percentage of us that

2656
01:54:39,261 --> 01:54:41,450
are totally irrational and out of her
fucking mind.

2657
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:44,480
And then there's a percentage of us that
are rational and I shouldn't say us

2658
01:54:44,481 --> 01:54:46,220
cause I'm not necessarily sure I'm
rational.

2659
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,180
Our personality,
we would like some parts of our,

2660
01:54:48,290 --> 01:54:50,590
our,
our personalities are rational parts.

2661
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:51,410
I,
Hey,

2662
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:52,131
you know why?
You know,

2663
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:55,820
I spar in case I get in a fight.
That's how insecure I am.

2664
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:58,850
Like I just want to be ready for an
imaginary scenario.

2665
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:01,580
Does that make any sense?
Not really,

2666
01:55:01,581 --> 01:55:03,030
dude,
but when you are,

2667
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:06,620
I'm losing my power.
Never had much anyway.

2668
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:08,330
But do you lift weights?
Yes.

2669
01:55:08,331 --> 01:55:09,590
I dead lift.
I know you can't tell,

2670
01:55:09,591 --> 01:55:11,390
but dude,
if I'm going to show you my lower back

2671
01:55:11,391 --> 01:55:12,740
and my ass,
okay.

2672
01:55:12,741 --> 01:55:13,930
Yeah,
I worked for my court.

2673
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:15,530
I'm gonna look forward to,
I believe you.

2674
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:16,840
All right,
well now I feel like you're,

2675
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:18,470
when we were talking about,
um,

2676
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:22,730
just like someone generalizing,
people do this or people do that.

2677
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:26,840
I think people are absolutely capable of
better and I think they're wiser now

2678
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:29,930
than they were hundreds of years ago
when they believed unbelievably

2679
01:55:29,931 --> 01:55:31,790
ridiculous things.
It's not that long.

2680
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:35,600
It's such a short amount of time with
how far people have come.

2681
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,660
You know,
like we were talking about earlier when

2682
01:55:38,661 --> 01:55:41,630
we first brought up this Matt Leblanc,
frank putting in perspective the steps

2683
01:55:41,631 --> 01:55:43,970
that have been made and then the,

2684
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,320
the progress that has been made.
It's a,

2685
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:49,920
it's a strange time.
It's a strange time because on one hand

2686
01:55:49,921 --> 01:55:54,060
you do have these really fascinating,
really rational people that make some

2687
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:55,230
great points and you go,
wow,

2688
01:55:55,231 --> 01:55:58,080
maybe there's hope for us.
But I think it's like when I send that

2689
01:55:58,081 --> 01:55:59,700
little building blocks,
he's Lego's.

2690
01:55:59,701 --> 01:56:04,200
You put a little tiny lego layer of
layer lego's on with each little

2691
01:56:04,201 --> 01:56:07,980
experience in each little of the way it
gets interpreted by people and they add

2692
01:56:07,981 --> 01:56:11,850
up to things.
So our version of like what reality is

2693
01:56:11,851 --> 01:56:14,460
now,
it keeps changing and growing and

2694
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:16,920
expanding and morphing as opposed to,
you know,

2695
01:56:16,921 --> 01:56:21,360
a 1930s movie depiction of reality,
which is really all we have to go on.

2696
01:56:21,361 --> 01:56:22,570
Other than the history books.
Yes.

2697
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:25,020
What do we have to do it?
We have to go on like what it looked

2698
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:25,530
like to watch.

2699
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:27,050
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf like
that?

2700
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:29,160
How do they talk to each other?
Who were these people like?

2701
01:56:29,161 --> 01:56:31,050
What is this?
How people were back then?

2702
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:33,870
Because you've got the written word,
you know when you got coming closer to

2703
01:56:33,871 --> 01:56:34,830
the answers.
Right.

2704
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:37,930
Is it,
would you say moving towards more of a

2705
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:40,260
truthful model,
at least for how the world works?

2706
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:42,660
I think it's so far away,
but I think it will happen quicker than

2707
01:56:42,661 --> 01:56:46,860
you think because I think with the
exponential expansion of technology,

2708
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:49,770
it's going to accelerate all this
learning and this understanding.

2709
01:56:49,771 --> 01:56:52,100
It's going to,
I think one of the things that we're,

2710
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:54,660
we're feeling really weird about when it
comes to the Internet,

2711
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:59,280
is this a invasion effect where it's
invading our lives.

2712
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:02,220
It's invading people's privacy.
It's invading your time.

2713
01:57:02,221 --> 01:57:05,990
People are getting addicted to checking
websites and checking their phone.

2714
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:08,430
It's got this sort of invasives thing.

2715
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:11,530
And when I look at that,
like the other day I was at um,

2716
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:14,880
this place and all these people were on
their phone and I just stopped and I was

2717
01:57:14,881 --> 01:57:17,970
just looking around and all these people
are walking and talking on their phone

2718
01:57:17,971 --> 01:57:19,740
at holding their phone in front of them.
I'm like,

2719
01:57:19,741 --> 01:57:22,440
this is a takeover.
This is a takeover.

2720
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:25,680
Like if that was an alien,
like it looks cute cause it's glass and

2721
01:57:25,681 --> 01:57:27,270
it's beautiful and it sits in your
pocket.

2722
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:32,630
But if there was like an alien that came
and landed in your ear and demanded as

2723
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:36,450
much time as your phone demands,
like we would think,

2724
01:57:36,451 --> 01:57:37,800
oh my God,
human beings,

2725
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:40,290
they're minds are being taken over by
this being.

2726
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:45,590
If something just climbed up on top of
your face and in and just start talking

2727
01:57:45,661 --> 01:57:46,471
in your ear,
hey man,

2728
01:57:46,471 --> 01:57:48,330
I got to my dance with me,
and they're like,

2729
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:49,800
oh,
you're like sitting there like with

2730
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:53,010
these aliens on your ear all day people,
people would freak out.

2731
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:53,850
They're like,
oh my God,

2732
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,890
we've got to get back to being people.
Well,

2733
01:57:55,891 --> 01:58:00,450
there's some weird filter between being
a person and then being a person,

2734
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:03,540
communicating with people only through
technology,

2735
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:06,030
only through electronics,
that you're inseparable,

2736
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:08,700
inseparable from these things.
It's true.

2737
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,060
All those things are leading us in some
sort of a weird way,

2738
01:58:12,061 --> 01:58:15,510
closer and closer and closer together to
a neural net.

2739
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,411
Yeah,
man,

2740
01:58:16,411 --> 01:58:17,070
it's,
it's,

2741
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:20,070
it's going to take place.
It's just a matter of when.

2742
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,780
It's not a lot of,
well,

2743
01:58:21,781 --> 01:58:24,060
someday maybe no,
it's going to take place.

2744
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:27,210
Whether or not we all choose to
voluntarily join in,

2745
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,903
I don't know,
but it's,

2746
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:33,540
I think it's going to be just one of the
inevitable realities of the future.

2747
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:36,210
Like um,
auto driving cars,

2748
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:39,060
self driving cars are in there.
They seem to be like,

2749
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:40,960
and though,
right?

2750
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:41,960
So yeah,
that's

2751
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:44,650
what ended.
It always feels like human beings are

2752
01:58:44,651 --> 01:58:47,350
pushing toward what their version of him
mortality.

2753
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:48,960
Like everybody wants to live forever,
right?

2754
01:58:49,010 --> 01:58:51,190
Everybody wants to live forever.
Like germ theory.

2755
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:56,200
Germ theory was a radical theory.
I mean the germ theory remember was it's

2756
01:58:56,201 --> 01:58:58,330
a very new concept.
You know,

2757
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:02,950
germ theory was don't drink that water
because there is,

2758
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:06,940
there are germs in there when lave and
hook and vented the microscope and was

2759
01:59:06,941 --> 01:59:09,610
checking his own saliva before he
brushed his teeth.

2760
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:11,710
He would like,
he'd look and see there's all this,

2761
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:16,270
did germs in my mouth and they're these
little microbes that were,

2762
01:59:16,271 --> 01:59:19,750
that you can't see.
But I created these lenses and you can

2763
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:23,560
see them and then he would clean his
mouth out and he'd spit into the slide

2764
01:59:23,561 --> 01:59:24,550
and he'd say,
ah,

2765
01:59:24,551 --> 01:59:27,700
there are less of those moving things in
my mouth.

2766
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:30,850
That was the beginning.
And people like that with the beginning

2767
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,900
of,
uh,

2768
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:36,700
of the idea that there is something
called bacteria and now we're realizing

2769
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:40,300
there are good bacteria and bad bacteria
and maybe your bile.

2770
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:43,690
But all of these,
all these sorts of developments were

2771
01:59:43,691 --> 01:59:47,890
there to push us beyond our biology.
So we didn't have to die of infection

2772
01:59:47,891 --> 01:59:51,280
anymore because we came up with this
idea because Alexander Fleming came up

2773
01:59:51,281 --> 01:59:55,210
with something called penicillin.
He had a cold and he,

2774
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:58,570
his snot dripped into a petri dish that
had some mold in it.

2775
01:59:58,571 --> 02:00:00,730
And he realized that the,
the mold,

2776
02:00:00,731 --> 02:00:05,080
it killed the bacteria that was in his
nose.

2777
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:06,610
And he went,
wait a minute,

2778
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:10,210
I'm going to invent something called
penicillin and antibiotics were born.

2779
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:13,060
So we had all these,
all these giant leaps,

2780
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:15,560
this idea that you can't see them but
their germs.

2781
02:00:15,570 --> 02:00:17,340
So wash your hands,
what?

2782
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:20,620
And then we'll keep things like the
bubonic plague may be at bay,

2783
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:21,580
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2784
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:25,600
And so as we move in this direction of
understanding,

2785
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:30,100
of understanding about our own biology,
understanding about our own psychology,

2786
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:31,490
understanding about,
you know,

2787
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:34,240
sort of the dangers of certain
ideologies,

2788
02:00:34,650 --> 02:00:35,391
uh,
and,

2789
02:00:35,391 --> 02:00:38,140
and why we should embrace other
ideologies.

2790
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:41,350
Like for example,
I don't know everybody's of the same

2791
02:00:41,351 --> 02:00:46,060
moral worth because some of these weird
and different because they're gay or

2792
02:00:46,061 --> 02:00:48,490
there were weird clothing,
that doesn't mean they should be

2793
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:49,570
ostracized.
In fact,

2794
02:00:49,571 --> 02:00:51,250
that means they should be included.
Well,

2795
02:00:51,251 --> 02:00:53,590
what are we doing here with all this
knowledge?

2796
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:56,770
What we're doing is we're saying this is
a better way to live.

2797
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:01,000
This is a more comfortable way to live.
This will allow us to live for a longer

2798
02:01:01,001 --> 02:01:06,001
period of time in more comfort.
But why?

2799
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:11,950
Why is it so we can come up with better
movies,

2800
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,750
books,
ideas?

2801
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,760
It starts to get to a point where you're
like,

2802
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:20,260
what are we doing this for?
Like is it just for our entertainment?

2803
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:24,790
And then does that mean that we are
chasing more sensation?

2804
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:30,510
It might be sensory sensation or is the
idea to achieve a higher level of

2805
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:35,170
understanding.
And then there are problems that we

2806
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:38,350
really have trouble with,
which is something like climate change.

2807
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:42,800
Climate change is real.
You've got ice sheets melting at a rate.

2808
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:43,900
You know,
I think what is the,

2809
02:01:43,901 --> 02:01:48,901
the Los Angeles basin uses one kilometer
of water a year and Greenland's ice

2810
02:01:52,641 --> 02:01:55,490
sheet is melting.
It's something like 240 kilometers.

2811
02:01:55,491 --> 02:01:56,340
I mean,
something crazy.

2812
02:01:56,341 --> 02:01:57,400
And we're losing,
you know,

2813
02:01:57,410 --> 02:02:01,310
sea levels are going to rise.
There's this other huge existential

2814
02:02:01,311 --> 02:02:05,660
threat that's going to affect all of us.
Maybe push a half a billion people who

2815
02:02:05,661 --> 02:02:09,350
live on coastlines inland to create a
massive amount of,

2816
02:02:09,351 --> 02:02:10,184
uh,
you know,

2817
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:14,000
uh,
ecological changes on a scale maybe we

2818
02:02:14,001 --> 02:02:14,834
haven't seen.

2819
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:18,620
So it's just a very strange thing as we
get closer to learning how to live

2820
02:02:18,621 --> 02:02:22,880
together and learning a better life as
we create this neural net where we're

2821
02:02:22,881 --> 02:02:26,180
getting a better understanding of what
it's like to be somebody else,

2822
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:29,090
even though their culture,
their software so different,

2823
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:31,270
it makes us more compassionate,
I suppose,

2824
02:02:31,271 --> 02:02:33,170
as a group of people.
Right.

2825
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:35,180
We can have a language for it.
We have a,

2826
02:02:35,270 --> 02:02:37,790
at least we're trying,
at least we know that's important.

2827
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:40,250
At least we know things like racism,
even though it exists,

2828
02:02:40,251 --> 02:02:43,070
is kind of a bad idea for a lot of
reasons.

2829
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:46,880
Yes,
we're getting closer to this goal,

2830
02:02:46,881 --> 02:02:50,300
but then I feel like there's this giant
tidal wave behind us,

2831
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:53,960
ecological title women see me and then
what is that?

2832
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:55,400
Honestly,
it's all a moot point.

2833
02:02:55,401 --> 02:02:58,940
If we get hit by an asteroid and we have
a lot of near Earth objects that could

2834
02:02:58,941 --> 02:03:00,740
fucking,
it's a little in civilization

2835
02:03:00,741 --> 02:03:02,990
instantaneously.
It comes back to fractals.

2836
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,873
Well,
there's also,

2837
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:07,310
there's that little bomb in Chelsea.
I could have been obliterated.

2838
02:03:07,311 --> 02:03:09,950
I got all these plans.
It really does go back to fractals

2839
02:03:09,951 --> 02:03:13,880
because one of the mind fuck of all
Mindfox is that when you go into a

2840
02:03:13,881 --> 02:03:15,410
person's body,
the deeper you go,

2841
02:03:15,411 --> 02:03:17,120
you hit their selves.
You go into their cells,

2842
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:21,770
you find subatomic particles blinking
out of existence,

2843
02:03:21,771 --> 02:03:26,150
and most of it is air anyway,
which is a lot like what the fucking

2844
02:03:26,151 --> 02:03:27,530
universe.
So we don't,

2845
02:03:27,590 --> 02:03:31,520
we don't know because we only have a
limited amount of ability to measure

2846
02:03:31,521 --> 02:03:33,770
these things,
but it's entirely possible that inside

2847
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:37,880
every one of those events,
subatomic events where seeing particles

2848
02:03:37,881 --> 02:03:40,190
blinking in and out of existence,
you might be able to go deeper and

2849
02:03:40,191 --> 02:03:41,960
deeper and deeper and find a whole new
universe.

2850
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:44,300
The human cells,
the university human cells and the

2851
02:03:44,301 --> 02:03:47,600
mechanisms as so intricate and so
detailed,

2852
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:50,450
and there's so much going on that it's
actually mind boggling.

2853
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:55,451
You could spend a lifetime studying how
a cell breaks down and what is going on

2854
02:03:57,051 --> 02:03:58,400
in a salad.
You could spend a lifetime.

2855
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:01,910
That's the true nature of infinity,
and that's why it's so impossible to

2856
02:04:01,911 --> 02:04:06,470
grasp because if there are hundreds of
billions of galaxies in this universe,

2857
02:04:06,471 --> 02:04:11,210
each with hundreds of billions of stars,
it's entirely possible that all of that

2858
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:14,900
could just be one subatomic particle
that's in another cell,

2859
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:18,650
that's in some other person in some
other universe.

2860
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:21,920
And that goes on and I mean that is the
true nature of infinity,

2861
02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:25,550
that it has no end.
So it is entirely possible that we'll we

2862
02:04:25,551 --> 02:04:28,310
look at as a structure.
You look at the inner universe like,

2863
02:04:28,311 --> 02:04:29,270
wow,
that's amazing.

2864
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:31,210
Constantly expanding thing.
It's,

2865
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,870
it's so beautiful and there's so many
cell,

2866
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:37,900
there's so many stars that it might be a
part of a cell that's in measurable

2867
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,690
to our Little Puny La.
Maybe.

2868
02:04:39,691 --> 02:04:43,890
Maybe the answer then is surrender like
socrates and Newton to the argue of the

2869
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:46,860
greatest minds that we,
at least in the European tradition,

2870
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:49,920
socrates says,
I know more than everybody else because

2871
02:04:49,921 --> 02:04:54,030
I'm very aware of the fact that I
basically know nothing after a lifetime

2872
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:56,190
of contemplation.
And then Newton said,

2873
02:04:56,250 --> 02:05:00,000
I'm standing on the shoulders of giants,
but he kind of liked himself to a kid

2874
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,820
skipping a rock.
Do you think the surface of the ocean,

2875
02:05:02,821 --> 02:05:06,180
that's how much he knows newt was on the
spectrum because it seemed like Newton

2876
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:09,060
had some really weird thing.
You know what he said right at the end

2877
02:05:09,061 --> 02:05:10,470
of his life,
his greatest accomplishment.

2878
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:11,490
You know what his greatest
accomplishment.

2879
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:13,200
So funny,
he said,

2880
02:05:13,201 --> 02:05:16,110
my greatest accomplishment comp,
he invented calculus,

2881
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:19,740
invented calculus.
It's the spatial relations theory.

2882
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:21,420
Gravity motion.
I mean he's just,

2883
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:22,860
he's the father of all scientists.

2884
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:24,390
Right.
And uh,

2885
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:27,710
he said that he said,
my lifelong,

2886
02:05:27,730 --> 02:05:29,730
the,
my biggest achievement was lifelong

2887
02:05:29,731 --> 02:05:31,020
celibacy.
Yeah.

2888
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:32,430
That was his thing.
Yeah.

2889
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:35,280
He was into no Posey,
very religious,

2890
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,050
very religious.
But whatever that meant.

2891
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:39,270
But yes.
Do I think he was on the spectrum?

2892
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:42,900
I think a mind like that on that level
was on a lot of spectrums.

2893
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:43,753
Well,
what do I know?

2894
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:44,880
But that's another thing,
right?

2895
02:05:44,881 --> 02:05:45,610
Isn't it?
When you,

2896
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:50,010
when we measure something or a label,
something like,

2897
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:51,240
oh,
he's got asperger's,

2898
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:52,440
or he's autistic,
you know,

2899
02:05:52,441 --> 02:05:54,300
like what,
what are you,

2900
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:56,070
what does that even mean?
Right?

2901
02:05:56,090 --> 02:05:58,590
Okay.
It's not like being a white guy,

2902
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:00,510
right?
He's got blue eyes up yet,

2903
02:06:00,511 --> 02:06:01,740
but he does,
I see his eyes.

2904
02:06:01,741 --> 02:06:02,910
They're blue.
He's the autistic.

2905
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:03,321
Oh,
yeah,

2906
02:06:03,321 --> 02:06:05,040
yeah.
I see the big gay on his forehead.

2907
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,120
No,
you don't.

2908
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:07,170
There's no,
like,

2909
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,010
how do you,
what is it?

2910
02:06:08,010 --> 02:06:10,470
Just a series of characteristics and
there's a spectrum,

2911
02:06:10,471 --> 02:06:11,700
right?
So what,

2912
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:13,160
what level is,
uh,

2913
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:14,250
Einstein that,
you know,

2914
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:17,040
what level is Elon Musk?
At what level are you at,

2915
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:18,091
you know?
Well,

2916
02:06:18,091 --> 02:06:21,450
maybe the answer then is to get really
good at one thing.

2917
02:06:21,451 --> 02:06:23,670
That's what a lot of people is like.
The Zen sort of,

2918
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:25,830
that's where archery's in,
in the art of archery,

2919
02:06:26,030 --> 02:06:26,571
you know,
you,

2920
02:06:26,571 --> 02:06:28,650
you learn everything through one thing,
through deep,

2921
02:06:28,651 --> 02:06:33,390
deep practice and deep immersion into
one particular discipline.

2922
02:06:33,391 --> 02:06:37,410
Because what it requires to be expert
mastery,

2923
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:42,390
like mastery at something will lead you
to a deeper understanding of all things

2924
02:06:42,450 --> 02:06:46,890
that that would be the sort of Zen Asian
mindset,

2925
02:06:46,891 --> 02:06:50,150
which I've always loved.
I tend to be interested in a fuck load

2926
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:52,710
of things,
but there is something to be said about

2927
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,990
Josh Waitzkin,
his book and the art of learning where

2928
02:06:54,991 --> 02:06:58,500
he said when he was learning,
he was a chess master and then he got so

2929
02:06:58,501 --> 02:06:59,170
into Jujitsu.

2930
02:06:59,170 --> 02:07:01,380
Is Marcella Garcia his first black belt?
And he said,

2931
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:04,920
I,
when I was studying Jujitsu,

2932
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:07,690
I was getting better at chess when I was
doing chess,

2933
02:07:07,691 --> 02:07:11,100
I was getting better at Jujitsu.
So maybe all of its related.

2934
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:12,570
Well,
I'm sure it is,

2935
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:17,600
but what my point was just so many
people's brains work so differently and

2936
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:21,210
I wonder if that's all just a part of
the mechanism as well is that in order

2937
02:07:21,211 --> 02:07:25,390
for this thing to keep moving,
it can't be a bunch of farmers can't

2938
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:29,460
just be what everybody's way humans
interact with each other and the

2939
02:07:29,461 --> 02:07:32,520
innovation that comes out of that,
the communication that comes out of

2940
02:07:32,521 --> 02:07:34,800
that,
the the change and the influence that

2941
02:07:34,801 --> 02:07:37,120
comes out of that,
even things is innocuous.

2942
02:07:37,121 --> 02:07:39,760
As a podcast,
she two dudes that sat down,

2943
02:07:39,761 --> 02:07:42,730
one of them being a terrorist survivor
yourself maybe,

2944
02:07:42,731 --> 02:07:46,060
maybe smoked a little marijuana and just
rambled for two and a half hours.

2945
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:48,100
I heard,
I heard the explosion and saw the smoke.

2946
02:07:48,101 --> 02:07:48,934
Yes,
because see,

2947
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:52,180
I think that the,
all of the experiences that we all have,

2948
02:07:52,181 --> 02:07:54,850
the good and the bad,
they're influential in some sort of a

2949
02:07:54,851 --> 02:07:59,650
strange way and it all seems to be kind
of balancing itself out or at least

2950
02:07:59,651 --> 02:08:04,450
pushing into a certain direction and
that direction seems to be the

2951
02:08:04,451 --> 02:08:08,650
improvement of the civilization.
Even the like poorly thought out

2952
02:08:08,651 --> 02:08:12,280
measures like this woman riding this
awful article about Matt Leblanc.

2953
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:16,840
The idea behind it that she's going to
get support is because she's saying that

2954
02:08:16,841 --> 02:08:18,940
someone is doing something even though
it's not true,

2955
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:22,360
someone's doing something bad for
society and culture.

2956
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:26,500
This person has a voice of influence and
they should never work again because

2957
02:08:26,501 --> 02:08:31,060
society and culture demands that you
behave a certain way or we will take

2958
02:08:31,061 --> 02:08:33,340
away your livelihood.
No more jokes.

2959
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:37,510
Well what the only way that would work
at all other than you're just a mean

2960
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:41,680
person and you're trying to like take
people's jobs away and make people poor.

2961
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:46,150
The only way it would work is if you're
promoting something of merit for the

2962
02:08:46,151 --> 02:08:49,300
civilization.
So by saying someone is awful and

2963
02:08:49,301 --> 02:08:53,680
terrible and this is why they should
never work again like you were in some

2964
02:08:53,681 --> 02:08:58,681
sort of way in your lane minded attempt,
you're trying to push culture forward.

2965
02:08:58,811 --> 02:09:01,180
Yes,
and I think that is trying to solve a

2966
02:09:01,181 --> 02:09:01,600
problem.
Yeah.

2967
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:05,020
That's a common thread.
Even when we're looking at dealing with

2968
02:09:05,021 --> 02:09:08,230
international crisis's.
The reason why we're looking at those

2969
02:09:08,231 --> 02:09:10,510
crises is,
is we don't want them to blow up in our

2970
02:09:10,511 --> 02:09:13,330
face.
We want to push towards a better future

2971
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:16,120
is dangerous though because this is
where,

2972
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:20,290
um,
principles and understanding and

2973
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:22,420
understanding what the goal is.

2974
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:25,090
Philosophy is very important.
And I'll give you an example.

2975
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:28,690
You gotta be very careful of giving
people a pass and not saying you are,

2976
02:09:28,691 --> 02:09:31,750
but of giving people a pass in the
notion that they're trying to solve a

2977
02:09:31,751 --> 02:09:34,330
problem because the means don't justify
the ends.

2978
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:37,080
You have plenty of examples.
Uh,

2979
02:09:37,110 --> 02:09:38,620
I had an acting teacher one time.
He said,

2980
02:09:38,621 --> 02:09:41,230
if you're trying to play Hitler,
you're trying to play Stalin as an

2981
02:09:41,231 --> 02:09:42,820
actor.
You can't play him as a monster.

2982
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:44,500
You've got to play him as a guy who's
trying to solve a problem.

2983
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:46,210
You know,
in Hitler's mind,

2984
02:09:46,211 --> 02:09:49,510
in his twisted mind,
he was trying to solve a problem.

2985
02:09:49,511 --> 02:09:51,940
That problem was Jews,
Gypsies,

2986
02:09:51,970 --> 02:09:55,420
gays or anybody who wasn't quote Unquote
Arion.

2987
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:57,520
And he was going to make,
at the end of the day,

2988
02:09:57,521 --> 02:09:59,200
he's going to make the world a better
place.

2989
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:03,820
And that's where I think,
and this is where the real work comes

2990
02:10:03,821 --> 02:10:05,530
in.
That's where I think it's so important

2991
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:09,550
to be able to articulate for yourself
and for others why,

2992
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:15,150
why certain things are better,
certain ways of living,

2993
02:10:15,881 --> 02:10:18,760
certain beliefs,
certain practices.

2994
02:10:18,761 --> 02:10:19,540
My God,
Pr,

2995
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:22,990
cultural practice,
certain philosophies politically for

2996
02:10:22,991 --> 02:10:25,180
example,
are better for the greater good.

2997
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:28,720
Then is this over here?
And that's where people like Michael

2998
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:31,870
Shermer and Sam Harris are doing great
work.

2999
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:34,550
That's where those guys sit around and
they articulate

3000
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:39,530
for us things that we might intuitively
feel or they sway us in a better

3001
02:10:39,531 --> 02:10:44,270
direction when our emotion takes us in a
different direction.

3002
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:48,830
When our emotion says,
let's vote for trump because he's a guy

3003
02:10:48,831 --> 02:10:52,630
who at least is quote unquote getting
shit done or he's taken the chess and

3004
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:57,530
the toilet in the air and then the more
sober thinkers who spend time thinking

3005
02:10:57,531 --> 02:10:58,700
about this say,
hey bri,

3006
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:00,830
hey joe,
hey steve over there.

3007
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:03,200
Um,
I know you feel this way.

3008
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:04,760
Let me,
let me steer you over here and here's

3009
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:06,770
why.
Because we should be actually,

3010
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:08,660
it's not just about trying to solve the
problem,

3011
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:09,830
but let,
let's,

3012
02:11:09,831 --> 02:11:12,110
let's get to what we're really trying to
get to and here's what,

3013
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:16,280
there's also a lot going on.
We're like we talked about before,

3014
02:11:16,281 --> 02:11:20,930
people love to be on a team.
They love to associate with a group.

3015
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:23,210
We all do,
and that's why they were in that ugly

3016
02:11:23,211 --> 02:11:25,490
hat.
That red hat with the white letters,

3017
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:27,260
keep ms,
make America great again,

3018
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:28,400
and that's not,
that's a,

3019
02:11:28,401 --> 02:11:30,170
that's a fuck you to everyone is
looking,

3020
02:11:30,171 --> 02:11:32,660
it's a bread feather.
It's on your,

3021
02:11:32,661 --> 02:11:35,380
a bright red peacock feather that's on
your head and you're,

3022
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:38,330
it's,
you're also like other assholes,

3023
02:11:38,331 --> 02:11:40,850
fellow assholes.
You see them and they honk at you and

3024
02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:44,240
they'll like make America great gun Bro.
And they'll pump their fist up.

3025
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:46,220
I mean,
this is a part of what's going on here.

3026
02:11:46,221 --> 02:11:48,470
It's not just a bunch of people that are
like,

3027
02:11:48,471 --> 02:11:49,820
look,
this system is fucked.

3028
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:51,770
The only way it's going to be fixed is
if it just,

3029
02:11:51,771 --> 02:11:53,300
the whole thing gets thrown into
turmoil.

3030
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:55,550
He's our best bet for that and I would
agree.

3031
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:57,620
He's our best bet for that.
He just is,

3032
02:11:57,860 --> 02:12:01,160
is as far as like upsetting the tray and
like going,

3033
02:12:01,161 --> 02:12:02,450
okay,
let's see what happens now.

3034
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:03,140
Well let's,
let's,

3035
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:04,820
let's fix some shit.
Obviously.

3036
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:06,290
How'd that guy get through?
Yeah,

3037
02:12:06,291 --> 02:12:09,740
like he's our best bet for that,
but man,

3038
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:12,440
it's,
it's dangerous.

3039
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:16,700
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous to to also cater to that

3040
02:12:16,701 --> 02:12:18,530
lowest common denominator

3041
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:22,300
earned in revolutions,
revolutions an even no matter how small,

3042
02:12:22,301 --> 02:12:24,790
the idea that you're going to take,
everything that's sort of settled,

3043
02:12:24,810 --> 02:12:28,670
it was there for a reason that sort of
became theirs.

3044
02:12:28,690 --> 02:12:33,490
There is an organic set point sometimes
to societies and when you come in and

3045
02:12:33,491 --> 02:12:36,040
somebody just throws everything out with
the bath water,

3046
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:40,450
it does historically have a good,
it typically doesn't have a good day.

3047
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:42,220
Does that mean maybe you can maybe can't
be,

3048
02:12:42,221 --> 02:12:43,970
it's possible they could engineer
correctly,

3049
02:12:43,971 --> 02:12:44,331
but the,
the,

3050
02:12:44,331 --> 02:12:48,560
the real issue is he doesn't like as a
spokesperson,

3051
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:51,450
he doesn't represent progress.
No.

3052
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:56,650
Like Obama represented substantial
progress over Bush as far as speaking as

3053
02:12:57,741 --> 02:13:00,350
far as his intelligence level has
articulation level.

3054
02:13:00,351 --> 02:13:03,380
His likeability is in that.
I would even argue his also,

3055
02:13:03,381 --> 02:13:06,980
his prudence is an inaction is he was
very careful.

3056
02:13:06,981 --> 02:13:09,680
He,
a lot of what we'll define Obama's

3057
02:13:09,681 --> 02:13:12,920
presidency I think,
and probably in a favorable light,

3058
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:16,850
is,
is the fact that he was not willing to

3059
02:13:16,851 --> 02:13:20,870
take action very often,
which is just as important sometimes as

3060
02:13:20,871 --> 02:13:24,890
taking action.
Do you think it's possible he could free

3061
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:28,910
Edward Snowden?
The could exonerate him before he leaves

3062
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:30,050
office?
I take heat for this,

3063
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:32,070
but personally I hope,
I

3064
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:33,960
hope he does.
Pardon him.

3065
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:36,540
You got to take heat from that.
Really?

3066
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:36,961
Yeah.
I mean,

3067
02:13:36,961 --> 02:13:39,360
a lot of people consider him a trader
and I think,

3068
02:13:39,361 --> 02:13:39,931
uh,
you know,

3069
02:13:39,931 --> 02:13:43,110
you hear a lot of this,
but I think Edward Snowden did us a

3070
02:13:43,111 --> 02:13:45,240
great service.
I think he's a very gutsy guy.

3071
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:47,670
He's a very,
he's an American of a patriot.

3072
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:50,070
I agree with it.
He was alerting us of a crime that

3073
02:13:50,071 --> 02:13:52,980
people that we elected,
we're engaging in and a lot of people

3074
02:13:52,981 --> 02:13:56,550
that we didn't elect a lot of people
that we're doing something that's

3075
02:13:56,551 --> 02:13:59,670
unconstitutional,
that's not approved and that the

3076
02:13:59,850 --> 02:14:02,490
citizens of the United States do not
want.

3077
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,230
But that's a good example of emotion.
Right?

3078
02:14:04,231 --> 02:14:07,650
That's a good example of people that get
very emotional at the idea that this guy

3079
02:14:07,651 --> 02:14:11,640
betrayed our intelligence agency,
our military and things like that.

3080
02:14:11,641 --> 02:14:12,600
So that's what they're saying.

3081
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:14,370
So that becomes team,
you know,

3082
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,050
Bill,
look at it in this perspective.

3083
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:18,600
They caught that fucking guy in New
York,

3084
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:21,150
the book the bomber within a couple of
days.

3085
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:27,060
Would they have been able to do that if
they did not have extensive surveillance

3086
02:14:27,061 --> 02:14:28,560
methods?
That's a good question.

3087
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:34,070
And is that worth the influence that
these these surveillance methods have on

3088
02:14:35,731 --> 02:14:38,910
us?
Like if you know that your phone's being

3089
02:14:38,911 --> 02:14:42,810
watched and that all those Dick pictures
that you send are all being collected

3090
02:14:42,811 --> 02:14:45,600
somewhere and then all those crazy texts
you sent about the government

3091
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:49,710
conspiracies are all being collected
somewhere and potentially could be used

3092
02:14:49,711 --> 02:14:51,390
against you if you run for office
somewhere.

3093
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:53,430
So if you decide to run for office and
he said,

3094
02:14:53,431 --> 02:14:55,680
you know what,
you know I love New York City is time.

3095
02:14:55,681 --> 02:14:58,160
New York City had a mayor that the
people understand I'm going to run for

3096
02:14:58,190 --> 02:14:58,600
years.

3097
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,270
I know I'm just an actor,
but I want to.

3098
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:02,010
And then all of sudden they pull you
into a room and say,

3099
02:15:02,011 --> 02:15:04,020
Hey Brian,
come over here.

3100
02:15:04,021 --> 02:15:05,730
We just,
we'd like to talk to you about some of

3101
02:15:05,731 --> 02:15:07,230
the emails that you've sent over the
years.

3102
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,760
I'll,
I'll answer that question with two with

3103
02:15:08,761 --> 02:15:10,200
two parts.
What does this one,

3104
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:12,180
sorry.
There's a new radio lab that's talking

3105
02:15:12,181 --> 02:15:13,100
about surveillance.
Yeah.

3106
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:14,970
Crazy.
Crazy stories in it.

3107
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:17,490
And they've done good stuff in that
Scott lab where they caught where they

3108
02:15:17,491 --> 02:15:20,280
caught the cartel members and stuff.
But I'll answer that two ways.

3109
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,800
One is if,
if surveillance is a reality and law

3110
02:15:25,801 --> 02:15:27,480
enforcement has to have some sort of
surveillance,

3111
02:15:27,481 --> 02:15:29,520
they do great work and they keep us
safe.

3112
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:31,980
However,
there are their history would suggest

3113
02:15:31,981 --> 02:15:35,220
two things.
One is that uh,

3114
02:15:37,230 --> 02:15:39,720
surveillance,
if you give the government power over

3115
02:15:39,721 --> 02:15:44,721
you in that context,
it's only going to grow unless you have

3116
02:15:44,821 --> 02:15:48,330
very strong checks,
balances and transparency.

3117
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:53,540
It is only going to grow.
And that has been the track record of

3118
02:15:53,851 --> 02:15:57,300
every government and that's just how
human beings are.

3119
02:15:57,680 --> 02:16:02,370
They are going to take the power they
feel is necessary and more so if you

3120
02:16:02,371 --> 02:16:05,940
give it to them.
So he was eisenhower leaving office that

3121
02:16:05,941 --> 02:16:09,090
the military industrial complex,
that crazy speech that he gave,

3122
02:16:09,091 --> 02:16:11,410
which was just like whoa.
It was precious.

3123
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:13,860
It wasn't,
it was so amazing because it was only

3124
02:16:13,861 --> 02:16:18,861
seen on television that one time and
then it took until it was made into vhs

3125
02:16:19,411 --> 02:16:23,700
or DVD or whatever and then leaked
online where people got a glimpse.

3126
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:27,570
I mean most people are not going over
former presidential speeches with a fine

3127
02:16:27,571 --> 02:16:29,470
tooth comb trying to find nuggets of
wisdom.

3128
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:33,070
But that one now has made its way into
the cultural zeitgeist.

3129
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:33,670
Sure.
Outcome.

3130
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:36,220
This really important.
You know,

3131
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:37,330
it was a,
it was a call,

3132
02:16:37,331 --> 02:16:38,500
it was called to the people.

3133
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:41,110
He's saying,
be careful because there's a machine out

3134
02:16:41,111 --> 02:16:42,610
there that wants to go to war.
Well,

3135
02:16:42,611 --> 02:16:47,440
be careful of this to the second part to
the idea that surveillance and uh,

3136
02:16:47,441 --> 02:16:48,430
is,
is,

3137
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:52,390
you know,
shouldn't be checked and Edward Snowden

3138
02:16:52,391 --> 02:16:53,650
should be,
is a trader.

3139
02:16:53,651 --> 02:16:57,700
Well,
well the fact is is that if the

3140
02:16:57,701 --> 02:17:02,260
government now has control over what I
say and if the government is listening

3141
02:17:02,261 --> 02:17:07,261
in without my consent and I'm a private
citizen who doesn't commit crimes,

3142
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:12,100
then I'm sorry,
but the terrorists have won.

3143
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:16,450
They won because they changed the way I
think and they changed the way my

3144
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:21,451
governor governs me and they have
created anonymity and a power structure

3145
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:26,470
that can do whatever the fuck they want
to its citizenry.

3146
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:30,130
That is UNAMERICAN,
that is anti-constitutional.

3147
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:33,160
That is not the country I want to live
in.

3148
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:36,790
It's not most importantly what makes
this country great.

3149
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:40,060
It is the opposite.
It is what Russia does and a lot of

3150
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:42,490
other countries,
so if you want a weaker country,

3151
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:47,350
ironically it is not to give government
agencies,

3152
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:51,340
I don't care who they are,
I don't care how well intentioned they

3153
02:17:51,341 --> 02:17:52,900
are and a lot of them are well
intentioned,

3154
02:17:52,901 --> 02:17:54,820
they do great work and they keep us
safe.

3155
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:58,780
You better have transparency and you
have better have checks and balances and

3156
02:17:58,781 --> 02:18:02,050
you better be following the law and you
better have court orders,

3157
02:18:02,290 --> 02:18:03,280
et Cetera,
et cetera.

3158
02:18:03,281 --> 02:18:06,190
I want all those systems in place.
I want,

3159
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:07,930
I'm in my,
and you know what,

3160
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:10,600
it might be cumbersome,
might be a pain in the ass.

3161
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:13,150
It might even make us a little less safe
sometimes,

3162
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:16,210
but I'll take it.
I'll fucking take that over.

3163
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:21,270
Giving any government agency power over
my private affairs and letting them

3164
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:23,710
listen in specifically.

3165
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:25,270
And then ultimately,
at the end of the day,

3166
02:18:25,271 --> 02:18:28,180
a big part of the problem is that
they're all just people like you,

3167
02:18:28,181 --> 02:18:29,620
really curious.
They're just people.

3168
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:34,390
You can really can't have people having
that kind of control and power over

3169
02:18:34,391 --> 02:18:36,280
other people.
Just as we talked about at the beginning

3170
02:18:36,281 --> 02:18:38,650
of the podcast,
that starts out about Greenpeace and

3171
02:18:38,651 --> 02:18:40,660
then after a,
it becomes about having power.

3172
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:44,680
I mean,
people love to have a position of

3173
02:18:44,681 --> 02:18:46,870
influence and power and they don't give
it up.

3174
02:18:46,871 --> 02:18:47,550
Use it.
Yeah.

3175
02:18:47,550 --> 02:18:49,240
When,
if that is your life,

3176
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:50,410
I mean,
that is what you do.

3177
02:18:50,530 --> 02:18:53,770
I'm a cop.
I'm a police officer and I'm the law in

3178
02:18:53,771 --> 02:18:54,850
this town.
I mean,

3179
02:18:54,851 --> 02:18:56,020
Pete,
we love those movies.

3180
02:18:56,350 --> 02:18:57,220
Um,
the law,

3181
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:59,400
you know,
that kind of craziness is,

3182
02:18:59,401 --> 02:19:01,060
it's,
it's human toxic hating.

3183
02:19:01,061 --> 02:19:02,440
People always say,
oh the cops and said like,

3184
02:19:02,441 --> 02:19:03,460
look,
there are a lot of great,

3185
02:19:03,461 --> 02:19:04,860
like we said.
I mean they were,

3186
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,900
were people is people stop saying,
yeah,

3187
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:08,590
it's just people.
So what's the solution?

3188
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:09,670
How do you,
how do you,

3189
02:19:09,690 --> 02:19:12,010
I mean the solution was fee.
Well the solution,

3190
02:19:12,011 --> 02:19:14,080
if you,
if you read the constitution,

3191
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:16,960
you start with the federalist papers and
read the Constitution and the bill of

3192
02:19:16,961 --> 02:19:18,850
rights,
that's the solution.

3193
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:21,120
That's what makes our country great.
Again.

3194
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:22,540
I know I get,
so I'm,

3195
02:19:22,541 --> 02:19:25,630
I'm and I like to like,
I like to point this out and that that

3196
02:19:25,631 --> 02:19:27,130
is,
they solve the political,

3197
02:19:27,630 --> 02:19:28,010
if our

3198
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,230
founding fathers that that's,
that's the solution.

3199
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:32,210
Yes.
New Challenges.

3200
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:34,250
Yes.
This is complicated men.

3201
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:36,110
Yes,
we do need surveillance.

3202
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:39,170
Yes,
technology is making it so that they can

3203
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:43,250
listen in on all that,
but it's also making them transparent.

3204
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:47,510
They're getting dusted left and right as
people from our generation are slowly

3205
02:19:47,511 --> 02:19:49,810
starting to get into office.
And there's,

3206
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:53,300
there's more of that to people who grew
up and have the internet when they were

3207
02:19:53,301 --> 02:19:57,320
younger and it helped form their,
their understanding of the world in a

3208
02:19:57,321 --> 02:20:01,190
better way.
And it also explained to them the nature

3209
02:20:01,191 --> 02:20:03,260
of transparency.
Like you're seeing this guy who was a

3210
02:20:03,261 --> 02:20:07,250
hillary Clinton's email deleter they
found his account on reddit and he was

3211
02:20:07,251 --> 02:20:10,010
asking a couple of years ago how to
delete emails,

3212
02:20:10,011 --> 02:20:11,000
chains,
mass.

3213
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:12,830
Yeah.
I mean it's total smoking gun.

3214
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:15,740
Damn.
They found it and then he deleted the

3215
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:20,960
reddit post after they found it because
he had had a certain reddit handle and

3216
02:20:21,081 --> 02:20:23,210
they could see,
they could bring that reddit handle,

3217
02:20:23,211 --> 02:20:24,410
they could connect it back to him.

3218
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:27,020
Yeah.
That a lot of that I suspect is,

3219
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:30,020
is,
is hillary not wanting people to see

3220
02:20:30,021 --> 02:20:31,970
that.
She was talking about how this was an

3221
02:20:31,971 --> 02:20:35,240
Islamic fundamentalist movement that
began Bengazi stuff.

3222
02:20:35,241 --> 02:20:36,500
Like there's a lot,
you know,

3223
02:20:36,501 --> 02:20:39,200
that they,
the Obama administration has this

3224
02:20:39,201 --> 02:20:42,890
strange edict and where they don't
really mention that it's Islamic

3225
02:20:42,891 --> 02:20:45,770
terrorism.
They mentioned that it's extremism.

3226
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:46,820
Well,
how about Orlando?

3227
02:20:46,850 --> 02:20:49,160
They literally cut it out of the
transcripts.

3228
02:20:49,161 --> 02:20:52,940
The things that the shooter was saying,
they'd cut mentions to Islam and

3229
02:20:53,970 --> 02:20:56,370
[inaudible] were living.
So we live in where,

3230
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:57,470
yeah,
you're lying.

3231
02:20:57,930 --> 02:20:59,760
That's not helping anybody not helping
any.

3232
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:03,680
The fact of the matter is these people
are Islamic fundamentalists and you're

3233
02:21:03,681 --> 02:21:06,950
just gonna make things worse.
If you don't acknowledge that fact,

3234
02:21:06,951 --> 02:21:08,690
you're just going to deny people
information.

3235
02:21:08,691 --> 02:21:10,370
They're going to think there's some sort
of conspiracy.

3236
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:11,360
They're going to get angry.

3237
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:13,250
They're going to feel like they're not
being represented properly.

3238
02:21:13,251 --> 02:21:16,340
They're going to think these liberal
pussies are fucking ruining our great

3239
02:21:16,341 --> 02:21:18,560
country,
and it's going to build up Donald Trump.

3240
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:20,500
That's where a guy like Donald Trump
comes from.

3241
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:24,500
The over the over sensitivity of the
left is what's created Donald Trump.

3242
02:21:24,590 --> 02:21:27,680
The acceptance of Caitlyn Jenner created
Donald Trump.

3243
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:32,510
This is Caitlyn Jenner is the prime.
If you got to go back to Caitlyn Jenner,

3244
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:34,460
you gotta go back to Bruce Jenner first,
right?

3245
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:36,890
And that goes just tiny,
tiny little nose.

3246
02:21:36,891 --> 02:21:37,251
He got,
well,

3247
02:21:37,251 --> 02:21:38,360
how about the jaw?
He goes,

3248
02:21:38,361 --> 02:21:40,610
jaw shave down.
He's such a good looking man and is

3249
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:41,810
facing a rubber,
you know,

3250
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:43,490
its face doesn't move.
He can't talk.

3251
02:21:43,491 --> 02:21:44,181
Right.
It's crazy.

3252
02:21:44,181 --> 02:21:48,200
And we're supposed to ignore the fact
that he irresponsibly plowed into a

3253
02:21:48,201 --> 02:21:51,020
woman and pushed her into fucking
traffic and killed her.

3254
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,570
Was he on his phone?
It was not paying attention.

3255
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:57,080
He rear ended with a truck,
a giant escalate that was pulling a

3256
02:21:57,081 --> 02:21:58,970
boat.
So he had all this weight,

3257
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:01,190
right.
He slams in this woman's car,

3258
02:22:01,191 --> 02:22:05,390
pushes her into traffic and she gets hit
by an oncoming car and you know,

3259
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:06,860
we're supposed to be like,
listen,

3260
02:22:06,930 --> 02:22:09,500
diversity is what's important here and
not a woman's life.

3261
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:11,800
What's important here?
The My,

3262
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,280
exactly.
Anyways,

3263
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,250
it just drops it.
Everybody drops an exonerates him.

3264
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:18,680
And I'm not saying she should be
punished forever being careless,

3265
02:22:18,830 --> 02:22:22,340
but I'm saying that's a significant
indicator of someone having a fucked up

3266
02:22:22,341 --> 02:22:25,440
personality that all you want to do and
these these talks,

3267
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,070
you talking

3268
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,070
about gender and yourself,
you fucking killed somebody in traffic,

3269
02:22:29,071 --> 02:22:30,300
man.
You should be,

3270
02:22:30,301 --> 02:22:33,930
you should be talking about that life
changing moment all the time.

3271
02:22:34,050 --> 02:22:34,800
And I say,
man,

3272
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:35,790
you know,
like dude,

3273
02:22:35,890 --> 02:22:37,350
like you could say,
Hey guy,

3274
02:22:37,550 --> 02:22:38,850
you can't say that to a girl.
Kenya,

3275
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:41,460
she killed someone.
Fucking God damn it.

3276
02:22:41,461 --> 02:22:43,590
I'm tired of doing that.
I'm tired of this.

3277
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:45,820
He,
she switcheroo well I haven't.

3278
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:48,120
You got one for life.
You'll fuck wait,

3279
02:22:48,121 --> 02:22:48,910
what a bank.
Well,

3280
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:51,240
can I ask you a question?
You're 30 you have to make a choice,

3281
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:53,050
right?
Hey,

3282
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:56,250
what are you in Guinea Pool?
You could be whatever the fuck you want

3283
02:22:56,251 --> 02:22:58,860
up until 30 once you hit 30 you got to
shit or get off the pot.

3284
02:22:58,890 --> 02:22:59,820
Who are you?
Can I,

3285
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,650
what is his dwarf?
Tiny people is midget dwarf.

3286
02:23:04,651 --> 02:23:06,490
Both of those are bad words.
I can't just say dwarfing.

3287
02:23:07,410 --> 02:23:08,490
The seven dwarfs.
Midget.

3288
02:23:08,491 --> 02:23:11,460
You can't say dwarf ism is an actual
disease.

3289
02:23:11,461 --> 02:23:14,790
So I can't call someone a dwarf.
I think they all prefer a little people.

3290
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:16,111
You know?
Again,

3291
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:19,530
we have too many fucking labels.
There's too many labels attached to

3292
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:20,310
anything.
A jail.

3293
02:23:20,310 --> 02:23:22,020
Don't do it.
Don't do dwarf jokes.

3294
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:25,380
Handsome and tall,
and you have white privilege.

3295
02:23:25,410 --> 02:23:27,540
I don't want to make fun of anybody
who's anybody.

3296
02:23:27,541 --> 02:23:27,940
I don't,
I,

3297
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:30,120
I never shop on that.
It's important to make fun of people.

3298
02:23:30,121 --> 02:23:33,580
They need to know the ridiculous,
but only if it's like their behavior.

3299
02:23:33,610 --> 02:23:34,320
Yes.
You know,

3300
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:36,600
south their genetics and especially not
dwarfism.

3301
02:23:36,601 --> 02:23:38,460
That's a motherfucker,
you know,

3302
02:23:38,490 --> 02:23:40,410
I'm only like a foot away from poor
fism.

3303
02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:42,600
There's several people that are foot
taller than me.

3304
02:23:42,601 --> 02:23:44,700
I'm five,
eight to six foot eight.

3305
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:47,010
A lot of people out there,
if I was a foot shorter,

3306
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:48,030
yeah,
I'm a dwarf.

3307
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:50,410
I walk around with Brennan Shop.
I feel like a doorframe.

3308
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:52,140
No,
and I feel like an old guy and you know,

3309
02:23:52,210 --> 02:23:56,010
it hurts my feelings because women look
at him and I could be a cup of coffee a

3310
02:23:56,011 --> 02:23:57,760
lot of times.
A Cup of coffee's nice.

3311
02:23:57,950 --> 02:23:59,910
It'll be a spore.
I like a cup of coffee.

3312
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:01,350
I'm like a mushroom.
He's holding.

3313
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:02,940
I'm like a potted plant.
He's holding it.

3314
02:24:02,941 --> 02:24:05,600
He's walking down and they could give a
fuck about the potted plant tape.

3315
02:24:05,601 --> 02:24:07,220
Folks would be kind of cute.
It says a cup.

3316
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:09,460
Let it go.
Tait Fletcher says a cup of coffee's

3317
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:11,430
like a warm hug.
You're going to let it go.

3318
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:12,870
Look,
there's a lot of people that never got

3319
02:24:12,871 --> 02:24:13,730
to be handsome.
God,

3320
02:24:13,731 --> 02:24:15,600
you're handsome for a long time.
I sure it was.

3321
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:17,520
I'm still kind of all right.
You're all right.

3322
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:18,431
I mean,
look it,

3323
02:24:18,431 --> 02:24:18,660
man.

3324
02:24:18,660 --> 02:24:20,190
You're funny.
You're funny guy.

3325
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:22,710
I got a great mind.
He went to him.

3326
02:24:22,711 --> 02:24:23,700
Yeah,
you're really fun to hang out.

3327
02:24:23,701 --> 02:24:25,560
I like going camping with you.
Uh,

3328
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:26,910
we got to do another hunting trip,
dude.

3329
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:29,250
We do last one.
Last one was bull ring.

3330
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:31,590
I haven't shot,
my vote wasn't boring.

3331
02:24:31,591 --> 02:24:32,880
I had a great time,
but not as good.

3332
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:33,700
Come on,
man.

3333
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:36,120
Gotta I gotta bring you,
but you've got to learn how to shoot a

3334
02:24:36,121 --> 02:24:37,730
bow and Arrow or we'll have to go use
it.

3335
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:40,290
We'll use rifles.
How about this?

3336
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:42,960
How about next hunting trip?
I'll go with you and I won't even shoot

3337
02:24:42,961 --> 02:24:46,680
anything because last couple of them
you've been unsuccessful.

3338
02:24:46,770 --> 02:24:48,830
I'll go and just be your backup.
Listen,

3339
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:53,400
we are your ammunition corridor.
I'll be a porter.

3340
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:55,530
I would like to,
I like the whole day.

3341
02:24:55,531 --> 02:24:58,510
A umbrella would be entire show,
like P diddy's assistant.

3342
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,190
I would be a fun,
that would be a fun show if fantastic.

3343
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:04,920
My Book Cook Cause it would make us some
tea,

3344
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:08,430
some tea and biscuits.
It's four o'clock in the afternoon and

3345
02:25:08,431 --> 02:25:10,950
it would be fair because I shot that
Turkey and then you got nothing,

3346
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:14,070
you know.
And we before that we just got skunked

3347
02:25:14,071 --> 02:25:15,630
on that island.
Outrageous.

3348
02:25:15,631 --> 02:25:17,590
It's soaking wet for six days.
And Ella,

3349
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:19,760
let's go.
We needed another a hunting trail.

3350
02:25:20,220 --> 02:25:21,630
I love doing them.
Let's do it.

3351
02:25:21,770 --> 02:25:23,800
Alright,
I'm bringing on James Kingston.

3352
02:25:23,801 --> 02:25:25,680
Now we're going to do another podcast
and a couple of minutes.

3353
02:25:25,681 --> 02:25:27,500
You gonna stick around for a few minutes
to talk to this guy.

3354
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:28,900
He's got to run.
Daddy's got to go.

3355
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:31,780
James Kingston,
who's the guy who's crazy gets on top of

3356
02:25:31,781 --> 02:25:34,360
buildings,
was Gopros and shit makes you shit your

3357
02:25:34,361 --> 02:25:36,400
pants.
He's on his way.

3358
02:25:36,401 --> 02:25:39,540
Brian can come see me at the auto focus
of nature.

3359
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:43,030
You're an American tradition and
American comedian,

3360
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:44,140
Ottawa,
Ottawa,

3361
02:25:44,141 --> 02:25:47,020
algonquin.
September 30th one of God's gifts.

3362
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:49,270
Go see him.
God Damn hilarious.

3363
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:51,810
Okay.
