1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,720
If I was a young man,

3
00:00:02,721 --> 00:00:03,381
I've got an argument.

4
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:03,860
Someone,

5
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,860
I would relive that argument like every
day for like 10 minutes for like a year.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,610
Maybe I'll come back to it a year later.

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,060
Yes.

8
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,651
Fucking God.

9
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:12,240
I should have told that.

10
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,420
Fuck Shit.

11
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,930
Oh fuck you mister.

12
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,160
You have to like go through your notes.

13
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,150
Like what was I going to say to him?

14
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,691
Oh yeah,

15
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:19,880
I was going to say that I used
to talk about this on stage.

16
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:20,714
This is totally true.

17
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,441
When I was a,

18
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,760
I guess I was like 26,

19
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,691
I live,

20
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,290
I was living in Encino and I rented this
house and it had an orange tree in the

21
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,020
front yard and I didn't pay my bills.

22
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:29,990
It's very irresponsible.

23
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:30,950
So this guy came over,

24
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,310
uh,

25
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,970
I had turned the power back on and the
guy came over to turn the power on and it

26
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:35,700
seemed like a nice guy.

27
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:35,931
I said,

28
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:36,390
hey man,

29
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:36,481
uh,

30
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,580
those oranges a delicious,

31
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:38,570
if you want me to go grab one.

32
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,591
And he goes,

33
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:39,921
okay,

34
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:40,400
thanks.

35
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,400
So the guy took nine fucking oranges
and I sat there watching them like this

36
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,413
motherfucker,

37
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,810
it's taken more orange.

38
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,280
I can't believe this shit.

39
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,200
And to this day,

40
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:51,680
man,

41
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,050
I have to fight off urge.

42
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,511
No,

43
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:53,721
no,

44
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:53,901
no,

45
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:54,081
no,

46
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:54,270
no.

47
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,103
Not that story.

48
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,480
Three times a day it's real.

49
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,373
Like I was an asshole.

50
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,940
To this day I'll be in my car and I'm
driving down the street and I'll just go

51
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,800
nine fucking oranges do.

52
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,790
Really?

53
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,770
That was 1993

54
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,570
did I tell you the story that the loan
told me that I tell it on this podcast?

55
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,433
No.

56
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,200
Shit like this never happens.

57
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,620
Me and pivot one time flew to,

58
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,710
we're going to fight to a Mayweather
fight and we get on the plane and fucking

59
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,090
Stallone is waiting.

60
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:27,924
[inaudible]

61
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,403
come on.

62
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,780
I guess we're going to
a fight with Stallone.

63
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,190
It's great thing about Stallone.

64
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,260
He knows what his good stories,

65
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:36,890
ours.

66
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,071
He,

67
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:37,521
you know what I mean?

68
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:39,500
He like knows what people
want to hear about.

69
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,580
They want to hear about rocky.

70
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,840
They wanna hear about fucking,

71
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:42,351
they want to hear what,

72
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:46,280
so he's talking about he was
directing the movie staying alive.

73
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,350
Oh,

74
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,780
uh,

75
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,020
yeah,

76
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,531
I remember that.

77
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:48,721
Yeah,

78
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,071
he was,

79
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:50,510
and it was a Travolta movie that,

80
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,850
that Frank Stallone
sang on the soundtrack.

81
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:53,684
That is correct.

82
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,853
Um,

83
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,230
so yes.

84
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,750
So Stallone said that he,

85
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:00,584
he goes,

86
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,341
he goes,

87
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,030
so I,

88
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,970
I called John Up to the
house for a meeting,

89
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,470
but then get that song,

90
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,960
play that song while the is going on.

91
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,640
He goes,

92
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,331
frank Stallone,

93
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:10,230
this is the end,

94
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,951
I think it's called.

95
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:11,784
This is the end,

96
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,800
and staying alive.

97
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,023
He goes,

98
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,421
he goes,

99
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:17,280
so John came up and he goes,

100
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:18,900
John's got a real food issue.

101
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,210
People don't know that.

102
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,383
And he goes,

103
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,561
he goes,

104
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,371
John comes up,

105
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,540
we're sitting at a table and he goes,

106
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,111
now,

107
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,820
my wife had made some
homemade fudge that day.

108
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,740
So we sit at the table,

109
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,010
my wife puts out some fudge Travolta
proceeds to eat the entire plate of fun.

110
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh yeah,

111
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,500
this fucking guy obey.

112
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,541
He goes,

113
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,860
which first of all,

114
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,330
his fucking route,

115
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,330
which is fucking made
me laugh my head off.

116
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,410
And that was like that.

117
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,760
He hasn't forgotten that he,

118
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,960
that's his orange story.

119
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,381
Does it,

120
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:51,680
was that,

121
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,500
is that dangerous when you have a
situation like that and you know,

122
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,300
your guy is going to face him?

123
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,381
Is that,

124
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:58,340
is it dangerous?

125
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,203
Is in any,

126
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,070
like to have

127
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,580
that attitude to go into a Dick
Glover doesn't have that attitude.

128
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:04,060
Right?

129
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,450
He doesn't,

130
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:04,780
I mean,

131
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,620
as much as he likes him,

132
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,580
he's there to do the job

133
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,210
was a glove,

134
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:08,541
was there,

135
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,500
did Java and clover.

136
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:13,190
It didn't have the closeness
that we did to him cause he came,

137
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,420
uh,

138
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,420
Kyle came around more when a
Glover was on his hiatus to Brazil.

139
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,770
So he didn't have quite the closest.

140
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,900
He really liked him.

141
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,360
But I mean the,

142
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,440
the MMA spirit,

143
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,513
um,

144
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,520
and I'll take out an m the maa spirit,

145
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,533
martial arts,

146
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,560
um,

147
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,930
is just so different than boxing,

148
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:36,411
which is,

149
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:36,651
I mean,

150
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:37,910
technically a martial art too,

151
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,890
but they just don't carry themselves.

152
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:40,724
Most of them,

153
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,690
like martial artists,

154
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,050
they carry themselves like
more like thugs or just,

155
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,140
they don't have the same comradery.

156
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,333
I mean,

157
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,540
I have a picture of us,

158
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,741
Siler,

159
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:52,580
of his fight in,

160
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:53,414
um,

161
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,291
in Kentucky.

162
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:54,710
I didn't even know,

163
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,880
I forgot the guy's name.

164
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,590
Really tough strong wrestler.

165
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,970
Um,

166
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,410
he lost a close decision.

167
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:01,340
It was his last fight.

168
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,203
Um,

169
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,490
but they were actually the day
before the fight at the Wayne.

170
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,563
Um,

171
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,231
they were,

172
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,810
they were hanging out
playing video games together,

173
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:13,190
like huddle together.

174
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,481
And I was,

175
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,310
and I didn't know who
that guy was at first.

176
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:16,911
And I walked over,

177
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:17,091
hey,

178
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:17,750
what's up man?

179
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,291
What's your name?

180
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:18,651
And he's like,

181
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,484
so and so I go,

182
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,830
aren't you guys fighting tomorrow?

183
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:22,190
And they go,

184
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,371
yeah,

185
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:22,581
yeah,

186
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:22,881
coach,

187
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:23,780
we just gotta hold up.

188
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:24,620
We got to finish this game.

189
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:27,500
And they hung out for like
two hours at the way in.

190
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,940
And then the day of the fight,

191
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:32,570
they were like hanging out in the dressing
room and then they went out and put

192
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,620
on a brutal,

193
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:33,831
I mean,

194
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:35,090
it was a very brutal fight.

195
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,030
It was a good fight and it was a brutal,

196
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,350
they didn't hold back anything.

197
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,310
They definitely fought.

198
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,431
Yeah.

199
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:41,480
It was Dennis Bermudez,

200
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,770
who's a great guy as well.

201
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:42,960
Yeah,

202
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,450
he's,

203
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,660
and I mean,

204
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:45,770
and that's the comradery.

205
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:48,260
You don't see that in boxing and MMA.

206
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,640
You see it more than you don't?

207
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,350
What do you think about bitcoin?

208
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:51,720
What

209
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,200
do you think about crypto currencies?

210
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,370
What do you think about emerging?

211
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:55,871
Look,

212
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,010
there are a lot of people,

213
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,090
um,

214
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,150
that are libertarian or some
people that believe in hard money.

215
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,580
There are people that
believe in gold that,

216
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:03,414
that are in bitcoin.

217
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,050
And you know,

218
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,690
I think that,

219
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,030
you know,

220
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,050
a lot of people who,

221
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,620
you know,

222
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,750
bought bitcoin a few
years ago and you know,

223
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:11,710
I didn't buy it and sure.

224
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:11,921
You know,

225
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:14,410
I wish I had bought them because
I would be selling them now.

226
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:14,651
In fact,

227
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:15,580
I would have already sold them,

228
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,630
so I dumped it already.

229
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,480
Oh yeah.

230
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,100
Why is that?

231
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,851
Because I think it's,

232
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,690
I think it's a bubble.

233
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:20,201
I think that,

234
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:25,180
I think that between the here with Vegas
casinos to casinos just start accepting

235
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:25,870
bitcoins.

236
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,051
Yeah.

237
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:26,884
But you know,

238
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,270
I think merchants starting to accept
bitcoins are actually going to be negative

239
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,710
for Bitcoin's not positive.

240
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,550
Why is that?

241
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:33,701
Well,

242
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,250
here's why.

243
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,900
You know,

244
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,350
when bitcoins went up from
Penny's a coin to $1,000,

245
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:38,860
right.

246
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,710
Do you know you,

247
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,420
you really couldn't do much with them
except whoredom so close before you go

248
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,820
there,

249
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,653
I'm sorry,

250
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,731
sorry to interrupt you,

251
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,920
but explain to me what
is it actually worth?

252
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,100
What is a bitcoin is worth whatever
somebody will give you for it.

253
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,740
I mean it has no actual value because
you can't do anything with it.

254
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,100
Okay.

255
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,660
All you can do is give
it to somebody else.

256
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,190
So is it in ones,

257
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,470
it means it in one bitcoin to bitcoins.

258
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,950
Is the volume.

259
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,431
What is the,

260
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:01,700
uh,

261
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,710
they usually sell them in one bitcoin,

262
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,430
but you can pay,

263
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,120
you can break a bitcoin up into
like a hundred thousand peaks of it.

264
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,740
Give me how much is a pizza?

265
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,300
How many bitcoins is a pizza?

266
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,960
Well,

267
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,770
a fraction because right now and in fire,

268
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,100
well an entire bitcoin right now is what?

269
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,180
$950.

270
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:18,800
So how many pizzas you can get?

271
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,290
A pizza is like $9 50 cents and
you get laid a hundred pizza.

272
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,890
They don't have any other
thing other than a bitcoin.

273
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,480
That's it.

274
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,410
It's just a bitcoin.

275
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,830
Well,

276
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,071
I mean,

277
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,210
you can get bitcoin.

278
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,080
I mean you can get,

279
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,380
you know,

280
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,250
fractional coins.

281
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,390
You don't have to buy a whole coin.

282
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,510
Yeah,

283
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,530
but they need to figure it out.

284
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,150
You have to have like Nicole quarter.

285
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:32,841
No,

286
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,690
it's just bitcoin.

287
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,250
You get dollar $10 a deck,

288
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:35,790
a deck.

289
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,980
A coin is sent a coin.

290
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,170
I don't know what it's the
exact opposite of pesos,

291
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,430
like a million pesos.

292
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,510
But the important thing is that
you can't do anything with it.

293
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,261
You know,

294
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,930
there's no actual value with
you can buy drugs right now.

295
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,460
Right?

296
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,120
Well silkroad yes,

297
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:50,511
but you,

298
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,210
you can spend it as long as
somebody is willing to take it.

299
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,720
Right.

300
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,070
But there's no end user.

301
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:55,461
There's no,

302
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,390
it's not a commodity.

303
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,310
The same with our currency.

304
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:00,170
Currently our currency is crap.

305
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:00,331
I mean,

306
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:00,580
I'm not,

307
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,670
you know why bitcoin is
crap in our currency is the
difference between the crap,

308
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:08,750
the government issues and bitcoins is
the crap the government issues for now as

309
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,584
legal tender.

310
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,071
I can,

311
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:10,251
you know,

312
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,120
people will accept it.

313
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,410
I can pay my taxes in it.

314
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:12,591
I mean,

315
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,580
I have a use for it.

316
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:13,851
Right.

317
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,830
But it's the government's.

318
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:18,240
It's saying it's legal tender isn't the
government enforcing being someone who's

319
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,430
so antigovernment as you,

320
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,930
I would assume that that's why own gold,

321
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,260
but you would enjoy something
like bitcoin coming along,

322
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,980
but it has no real value.

323
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,690
I recognize that it could collapse.

324
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:26,931
I don't,

325
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,670
there's no a value.

326
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:29,421
Isn't there a value?

327
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,430
Just like we do tomorrow?

328
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,050
Everybody can agree there's no value.

329
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,083
See,

330
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,010
gold was valuable long
before it became money.

331
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,860
Bitcoin had no value
until it became money,

332
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,830
but I don't think it can
withstand the test of time.

333
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,160
Okay.
