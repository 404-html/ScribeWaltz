1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,640
It's one of most common traits,

3
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,451
much humans,

4
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:04,110
man,

5
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,230
I have a really tough time and there
are some really cool people down here,

6
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,180
but I have a lot of trouble with LMN.

7
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,090
You should.

8
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,310
San Cisco is superior.

9
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,061
Well,

10
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,070
I think everybody in San
Francisco has Asperger's,

11
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:15,270
so they'd just say what's on their mind,

12
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:16,470
whether it's appropriate or not.

13
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,640
So,

14
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,730
which is is really refreshing
but can be frustrating.

15
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,460
But the converse in la,

16
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:23,731
man,

17
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:24,630
it's like Jesus,

18
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:28,050
like how many layers to this onion of a
person to have to peel back to know what

19
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:29,460
the fuck you're actually
trying to say to me.

20
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:29,911
Yes,

21
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,140
that is a huge issue.

22
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:33,600
And it's an issue because of
the entertainment industry.

23
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,230
The entertainment industry fosters
bullshit because you have to pretend to be

24
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,060
something a unique and different.

25
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,660
And meanwhile you're just another fucking
person who's going to pretend to be a

26
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:46,070
killer in a movie or pretend to
be a princess or pretend to be at.

27
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,120
You're pretending you're faking it.

28
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,150
So like you to be the best at it,

29
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,200
you have to be fake.

30
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,850
You have to be a big fake person.

31
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,743
Good at lying.

32
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,820
It's really bananas.

33
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,260
And not only that,

34
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,660
you start to embody this.

35
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:00,991
Look,

36
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:01,260
look,

37
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,280
here's a perfect example.

38
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
Sean Penn is a brilliant actor.

39
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,760
He's very good at that.

40
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,490
Most likely because Sean
Penn is fucking crazy.

41
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,533
Okay?

42
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,940
And Chris Rock was hosting the Academy
Awards once and he was making fun of Jude

43
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,740
law about how Jude law's and everything.

44
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,221
What have we got?

45
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:17,431
Damn.

46
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:18,590
Can I see move without Jude luck?

47
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,553
It was pretty funny.

48
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,453
It was just joking.

49
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,210
It's a subject because Jude law is
very prolific and he's excellent.

50
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,680
So He's used it a lot of movies.

51
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,800
So fucking Sean Penn takes the
microphone afterwards and says,

52
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,860
Jude loves and all these movies
because he's an amazing actor.

53
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,611
I'm like,

54
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:32,911
okay,

55
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,410
I want to beat you to death.

56
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,290
I want to beat you to death for,

57
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,390
for getting literal about a fucking
Chris rock joke about a prolific actor.

58
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,070
Jesus Christ.

59
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,460
You fucking pretentious cock sucker.

60
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,580
Did you really say that
you have friends at all?

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,290
Do you have anybody that busts your balls?

62
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,981
Do you know?

63
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,981
They take himself so God damn seriously
and there were donkeys plus award show

64
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:58,920
wherever.

65
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,360
Where's I'll monkey suit.

66
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:00,900
You were,

67
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,110
oh,

68
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,620
we're all gonna agree to wear the same
stupid outfit that we never were for

69
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,850
being comfortable in real.

70
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,301
Yeah.

71
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,470
Why don't you put a bow tie on?

72
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,800
You can't put me there
with a white shirt and oh,

73
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:11,880
buttoned up jacket.

74
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,020
Are you guys rich?

75
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,730
Can you address any way the fuck you want?

76
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,170
Why is everybody dressing the same?

77
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,561
Oh,

78
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,910
were elegant this evening.

79
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,151
Why?

80
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,740
We have traditional attire on,

81
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,530
I just want to say that
Jude Law's an amazing actor.

82
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,011
Yes.

83
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:23,221
Here,

84
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:23,790
here.

85
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,720
Let's go back to being pretentious to
Chris rock actually exposed some reality.

86
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,220
Did he make fun of something?

87
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,821
No,

88
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,200
we have no room for that here.

89
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,760
We're helping the world,

90
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:34,230
but providing the arts.

91
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,030
You fucking Twat.

92
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,740
I want to punch you right
in your stupid face.

93
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,140
He plays but like tough guys and movies.

94
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,160
We fucking like,

95
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,240
this movie is pretty good.

96
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,800
It plays a Mickey Cohen and this,

97
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:44,041
uh,

98
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,470
this new gangster squad movie fun movie.

99
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:47,520
It looks like Horse Shit.

100
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,020
Sean Penn's very good at that,

101
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:51,480
but most likely he's good at
that because he's fucking crazy.

102
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,260
Which is why you had to explain
a joke during the Academy Awards.

103
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,430
What a fucking brilliant world renounced
standup comedian as the host of the

104
00:02:59,431 --> 00:02:59,770
award.

105
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,320
Holy Shit to do a comedian make a joke.

106
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,820
Oh No,

107
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,271
stop.

108
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,360
Let me explain what's
great you're making here.

109
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,530
I think in the same academy awards it
was when Chris Rock was talking about 50

110
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,940
cent and said this guy's
had dealt with everything.

111
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,240
He took more gunshots to the face than
Jenna Jamison and they were both in the

112
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,074
audience.

113
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,970
Nobody got up and defended Jenna Jamison.

114
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,050
I was very offended.

115
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,830
You're allowed.

116
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,940
You're allowed to say that.

117
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,451
Yeah,

118
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,560
you're allowed to say that,

119
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,940
but that's a free target.

120
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,820
I make fun of Jude Law Cause
he's a brilliant actor.

121
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,000
So she's butchered laws in a lot of
films cause he's a brilliant doctor.

122
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,840
I just wanted to say,

123
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,970
I just want her to
straighten everybody out.

124
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,530
I wanted to exercise my ego about some
shit that happened earlier that I thought

125
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,640
was unjust.

126
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,630
Are you making fun of June law during
our special day when we were a monkey?

127
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:47,464
Suits.

128
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,430
Fuck choke you like this one hand.

129
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,903
Are you going to,

130
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,350
Oh,

131
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,200
you'd do the scent of a woman
like ranger choke on the boy.

132
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,700
I wouldn't even use my elbow.

133
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:02,701
I wouldn't even have to just grab him
like a dove rocky like a little rant.

134
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,060
Hold on tight

135
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,221
shut.

136
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:11,221
It just pretentiousness is
really intolerable and it
shouldn't be tolerated in

137
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,140
your friends and it shouldn't be
tolerated in celebrities either.

138
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,160
That's nonsense.

139
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,600
That kind of stuff is nonsense.

140
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,490
You're talking about acting cunt face.

141
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,121
Okay.

142
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,380
You're not saving the world.

143
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,030
You're not time traveling.

144
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,950
You didn't invent a nuclear weapon.

145
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,820
Okay.

146
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,600
You not needing to develop faster and
enter in and either it's not like you came

147
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,440
up with five g,

148
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,380
you pretended to be a gangster and
a movie and you were good at it.

149
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,070
Thank you.

150
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,511
Thanks for it.

151
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:36,190
Did entertain the main distracting me
for an hour and a half cause that's all

152
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,024
the fuck you did.

153
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,810
Okay.

154
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:37,990
You,

155
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,800
you made me sit down and I enjoyed your
performance and it made me not think

156
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,750
about my life and I got
some thrills out of it.

157
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,240
It was very exciting and
enjoyable to follow along.

158
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,670
That's all you did.

159
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,420
Okay.

160
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,160
He didn't fucking change the world.

161
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,150
You're not awesome.

162
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,590
You're guy who's good at pretending.

163
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,130
Fuckheads drives me nuts.

164
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,520
It drives me nuts and that is the one
thing that I hate about this town and you

165
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:00,761
know,

166
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:05,220
and being a person who lives
in two very real worlds,

167
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,710
the world of fighting in
the world of standup comedy,

168
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,330
being a cage fighting commentator,

169
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,520
I see the realist of the real shit.

170
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,740
Human character exposed,

171
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,240
people cracking under pressure.

172
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,290
People rise to the occasion.

173
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,030
I see the realist of the real shit.

174
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,043
And then comedy,

175
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,250
nobody laughs,

176
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,970
you're not funny.

177
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,361
Okay.

178
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,040
If your point doesn't work,

179
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,360
they don't accept it into their mind.

180
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,690
It has to really work and you
have to be in that moment.

181
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,380
You can't think about something that's
completely opposite and say something

182
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,480
funny and have it be
funny cause he won't work.

183
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,100
There's something weird going on.

184
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,960
It's not just the words
coming out of your mouth,

185
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,200
it's you thinking about those words as
they come out of your mouth and people

186
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,730
recognizing that you're in the moment,

187
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:43,570
which makes it funny.

188
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,520
Those are two very real things.

189
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,460
So when I see someone like
pretentious and someone who just,

190
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,810
someone who's like taking themselves way
too fucking seriously or wants a lot of

191
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,660
accolades and respect to
something that's basically just,

192
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,440
that's what you're,

193
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,110
that's what you,

194
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,680
man,

195
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,730
you're really good at that.

196
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,710
This guy's really good
at fixing people's eyes.

197
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,630
This guy's really good at driving cars.

198
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,860
You don't be an asshole.

199
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,821
It's really simple.

200
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,350
Don't take yourself too fucking seriously,

201
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,930
cause you don't deserve
any extra appreciation.

202
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,670
You don't deserve any extra respect.

203
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,230
You don't deserve any extra attention.

204
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,900
You deserve exactly what the
fuck you've already gotten.

205
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,630
And you should be super
duper thankful for that.

206
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,000
And anytime you want more
than what you're getting,

207
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,050
you're a cunt.

208
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,490
It's that simple.

209
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,020
If you demand respect,

210
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:24,380
you're a,

211
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,213
you're a cunt.

212
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,420
You're simply a cunt.

213
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,830
It's your problem.

214
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,500
You're you're imbalanced and
need to take a yoga class.

215
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,360
You need to go on a mushroom trip,

216
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,350
go to Peru,

217
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,610
take some Iowasca,

218
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,360
do something,

219
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,193
but stop.

220
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,040
It's 2000 and fucking 13 we
have no time for you anymore.

221
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,060
I have no time.

222
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,920
This,

223
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,790
there are so many flooded.

224
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,580
It's rats,

225
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:44,860
rats,

226
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,690
and a fucking sewer.

227
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,523
Goddammit.

228
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,890
[inaudible].
