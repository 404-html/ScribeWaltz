1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,220
What is the state of
Japanese on my main now?

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,610
It was gigantic for awhile
when Soccer Rabo was big.

4
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:08,690
When you were huge.

5
00:00:08,691 --> 00:00:12,260
When pride was filling 90,000 seat arenas.

6
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,094
Huge.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,360
It was like nothing else.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,700
It's like I experienced 60,000 at Rogers
in Canada when George Saint Pierre

9
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:20,534
fought Jake shields.

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,930
I couldn't imagine 30 more
thousand people there.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,490
But you were there for that.

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,100
It was awesome.

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,770
I mean if that was a 10 and before,

14
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:32,950
I mean may actually came out when they
were only had pancreas and that was a

15
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:33,700
one,

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,660
it sounded like a foreigner right now
what happened is Yuck was the involvement.

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,740
Uh,

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,260
I mean the thing that people
don't realize is in Japan,

19
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,000
everything is Jaquelle's involvement.

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,260
Every big company,

21
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:45,730
every big promotion shoot,

22
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:48,310
they'll chose to say that didn't
ever get a cause Yahoo's involvement.

23
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:49,144
But they're there.

24
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,300
They're backed by [inaudible],

25
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,990
which is the second
largest group of Japan,

26
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,181
you know,

27
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:56,140
so everyone has yakuza connections
to any big Coca Cola company.

28
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,040
Johnson and Johnson.

29
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,470
Any company has yell
cause the connections.

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,380
Wow.

31
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,550
But it's not public.

32
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,050
So save cocacola goes over there
and they open up a plant in Japan.

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,090
They must go through the Yakuza.

34
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,740
They'll have that connections.

35
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:10,071
Yes,

36
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:10,700
definitely.

37
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,020
How do they negotiate that?

38
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,341
Well,

39
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:12,730
it's,

40
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:12,941
it's,

41
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:13,691
it's really easy.

42
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:13,871
It's,

43
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:14,101
it's,

44
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:14,471
it's a,

45
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:14,920
um,

46
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,850
it's a turf thing.

47
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:16,211
It's a,

48
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:17,350
if you know somebody,

49
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:17,681
it's,

50
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:18,514
it's,

51
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,110
it's a percentage you pay.

52
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,500
It's,

53
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:21,890
it's a,

54
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,930
it's pretty given thing.

55
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:23,690
It's almost like,

56
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,523
like taxes.

57
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,320
Wow.

58
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,510
Yeah.

59
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,680
Pink Tabs just accepted.

60
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,820
Accepted,

61
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,271
accepted.

62
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,104
That's why it's,

63
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,030
it's funny how when it became public,

64
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,720
everyone,

65
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,810
it got really bad because it's a,

66
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:36,370
it's a weird thing is accepted,

67
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,750
but it's frowned upon.

68
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,620
It's something that they know they
need to be a part of in society,

69
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,490
but they don't want to make it
public because the Yakuza has,

70
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,420
does have a bad name.

71
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,700
That was the only place
where I've ever been with a,

72
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,590
asked me to cover up my tattoos.

73
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,513
Yeah.

74
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,180
Yeah.

75
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,811
It was weird.

76
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,471
That's why I don't have,

77
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,180
I try to keep them all from my sleep,

78
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,140
so it comes up from here.

79
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,940
But after that I stopped
because I don't want to

80
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,580
walk around and you know,

81
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,010
be kicked out of places,

82
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:01,171
you know,

83
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,840
I just got denied to go in a hotel
like last week when I was in Japan.

84
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,390
Really?

85
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:05,631
Yeah.

86
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:08,150
Because of my tattoos with the neck.

87
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,870
Is that what it is?

88
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,051
Yeah,

89
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:09,800
they saw it.

90
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,090
They sell it for wear a Hoodie.

91
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:11,924
It covers it up.

92
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,180
It helps me.

93
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,451
Yeah.

94
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,021
I got a,

95
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,280
I got kicked out of a gym.

96
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,960
They made me go put a
long sleeve shirt on.

97
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,140
The Gym's even big gyms at
Gold's gym won that year.

98
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,281
That's crazy.

99
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:22,880
Yeah.

100
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,950
What does it represent to Japanese?

101
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,690
It represents the underworld
gangsters and you know the,

102
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,410
you got to figure when you have a gang,

103
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,160
a gang,

104
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,930
there's two or three top men.

105
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,430
Those men are awesome people.

106
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,540
And then you got the rest of the
hundreds and thousands that are punks and

107
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,590
that's the ones that you see.

108
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,790
So basically a,

109
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,460
a gangster,

110
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,350
someone with tattoos,

111
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:47,640
which equals the Alcazar would
mean trouble and they would,

112
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,990
if you go into a sports gym and you're
working out next to a guy and you know

113
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,371
you're,

114
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:52,981
you're working on,

115
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,130
say you take his awaits by accident
because see in the middle of a set and if

116
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,080
you're doing it to someone
that's a normal person,

117
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:58,531
he'll just say,

118
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:58,651
hey,

119
00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:59,610
I was using ways old.

120
00:02:59,611 --> 00:02:59,861
Sorry.

121
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,670
Okay,

122
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,750
well it might be different for the Yakuza
and people would rather not work out

123
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,970
in the area if there's a cause.

124
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,790
The guy working on there,

125
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,710
so it's a bad rap.

126
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,690
I mean it's just justifiable though.

127
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,770
I can understand that.

128
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,881
The UFC,

129
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,410
when they went in and bought pride,

130
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,790
it's kind of a crazy story,

131
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,160
but they paid $65 million.

132
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,690
They bought pride and they thought,

133
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:19,931
you know,

134
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,171
hey,

135
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,080
we're going to run pride
as well as the UFC.

136
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,780
The same way they did with Strikeforce
when they bought strike force,

137
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,760
they kept strike for us going for a years.

138
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,140
They thought they were going to do that.

139
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,190
But meanwhile it turned out
all the contracts are illegal.

140
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,710
They really didn't have
anybody on the contract.

141
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,000
They spent $65 million and all they
really got was a video library.

142
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,650
And then while they had offices in Japan
and they were hiring these people and

143
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,340
painful him,

144
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,570
they were starting up dream.

145
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,400
They were starting up
their own organization,

146
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,260
organizing everything and yeah.

147
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,094
And then,

148
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,030
you know,

149
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,840
the UFC,

150
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,950
it took years before they could
come back and do a UFC there.

151
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,940
They took,

152
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,080
it took a long time.

153
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,490
Dana was getting like some like
underworld threats and you know,

154
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,650
yeah,

155
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,411
that's what I heard.

156
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:04,521
And I,

157
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:04,730
sorry,

158
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,710
I sent Dana email in
that because if anything,

159
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:10,460
I have a lot of pulling that site and I
told him that if you have any problems

160
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:10,821
with that,

161
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:11,654
I can help you.

162
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,310
What would he have to do,

163
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,830
come to you and then you go to the,

164
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,160
I really respected in their world.

165
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,241
So,

166
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:17,930
um,

167
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,381
I could,

168
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:18,681
I,

169
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:20,300
if I don't know the person directly,

170
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,460
I have guys at norm.

171
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,690
So if he had any type of problem,

172
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:24,110
I still,

173
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,130
it still sounds still today,

174
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,470
if Dana has any type of
underwrote problems there,

175
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,670
if he calls me arc,

176
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,513
take care of it for him.

177
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,290
It's interesting that there's such an
underworld presence in Japan because it

178
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,970
seems so safe when you're there.

179
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:35,804
Everything is so,

180
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,670
people are so polite and you don't see
violence you don't see like you see drunk

181
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,050
people walking into the street
and no one hurts them day.

182
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,933
Everyone's fine.

183
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,370
Girls Walk down the dark
lanes and it's okay.

184
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:46,841
Yeah,

185
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:46,971
it's,

186
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:47,510
yeah.

187
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,250
It's a strange sort of,

188
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,911
you know,

189
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:50,744
a contrast.

190
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,271
Yeah,

191
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:51,541
it's a,

192
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:51,881
it's,

193
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:54,030
it's almost like you just have bad areas.

194
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,730
Like can change your cool.

195
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,440
They have over 300 was offices there.

196
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,670
Roppongi only has three.

197
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,720
Wow.

198
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,021
Yeah.

199
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:01,771
So you've got,

200
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,380
these are districts that
they're accumulated in,

201
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,430
they have offices,

202
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,240
they have offices.

203
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,073
Yeah.

204
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,460
The mafia doesn't have office.

205
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:08,701
Yeah.

206
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:09,534
See that's the thing.

207
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,800
Like for me,

208
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,030
I guess I grew up in America,

209
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:14,820
so for me the mafia
just scares me way more.

210
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:15,150
I mean,

211
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,400
I have this image that
you screw with the Mafia.

212
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
You better change your name,

213
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,570
you were to move and you better hide
who your family is and you've got to get

214
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,040
the hell out of just disappear.

215
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,470
But when you get in trouble at the Yakuza,

216
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,491
um,

217
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,330
I've been in trouble with
them before and it's,

218
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:28,980
it's,

219
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,910
it's like you can kind of pretty much
deal with them the way you want to deal

220
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:33,180
with them.

221
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,391
You know,

222
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:36,660
it depends on how much
you're willing to sacrifice.

223
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:37,494
Yeah.

224
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,180
And for me it was your issue with them.

225
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,400
There was a one to it with kid.

226
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,450
Um,

227
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,020
when,

228
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,853
when I,

229
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,481
this guy,

230
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,450
this Jaquez guy wanting to,

231
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:51,150
to open up a gym and I agreed to open
up a gym with him called purebred Tokyo

232
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,043
killer bee.

233
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,550
And I just told them that the only thing
you have to do is you have to hire two

234
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,240
of my fighters so they can
make a living through fighting.

235
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,250
And I wanted to help them on,

236
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,093
I want to no money,

237
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,780
you can use my name or my gym,

238
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,980
but you have to hire my two fighters.

239
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,131
He,

240
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,240
they acquired kid and they're hard.

241
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,110
Ryan Bull.

242
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,630
And those are the fighters
in everything was good.

243
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:11,780
And what happened was kid started,

244
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,140
um,

245
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,550
I guess from the influence of his father,

246
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,384
he started being,

247
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,060
the loyalty issue in him was getting,

248
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,280
was wavering where he
wasn't telling me stuff,

249
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,090
he was hiding stuff.

250
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,781
He's lying to me.

251
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,920
And then I put that [inaudible] was the
guy in charge of them that ran the gym.

252
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:25,521
So I told him,

253
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,360
I called him and say,

254
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,410
what's going on man?

255
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,311
You got to take care of it.

256
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:28,501
He goes,

257
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:29,151
I'll take care of it.

258
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:29,601
I'll take care of.

259
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,570
He's told me that and it got to a
point he didn't take care of it.

260
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,570
So I called him and I
was pissed dirty by now.

261
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,550
And I called him and said,

262
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:38,120
you know what?

263
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,630
Call me.

264
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,370
He avoided my calls for three days.

265
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,911
So three,

266
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,390
three,

267
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,223
three weeks.

268
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,281
And I'm sitting there,

269
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:44,510
this guy's running from me.

270
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,890
I'm thinking this is ridiculous.

271
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,031
So then they'll say,

272
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,900
this guy is running from me.

273
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,770
I'm not going to look for him.

274
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,130
I want to,

275
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,700
he's going to pop up these guys that
charter to run their pop up all the time.

276
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:52,911
You know,

277
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:57,200
so I'm sitting there
watching the [inaudible] kid
flight and kid wins a fight

278
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:00,260
and this guy's in the ring jumping and
hug him and team has a mother fucker.

279
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:04,080
This guy's hiding from me and he's on
national TV hugging me saying Hansen,

280
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,933
I'm here.

281
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,500
So I guess is it?

282
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,490
So I called my students,

283
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:11,770
I took the final where the after party
is what after part and I was leery going

284
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:14,360
to walk in there and grab that guy with
the hair and pulled the model of party.

285
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,420
But my students felt it
was going to be a problem,

286
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:18,860
is going to make too much commotion.

287
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,880
The cops are going to be called.

288
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,440
So Daddy said to get them in.

289
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,430
They brought him up and brought him to
the park and pretty much beat him for

290
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:26,151
like 20 minutes,

291
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:29,360
which is something he shouldn't do in
Japan because in the acquisition world

292
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,740
they work by face,

293
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,850
they work by being tough,

294
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,800
being scary to collect money and stuff.

295
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,720
And if he's got all,

296
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,130
they got a black tie and
bruises on their faces,

297
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,310
kind of goes against the fact
that they're tough people.

298
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:40,600
You know?

299
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,830
So I beat him up pretty bad.

300
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:43,070
And,

301
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,903
um,

302
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,511
I did.

303
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:44,811
But see,

304
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,640
the thing is I never did pick on anyone.

305
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:48,740
I never did do anything without a reason.

306
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,310
And I,

307
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,330
I believed that I would die for my
beliefs tomorrow and I believe that I was

308
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,700
right and this guy
really deserve that shit.

309
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,980
So if they didn't like it,

310
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,510
if the top guys didn't like it,

311
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,344
then they can,

312
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,310
they know where to find me.

313
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:04,160
And so what happened was it
was going off for 20 minutes.

314
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,230
And when I went down,

315
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,981
I let people in,

316
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:09,080
some people in my friends know
and they were all worried.

317
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:13,640
So they made calls and we had two other
Yakuza guys come down to the scene to,

318
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,720
to try and stop me,

319
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:17,180
to kind of getting me tween
not stop me physically,

320
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,180
but to,

321
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,540
to,

322
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,690
to ask for forgiveness for this guy.

323
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,780
And they're kind of like bawling in the
middle of me and the guy and I'm getting

324
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,614
around and just,

325
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,210
just giving them wax at a time.

326
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,290
And when he,

327
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,820
if he would've fallen from a hit,

328
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,890
I had ground and standing
right back it up.

329
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:31,940
Yeah.

330
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,910
So it's kind of getting really,

331
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,010
he was all bloody and then,

332
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,193
um,

333
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,100
these guys are kind of my friends too,

334
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,520
so they weren't going to get involved,

335
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:40,580
but they're trying to stop
me from going too far.

336
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,590
And when we,

337
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,700
there's this old lady,

338
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,980
you know how you have the old ladies in
the neighborhood that don't give a fuck

339
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:46,814
who you are.

340
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,121
She,

341
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,830
this lady comes on and
says screaming at us,

342
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:52,200
he didn't make it the less noise and shit
cause that gets on the lady and I say,

343
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:52,381
no,

344
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:52,490
no.

345
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,091
Hey Man,

346
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:53,751
don't do that man.

347
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,584
Let's go.

348
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,270
So he moved over to the next part and
as you're moving on with the next bar,

349
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:01,260
lake three fricking monkeys
disguise higher ups to find
out what's happening and

350
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,540
come out and they're
walking up like these,

351
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:03,721
you know,

352
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,460
like the movies they are
walking through that I,

353
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,880
it was funny because I call them monkeys
because they're walking through bushes.

354
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,830
I saw him walking through the
trees and they came on and like,

355
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:12,570
Oh shit,

356
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,291
these are the guys,

357
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,700
these are like the hot head guys.

358
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,460
And they came up to me and they're
screaming in Japanese to me,

359
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:17,650
Oh,

360
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,400
you were going to hurt you now
because you heard our brother.

361
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,540
And then some of my guys came
and held him back and I say,

362
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:24,781
okay,

363
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,614
wait a minute.

364
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,881
If it's going to happen,

365
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,714
it's going to have to know.

366
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,221
So I told my guys,

367
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:29,970
let 'em go.

368
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,241
I said,

369
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:30,621
let him go.

370
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:30,931
I said,

371
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,310
I just want to say one thing to you guys.

372
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,173
And they,

373
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,980
they came up and they're all there,

374
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:35,191
you know,

375
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:35,681
they got this,

376
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:38,300
this stance and they're all mad at me
and looking at me and I'm the to see,

377
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,150
I got one thing to do.

378
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,470
If I got one thing to say,

379
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,000
if I say you don't like it,

380
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:42,780
we can have it all.

381
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,021
I said,

382
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:44,010
I'm ready to die tonight.

383
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,970
And then this guy goes,

384
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:45,231
okay.

385
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:45,811
And so I tell them,

386
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:46,320
okay,

387
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,550
if someone fucked you over,

388
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,260
I sent you wanted to punish them.

389
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,581
Wouldn't that be fair?

390
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:50,851
He goes,

391
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:51,270
yes,

392
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,410
but look what you did to him.

393
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:53,160
Look at him,

394
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,401
the kid,

395
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:53,971
he's all blood,

396
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,280
he's standing here are bloody and owner.

397
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,341
And I said,

398
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:56,461
well,

399
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,030
you know what?

400
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,661
Let's put it this way.

401
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:57,811
I said,

402
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,840
I'll shoot one question if
going to kill him with my hands.

403
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,100
How fast you think I could do it?

404
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:02,341
He said,

405
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,680
probably five minutes within five minutes.

406
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:04,921
I said,

407
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:05,161
hell,

408
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,660
within two minutes I killed that fucker.

409
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:07,494
And he goes,

410
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,221
yeah,

411
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,290
but what do you do?

412
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:09,960
What does that mean?

413
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,381
And I said,

414
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:10,830
well,

415
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,210
I ain't even hitting him for 20 minutes.

416
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,710
I said,

417
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,951
dude,

418
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:14,550
this is,

419
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,830
this is like 10% of what I could do.

420
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,671
And I said,

421
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:18,331
don't you agree?

422
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,800
If you what you,

423
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,890
if you had somebody fuck you over and
you decide to just to 10% out of respect

424
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,130
to the people behind him,

425
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,540
wouldn't you think that's fair?

426
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,880
And they guy just changed.

427
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:29,340
Straight up.

428
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,900
Bull stopped and he said,

429
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,363
you're right man.

430
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,320
Thank you.

431
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,711
Wow.

432
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,000
That doesn't fly in America.

433
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:35,241
That's,

434
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:38,660
that's an interesting interesting code.

435
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,040
The they believe in the underworld
side is there's two sides of the fence,

436
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,900
the legal side,

437
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,733
the illegal side,

438
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,650
the legitimate site
and you are never ever,

439
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:50,720
if you're on the ligament side,

440
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:51,750
they have a legitimate problem.

441
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,980
You are never ever allowed to go
to the other side to get home.

442
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:56,810
You're,

443
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,380
you're,

444
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,260
if you're going to stay,

445
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,840
you're going to get other guys to
help you on this site and retaliate,

446
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:01,674
that's fine.

447
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,430
But if you ever go to authorities and
you lose face and you can never can ever

448
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,270
work in that world again.

449
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,103
So

450
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,781
wow.

451
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,850
So you have to deal
with things on your own,

452
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,500
the problem like that.

453
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,070
Yeah.

454
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,060
You pretty much,

455
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,991
if you,

456
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,560
if you're someone from the outside and
you're like a regular businessmen and

457
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:20,330
these guys come and bother you,

458
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:23,640
the best thing to do is go to
the authorities because of the,

459
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,000
the police are just waiting
to grab the yellow buses.

460
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,380
So He's psycho role.

461
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:28,550
It's like Kryptonite to the [inaudible].

462
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,770
If you go say you're going
to the police still back off.

463
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,830
But if I,

464
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,660
I live my life in that side pretty much,

465
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,494
you know what I mean?

466
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,780
A lot of my friends are part of those
groups and a lot of my beliefs run really

467
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,790
deep with their beliefs.

468
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,420
You know the,

469
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,170
I mean,

470
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,861
see the thing is,

471
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:46,171
is you,

472
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,260
you and you hear about the youngest,

473
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,420
they get a bad rap because you
talk about child pornography,

474
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,254
drugs,

475
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,830
you know,

476
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,760
extortion.

477
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,153
Um,

478
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,851
what is that?

479
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:54,971
Uh,

480
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:55,331
when they,

481
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,310
when they steal money from people,

482
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,551
you know,

483
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,440
but the thing that they don't see that,

484
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:01,750
so that's all the things in the media,

485
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,950
but the things that they don't see,

486
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:03,671
which I feel is,

487
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,000
uh,

488
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,960
is really unfortunate is the honor and
the loyalty they have for each other.

489
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,390
And that's where me and
them click really well.

490
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:11,224
You know what I mean?

491
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,020
They will die for anyone
in your group tomorrow.

492
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,190
They'll go to jail for 10 years for
their boss tomorrow if they have to.

493
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,533
I mean,

494
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,570
you don't see that type of
loyalty around all these,

495
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,360
you know,

496
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,500
non American and I love,

497
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,940
you know,

498
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,360
I think that loyalty,

499
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:25,601
you know,

500
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:26,434
and they,

501
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,281
and that's,

502
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,050
I think that's why they
respect me so much is you,

503
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,430
I will die for my values.

504
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:32,170
I'll die for my people
that are close to me.

505
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,723
It's just such a

506
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,520
unbelievably fascinating culture.

507
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,750
How different Japan is.

508
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:37,860
And so many ways,

509
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:38,291
like a big,

510
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,270
there's big gaps in it.

511
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,170
Yeah,

512
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,003
it's crazy.

513
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,851
It's really,

514
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:42,151
really,

515
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:43,500
really fascinating stuff.

516
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,980
It's just that all these different
cultures evolve independently,

517
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,200
that the Japanese culture evolved
independently from the American culture.

518
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:55,050
We independently from the European
culture and it's so different.

519
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:55,401
Yeah,

520
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,260
it is all he think all the
places are different men.

521
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,050
It's hard to really move into,

522
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,993
uh,

523
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,520
a different country and,

524
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,780
and run yourself in the way that you
learned in another country because it's,

525
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,741
you know,

526
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:06,930
I said,

527
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,061
well,

528
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,410
when in Rome he was,

529
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:08,711
what do you,

530
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:11,890
what do you think about the state
of a Japanese MMA right now?

531
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,990
Because it's kind of in
a transitionary period.

532
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,160
If one at one point in time it was
gigantic and you say Yakuza involvement as

533
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,450
why people,

534
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:23,620
corporate sponsors backed out and
then they lost a lot of viewership.

535
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,610
But man,

536
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:29,200
it was just not that long ago that there
were selling out these gigantic places.

537
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,130
Not what,

538
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,450
what's going on right now?

539
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:31,800
Well,

540
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,730
right now I'm,

541
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,331
like I said,

542
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:34,620
it's up the number four right now.

543
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,030
There's people that are real hesitant.

544
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,370
They're not among many sponsors
that want to put money into it.

545
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,200
Um,

546
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,130
on the flip side,

547
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,300
the big things that's
happening is gangster events
where they allow gangsters to

548
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:46,080
fight in the ring.

549
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,831
And yeah,

550
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:48,030
it's crazy though.

551
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:48,864
This thick,

552
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,950
I attend all of those.

553
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,340
I'm like a guest and most of them they
pay me to just to be there and to judge

554
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,230
sometimes to make a speech in their ring.

555
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:55,951
Maybe in the beginning,

556
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:58,110
because I'm still respected in that world,

557
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:01,290
that to have me there a lot
of these gangsters him down,

558
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:01,471
you know,

559
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,310
when they want to riot,

560
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:02,971
they don't riot,

561
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:03,480
you know?

562
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,200
I mean,

563
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,860
you go to the event and it's not unusual
to see a picture of two stick figures

564
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,570
fighting and has a big x on it.

565
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,070
So don't fight,

566
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,933
don't fight.

567
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,050
It's like,

568
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,920
isn't that a given?

569
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,790
You never see any signs up in the UFC
saying please don't fight in the audience.

570
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,330
It's like,

571
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,290
it's already given this,

572
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,400
not something you should do.

573
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,351
But yeah,

574
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,280
so that's a big thing right now.

575
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:26,930
But it's good because the
gangster events actually they,

576
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,050
they have headbutts,

577
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,230
they have elbow striking
that you can split system.

578
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:32,720
You can neither groin,

579
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,541
you can do whatever.

580
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,760
Pretty much they have two on one.

581
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,520
They have to and to really,

582
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:38,720
it's crazy dude.

583
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,010
How often do they have these
findings held on the bowl?

584
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,880
Once a month man,

585
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,691
there's one somewhere.

586
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:43,170
Shit.

587
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:43,401
Yeah.

588
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,910
And it's like these guys,

589
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,160
it's become,

590
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,420
it's a good trend because it's become
where these guys just came off the street

591
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:49,651
singing.

592
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:53,330
They're tough gassing on one minute from
these guys actually spending time in

593
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:55,220
the gym though and being off the street.

594
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,600
So it's like I should a good movement.

595
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,400
Um,

596
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,770
a lot of,

597
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,520
there's about three or four gang shirts
already now this actually made their pro

598
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,390
debut and deep.

599
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,470
So these guys are actually
going to run the gangs and,

600
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,980
and start selling drugs and you know,

601
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,470
doing illegal activity.

602
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,690
They're not training and it's
having a future and fighting,

603
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,524
which is awesome.

604
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,810
As far as the legitimate side of MMA,

605
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:15,230
I,

606
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,860
I see it,

607
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,590
I can see it picking up again
and it's all due to the UFC.

608
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,580
The UFC has done a couple
of events there now.

609
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,680
And the last one they
did when I went to that,

610
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:24,951
it was,

611
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:25,700
it's huge man.

612
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,481
It's so big.

613
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,314
I mean,

614
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,750
as much as the Japanese fans are
kind of losing hope in Japanese,

615
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,710
I mean maybe cause a lot of
productions were folding.

616
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,143
Um,

617
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,721
when,

618
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:35,840
uh,

619
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,470
when we went to,

620
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,520
when I went to the UFC,

621
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,633
uh,

622
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,600
I felt debt that energy again
when I was fighting in pride,

623
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,130
that energy that they had in the audience.

624
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,010
And especially when ramp piece
chemo with the pride music,

625
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,160
it gave me goosebumps because
when he came out to that,

626
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,230
I looked around the arena and I was like,

627
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:51,441
damn,

628
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,420
this is a psycho pride.

629
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,280
This is a,

630
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,113
this is a pride.

631
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,520
And I,

632
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,540
it's the first time since
that big incident with the
[inaudible] and pride that

633
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,680
I've actually seen that again.

634
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,603
It,

635
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,400
it's so surreal to me actually.

636
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,361
And I was like,

637
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:05,610
John,

638
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,110
this is gonna,

639
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,943
this is gonna be the,

640
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,710
the ticket back is the
UFC coming to Japan.

641
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,010
If the UFC did an ultimate
fighter in Japan and,

642
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,281
uh,

643
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:14,690
have a Japanese version of it,

644
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,130
would you be interested in coaching?

645
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,061
Oh yeah.

646
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:17,894
We'll definitely,

647
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,823
yeah,

648
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,173
I would love to.

649
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,660
That'd be perfect.

650
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,400
You'd be,

651
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,350
you would really be perfect
for something like that.

652
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,310
I would love that.

653
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,203
You know,

654
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,540
[inaudible].
