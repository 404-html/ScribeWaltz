1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,060
Welcome back to civilization Jamie 
Kilstein high.

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,870
So a lot has changed since the last time
we spoke and for people who don't know,

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,680
you used to be the host of or one of the
cohosts of citizen radio,

4
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:25,681
like Super Progressive Lefty podcast and
you were a Vegan,

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,970
but I ate a steak.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,760
Oh,
hell's broken loose.

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,530
Oh,
I don't know what's happening.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,830
I don't know where I am.
Yeah,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,840
I,
I remember I was thinking about like 

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,750
being back in the studio and uh,
I never met Jamie before and I was like,

11
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:42,220
all right,
everyone's been really nice to me.

12
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,710
I'm like literally feel like I'm like,
this isn't,

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,920
this isn't a trick.
Joe sent me very nice emails and I'm 

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:49,920
like,
but I'm a very trickle guy.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,790
Uh,
and I came in and yeah,

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,660
everyone's just lovely and nice.
Uh,

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,160
yeah man,
a lot of change.

18
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:59,560
I went into hiding,
hiding

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,940
because I only got like a peripheral 
story of like what?

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,690
What went sideways.
All right.

21
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,180
So like some people girls accused you.

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:07,810
Well,
yeah,

23
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:08,800
that this is,
look,

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,720
this is the fucking worst time for me to
be like,

25
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,750
you know what?
Now that everyone's talking about 

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:15,750
Weinstein's time for Kilstein to make 
his return,

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,210
why too simple.
I like roads.

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,210
Yeah.
It's like very,

29
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,640
like Julie and predatory.
When I wrote,

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,880
I wrote Stan Hope I get a.
When the wine,

31
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:25,690
same thing happened.
I was like,

32
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,220
hey man,
you want to like push off this return?

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,850
He's like,
you're fine.

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,070
Uh,
yeah.

35
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,540
So here's what happened.
So,

36
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,970
uh,
it kind of started where I was a comic a

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,840
for years and you know,
as it got more progressive,

38
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,590
um,
it,

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:39,990
it,
it,

40
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:44,991
it got more into that judgmental 
territory I guess where I feel like I 

41
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,750
definitely became one of those people 
who would just be on twitter all day and

42
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,000
instead of sort of talking about real 
issues,

43
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,070
it just becomes like,
who are we mad at that day?

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,170
Like,
who used the wrong word that day?

45
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:01,171
Who can we get fired that day?
And it's twitter mob stuff and it 

46
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:01,171
happens on the right and it happens on 
the left.

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,180
And it's just like kind of just people 
who were sad who just live like in the 

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,180
box,
which I was like one of them.

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,400
Right.
That's fine.

50
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Well,
I think this is such an important 

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,440
conversation because,
because you've kind of stepped away from

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,941
it and you see it for what it is.
I think people don't realize that when 

53
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:16,970
they're caught up in the swirl of it,
the momentum of it,

54
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,400
that it's almost like a natural human 
behavior pattern.

55
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:20,300
It's very tribal.

56
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,490
Yeah.
Well it's tribal and it's physically 

57
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,130
addictive.
Um,

58
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,160
you know,
like I've like gone back and forth with 

59
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,150
like drinking and not drinking a pot and
not smoking pot.

60
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,000
And I can tell you that the thing I was 
addicted to the most was twitter.

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,740
It was refreshing twitter.
It was like,

62
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,130
you literally get dopamine hits from 
that.

63
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:43,890
Like I remember when I first tried to 
get off twitter,

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,160
I like,
I was fighting with some fucking 

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,160
stranger,
uh,

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,530
in my living room on twitter and I was 
like,

67
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,230
you know what?
Fuck this.

68
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,470
I'm going to go take a walk.
I don't need a,

69
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,760
I don't need to be involved in this 
guy's life.

70
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,120
I closed it and before I even knew it,
I'm like walking in the park,

71
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,980
fighting with some other guy on my 
fucking phone and I'm like,

72
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,280
it follows you.
Like if someone's calling you a cunt,

73
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,530
they're calling you a,
of a dinner with your girlfriend,

74
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:10,531
they're calling you a con when you go to
like your brother's graduation and 

75
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:10,531
you're just like,
refreshing it,

76
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,850
waiting for someone to tell you that 
you're good.

77
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Um,
and sort of so that I got addicted to 

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,240
that,
um,

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,760
more than anything.
And especially when I finally got an 

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,870
audience with the left have left.
Um,

81
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,730
I mean,
just to be very clear,

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
uh,
it's not like I'm going to come on this 

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
show and suddenly like do a fucking 
Shawn michaels.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,480
He'll turn and be like,
I'm Johnny Rape Joke.

85
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,860
Those fucking bitches all had to come 
and you're just being a person.

86
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,010
Well,
and that's what I like wasn't doing for 

87
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,290
a very long time is I feel like I don't 
want to speak for people,

88
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,650
but I feel like with me,
I always needed something to like define

89
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,880
me right.
Where it's like,

90
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,910
I'm a progressive or I'm a,
I'm a Vegan or I'm just Jujitsu and 

91
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,630
whatever I whatever I would become kind 
of currently obsessed with.

92
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,860
I was sort of like throw the other shit 
away and kind of like shit all over that

93
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,620
because,
you know,

94
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,260
a lot of times I would feel like a 
failure.

95
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,020
Like that's really where the 
progressive.

96
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
Um,
I mean I still hold a lot of progressive

97
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,730
ideas,
but that's when I went from comic to the

98
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,770
political.
It wasn't that I like wanted to make 

99
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:19,300
comedy,
my,

100
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,490
my like nemesis,
right.

101
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,310
It was that I felt,
I feel like I've failed.

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,540
Um,
you know,

103
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:30,541
I dropped out of school to start a 
comedy like 17 and I did the things 

104
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,860
you're supposed to do.
Um,

105
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,890
and yeah,
I did Montreal a couple of times and 

106
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:37,890
Conan once,
uh,

107
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,060
and I had this year where it seemed like
things were gonna happen and then,

108
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,450
you know,
I was kind of that guy that people were 

109
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,450
like,
oh,

110
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,251
we like you,
we can't do anything with you but we 

111
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,111
like you.
And so I started to kind of make my own 

112
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:49,111
audience.
And the audience was fucking great.

113
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,010
It was like a bunch of,
you know,

114
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,740
when that show started,
it was a bunch of just weird.

115
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,010
I'm sweet,
nerdy comedy fans and then everything 

116
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:03,550
just started getting pushed a to two 
crazy though.

117
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:08,551
Like when I knew shit,
I said this on Doug's podcast when I 

118
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:11,161
knew shit got nuts is when I was 
defending a trans person.

119
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,870
So already like a left issue,
like I'm doing the right thing.

120
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,810
Right?
And I called this transphobic,

121
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,110
I an idiot and we get an email that said
a while,

122
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,420
we appreciate you using a defending 
trans people.

123
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,650
The word idiot is able list and I want 
it to be like,

124
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,840
you're retarded.
Your retarded context.

125
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:28,950
Okay.

126
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,060
I wanted to list for people,
people making fun of people who don't 

127
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,480
know.
I don't know what it means anymore.

128
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:38,480
I thought abelist was just like,
that guy's in a wheelchair.

129
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:43,481
Fuck him.
But I guess like all of these different 

130
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:43,481
terms,
these everyday terms,

131
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,040
like I guess idiot is abelist because 
fucking,

132
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,230
I don't know.
There was an idiot in a wheelchair.

133
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,740
Oh No,
no,

134
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:49,590
no.
It's a bliss.

135
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:52,520
Because if you're not an idiot,
if your brain works well,

136
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,800
you're mocking someone whose brain 
doesn't work well.

137
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:58,150
They're not able to think correct.
You're enabling Joe,

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,870
you just out progressive to me.
Well,

139
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm pretty progressive.
I know that.

140
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:07,121
I mean I,
I looked like a meathead and I espoused 

141
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:09,140
some right wing ideas,
but when it comes to like social issues,

142
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,190
I'm very progressive.

143
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,520
We became friends.
You saw a gay rights thing I did on 

144
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,520
twitter.
Yeah.

145
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,390
Like you weren't.
That's why I'm.

146
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,180
But I,
but what I saw happening you,

147
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,140
but what I saw happening with you and 
what I see happening just in general,

148
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,720
online,
you know,

149
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,730
I mean,
I was on citizens radio when you guys 

150
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:30,730
first started.
You're on our poster.

151
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,890
Yeah.
I think there's something that happened 

152
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,110
where people were around the time of 
occupy Wall Street.

153
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,170
Things got really heated up and people 
started moving way left and then some 

154
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,860
folks started moving way.
Right.

155
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,861
And I really truly believe to this day,
the way left is what started the whole 

156
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:50,810
trump movement.
It's in response to the way left.

157
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Yeah.
I think all these shit heads got 

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,310
together and they didn't like being 
accused of being assholes are able lists

159
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,160
or rapist or whatever it is by the ultra
progressives.

160
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,400
So they went far right and all right.
I mean the alt right essentially was 

161
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,020
people who didn't identify with these 
old men who were bankers,

162
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,320
but they also didn't want to have 
anything to do with these ultra lefty 

163
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,980
progressive that we're calling everyone 
a racist.

164
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,410
Everyone a rapist,
every man's a piece of shit.

165
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:21,800
Oh,
I,

166
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:22,970
I did all of that.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,960
Yeah.
I straight up that,

168
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:26,980
all of that.
And I think one of the things with the,

169
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,810
the ultra left,
and maybe this is me,

170
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:30,850
like,
uh,

171
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,080
you know,
maybe this is me desperately trying to 

172
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,200
defend myself,
but I think in a weird way it was harder

173
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:41,201
for me and it's harder for a lot of 
people to see themselves slipping into 

174
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:45,221
the extreme left.
And so like what I mean by that is I 

175
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:47,501
never thought when I heard people say 
the extreme right is as is as bad as the

176
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,370
extreme left.
I was always like,

177
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:52,780
fuck you.
Because like the extreme left isn't like

178
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,900
the bombing Palestine being like,
give us free healthcare or let Trans 

179
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:57,950
People Piss in the right bathroom,
like,

180
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,870
you know,
uh,

181
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,300
even that like,
uh,

182
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,720
the shooter and not in Vegas,
but that DC shooter,

183
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,890
like he was like a fucking crazy guy.
He wasn't able to.

184
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,930
So I'm sorry he wasn't shooting the 
politician screaming like,

185
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,940
you know,
I mean he liked the Bernie Sanders page,

186
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:15,941
but it wasn't like we are launching a 
wars against Islam for a Christianity.

187
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,600
It wasn't,
um,

188
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,200
you know,
uh,

189
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,310
what we're doing this for free market 
capitalism.

190
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,340
It was,
to me the extreme left when I heard 

191
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,551
people say it.
And the reason I would scoff when 

192
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:30,551
someone like you would say it is because
I'm like,

193
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,390
dude,
like the left should just be like,

194
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,920
stand for like,
equality.

195
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,730
Everyone has the right to an education.
Everyone has the right to not go fucking

196
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:38,910
hungry,
um,

197
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,150
to have health insurance.
I'm gay.

198
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:45,350
People can do whatever they want with 
their dicks than vaginas.

199
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,860
Vaginas.
It shouldn't

200
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,080
be essentially like that on both sides.
The right what,

201
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:55,081
what being a conservative used to be 
with small government and having the 

202
00:08:56,191 --> 00:09:00,330
government stay out of your lives and 
morphing

203
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,870
where it's like we will stay out of your
lives,

204
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:07,871
but we will be like in your pussy if you
want a fucking abortion will tell you 

205
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:08,030
like who's Dick you can set up

206
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,140
abortion thing is where it gets real 
squirrely.

207
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:15,141
Right?
Because the abortion thing is 

208
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:16,420
essentially it's a religious thing and 
it's a religious thing.

209
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:21,421
It's and it's a moral thing and it's,
it's also what is an abortion.

210
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,920
I mean you are ending a life but you're 
ending a life inside a woman's body.

211
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,180
Well,
when is it okay to do that?

212
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,140
Is it okay to do that

213
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,820
one day and as the grown woman's life 
matter more than the cells are more than

214
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,050
me.
Yeah.

215
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:40,051
That gets to a point,
but initially it's like when is it 

216
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:40,051
defined as a life?
I mean if,

217
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,580
if the moment of conception,
if that moment,

218
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,880
if 30 seconds later it's an abortion,
right?

219
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,920
Like if you could hold your breath and 
then the baby's dead.

220
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:53,190
You know,
like if we found out that the moment 

221
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,261
that God comes in a woman,
if she could just hold her breath for a 

222
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:55,261
minute.
Yeah,

223
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,560
I mean is that,
why does that sound worried be murdered?

224
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,690
But.
But it is.

225
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,970
Look,
abortion is fucking weird.

226
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,890
I'm pro choice,
but abortion is weird because like when 

227
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,180
you,
when it gets older,

228
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,640
when you're four weeks in,
six weeks in,

229
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,490
it's still illegal and it's a fucking 
little baby.

230
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,740
I mean it is a little baby look,
man,

231
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,640
look at it.
It's,

232
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,520
it looks like a little baby.
Sometimes they have a heartbeat.

233
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,130
If it gets to a certain age,
what's going on?

234
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:26,131
Like I'm not saying that it should be my
choice to define whether or not someone 

235
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:30,421
should do it or not do it,
but it's very disingenuous when people 

236
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,870
frame this argument as it's a woman's 
right to choose period.

237
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:34,060
And that's what it is.
It's not just that.

238
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,590
It's also killing a baby.

239
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,160
I don't know.
Man.

240
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,590
Feminists don't like me anymore,
so I'm like,

241
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,250
coat hanger up.
I'm out of this debate.

242
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,300
I don't give a shit.

243
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,530
It's a,
it's a.

244
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
It should be an honest debate because it
is a very controversial and very nuanced

245
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,410
issue,
so it's not as simple as,

246
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:52,350
you know,
the right doesn't want a woman to choose

247
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,440
and stay out of my body.
It's not just stay out of your body.

248
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:56,580
It's like,
what are we doing?

249
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,950
We're killing a baby that's in a woman's
body.

250
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,510
At what age should that be legal?

251
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,530
Well,
and I think that's the whole thing that 

252
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:05,530
we were talking about before with these 
echo chambers where,

253
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,990
you know,
for the first time ever I've been 

254
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,680
listening to sort of like both sides of 
issues.

255
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,730
Um,
first time ever since recently.

256
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:17,320
Yay.
Yeah.

257
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,950
Well,
because like you just see again,

258
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,320
the majority of people like,
yeah,

259
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:22,670
I'll totally fess up.
Sure.

260
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Like I didn't ask a lot of follow up 
questions because your facebook feed is 

261
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,361
curated and your,
your twitter is all of your friends and 

262
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:32,000
for the most part people you agree with 
and you know,

263
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,060
comedy was actually comedy now,
like I've been listening to like a ton 

264
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,220
of like backlogs of your show is because
once I was just like,

265
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,710
oh,
he doesn't hit me.

266
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:40,910
I can listen to the show again.
Great.

267
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:41,960
Hated.
No,

268
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,700
I know I never hated it.
And so,

269
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,760
uh,
but I started listening to the show and 

270
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,280
like hearing pretty equal,
um,

271
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,360
you know,
progressive to conservative ideals and 

272
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,110
comedy was always kind of this cool 
place where you could explore ideas 

273
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,300
because comedy and jokes and laughter 
would sort of take the,

274
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,820
um,
take the edge off a little bit,

275
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:04,600
you know what I mean?

276
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,600
And you could actually talk about issues
and once I kind of became part of that 

277
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,750
crew that would um,
even shit on comedy than it was like,

278
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:18,751
well,
I can watch democracy now and I guess 

279
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:18,751
that's it.
Um,

280
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,470
and I have my.
And I would feel fucking stupid.

281
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,360
I hung out with journalists and hang out
with comics.

282
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,370
I hung out with people where I was sort 
of like,

283
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,800
felt like the joke monkey and like,
um,

284
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,280
the high school dropout part of me would
get really like.

285
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,310
But you felt like the job.
Did you feel like you had to be funny 

286
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,310
when you're around those pieces?

287
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Because when I tried to say something 
like political or that I thought was 

288
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,150
smart,
it would just be kind of like a,

289
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,440
a hushed because I'm not that smart.
I'm not,

290
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,570
I'm good at telling stories.
Um,

291
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,510
I'm,
I'm good at like,

292
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,960
I think listening and asking like decent
questions.

293
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,050
Uh,
but I was never like a fucking 

294
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,050
intellectual.
Um,

295
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,070
and a lot of that crowd is um,
and that's good.

296
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,510
We need those people,
right?

297
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,150
Um,
but I would,

298
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,440
I,
I,

299
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,100
it was really easy for me to be like,
just shut up,

300
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,640
you know what I mean?

301
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,430
Is this all in your mind?
I mean,

302
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,720
you're a human being,
right?

303
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,310
I mean,
if you're just talking to these people,

304
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:16,260
you're not an unintelligent person.
No.

305
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Is this just an insecurity that you 
carried around with you when you were 

306
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,440
around the whole lay?
Um,

307
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,790
yeah,
lot of it was the reason why I asked you

308
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:27,791
this,
your show was sort of in a lot of ways 

309
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:27,791
of entering into the world of 
journalism.

310
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:27,791
Oh,
so that's right.

311
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,790
It's going,
that's right.

312
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,740
That's where I was going,
like sort of way back,

313
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,270
which was,
um,

314
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,970
you know,
the show,

315
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,420
a show started as a comedy show.
It was called drunk and politics before 

316
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,050
it was called citizen radio.
Um,

317
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,690
I think we changed it maybe around like 
occupy,

318
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,170
um,
but it was comedy and like we had 

319
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:50,170
progressive ideas.
So that's sort of what we talked about,

320
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,731
but it wasn't that we had to talk about 
it became this thing where any 

321
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:56,520
progressive issue in the news that day 
or on twitter we had to,

322
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,990
we had to talk about that day and um,
it's sort of lost.

323
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:02,900
I don't know.

324
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,360
Did you,
did it also interrupt interrupting here,

325
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,880
but did it also,
you,

326
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,660
you guys went to is sort of a 
subscription service?

327
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,700
No,
we actually,

328
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,570
um,
you know,

329
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,690
that

330
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,780
I think I'm really proud of about that 
show and why I'm definitely bummed out.

331
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,300
I lost,
um,

332
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,750
a lot of those fans are or whatever was 
we.

333
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,940
We started ages ago.
We,

334
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,010
uh,
we were pretty early on with podcasts 

335
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,580
and we never had commercials and we 
never had.

336
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,590
You didn't really get anything if you 
paid.

337
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,620
It was voluntary,
it was like a shitty version of NPR 

338
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,080
where it was like everybody gets to show
for free.

339
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,140
Right.
It was like I was trying to be 

340
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,340
socialist.
Everyone gets to show for free if you 

341
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,340
can't afford $5 a month,
$10 a month,

342
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,210
$50.
People do that way.

343
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,050
Sam Harris does that.
Totally.

344
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

345
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,590
We just didn't really have,
like,

346
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,530
we couldn't afford to send you like a 
tote bag or whatever,

347
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:50,760
but yeah.
So it wasn't a pay model.

348
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,010
Everything said anybody could

349
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,880
hear.
Um,

350
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:57,881
we occasionally did like little,
like goofy bonus shows for like 

351
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:57,881
subscribers,
but that was it.

352
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,140
That was the question.
So there was some shows that only people

353
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,220
who subscribed because not a lot though.
Yeah.

354
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,210
And it was five days a week too,
so it was a lot.

355
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,700
That's another thing when you're doing 
the fucking show five days a week,

356
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,330
you got to dig for things to be like,
pissed off about a.

357
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,990
to not be redundant.
Yeah.

358
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:16,190
I've done five days a week shows and uh,
I don't think I'm at my best five days a

359
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:21,191
week.
I think four days a week is where I 

360
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:23,650
start to break down anything after four 
days a week unless I'm doing like fight 

361
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,851
companions,
which are just a goof that's just 

362
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:27,851
hanging out,
watching fights.

363
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:27,851
That's easy.
Yeah.

364
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:32,830
You don't want to get stale board.
You don't want to force it into being a 

365
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:32,830
job.

366
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,850
No.
I think what I got out of you was that 

367
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,160
you or you were getting a lot of praise 
and you were.

368
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,390
You were being hailed like I saw Jessica
Bell wrote something where they called 

369
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:48,920
you a great example of an ally or that 
was pre this year.

370
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,160
He has a bell.
Yeah,

371
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,340
but I mean,
but that expression was a.

372
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:53,990
is a very odd expression.
I mean,

373
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,550
I hate to sound like this is 
disingenuous egalitarianism,

374
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,330
but I really do believe this.
I mean we.

375
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,440
We should be allies to each other.
We all should be this idea that like 

376
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,641
there's a God team war going on that 
Jamie Kilstein is out there booking for 

377
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,000
the females.
That's what it's like.

378
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,940
It's like that's what they input.
They reward that.

379
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,300
This is the thing.
It's like some,

380
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,330
and this is not the single outage as 
well because I think they've got some 

381
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,330
great writers.

382
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,040
There's,
there's something that happens with 

383
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,761
people when you write a lot of mean a 
very critical stuff and you you become 

384
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,790
this,
this attack machine and this is how you 

385
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,720
promote your ideas.
This is how you push your agenda by 

386
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,110
attacking people that some of them 
fucking deserve it for sure.

387
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,230
Some of them we're definitely assholes,
but it becomes almost like the currency 

388
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,400
that you're dealing.
Yeah,

389
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,080
and that goes back to the insecurity,
right?

390
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,060
By the way,
my,

391
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,330
but let me finish sentence is that when,
when you're an attack machine like that,

392
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:03,131
and not saying that Jezza bill,
but there's a lot of the blogs that are 

393
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:05,951
attack machines when you're attacked 
machine and if you can be an ally on the

394
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,260
other side are not even on the other 
side,

395
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,900
but an ally to the attack machine like 
and then they single you out,

396
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:14,060
is that it gives you this feeling like,
oh,

397
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm not going to get attacked by them.

398
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,800
This is good,
and you reinforce that behavior by 

399
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,861
ramping up.
The types of things that you say that 

400
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,280
they like,
they appreciate and it becomes a sort of

401
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:30,281
weird exchange where you know,
it's like imply like I think this is 

402
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,780
what a lot of what goes on and political
circles as well.

403
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,810
Like there's not as much bribery as 
there is an understanding that if you do

404
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:40,610
what we want you to do and you say what 
we want you to do,

405
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:42,770
then you're in,
then you're on the good side.

406
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Yeah.
And that goes back to that insecurity 

407
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,130
and I think a lot of people are 
insecure.

408
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,980
I think we're all

409
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,330
insecure.
Everyone is.

410
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,460
And when you do find that tribe.
Yes.

411
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,860
And you do find people who are going.
Yeah.

412
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,070
And the more you attack on twitter 
because not just blogs,

413
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,660
like remember,
like individuals on twitter,

414
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:03,210
like me,
like when I would see like who's getting

415
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,250
piled on today.
Okay,

416
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:10,251
cool.
This writer wrote something about 

417
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:10,251
mansplaning don't need to read the 
article.

418
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:11,220
What's the Hashtag?
That's the Hashtag.

419
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm going to say the fucking meanest 
funny thing because I'm a comic and I'm 

420
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,840
funnier than journalists and then a 
famous people are going to retweet me or

421
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:22,920
phase me and then I get to feel like a 
fucking civil rights hero because that's

422
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:27,921
what,
what happened where like I would 

423
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:28,620
literally tweet even if not even a joke,
even if I tweeted somebody's sincere and

424
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:33,621
this like sucks to admit,
but even if I tweeted something like 

425
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:36,380
Hashtag black lives matter,
I'm refreshing that shit to be like to 

426
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Queslo favorite.

427
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,280
You know what I mean?
Like I'm not doing it to be,

428
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,430
you know,
and then you can feel good about 

429
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,430
yourself.
Then you can go.

430
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,430
Not Saying I did this,
but you can go on the street and you can

431
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,141
fucking ignore the homeless person and 
you can cross the street when you see 

432
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:48,141
like the scary black guy because you're 
just like,

433
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:52,701
well,
I'm technically the Rosa Parks of 

434
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:54,441
twitter because I fucking tweeted that 
joke at that writer who said that 

435
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:54,900
fucking thing that no one's going to 
remember tomorrow,

436
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,260
but we were all angry about today.
Jesus Christ.

437
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,740
This is the first time I've had caveman 
coffee.

438
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh,
there's Nitros are no joke,

439
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,260
drinking adderall.
I think I've ever done adderall.

440
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:06,420
But

441
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,740
uh,
I got adderall offered to me before the 

442
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,671
Stan hope podcast and he came up to me 
afterwards and was like,

443
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,610
ah man,
you fucking talked a lot.

444
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:17,990
That adderall fucked you up.
And I was like,

445
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,300
I didn't take it like I had it in my 
pocket.

446
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,430
It's like,
that was just me being spazzy.

447
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,970
Um,
so I think what happens is,

448
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,480
so yeah,
so you get that validation

449
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,470
validation and it's essentially,
it's an exchange and it was an exchange 

450
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,100
that you're talking about with twitter 
being like this.

451
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,960
You get this dopamine rush every time 
you tweet and refresh.

452
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:42,961
And it's one of the main reasons why I 
don't interact with people online very 

453
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:43,890
much.
It's very rare that I do.

454
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,900
And when I do,
I'm almost always civil.

455
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Yeah.
Because I just don't think that unless 

456
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,411
it's.
One of my friends called Berta fucking 

457
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:53,411
door because he called himself.
The machine is like,

458
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:54,960
come on dude,
I'm the machine.

459
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,230
Like I love him so much years ago.
Let that go.

460
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,340
Bird got to move on.

461
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,990
I uh,
but I mean that's just fake.

462
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,590
No,
no.

463
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,390
And I,
um,

464
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,170
I wasn't gonna say off that with man.
Just a sort of sidebar with twitter when

465
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:15,661
all that shit happened to me and I got 
off all social media but you didn't 

466
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:15,661
explain what happened.
Oh,

467
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:15,810
right,
right,

468
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,730
right.
Um,

469
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,200
okay.
So you're the Super Vegan fet,

470
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,900
the feminists too.
Feminists and again,

471
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,110
like the ideas at their core,
right is bad rape,

472
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:32,111
sped,
like these shouldn't be fucking 

473
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:32,111
controversial issues,
but when you take it to that extreme,

474
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,400
um,
that you were talking about where you're

475
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:35,710
looking to sort of like,
who can I call a sexist today?

476
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,080
Who can I call it racist today

477
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,850
thing?
It's like,

478
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,650
it's,
it becomes an attack machine.

479
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,290
Yeah.
And uh,

480
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,610
yeah,
my,

481
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,040
my dad said that yesterday.
He's like,

482
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,210
you go on the show,
you should say you're not going to be an

483
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:49,960
attack machine.
And I'm like,

484
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,060
what a Dorky thing to say.
I swear to God,

485
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,540
I emailed it to myself.
It can be like Brogan,

486
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,460
degrade you year.
And My pops.

487
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,410
Yeah,
he's gonna be very excited.

488
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,320
Um,
so yeah,

489
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,050
so that happened and what you were 
saying with the allied title,

490
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,210
I was never comfortable with a lot of 
the,

491
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,460
the stuff I got thrown into,
um,

492
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,690
you know,
I was constantly saying either the wrong

493
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:21,691
or offensive things on the show that we 
would have to do to try and be funny 

494
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:24,960
because I'm trying to be funny and we're
going to have to stop and edit it out 

495
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,740
and I would feel like a fucking idiot.
And um,

496
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,340
and I remember I did a college once and 
it was the first time it's ever 

497
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,420
happened.

498
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,770
Like usually they,
you know,

499
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:39,220
they introduce you by my measly credits,
like they would be like,

500
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:44,221
he did Conan once and this time the,
the woman at the college introduced me.

501
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,640
She didn't give any comedy credits.
She just goes out.

502
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,650
Our headliner tonight is a male feminist
and I remember going into the mic and 

503
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,470
being like,
that makes me sound like a rapist.

504
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Like it sounds so fucking creepy.
And that's what I was like labeling 

505
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,701
myself.
That was a label that was thrown at me 

506
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:02,701
and in my head I'm like,
well,

507
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:02,701
I don't hate women.
So I guess.

508
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:03,210
Sure.
Um,

509
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,430
but male feminists sounds like you're 
like cruising around in like a fucking 

510
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,010
male feminist van being like,
who wants equal pay?

511
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,890
Like it sounds so creepy,
but I,

512
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:16,891
I took it because there is so much 
sexism on the other side that you're 

513
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:17,020
like,
I guess man,

514
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,580
I guess being an ally is good,
right?

515
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:23,581
That's like you're defending people,
but then it gets to this level where 

516
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:27,001
you're like,
I got to renew my ally dues and call 

517
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:27,570
somebody a fucking rapist.
Um,

518
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,720
and that's where it got stuck.
So.

519
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,520
And then this,
so this is where it bit me in the ass.

520
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,550
So I come on this show,
we have the argument about a sexism 

521
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,340
like,

522
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,260
right.
I had,

523
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,350
we had a discussion about Daniel Tosh 
rape jokes when Daniel Tosh made a rape 

524
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,670
jokes.
And,

525
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,180
and also there was this,
this weird definition that people like 

526
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,291
to use in a term.
I'm sure you're probably aware of the 

527
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:53,840
actual definition now of like how many 
rapes actually occur,

528
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,130
which is it.
It all came from a study that I want,

529
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,280
if I want to say it was out of the 
University of Arizona,

530
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,520
but I forget where the study was,
but they essentially looked at almost 

531
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,440
any uncomfortable interaction between a 
man and a woman.

532
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,980
Unwanted or remorseful sex was rape a 
lot,

533
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,240
a lot of different things.
Sex while intoxicated was raped.

534
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:20,720
There's a lot of different things that 
they use to define sex where they got to

535
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:21,670
this one and five.

536
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,710
Well,
and this is another reason we need to 

537
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,710
have the conversation,
right?

538
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,160
Because like I'm remorseful.
I don't know what that definition is,

539
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:31,370
but that doesn't sound like many people 
have had sex.

540
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:33,590
I'm sure you have in the afterwards like
what the.

541
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,650
Some people want to call that rape,
but like a,

542
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,390
if you're a fucking blackout drunk and 
like the dude's not like.

543
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:41,840
Right,
okay.

544
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:46,841
That is.
But if we can't have the conversation 

545
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:46,841
and the girl's not,
you get raped.

546
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:47,930
Right.
Because that's happened to me.

547
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,100
That's happened to me too.
Yeah,

548
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,950
I'm straight up.
Has it grover hit you.

549
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,410
Hit me physically.
I had girl swinging at me.

550
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,180
I got the Telegraph it,
do they wind up and,

551
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,740
and they're,
and they're yelling,

552
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:02,870
which I've been told that's what they 
tell you to do on Krav Maga.

553
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Uh,
but they yell while they do and I'm 

554
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,100
like,
no,

555
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,100
you can't yell before you throw a punch.

556
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm going to come coming.
Uh,

557
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,980
but these are stories that like I 
couldn't even tell it.

558
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,230
Like I had a girlfriend tried to beat 
the shit out of me,

559
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,000
uh,
when I was,

560
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,060
when I was like 20 years old,
but it happened at the same time.

561
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:22,061
So I swear to God I,
I'm just dodging what happened but I 

562
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,061
will get through it after this.
Um,

563
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,160
I,
uh,

564
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,760
she was breaking up with her but it was 
at the same time that,

565
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,260
um,
do you remember dyphus?

566
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,070
There was like child services,
typhus,

567
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,300
that's what,
that was the acronym,

568
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:33,110
like,
I don't know,

569
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:38,111
maybe it's just like a Jersey thing,
but it was child services essentially 

570
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:39,680
was at our house to do like an 
inspection essentially to be like,

571
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,740
is it fit to have kids here?
Um,

572
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,080
because like my house was a disaster 
back in the day.

573
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,000
They do it in.

574
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,470
Were you guys thinking about having a 
baby?

575
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:48,830
No,
no,

576
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:49,100
no,
no,

577
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:54,101
no.
We had like a alcoholism in the family 

578
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:55,460
and neighbors were complaining and 
screaming and like I was a fucking train

579
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,340
wreck.
And um,

580
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,100
oh,
I was like,

581
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,960
oh no,
I guess I was like 19,

582
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:02,030
but I was still living at home.
Um,

583
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,850
and I'm one of five,
so I'm the oldest of five.

584
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,880
So this guy.
So I'm breaking up with my girlfriend 

585
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,510
not knowing that this,
like dyphus random inspection is going 

586
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,651
to happen and this guy comes over and 
he's just like older African guy and 

587
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:19,580
he's sitting with my dad on the couch,
African American or African African,

588
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,390
African.
And uh,

589
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:23,560
so the accident and every,
that's the one,

590
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,670
uh,
I'm allowed to laugh at that now.

591
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,250
Good Times.
I,

592
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:27,670
yeah,
I can.

593
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,050
There's so many words I can say now.
It's a good time to be alive word.

594
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,950
Oh my God.
I was with my friend the first time I 

595
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:37,950
hung out with a comic,
uh,

596
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:37,950
this guy,
uh,

597
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:37,950
Louis Gomez,
do,

598
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,180
you know,
so it was with Louis and we were hanging

599
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:44,420
out in la and I was telling him I think 
I want to do comedy again.

600
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,540
And He,
he made a joke with the word fingering 

601
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,300
in it and I started laughing like a 
fucking kid and I'm like,

602
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,000
I forgot how fucking funny the word 
fingering is a funny word.

603
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,270
I felt like I came out of like a comedy 
coma.

604
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:56,780
I was like,
oh,

605
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,480
fingering and midget and Co,
like,

606
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,510
there's so many good.
Anyway,

607
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,860
so,
so my girlfriend,

608
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,110
so I'm breaking up with her and she 
starts swinging at me and she's like,

609
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,460
you can't fucking break up with me,
like blah,

610
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:08,380
blah blah.
And I was just like,

611
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,020
I was like,
Hey,

612
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,130
we can talk about this later.

613
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,580
But like there's a guy downstairs who is
going to a,

614
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,650
with a hilarious,
who's going to take like take my 

615
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:17,650
brother,
she,

616
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,410
you have to like stop and she's fucking 
swing and swing at me.

617
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,150
Nope.
And she's screaming.

618
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:21,170
She was,
she was like,

619
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:23,900
are he used to beat the shit out of her?
And then she has bell wrote about it and

620
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:25,080
that's what happened.
Um,

621
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,290
so I'm just like,
kind of like covering up and I'm like,

622
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,060
you have to stop.
They're going to take my baby brother.

623
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,420
She storms off.
I go downstairs and this guy from child 

624
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,901
services is there.
And I looked at him and I have tears in 

625
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:37,901
my eyes and I'm like,
please don't take my brother's,

626
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:38,600
like,
she doesn't live here,

627
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:39,920
she's just my girlfriend.
I broke up with her,

628
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:42,380
she's never going to be here again.
Like I'm so sorry about that.

629
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,010
And he just looks me and he goes out and

630
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,560
my dad and it just goes,
women are crazy,

631
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,090
aren't they?
And I was just like,

632
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,920
all right.
And that was it.

633
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,290
He didn't give a fuck.
He was like,

634
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,140
I've seen that before.
And like,

635
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,180
she got to leave.
Yeah,

636
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,680
it was lucky.
I got lucky.

637
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,710
Been an angry woman.
Could have been angry woman and we all 

638
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,710
would have been in jail.
Um,

639
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,870
okay.
So I am known as this male feminist.

640
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,950
Um,
which again,

641
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,070
um,
and it kind of becomes my thing.

642
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:14,880
So I go on your show.
We argue about it because I'm like,

643
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:16,770
I don't have comic friends anymore.
Uh,

644
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,120
so,
uh,

645
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,830
I,
I take this side,

646
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,880
um,
and I didn't hear all about the rape 

647
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,691
joke.
Like I just heard all the whole Daniel 

648
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:26,691
tosh story.
I heard,

649
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:27,960
uh,
at the Stan hope show for the first time

650
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,840
because the articles I read don't have 
the nuanced parts,

651
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:31,170
right?

652
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,960
So all I explain what actually have.
Sure.

653
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,140
Daniel Tosh was not supposed to be on 
stage that night.

654
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:40,850
Daniel Tosh was just hanging out at the 
laugh factory and his good friend Dom,

655
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,710
I asked him to go up and he said,
I'll go,

656
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:45,150
okay,
I don't have any to talk about.

657
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:46,470
He goes on stage.
Everybody goes crazy.

658
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,640
Oh my God,
Daniel Tosh is here.

659
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,350
This is amazing.
And he goes,

660
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,310
look,
he goes,

661
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:53,310
I don't have any material,
I'm not even supposed to be up here.

662
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:56,520
So what do you guys want to talk about?
What you know in some guy yells out.

663
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,890
And he goes,
yeah.

664
00:27:58,891 --> 00:27:59,310
He goes,
yeah,

665
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,760
that's real funny sir.
Well,

666
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,800
what's funny about rape?
The humiliation of violence and this 

667
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:05,800
woman yells out,
actually,

668
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,240
nothing's funny about rape,
like very self aggrandizing.

669
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
And he goes,
wouldn't be funny.

670
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:12,720
And five guys raped her right now like 
that.

671
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,750
That's the funny part is like what a 
comedian does.

672
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:18,810
So that line was the line that was 
circulating.

673
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,960
But even that first part,
not that that part was ignored 

674
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,720
conveniently,
the whole part where he's just like,

675
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,820
what's funny about it?
And like that's a good.

676
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,070
Technically that's an anti rape joke,
right?

677
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,870
Um,
and you know,

678
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:33,010
Daniel,
that's how he thinks he's not,

679
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,180
he's not a bad guy.
No sense the one,

680
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,350
that's a great way,
but that has to do with these echo 

681
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:40,350
chambers where I'm like,
why don't fucking hear that part of it?

682
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,070
Um,
I just hear the part,

683
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:44,310
you just hear the part that you're 
supposed to attack.

684
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,140
And then,
you know,

685
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,700
ironically I went to one of Burt's 
podcasts,

686
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,270
uh,
at the same festival,

687
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,980
the all things comedy festival and 
fucking Doug and burt,

688
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,530
like this whole rape thing happened in 
the audience.

689
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,580
I don't know if you heard about it,
but like,

690
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,110
all hell broke loose in the audience 
with that.

691
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,170
So like,
uh,

692
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:02,550
I don't want to be the one to blow up 
the spot.

693
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:04,230
I don't know if birds going to aerate,
if he's gonna,

694
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:09,231
if he,
if he hears the take off from work 

695
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:12,381
podcast or whatever,
it's one of the best things I've ever 

696
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:12,381
heard.
But this,

697
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:12,381
we call them right now.
Yeah.

698
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:13,080
Because I don't want to blow up his 
spot.

699
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,740
But essentially what happened was they 
stand hope it'll just get people to 

700
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,080
listen.
Good.

701
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,620
Stan hope started,
uh,

702
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,010
talking about a rape and child rape and 
the whole show became very rape themed.

703
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,220
Right?
And there was a girl next to me and 

704
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,170
there was a woman next to me and my 
girlfriend who just started screaming 

705
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,630
like Dell talk about it.
And like I said,

706
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,840
they ignored her the whole time.
Um,

707
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,200
and my girlfriend and I would look over 
and then she would like have another sip

708
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:42,120
of her drink and watch show and giggle 
and then rape

709
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,130
will come up.
But she was like stopped.

710
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,830
We just screamed.
But like she didn't,

711
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,030
she didn't,
she didn't,

712
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,250
she didn't leave,
like she didn't get up and leave.

713
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,580
And that was like,
it was so interesting to be on sort of 

714
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,010
the opposite end of that where,
you know,

715
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,470
nothing offensive was really happening 
and I'm like,

716
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:57,070
fuck man,
I,

717
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:59,660
I'm next to that lady from the show.
This is,

718
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,950
this is like my Karmic fate and I'm just
like,

719
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,720
she should go,
she should leave.

720
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,590
But anyway,
so I was on the not calm,

721
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:10,570
excited of that.
And by then I wasn't doing comedy clubs,

722
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:12,670
I was never really accepted into comedy 
clubs.

723
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:14,460
I'm just playing for my progressive 
audience.

724
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:17,050
Said like a Vegan coffee house.
Like that's,

725
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,080
I'm just playing random,
like little rock gigs for like my 

726
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,080
audience.
So again,

727
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,080
Echo Chamber,
right?

728
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,010
And I'm not hanging out with comics.

729
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,140
So when people were like,
why aren't you defending a comment?

730
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,130
And I'm like,
I don't know man,

731
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,000
because I don't think I am one.
Like I didn't,

732
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,090
I,
I didn't really consider myself one.

733
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,700
And so,
um,

734
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,700
yeah.
So me and you a me and you went at it.

735
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:40,600
I believe it was very divisive.
I think half your audience thought I was

736
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,430
a,
a whiny bitch and the other half thought

737
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:43,870
I was a whiny bitch,
you should get raped.

738
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,160
Uh,
it was very one sided.

739
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:47,430
Nobody liked me.
I was uh,

740
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,420
I did not come off well,
I'm told and,

741
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,880
but I was like,
I guess I did the right thing,

742
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:59,881
right.
I guess I sided with women over over a 

743
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:01,090
jokes.
And so from then on,

744
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:04,500
any comic that did like Mei didn't,
uh,

745
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,230
let me stop you right there.
Yeah.

746
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,630
Just,
and I'm not trying to sound the same to 

747
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,630
me by the way.
Yeah,

748
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,361
the sake of honesty,
the real issue came not just because of 

749
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:16,900
that,
but because of your characterization the

750
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,560
next day.
Yeah,

751
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,620
totally.
So the next day there's a video out 

752
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,160
about it that someone put together 
called the Kilstein delusion and some of

753
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,140
that shit was taken out of context.
Some of that shit I will

754
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,780
completely like own up to.
I watched it like once,

755
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:30,300
I mean at that point,
that point,

756
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,550
uh,
just all hell broke loose.

757
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,400
Like I lost my,
I lost my managers.

758
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:38,490
I love was having like a,
someone hacked my twitter and just wrote

759
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,410
rape all over.
It was kind of like,

760
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:42,540
did you lose your manager?
Uh,

761
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,570
they said it was because I don't 
cooperate with the comedy community.

762
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,410
Uh,
to be fair to them.

763
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,590
I was like a pain in the ass client.
It was hard enough for me to fucking 

764
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:54,590
book and then every complicates me and 
they're like,

765
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,520
I don't know man.
I think they just like threw their hands

766
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:58,210
up.
Um,

767
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,200
and so the next day was one of those 
things where I'm like,

768
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,970
I either doubled down and like,
and I was like,

769
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:07,920
it wasn't like I'm like,
I'm going to lie.

770
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,760
It was,
I'm gonna try to uh,

771
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,070
defend myself and give,
like,

772
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,080
you know,
my side to it and that I don't know,

773
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,710
it wouldn't stop you here real quick 
because we're going way,

774
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:20,850
way,
way back.

775
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,200
The real issue.
This is like a year before,

776
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:27,360
more than a year before everything went 
sideways.

777
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,670
Oh yeah.
Hey,

778
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,040
what went sideways and why?
So you're this Super Progressive Vegan 

779
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,260
guy,
but what went sideways?

780
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,830
So,

781
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,270
so I'm an ex of mine,
um,

782
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,880
an ex of mine,
uh,

783
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,850
I'm trying to think about like how much 
I can say,

784
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,640
um,
started.

785
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,890
Um,
it was weird like girls I was dating,

786
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:55,891
like she would kind of like pop up and 
be like following them on like social 

787
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:56,300
media and I kind of was like,
all right,

788
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,140
it's a little weird.
But you were married at the time.

789
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:05,170
So what was also not talked about in 
these articles is that for the last 

790
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,370
however many years before I'm out and I 
got separated,

791
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,200
we were in an open relationship.
We just didn't,

792
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,060
we talked about it on the show 
eventually,

793
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,940
but for awhile we didn't talk about it.
Um,

794
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,180
and which to anyone in a fucking open 
relationship,

795
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:20,000
like it's a nightmare when you're not 
talking about it because you feel like,

796
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:25,001
uh,
a lecherous cheating creep a because 

797
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:25,001
you're in an open relationship.

798
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:25,910
I mean,
you don't talk about it.

799
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:27,990
So then when girls meet you and you tell
them,

800
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,570
I'm like,
yeah,

801
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:30,020
right.
Yeah,

802
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:35,021
totally.
When you go home in a secret open 

803
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:35,021
relationship,
you're like,

804
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:35,021
you're full of shit.
Um,

805
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,410
and so,
you know,

806
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:42,411
I like Kinda did the road thing but like
felt like a fucking creep and rotary 

807
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:46,990
meaning hookup with girls and uh,
and then uh,

808
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,860
you know,
I was finally just like,

809
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,690
we have to talk about it and at this 
point,

810
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:52,980
and I don't want to shit on anybody,
uh,

811
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,260
you know,
at this point,

812
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,640
um,
you know,

813
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,230
my cohost then I,
we were like,

814
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,350
we were pretty much just like really 
good friends,

815
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:05,351
right?
Who lived together and did a show 

816
00:34:05,351 --> 00:34:06,260
together.
And I'm so years later,

817
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:11,261
years after me and this girl broke up 
years after all this shit,

818
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,610
I'm living in La.
Um,

819
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,610
I have a guy had a girlfriend for a 
year.

820
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,220
It's like a very healthy,
wonderful relationship.

821
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,440
Um,
years after all this.

822
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,520
I guess what happened was one of these 
girls,

823
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,640
I'm essentially started to try to find 
any girl who has been pissed off by me 

824
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:35,771
before and they found enough for an 
article that,

825
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,300
um,
I think like two articles came out.

826
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,830
I left to do some radio because the show
was getting a ton of complaints because 

827
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,730
our inner circles started to find out 
that the record unquote accusations,

828
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:49,420
which the word accusation makes it sound
Weinstein.

829
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,860
Um,
accusations of.

830
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,590
So that's what they were saying.
But there was,

831
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:56,240
it was very unspecific.
What I've read,

832
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,310
they said predatory behavior.
And I was like,

833
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,930
oh,
meaning he's trying to get laid.

834
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,960
That's what a man does.
Not Predatory in the sense of you're 

835
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,830
victimizing someone to raping someone or
doing something horrible to someone.

836
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:11,831
Or even,
and this is when my own words kind of 

837
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:14,921
bit me in the ass because you,
I spent an entire year a or years being 

838
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:16,850
like,
you know,

839
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,110
a Hashtag believed women.

840
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,340
And then you read that and you go,
ah,

841
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,330
Hashtag don't believe women.
Like,

842
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,260
you don't know what to do.
And like I,

843
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,470
I was always like,
if you call a girl who accuses you,

844
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:25,660
uh,
uh,

845
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,390
you know,
crazy,

846
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,280
you're just projecting and like you're 
trying to.

847
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,990
And then suddenly I'm reading this 
article,

848
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,220
I'm like,
this is fucking crazy.

849
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,690
And I didn't,
uh,

850
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,180
all of my stuff in one article you talk 
about the,

851
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,580
yeah,
there was Jenzabar article and Hell hath

852
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:41,190
no fury like a woman scorned.
I,

853
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:46,270
uh,
it was really bad and I read it for the 

854
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,741
first time and I don't want to go into 
details because I don't want to shit on 

855
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:48,741
people who like,
feel like they were,

856
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:49,530
um,
you know,

857
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,190
hurt or whatever.
Um,

858
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,320
but a good majority of the article isn't
even fucking true.

859
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,920
Um,
there was one part where Jezza bell even

860
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:03,921
wrote it.
Like if we can make it about journalism 

861
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:03,921
Jenzabar because it's one woman who 
wrote it.

862
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,070
Oh yeah.
Totally.

863
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:06,450
So this,
so the author,

864
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,980
there's one moment in it and I'll try to
make this about journalism and not about

865
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,300
the,
the woman,

866
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:17,301
but one of the complaints about me was I
had a consensual night with a lady in 

867
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:21,600
Nashville,
um,

868
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,970
who I guess because she listened to the 
show,

869
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:28,971
maybe they're like,
that's predatory because you're like 

870
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:28,971
famous.
And I was like,

871
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:28,980
well,
no one else thinks I'm fucking famous.

872
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,760
Uh,

873
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,720
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

874
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,230
wait a minute.
There were defining as predatory because

875
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,270
you're famous.
That's part of it.

876
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,730
Every time Mick Jagger gets laid,
it's predatory.

877
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,930
That's part of it.
That's what I don't.

878
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,610
That's the thing.
And by the way,

879
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,040
fucking call me.
If I'm Mick Jagger famous,

880
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,750
you can call me a fucking Predator if 
I'm,

881
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:48,310
I can barely get a plus one to have

882
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,860
vegan festival famous like,
don't please do not call me a predator.

883
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,610
I mean,
look,

884
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,620
it's,
there's levels to fame,

885
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,600
right?
And I know you're being self deprecating

886
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:01,601
and everything like that,
but you did have a nice following and 

887
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:02,060
you did.
I saw some of your videos online.

888
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:03,720
We did big crowds.
So it's not,

889
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:08,860
no,
it's not like you didn't have fans know 

890
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,620
she did that fans,
but the idea that you liking some woman 

891
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:17,291
who's a fan and her liking you somehow 
know that you're a Predator because she 

892
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:20,480
enjoys your work is crazy.
Was that how they were defining it?

893
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:22,490
Because I don't know.
And then,

894
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:25,460
but then it seems like they've been very
convenient.

895
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:26,430
Their definition.
Well,

896
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,270
and that was part of it.
There was a,

897
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,880
um,
there was another one where it was like,

898
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:37,970
yeah,
the predatory stuff specifically was 

899
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,491
that.
And then what was even more fucked up 

900
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,230
about the article was it said,
um,

901
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,790
and,
and I'm not going to quote exactly.

902
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,830
She also wrote into another podcast and 
I heard this,

903
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,020
but essentially what the woman said,
we did not sleep together.

904
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:54,021
It alluded that we slept together.
It didn't say that I was in an open 

905
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,021
relationship,
but we didn't sleep together.

906
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,260
Um,
she told me she didn't want to,

907
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,670
uh,
uh,

908
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,900
sleep together.
And I was like,

909
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,070
great,
no problem.

910
00:37:59,370 --> 00:37:59,970
She's like,
I don't want,

911
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,650
I don't want it to go further than that,
you know?

912
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,330
So I was like,
cool.

913
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,280
Even if you change your mind,
we're not going to do it.

914
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,670
Got It.
And then in the article in the article 

915
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,850
about me being a Predator,
it's like I felt so safe and,

916
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,710
and,
and it was a great night and I was like,

917
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:15,840
this sounds like an article about pep 
and a good dude.

918
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,080
And then it said,
but then weeks later she heard on the 

919
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,311
podcast that she was just a road fuck.
And then rebel in parentheses is one,

920
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:29,970
Arthur Arthur from Isabel and fantasy 
said Jezza bell could not find the clip,

921
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,460
right?
Because it doesn't fucking exist because

922
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:37,461
I'm not going to call someone a road 
fuck next to my wife on my feminist 

923
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:37,461
podcast.

924
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:38,620
Not only that,
you're not going to say it if you didn't

925
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,330
even have sex with them.
We didn't have sex.

926
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,890
Right?
So this is just,

927
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,920
they just decided to take this 
characterization by this one woman did 

928
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,040
in flavor the article.
Yes.

929
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,380
It's very unfair.
And Dude,

930
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:55,381
like,
is this punishment you think for you 

931
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:56,560
because you somehow or another.
So that's why it becomes easy.

932
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:58,240
And,
and just to be like incredibly clear,

933
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:00,790
like if this woman was like hurt by 
that,

934
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,970
that sucks man.
I've been burned by girls can do 

935
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,031
anything if she didn't,
if she was hurt because you didn't 

936
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:10,420
eventually become her girlfriend,
her boyfriend rather.

937
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,090
That's just on her.
Sure.

938
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,380
Unless you're mischaracter no,
no,

939
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,690
no,
no.

940
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,880
It's,
I'm just trying to be.

941
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,220
You're trying to be nice.
That'd be nice.

942
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,770
Yeah.
Well I assume she is probably,

943
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:28,771
you know,
she's probably taken out of context as 

944
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:28,771
well.

945
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:30,780
There's a real problem with writing 
things about people and one of the real 

946
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,141
problems with writing things about 
people is they don't get a chance to 

947
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
respond in real time to things you're 
saying.

948
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:35,770
So you establish a narrative and then 
you keep going with it.

949
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,110
You write paragraph after paragraph with
no,

950
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,400
no one responding to them months later.
I counter to,

951
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,340
I saw like the,
the,

952
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,420
the woman who wrote the article,
like there was a request in my like 

953
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,240
other inbox and facebook that like you 
don't even see it and like for a 

954
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,240
comment.
So like,

955
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,390
I mean I got,
she did reach out,

956
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,690
but at that point I was a,
at that point I was literally googling 

957
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,030
ways to kill myself.
So I'm like,

958
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:03,031
I did,
I did not get back to googling ways to 

959
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:03,031
kill yourself for real.
Yeah,

960
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:07,230
for real.
So we'll just to like why put it on the 

961
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:07,230
article?

962
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,860
So here's what happened,
and this goes to your question before 

963
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,220
because I had called so many people 
sexist because I had sort of made my 

964
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,390
almost career by that.
Um,

965
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
it was fucking fun man.
When people heard about this like,

966
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:29,370
and you see the headlines and this is 
another problem with like click bait 

967
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,551
journalism.
The headlines look like I was fucking 

968
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:34,560
accused of rape.
There was a one article that used the 

969
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,471
word sexual harassment.
Sexual misconduct was in all the 

970
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:37,471
headlines.
What is that?

971
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:41,170
I,
I've seen that one about people 

972
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,550
connected to Harvey Weinstein,
like about Ben Affleck,

973
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:45,280
they called it sexual misconduct.
What does that mean?

974
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:50,281
Like,
but in something that you don't think 

975
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:50,281
they should do,
what's really creepy?

976
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,960
Eagle and I almost lost a job.
I did just lose a gig because when you 

977
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,900
google and be like sexual misconduct 
stuff and like that's really a scary and

978
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:00,190
again,
I don't want to be like,

979
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,080
you know who the real victim of Harvey 
Weinstein is?

980
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,970
Jamie Kilstein.
But like,

981
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,950
uh,
let me just stop you right here.

982
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,700
If you say like one more time,
I fucking head's going to explode dude.

983
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,480
I get comments like that.
It's brutal.

984
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:11,860
It's a brutal.
Isn't as bad as.

985
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,770
All right.
I'm going to,

986
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,970
I just want you to slow it down.
I'm going to use it every now and then.

987
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,870
Flip this coffee over here.
Breaking like the light meter.

988
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,460
I'm gonna.
Do it to men.

989
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,350
A lot of people do it.
It's an easy one to do.

990
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,010
I'm going to hit switched to water,
but that word is a,

991
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,690
it's an,
it's a.

992
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,790
people use it as um,
I know,

993
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,870
I know.
It's okay.

994
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,440
I do it too.
We all do it,

995
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:33,960
but it's just,

996
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,560
it's nice to know.
Yeah,

997
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,110
no,
I,

998
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,220
it's also a very progressive thing.
Like there's a way that people talk,

999
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:45,221
like when they're really progressive 
that like you don't hear like left wing 

1000
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:48,371
people talk.
I keep getting fucked over by the 

1001
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:49,730
progressive's.
It's a way of appearing.

1002
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:56,350
What's the word?
Submissive or passive?

1003
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,740
Yeah.
It's not a,

1004
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:59,720
it's not an aggressive way of 
communicating.

1005
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,920
All right.
What if I said like,

1006
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:04,970
but like I kept punching the table like 
as I did it on a fucking like,

1007
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,090
you know,
like go to like step to me just smash up

1008
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,920
perhaps a can.
So.

1009
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:18,010
So you got a bunch of people that were 
upset at you because you had embodied 

1010
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,200
the quintessential allies.

1011
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:26,290
So it was there.
Nobody had a reason to like me or to 

1012
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,050
defend me.
On one half of the twittersphere you had

1013
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,520
progressives who thought I was a sexual 
creep.

1014
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,780
And then on the other half you have 
comedy fans who are like,

1015
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,810
fuck this dude.
He's the one who called everyone a 

1016
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:43,810
sexist.
You don't need to read the article.

1017
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,630
If you see a headline.
I mean,

1018
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:49,631
God,
I attacked so many people without 

1019
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:51,251
fucking reading the articles.
Of course there are people to this day 

1020
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:52,250
that will come up on citizen radio that 
I don't know why I was mad at.

1021
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:55,010
I would just figure out the story as we 
were covering it and be like,

1022
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,240
Yep,
fuck that guy.

1023
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,840
I guess of course.
And so nobody.

1024
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:02,600
There was no reason to root for me.
There wasn't a strong enough fan base.

1025
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:04,430
It wasn't like if,
you know,

1026
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,650
a bigger comic gets accused of 
something.

1027
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,650
Well he has thousands or millions of 
fans and then this small community who 

1028
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,690
accused him of something I had sort of 
nobody and when I burnt all the bridges 

1029
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,700
and in comedy and you know,
I never just showed up at clubs to do 

1030
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,771
sets and stuff like that.
I just had this audience and sort of 

1031
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:24,380
thought I could never get fired,
you know,

1032
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,110
like when,
when Allie and I sort of became more 

1033
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,610
platonic before the open relationship.
I mean there were days it was,

1034
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,340
it was.
So,

1035
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:34,910
uh,
you know,

1036
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:39,911
I mean I would sleep on the couch,
but there were days I would go on the 

1037
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:42,761
road and I would not cheat and I would 
go back to the hotel and shirk off and 

1038
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:42,761
like my orgasm was better because I'm 
like,

1039
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:46,760
I saved citizen radio.
Like I was trying so hard not to,

1040
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,480
not to do anything like that.
And so anyway,

1041
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:51,980
I lost.
Yeah,

1042
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:54,410
there was no one to root for me.
I just had this small audience.

1043
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,440
A small audience either thinks I'm a 
Predator or they're too nervous to say 

1044
00:43:59,440 --> 00:43:59,440
anything.
Well,

1045
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,530
you fit the quintile,
you,

1046
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:06,531
you,
there's a classic view of what a male 

1047
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:09,941
feminist is in that classic view is a 
sneaky guy that is like getting in tight

1048
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:13,220
with women and saying all the things 
they really want to hear.

1049
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:18,610
And the classic story is that those 
women are never attracted to that guy 

1050
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,220
anyway.
And one up and go and fuck some jocks.

1051
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:25,221
I'm Alpha Guy.
I didn't mean that's literally what 

1052
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:25,221
happened was like,
yeah,

1053
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:25,221
you don't say like,
do you?

1054
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:28,010
But it's just this thing that people,
there's,

1055
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,840
it's just.
Well,

1056
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,250
it's a cliche and I totally,

1057
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,400
and I also think it was the homophobic 
politician who sucks a Dick,

1058
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,570
right?
Where they're like the super religious 

1059
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,960
guy who turns out to actually be gay.
Like Ted,

1060
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,020
what is that guy's name?
The guy from Colorado.

1061
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,660
Can we just say careers and started?
You probably couldn't,

1062
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,080
right?
It was definitely a price.

1063
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,240
Yeah.
And so haggard Ted Haggard.

1064
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,960
Yes.
Yeah.

1065
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,770
And the Chinese have a bit about them 
and who didn't.

1066
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,580
And so this is what happens.
Yeah.

1067
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:06,300
This is sort of the problem with acting 
like you don't have flaws.

1068
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:08,220
And I always did.
I thought on the show,

1069
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:13,221
my favorite parts of my show were when I
talked about a depression or alcoholism 

1070
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:18,741
and,
and we would get emails in from people 

1071
00:45:18,741 --> 00:45:21,561
who said it really helped them and I 
wanted to talk so much about that stuff 

1072
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:27,050
because I,
I do think it's important to examine 

1073
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,050
your flaws,
but on a political level,

1074
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,530
I held myself up as like an untouchable.

1075
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,540
I think you were doing essentially the 
same thing that you were talking about 

1076
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,961
doing on twitter where you're addicted 
to this positive response and you're 

1077
00:45:38,961 --> 00:45:43,210
addicted to saying these things about 
people and attacking people there.

1078
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,950
It's a real problem on the left where 
there are people that essentially a 

1079
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,940
giant majority of what they do is 
attacking people.

1080
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:58,941
Yeah.
And you also get scared about what you 

1081
00:45:58,941 --> 00:46:00,801
can talk about.
So one of the things that would come up 

1082
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,430
a lot was like fat shaming stories on 
the show,

1083
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,200
but what also came up was like I fucking
loved Jujitsu and so we would get emails

1084
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,030
from people who are like,
Yo,

1085
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:11,910
my doctor just said like I have to lose 
weight or I'm fucked or whatever.

1086
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,240
And the first thing I would recommend,
like I would give that advice and I 

1087
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,240
would be like Jujitsu,
go fucking do Jujitsu.

1088
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,640
And then we got countless emails from 
people who are like,

1089
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,530
Yo,
I lost 100 pounds because I did Jujitsu.

1090
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:23,580
Yo,
I just got my blue belt.

1091
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,320
Like I feel confident for the first time
or whatever.

1092
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,370
And then we would get emails,
a counter emails being like,

1093
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,100
I don't want you to talk about that 
because that's fat shaming to me.

1094
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,570
And I couldn't say that's fucking crazy.
I couldn't say,

1095
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,600
why couldn't you say that?
Because it would be fetching it in the 

1096
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,871
box that I had put myself in.
I couldn't say that I was capable of 

1097
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:44,871
saying it.
I thought it.

1098
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:49,071
I set it off the air.
Can you see this is where it gets real 

1099
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:50,990
problematic when it comes to expressing 
your ideologies.

1100
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,640
Like if you can't be honest about your 
actual thoughts,

1101
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:55,890
then what you're doing is bullshit 
bullshit.

1102
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,190
And there is a,
the the other side to the validation of 

1103
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,620
ones you find yourself in a box is the,
is the policing of it.

1104
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,930
So there's validation on one side and 
then there's,

1105
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,330
Oh,
I can get kicked out on the other side.

1106
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:10,800
Right?
Like if I say this word,

1107
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:14,880
I can get kicked out if I say that.
Like you should not fucking come down on

1108
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:17,670
someone for doing Jujitsu and getting 
into better shape than you.

1109
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:22,671
If you don't want to do it.
I'm not saying this guy is doing 

1110
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:22,671
Jujitsu,
so fuck you for being fat.

1111
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:24,450
I'm saying this guy's doing Jujitsu.
We should be proud of this guy who saved

1112
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:26,790
his life.
That's not fat shaming.

1113
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,820
And there's so much of that projection 
from the left were [inaudible] on 

1114
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,330
twitter in general where it's like,
why is that though?

1115
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,320
I mean it,
it really is the ideology thing.

1116
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:42,350
So like you are unable to criticize 
anyone that's in your team because this 

1117
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:47,770
is essentially what's going on.
So they're using the phrase fat shaming,

1118
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,330
which is obviously a progressive 
ideology or it fits right into it.

1119
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,780
But for someone to say that you're fat 
shaming by discussing people 

1120
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,830
successfully managing their health,
that's fucking intense where it gets 

1121
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:01,990
crazy.
But if you,

1122
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,380
if you wanted to,
you wanted to talk about.

1123
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,280
Of course I did.
Allison,

1124
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,620
who as well?
Um,

1125
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,330
I mean I can't speak for her.
Right?

1126
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:15,331
But you guys have conversations off the 
air about what this is crazy would have 

1127
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:16,690
conversations about that.
And uh,

1128
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,190
you know,
because you don't.

1129
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,170
Because fat shaming sex,
right?

1130
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:22,060
Like if someone gets fired for being 
like,

1131
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,370
that's the thing.
I think there's a middle ground,

1132
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:29,590
so slippery road when you can honestly 
communicate and this is what the debate 

1133
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:29,650
side gets silenced.
It's done.

1134
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:31,960
And that's what happens with,
you know,

1135
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:36,961
I was listening to a,
I think it was Sam's podcast with the 

1136
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,250
guy who got screened off of that campus.
Sam Harris,

1137
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,450
Jordan Peterson maybe.
Oh No,

1138
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,640
no.

1139
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,950
The guy that was a halloween costume 
wise,

1140
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,030
um,
the,

1141
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:51,031
uh,
from it was him and his wife and he was 

1142
00:48:51,031 --> 00:48:52,510
just like,
sounded like the sweetest guy.

1143
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:52,910
Great.
Good.

1144
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,040
I just knew,
I was like,

1145
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,570
I fucking,
I don't remember when,

1146
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,760
but I can guarantee there's an episode 
about that guy was just like,

1147
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,140
I was defending my wife.
I'm,

1148
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,190
I've given to progressive causes my 
whole life.

1149
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,340
I just tried to talk to them and yeah,
he would raise his hand and they would 

1150
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,310
call it like a fucking,
some kind of like microaggression or,

1151
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:10,720
or I don't,
I don't even remember what,

1152
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,180
you know,
what happened to evergreen,

1153
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,790
evergreen steaks.
I heard it on your show.

1154
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:16,600
It was,
yeah.

1155
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:17,830
Oh yeah,
I did hear that episode.

1156
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:18,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

1157
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:21,160
That's a,
that's a very extreme example.

1158
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:23,410
What they were telling the president to 
put his hands down.

1159
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,460
That's what I said,
because you are making these,

1160
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:27,070
this,
you're being aggressive with your hands.

1161
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,220
So he did put his hands down and they 
started laughing because that's what's 

1162
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,220
really going on.
It's a game.

1163
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,130
Well,
and the thing is too,

1164
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:38,131
it's like we have such legit racism and 
sexism in this country and I feel like 

1165
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,300
we should be going after those issues.
Right.

1166
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:48,330
Well that's why I think you are.
This conversation is very important 

1167
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:52,690
because you are an example of someone 
who got caught up in the ideology of 

1168
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,460
things where your intentions were good 
in the beginning,

1169
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,940
but you got caught up in this whole 
leftwing spiral.

1170
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,060
Yeah.
That's the thing is if you go extreme,

1171
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,220
right?
I feel like,

1172
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:04,300
you know,
if I had like a big,

1173
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,930
like Nazi kill the Jews,
like closing prop bit.

1174
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,550
I feel like I would know I was selling 
out,

1175
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:12,700
you know,
but on the left it's a creep man because

1176
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:14,320
you really feel like,
again,

1177
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:16,750
the baseline of homophobia is bad.
Sexism is bad,

1178
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,890
racism is bad.
Those are good things.

1179
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:25,891
Right?
So when it starts to creep into the 

1180
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:26,980
language policing and stuff like that,
at least for me,

1181
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,280
I didn't really

1182
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,680
notice it.
I would notice it sometimes and be like,

1183
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:35,710
man,
I wish I could say this and I wouldn't 

1184
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:36,800
because I wouldn't wanna get in trouble 
and it bit me in the ass anyway.

1185
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,250
And you know.
So the suicide stuff was like,

1186
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,000
yeah,
like I had,

1187
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,920
I had nothing people on twitter stopped 
doing shows.

1188
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,900
Oh,
I stopped,

1189
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,430
I got a day job for the first time in 
like 15.

1190
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:54,850
What are you doing for a living years?
A jujitsu stuff.

1191
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,280
Um,
and uh,

1192
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,260
you know,
but even this stuff like I don't want to

1193
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:06,440
put that fucking job is in jeopardy.
Right?

1194
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:10,490
Like at least it's something I love and,
but yeah,

1195
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:12,590
I couldn't perform.
I didn't because again,

1196
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:13,190
remember,
like,

1197
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,040
so you felt like your audience was gone?
Audience gone.

1198
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:16,790
Oh,
straight up.

1199
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,910
I mean there was a facebook comment,
I just stopped going online,

1200
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:22,310
but there was a facebook comment from 
the day before there was like,

1201
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,010
just so you know,
you saved me from killing myself.

1202
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,040
And then the next day when all that shit
broke loose,

1203
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,160
like you know,
you can like add a comment to your 

1204
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,160
comment.
It was like,

1205
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,160
fuck you,
I hope you whatever.

1206
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,030
Same dude like literally added it to his
comment,

1207
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:40,110
but you need to think about some of the 
things that you said and realized that 

1208
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:44,161
you didn't really mean them,
but you were saying them because you 

1209
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:45,580
want your trading in the currency of 
political,

1210
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,470
correct,
left wing,

1211
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,150
progressive ideology thinking.
Right?

1212
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,860
And you were,
you were getting from that.

1213
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,920
But you gotta realize these other people
are doing the same thing.

1214
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,260
Like they don't really mean what they're
saying.

1215
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,000
They feel like they have to say,
fuck you.

1216
00:51:58,001 --> 00:51:59,410
I hope you die.
Jamie Kilstein.

1217
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,580
They don't even know you well.
I think we have a real problem both left

1218
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:06,610
and right in this country with attacking
people.

1219
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,640
And I hate to say this,
but I think we have a problem with doing

1220
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:14,641
that with trump because although he has 
done some reprehensible things and he 

1221
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:18,520
said some really foolish things and his 
ego is ridiculous.

1222
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:20,590
There's a lot of things wrong with him.
Right?

1223
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:24,670
But the,
the attacks on him at all this attacking

1224
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:30,060
instead of sort of laying out a better 
way instead of explaining what's wrong 

1225
00:52:31,991 --> 00:52:36,991
with it,
it's all insulting and attacking that 

1226
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:36,991
doesn't fix anything and it's not

1227
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:41,330
going to.
And it also is going to make his people 

1228
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:41,330
double down and they're not gonna want 
to listen to it either.

1229
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:41,980
My point.
And that's what I.

1230
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:46,981
that's what I noticed.
That's why you never want a twitter 

1231
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:46,981
argument.
Right?

1232
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:46,981
Do you have like extreme one side,
an extreme other side is like,

1233
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:51,721
cool,
you're gonna solve this in 140 

1234
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:51,721
characters.
That's right.

1235
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:53,160
The problem is also people start 
insulting each other.

1236
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,490
It just doesn't work.
It doesn't yet.

1237
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,860
It becomes a contest.
It's like you try to do that and I go 

1238
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,030
check and then you go check and then we 
move in back and forth and you're trying

1239
00:53:03,031 --> 00:53:03,670
to fucking get.

1240
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,120
Yeah.
And then like people's twitter bios or 

1241
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,280
like their whole bio or like here's a 
list of people who blocked me.

1242
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:11,750
It's like Yo man,
if that's your fucking,

1243
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,470
that's your resume,
that's your life accolades.

1244
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:19,471
Like that's such a bummer.
And I wouldn't have people block me and 

1245
00:53:19,471 --> 00:53:22,891
I never even communicated with them 
because I somehow or another I got on 

1246
00:53:22,891 --> 00:53:26,881
some sort of a list or someone decided 
that was about a guy I use that and I 

1247
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:26,881
don't

1248
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:28,520
know how to reverse it because now,
uh,

1249
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,690
I'm friends with allegiance escape guys.
And I was like,

1250
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,750
oh,
I think I blocked everyone.

1251
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,870
It's called like twitter,
blockchain or something.

1252
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,380
And so I would go to your profile if 
like all of your fans are attacking me.

1253
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,280
And I'm like,
fuck this,

1254
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:43,360
uh,
I go to your profile and then I click 

1255
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,051
it.
And it blocks everyone who follows you 

1256
00:53:45,051 --> 00:53:45,051
a,
it's not just that like people,

1257
00:53:45,051 --> 00:53:47,300
there's,
there's groups that people have decided,

1258
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,140
I've seen that,
that,

1259
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:54,141
that they decide you're right wing 
decide your anti progressive or 

1260
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:55,260
whatever.
I'm like,

1261
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:57,330
I hate lesson blocked by people that 
were like,

1262
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,920
I never even communicated with this 
person.

1263
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:03,840
It's like a screenshot of someone's 
saying something absolutely ridiculous.

1264
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:04,950
And I'll go,
oh my God,

1265
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,350
I got to go to this guy's page.
Yeah.

1266
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:10,050
And then I go there was on block,
which by the way you fucking dummies.

1267
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:15,070
Oh you have to do is sign out of 20 and 
then I go to your page and then I read 

1268
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,190
it all can't really block someone.
Like what?

1269
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:20,670
I know what I found myself,
like looking through all those.

1270
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:24,190
I was like fuck out of this.
So I,

1271
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,300
I will say cautionary tale.
Oh my God,

1272
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:32,750
I will.
That's going to be what my Edinburgh 

1273
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:32,750
show is called a cautionary Beta male 
tail.

1274
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,220
Are you going to do?
And I think so.

1275
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:36,390
I will all.
I want to just be a comic.

1276
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:39,630
I did stand up at a festival and it was 
so fucking fun.

1277
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,700
I did it the night after.
Stan hopes.

1278
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,360
Yeah.
Podcasts have material written down,

1279
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,930
stuff about like this.
And I hadn't been the first time.

1280
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:50,010
He didn't stand up.
And how long?

1281
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,640
Well if you're not counting like the 
weird like slam poetry music shows.

1282
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,690
I did like five slash six years and then
it was the first time I've been on stage

1283
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,100
in a year.
I mean,

1284
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,200
so first time you've been on stage in a 
year and the first time outside of,

1285
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,760
because I saw something that you did,
uh,

1286
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,790
were you,
you were doing like what you're saying,

1287
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:09,030
look,
sort of slam poetry.

1288
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:12,150
We take these big deep breaths in 
between each line and your power.

1289
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,280
It's almost a performance art piece is 
doing the actual standard.

1290
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,630
You don't pause,
you can't hear that.

1291
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:20,480
They're not laughing.
My friend just,

1292
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,260
you know,
you had a thing.

1293
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:27,430
It was a cadence.
It was like I'm a drummer and also when 

1294
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:27,720
I wasn't getting booked,
like after nine slash 11,

1295
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,010
my stuff was really political and I 
wasn't getting booked in New York,

1296
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:35,280
so I would just go to slam poetry places
and I just made,

1297
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,870
if I had a gay rights joke,
I'm like,

1298
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,900
oh,
well let's just do a three minute gay 

1299
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:41,900
rights chunk.

1300
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:41,900
Right.
And so I started to get booked,

1301
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,050
but at some of it was really well 
written.

1302
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:48,051
I saw this one thing that you did in 
front of some big giant group of people 

1303
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:48,051
about,
uh,

1304
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:50,840
the trump boys.
And uh,

1305
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,770
oh,
that was at the Lib qualys show.

1306
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,650
Yeah.
All this shit happened like right after.

1307
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:56,760
Yeah,
it was,

1308
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,870
it was a real bummer right after I,
I'm in La,

1309
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,330
my.
Because I was suicidal in New York,

1310
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,490
which I've never talked about publicly 
before.

1311
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,150
Before that was very,
I was very,

1312
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,890
very,
very suicidal.

1313
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,140
Here's,
Oh,

1314
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,850
I was just in a,
I don't want to say like love,

1315
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,940
I don't want to be mean,
but it was in like a failed 

1316
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:21,940
relationship.
Right,

1317
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,381
right.
And I didn't have friends and I wasn't 

1318
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:25,381
doing comedy.

1319
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,060
Why don't you have friends in New York?
I had friends when I would do Jujitsu at

1320
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,600
friends of Marcello's,
like those guys were absolutely the best

1321
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:33,610
friends I had,
but I didn't have,

1322
00:56:33,611 --> 00:56:37,960
I didn't feel like I had like a career 
and I had a couple friends.

1323
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:42,961
I mean all of our friends were pretty 
much linked to that same sort of 

1324
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:45,451
progressive circle when I went home to 
see my brothers and I could talk how I 

1325
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:49,681
want it to and I could shoot the shit 
and I could like not police my own 

1326
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:49,681
language.
It was amazing.

1327
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:54,330
I would,
I would go walk around blocks just to 

1328
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,521
talk to my brother Nick,
like for hours and we would just laugh 

1329
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:59,680
and tell jokes and shit like that.
And then I had depression forever and 

1330
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,750
I've been self hating forever and you 
know,

1331
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,760
this is not,
I can't by any means blaming on other 

1332
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:06,760
people,
but I remember,

1333
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,580
and this kind of ties in,
this is really fucked up.

1334
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,930
This kind of ties into what you were 
talking about with like microaggressions

1335
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,650
and,
and,

1336
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:18,810
and stuff like that.
I remember I tried to open up to 

1337
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,201
somebody very close to me about being 
suicidal and they told me that,

1338
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,560
um,
I forget the progressive word for it,

1339
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,500
but they said it was like manipulative.
Essentially.

1340
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:34,950
You being depressed was a minute of me 
being suicidal by telling them I was 

1341
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,570
suicidal because I was telling them what
you're looking for help right now.

1342
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:39,730
With that said,
the people who were like,

1343
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:41,320
if you break up with me,
I'm going to kill myself.

1344
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,210
That's fucked up.
Right.

1345
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,600
That's like holding them hostage or 
making them feel like they would be 

1346
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,451
responsible.
That I guess I would consider that's 

1347
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:51,451
manipulative,
right?

1348
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:51,510
Well,
it's certainly not good.

1349
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,610
It's not healthy yet.
Totally.

1350
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,820
And,
but when you reach out for help,

1351
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,870
but that's fucked up.

1352
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:04,050
And so I didn't,
I didn't feel like I had a lot of 

1353
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,511
people.
I had my family and stuff like that and 

1354
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:07,990
that's why one of the reasons I moved to
La as I came out to here and I did a big

1355
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:11,320
show and it was great and I love La and 
I've always wanted to live here.

1356
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,090
So once my relationship ended I was 
like,

1357
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,800
I've always wanted to go to la.
I'm going to go to La.

1358
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,460
So I go to La and then the winter,
right?

1359
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,160
Dude,
every New Yorker who's like,

1360
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,570
oh fuck la,
they're all like,

1361
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:23,350
fake happy.
I'm like,

1362
00:58:23,351 --> 00:58:24,220
no bro.
They're happy,

1363
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:29,221
happy because it's gorgeous and like 
we're eating Avocados by the pool and 

1364
00:58:29,221 --> 00:58:29,890
it's sunny and everyone's really nice

1365
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,850
interest was like,
I want to be in New York Yorker man.

1366
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:34,770
And now he's like,
fuck that dude.

1367
00:58:34,771 --> 00:58:36,650
I did one winter.
I'm moving though.

1368
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,720
He's moving back before this winter.
He's like,

1369
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:41,270
I can't do it anymore,
man.

1370
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,720
It's just cold and everyone's mean to 
you and Jujitsu.

1371
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:50,790
I don't like the main road,
so mean and Jujitsu in New York when 

1372
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,771
like in the winter where you'd be so 
fucking cold and then you leave the gym 

1373
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:58,101
and you're so hot,
but you have your dumb jacket on and 

1374
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,321
then you have the subway and you have to
rip your jacket off and you got off the 

1375
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:00,321
subway and you're freezing again.
It's like that.

1376
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:01,470
You know what the solution to that,
by the way,

1377
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,170
it's non Vegan,
but reno wool,

1378
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,770
Merino wool,
because Merino wool,

1379
00:59:07,771 --> 00:59:11,280
when you're wet to keep irritating teat,
it's uh,

1380
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,340
it's a,
it also keeps you cool when you're 

1381
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:16,340
hunters use it.
It's around.

1382
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:16,340
No Shit.
Yeah.

1383
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:19,560
There's a company called First Light Lit
II and they,

1384
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:22,280
uh,
they make like really Marino will

1385
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,730
wool clothing for hunting and they're 
one of the first guys to figure it out.

1386
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,520
That's what it is,
is it's a natural fiber,

1387
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,180
has a wool and wool.
It's a weird thing,

1388
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:34,120
like if you have a cotton shirt on,
okay.

1389
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,130
And you get wet from sweat,
like say if you hike up a hill,

1390
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,060
but it's cold out and then you sit down,
you will freeze your fucking ass off and

1391
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,790
it's really bad.
Like you can get hypothermia that way,

1392
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,030
but if you have wool on it retains the 
heat,

1393
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,500
the buyer,
even if it's wet,

1394
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,890
it's really weird.
So if you just were a,

1395
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:54,680
um,
a base layer of Merino wool,

1396
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,020
like when you go out,
like in cold weather,

1397
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:02,380
you will get wet from the sweat,
but your body will retain heat to stay 

1398
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:02,380
warm.

1399
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,270
Well now in la I got to pull up the 
fucking Hensley was my little 

1400
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,150
preassembled chain.
Say Bye to everybody and get back in my 

1401
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:09,150
car.
Yeah,

1402
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:09,960
it's fascinating.

1403
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:15,060
Yeah.
You have to lay a towel down so you 

1404
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,060
don't sweat through your seat.

1405
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,060
Yeah,
yeah,

1406
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,060
yeah.
Totally.

1407
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,400
So,
uh,

1408
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,500
so yeah.
So I moved to La and I met my girlfriend

1409
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:20,930
and it's like the most healthy,
wonderful relationship.

1410
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:25,931
My poor girl,
my girlfriend was a comedy fan when she 

1411
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:27,980
met me and not a feminist and she saw me
at cobb's.

1412
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:31,700
I was one of the clubs.
I would still like play me and I,

1413
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:36,701
uh,
and when we first met I think she got 

1414
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:39,581
excited that she was going to date a 
comic because she's like a huge comedy 

1415
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:42,641
fan dude and you know,
we moved in together and she would be 

1416
01:00:42,641 --> 01:00:42,641
like,
you know,

1417
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:43,910
is exaggerated,
but it would be like,

1418
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:45,770
do you listen to bill burrs podcast?
And I'd be like,

1419
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:50,830
Oh,
well let me tell you why he's 

1420
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:50,830
problematic and upholds the patriarchy 
and she must've been like,

1421
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,500
fucking shit.
But she's like,

1422
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,330
I'm getting the kind of,
yeah,

1423
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,930
kind of.
And now once all this shit happened,

1424
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:59,840
I get to discover all these great people
I wasn't allowed to watch.

1425
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:04,930
I'm like,
did you know that these woody Allen 

1426
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,221
movies are good?
And I've watched Manchester by the sea 

1427
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:06,221
and it was great.

1428
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:06,221
I met you,
I met you.

1429
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:10,791
You were deep in the throes or you were 
beginning your journey of progressivism.

1430
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,300
Yeah.
And you were,

1431
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:13,290
you were on your way.

1432
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,540
First show we did was great.
I don't think we know.

1433
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:15,750
No,

1434
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,680
no,
that's not what I mean.

1435
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:17,910
I mean,
but what I'm saying is,

1436
01:01:17,911 --> 01:01:21,540
but I knew people that knew you from 
back in the day,

1437
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,000
like stanhill Oh,
right.

1438
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,690
I remember what kills team is just a 
comic.

1439
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,720
It was just a comment because one of us,
and then he let you assume this 

1440
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,020
identity,
but um,

1441
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:34,140
all of us are susceptible to ideologies 
and be like,

1442
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Jordan Peterson had a really fascinating
take a nazi-ism about these,

1443
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:44,660
these people that became Nazis.
And what's most terrifying about it is 

1444
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,970
that have you were in their exact same 
shoes.

1445
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:51,870
You are a human being and it is quite 
possible that you could have been a Nazi

1446
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:53,840
too.
And that is terrifying people.

1447
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,300
But that obviously that's a very evil 
ideology.

1448
01:01:57,301 --> 01:02:00,150
But ideologies in general,
we're all susceptible to them.

1449
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:02,310
I've been susceptible to ideologies my 
whole life.

1450
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:07,311
And it's,
I have a very addictive personality and 

1451
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:10,280
I think that's one of the reasons why 
you and I connect our on Jujitsu things 

1452
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,851
along those lines because you get 
obsessed with these things and they 

1453
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:17,430
become a part of your identity.
And I think for you,

1454
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:20,190
progressivism was in that box.

1455
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,620
It was in that wheelhouse.
Yeah,

1456
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:26,740
and we all crave acceptance and comfort 
and support and a tribe,

1457
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:30,050
right?
Um,

1458
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:34,380
and so and again with progressivism,
it doesn't sound like an evil thing.

1459
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,590
It's not like I was in a gang,
like no parents or warning kids.

1460
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:38,000
Like,
oh,

1461
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,830
I hear Noam Chomsky blasted out of his 
fucking stereo.

1462
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:42,120
Like,
that doesn't happen.

1463
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,730
So you don't really does.
It's really slow anyway,

1464
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:46,950
are really,
really slow.

1465
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,190
He talks like this,
it's not a problem.

1466
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,340
I tried to ask him a relationship 
question just to change it up and he was

1467
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:54,510
like,
I'm not going to answer that.

1468
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,450
I was say that.
Yeah.

1469
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,250
And I was like,
I'm sorry.

1470
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:01,430
Wow.
I was trying to be funny at the end of 

1471
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:01,430
the interview relationship question.
I was like,

1472
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:01,430
what do you consider?
It was like,

1473
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:02,550
love or like,
what's your,

1474
01:03:02,551 --> 01:03:03,210
whatever,
like,

1475
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:04,020
oh no.
I was like,

1476
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:05,820
I want to do like love advice with Noam 
Chomsky.

1477
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,810
And it was essentially.
No,

1478
01:03:06,811 --> 01:03:08,300
thank you.
Yeah,

1479
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,340
I'm wearing sweaters.
So goes.

1480
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,390
Yeah,
he's,

1481
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:15,990
he's got a very distinct area that he 
operates in.

1482
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,280
Howard Zinn,
I interviewed,

1483
01:03:17,281 --> 01:03:18,630
he was funny as shit.
Was it?

1484
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,760
Howard was fucking cool.
He was spry.

1485
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:21,600
Yeah,
totally.

1486
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:23,880
He was one of his last interviews at his
house.

1487
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:28,890
Surprise,
a funny thing to say what really old 

1488
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:28,890
dude dude.
Well that.

1489
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:29,220
But that was the first thing I thought 
where he pulled up in his little car and

1490
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:32,130
he had his like whole foods bags and he 
like hopped up the steps.

1491
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:37,131
He's like,
come in and they'll get your orange 

1492
01:03:37,131 --> 01:03:37,131
juice.
And I was like,

1493
01:03:37,131 --> 01:03:37,131
all right,
Howard Zinn.

1494
01:03:37,131 --> 01:03:39,861
And then uh,
he died a couple weeks later like it 

1495
01:03:39,861 --> 01:03:42,670
was,
it was one of the last fucking 

1496
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:42,670
interviews.
And he was like,

1497
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:42,670
that's where Matt Damon,
you still live.

1498
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:42,900
And I was like,
cool,

1499
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:44,430
man.
It was awesome.

1500
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:49,430
It was super cool.
Like I did not see that coming because 

1501
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,681
he just was really high energy.
It was self deprecating and the 

1502
01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:51,681
interviews.
Dude,

1503
01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:51,720
it was awesome.
It was really fun.

1504
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:58,430
Going back to this,
one of the reasons why I really wanted 

1505
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,711
to talk to you is because I think that 
this is this trap of falling into any 

1506
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:01,920
ideology.
I mean,

1507
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,760
I know a lot of people that get really 
wrapped up in right wing ideologies.

1508
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,120
I think it's a trap and I think that 
also this,

1509
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,260
this tribal thing that we do attacking 
people that aren't on that tribe,

1510
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,610
it's a trap to him and you see it when 
you get rewarded for it,

1511
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:21,611
like Pz Myers as a whole career from it 
attacking people and the other side 

1512
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:25,200
instead of.
I think there's a way to get these ideas

1513
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:30,201
across where you're,
you're not going to piss people off and 

1514
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:30,720
I don't think pissing people off is.

1515
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,720
I think there's certain comfort to it,
but there's also people gravitate 

1516
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:38,640
towards you because they don't want you 
to do that to them.

1517
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,050
Yeah,
and I know what I'm saying.

1518
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:41,670
Yeah.
And I think everyone does that,

1519
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:42,800
you know,
like pc,

1520
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:47,850
pc.
I haven't been on twitter and for 

1521
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:47,850
everybody.
Like he was always really nice to me,

1522
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,511
but the people he's also arguing against
her also kind of doing the same thing 

1523
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:54,490
too.
I had this fucking revelation today 

1524
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,460
coming into the studio when I was kind 
of like worst case,

1525
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,930
like battle planning.
I'm like,

1526
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,910
oh,
what if he really hates something?

1527
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:01,050
I say,
and we're gonna get into a fight,

1528
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:02,910
and for the first time ever I was like,
oh,

1529
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:07,911
I could listen to them and ask a 
followup question like I could just 

1530
01:05:07,911 --> 01:05:09,270
because that wasn't an option before.
Because you have your.

1531
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:12,420
Especially when you start going on MSNBC
and these news round tables,

1532
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:13,920
no one asks questions.

1533
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,450
No one goes,
what do you mean by that?

1534
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:19,240
Right.
Guys went on once and you were talking,

1535
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,670
now this is,
this is one time I actually got upset at

1536
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:23,440
you.
They're not upset at you,

1537
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:27,190
but upset at the idea time to around the
eye.

1538
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:32,191
You were going on after Charlie Hebdo 
and you were saying that the cartoons 

1539
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:38,101
that they did was.
We were really racist and my thought 

1540
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:38,950
was,
it's so fucking what you know.

1541
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:43,951
Even if they were racist,
these people got gunned down and killed 

1542
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:45,160
because of ridiculous religious 
ideology.

1543
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:50,190
This is what this is about.
This is about not being able to draw 

1544
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:50,190
Muhammad well,
and I think that,

1545
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:54,750
but you got wrapped up in this super 
progressive like defense,

1546
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:59,790
but you're also.
It was so confusing to me because the 

1547
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:04,531
term Islamophobia is a very interesting 
one to me because it's always used 

1548
01:06:04,531 --> 01:06:04,960
essentially on the left.

1549
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,850
It's very rarely used on the right.
Right.

1550
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:11,530
And Islam promotes violence against 
women.

1551
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,660
It,
it is,

1552
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,410
it's very.
In terms of like,

1553
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,860
it's suppression of women's rights.
I mean,

1554
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:18,240
it's,
it's,

1555
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:21,100
it's very ancient.
It's ideas.

1556
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:24,550
Most religions do.
That is a very uniquely suppressive one.

1557
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,830
I don't know if you actually take the 
Bible literally.

1558
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,170
Did you know that?
Like the Old Testament,

1559
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,560
the Old Testament,
I mean the selling your daughter into 

1560
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,261
prostitution when they're talking about 
someone who is literally taking that 

1561
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:41,890
version of it in practice and killing 
cartoonists for drawing Muhammad.

1562
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:46,910
So here's,
here's what I think you should be able 

1563
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:46,910
to do.
Here's what I've been trying to do,

1564
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,370
where it's like,
I don't understand why you can't go,

1565
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,550
um,
why you can't go racist.

1566
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:52,860
Cartoons are bad,
right?

1567
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:56,290
And hacky killing them is worse,
right?

1568
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,210
You shouldn't,
you shouldn't kill people.

1569
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,410
Or if you go,
you know,

1570
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,980
that uh,
uh,

1571
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:07,350
Islamophobia,
racism against Arab people who you're 

1572
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:12,841
just going to assume are all Muslim and 
not just all regrets about Islam,

1573
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:17,881
but exactly all like except same 
versions of that homophobic that's bad.

1574
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:22,900
But being sexist in the name of a 
religion is also bad.

1575
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:27,901
Right?
And I think this is what you were 

1576
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:27,901
talking about where it comes down to,
well,

1577
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:31,831
you got to pick a side deal.
It's either everybody's racist or every 

1578
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:34,790
Muslim is a murder and it's like you 
don't have to pick a side and,

1579
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:40,020
and,
and post this fallout when I've been 

1580
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,020
like,
I mean,

1581
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,520
here's the thing,
I've been healthier than I've ever been 

1582
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:44,520
in my life.
Um,

1583
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,270
my girlfriend is fucking wonderful.
I wake up at like five and I meditate 

1584
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,450
and like Jiu Jitsu saved my fucking 
life.

1585
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,800
This literally saved my life this year.
I'm at being off twitter.

1586
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:56,470
Being off social media has been fucking 
great.

1587
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,290
It's been incredible.
And getting to hear,

1588
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,210
like getting to listen to Sam Harris' 
podcast,

1589
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:06,211
getting to listen to your podcast.
Hearing both you guys say like really 

1590
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:06,880
progressive things.
I don't think people know that,

1591
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:12,020
but I think they do.
I think you were just in an echo 

1592
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:12,020
chamber,
but.

1593
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:12,760
Well I think if you don't listen to what
you're saying is side.

1594
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,600
Yeah.
Here's the thing.

1595
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,160
No one's running either side.
No,

1596
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,630
this is what's going on.
It's not,

1597
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:19,150
it's not like,
you know,

1598
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:24,180
you're,
it sounds like it's the dolphins versus 

1599
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:24,180
the raiders.
You know,

1600
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:28,740
like one team has very clear outfits and
they're trying to move the ball across 

1601
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,400
this line.
You know,

1602
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,740
I don't know what any of those words 
meant,

1603
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,760
but I guess,
you know what I'm saying?

1604
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:35,240
I really barely.
I barely do no fighting,

1605
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,240
but the idea is that these,
these sides,

1606
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:43,380
they're very fluid.
They're moving around all the time and 

1607
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:46,870
they solidify with resistance and I 
think when people hear middle or middle 

1608
01:08:47,241 --> 01:08:52,241
ground,
they always see that as wishy washy or 

1609
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:52,241
you're not taking aside.
Yeah,

1610
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:52,241
exactly.
But I.

1611
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:55,790
But I feel like there is still,
there's good middle ground,

1612
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:56,710
like the,
the,

1613
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,720
the,
the racism slash jihadism is really 

1614
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:01,720
good.
Right?

1615
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,860
You can say that both are bad.
You can say the jihadism is bad.

1616
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,810
You can say the fucking profiling 
Muslims is bad.

1617
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:08,510
I don't know what's so fucking hard 
about saying those things,

1618
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:13,540
but also in an attacking all Muslims,
what you are doing is solidifying their 

1619
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:19,511
position as well and you're.
You're making it very hard for them to 

1620
01:09:19,511 --> 01:09:23,830
look.
All religions at one point in time were 

1621
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:27,131
extremely rigid and like you said,
if you go back to the early days of 

1622
01:09:27,131 --> 01:09:27,500
Christianity,
go back to the inquisition.

1623
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:32,510
Mean they did some fucking unbelievably 
horrific things in the name of God in 

1624
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,640
the name of Christianity.
Now,

1625
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:39,641
if you look at where the more moderate 
Muslims are today,

1626
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,590
you know,
I mean there's people that are reformers

1627
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:47,620
that are still,
that's still considered themselves most 

1628
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:47,620
of their grant.
Yeah.

1629
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:47,620
Like,
um,

1630
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,240
you know,
I mean there's a ton.

1631
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,280
I had Hirsi Ali I guess is not no longer
considers himself a Muslim,

1632
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:56,450
but Majid does mentioned wanting a lot 
of them who consider themselves Muslims,

1633
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:59,750
but they're moving towards a more 
progressive ideology.

1634
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:01,760
This,
this is possible,

1635
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,510
but it's only possible if you,
if you're not attacking,

1636
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:09,530
see if you attack.
Then the more radical of that base,

1637
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:14,060
they they lean to that and they lean to 
reinforcing their team.

1638
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:19,090
Well not only the more radical,
but even just the younger ones where if 

1639
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:22,871
you are a 16 year old Muslim kid in 
America and you immigrated here because 

1640
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,600
your fucking family got bombed in Iraq 
or Syria or wherever by us and now 

1641
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:31,880
you're being profiled and being called 
racist names here.

1642
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:34,420
It's like that's how you make extremist.
Yes,

1643
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:37,460
and so it's not only as the racism 
racist,

1644
01:10:37,461 --> 01:10:40,010
but it's also fucking counterproductive 
and a lot of ways.

1645
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,330
A great way to put it.
Yeah.

1646
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:44,360
It's like you are all these wars that we
say we're doing to defeat Islam.

1647
01:10:44,361 --> 01:10:49,361
They're also creating a fuck load of 
extremists who maybe would have been 

1648
01:10:49,361 --> 01:10:49,361
moderate,
but now their houses in a rebel,

1649
01:10:49,361 --> 01:10:50,720
they don't have jobs,
right?

1650
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,920
One hundred percent and they're just 
like,

1651
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:56,921
well,
I'm going to avenge my family and this 

1652
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:56,921
dude says I got to go to heaven.
So fuck yeah,

1653
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:58,010
and this ideology and this,
this point of view,

1654
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:03,090
it's applicable to this whole team 
mentality that we do with right versus 

1655
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,030
left as well.
And that in attacking,

1656
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,140
instead of explaining the positive 
aspects of your positions,

1657
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:14,010
attacking the other positions and 
attacking an ad hominem attacks on

1658
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,590
these people and attacking their 
structure,

1659
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,410
who they are,
attacking them as racist,

1660
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,820
sexist,
homophobic,

1661
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:26,060
instead of reinforcing the very positive
aspects of live and let live about being

1662
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:31,950
open minded and being legitimately 
progressive progress.

1663
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:37,010
You totally.
And I think that one of the things that 

1664
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:39,081
I know I did and everyone I followed on 
twitter did in sort of the progressive 

1665
01:11:39,081 --> 01:11:40,290
world as you would like try to out 
progressive each other.

1666
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:45,291
Right?
So it's like somebody has a progressive 

1667
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:45,291
take on the news.
How do I make it like,

1668
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:45,291
dude,
when,

1669
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:47,730
when same sex marriage became legal,
people be like,

1670
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:50,130
yeah,
well tell that to the People Bama drone.

1671
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:55,131
It's like fuck,
can we just be happy about like one 

1672
01:11:55,131 --> 01:11:56,520
thing or it's like they're finding ways.
Like everyone likes cory booker.

1673
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,830
What can I find that cory booker did 
that was like fucked up?

1674
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,450
Or,
you know,

1675
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:03,180
like the,
I feel like you gave another example,

1676
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:05,370
but it's,
you know,

1677
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,740
I mean that just happened with rose 
McGowan a little bit,

1678
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:07,970
right?

1679
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:12,980
Like she did this really brave thing but
coming out against Harvey Weinstein and 

1680
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:17,121
then people are calling it like white 
lady feminism and it's like the left is 

1681
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:21,351
never going to win if you,
you can't let the rape survivor come 

1682
01:12:21,351 --> 01:12:24,660
forward without attacking her for not 
being raped progressively enough.

1683
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:26,040
Like,
that's nuts.

1684
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:31,340
Um,
and I think that's one of the biggest 

1685
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,681
problems.
Everybody's trying to be the best 

1686
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:33,681
example,
right?

1687
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:37,850
The best example of being progressive 
and shit on someone who's less 

1688
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:37,850
progressive than you.
Yeah.

1689
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,130
Or the most depressed.
Right?

1690
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:44,250
And ramp up the radical aspects of your 
progressive and the most depressed is 

1691
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,650
that we were saying the most oppressed.
And like for like a white guy like me,

1692
01:12:46,651 --> 01:12:48,750
it was like,
well I'm not oppressed.

1693
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:53,751
I'm not gonna start calling myself like 
saying your Kilstein like I'm going to 

1694
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:54,690
be the ally so I'm not oppressed.

1695
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:59,690
Because twitter was a great tool and is 
a great tool where we wouldn't have had 

1696
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:02,610
a lot of like really big.
I think social justice victories without

1697
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:05,280
twitter and it became a really good like
which ones?

1698
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:10,340
Well,
I think it became a good watchdog for 

1699
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:10,340
the police violence.
Right.

1700
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,690
And specifically twitter and not just 
all social media in general.

1701
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,340
Do you think facebook is more of an echo
chamber?

1702
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,010
Like what do you mean?
Facebook?

1703
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:20,220
I kind of just.
I mean at least for me a facebook goes a

1704
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:23,880
little slower and I mainly follow just 
friends on facebook,

1705
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:25,740
but I guess you're right.
I guess facebook and twitter,

1706
01:13:25,741 --> 01:13:30,741
social media.
I think the problem with facebook is 

1707
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:30,741
that people have the opportunity to be 
too verbose.

1708
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:35,270
They can write these gigantic long 
screens and no one's going to fucking 

1709
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:38,961
read it anyway.
You give people too much of an 

1710
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:38,961
opportunity to be self indulgent.

1711
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:40,440
That's all I did.
That's all it is.

1712
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,750
And then you just see it and you see a 
word,

1713
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,640
like you see a word like racism and you 
go,

1714
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:49,641
I guess I.
I Guess I like it because I don't want 

1715
01:13:49,641 --> 01:13:51,441
to not like the big racism,
but then you also become item read 

1716
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:55,911
fucking articles.
If the progressive person I knew shared 

1717
01:13:55,911 --> 01:13:56,460
an article and the headline looked good 
enough,

1718
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,490
I would share the article and then 
that's the shit that happened to me.

1719
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:00,750
How backfired.
Where I'm like,

1720
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:03,120
how many people are actually reading 
these fucking articles?

1721
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:08,121
Reading the articles that say we could 
not find that quote or we can not find 

1722
01:14:08,121 --> 01:14:09,330
whatever.
So all this shit went down.

1723
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:12,190
Jessebelle writes an article about you,
some other people write articles about

1724
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,140
you and you just dropped off the face of
the earth.

1725
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,880
So I just figured,
fuck this.

1726
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:16,960
I'm deleting my twitter.

1727
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,560
Yeah.
I said,

1728
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:18,620
well,
I assumed.

1729
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:19,880
I mean nothing.
I could say.

1730
01:14:19,881 --> 01:14:24,881
Part of me didn't say anything.
Part of me didn't say anything because 

1731
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:25,010
I'm like,
I no longer.

1732
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:28,250
I have to be a real person now.
I can't do shows anymore.

1733
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,750
So why did you say that?
B?

1734
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:36,610
Just because I felt like the,
the only world I knew completely was 

1735
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,380
crashing down and calling me things that
I wasn't.

1736
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:42,770
And,
and I already sort of burned comedy and 

1737
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,180
this is one I don't understand,
like I don't,

1738
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,410
I don't see

1739
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:48,280
big accusation.
We'll see them saying

1740
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:53,570
fuck girls.
Well that's what happens is in my world 

1741
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,740
and former world pre,
you know,

1742
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:01,130
Weinstein and like this is what real 
predators look like.

1743
01:15:01,131 --> 01:15:04,040
It was just fun to go after him and to 
go after me.

1744
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:05,750
But also,

1745
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,400
so as you said,
because you had sort of set up

1746
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:09,730
rotted out myself.
Right.

1747
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,800
And so my girlfriend,
when it happened,

1748
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:16,801
my girlfriend was out of town.
I totally assumed she was breaking up 

1749
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:19,540
with me.
So I'm in La and like,

1750
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:20,650
uh,
my little apartment,

1751
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:22,060
my cat,
my girlfriend,

1752
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:24,490
I assume has gone.
My family's talking to me,

1753
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,500
which is great.
But none of my friends.

1754
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:30,050
Here's something I'll say this about,
this is one of the reasons I came back.

1755
01:15:30,051 --> 01:15:32,150
The comedy,
um,

1756
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:32,650
I mean,
besides,

1757
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:37,651
I always loved it and I missed.
It was the only fucking people that 

1758
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:42,211
reached out to see if I was okay.
We're comics comics who I hadn't talked 

1759
01:15:42,211 --> 01:15:43,540
to in years.
None of the progressive journalists,

1760
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:47,560
none of the people who knew about 
depression or suicide or whatever.

1761
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:52,910
I mean,
I don't even know if they read the 

1762
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:52,910
fucking article like or if they just saw
that word and was like,

1763
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,480
I will get in trouble if I mean Jim 
Norton who I.

1764
01:15:55,481 --> 01:16:00,481
I knew when I was 22,
I probably asked him if I could do a 

1765
01:16:00,481 --> 01:16:03,301
guest spot for him,
but like the stress factory wrote me to 

1766
01:16:03,301 --> 01:16:04,030
see if I was okay like you wrote me a 
really nice email.

1767
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:08,800
Stan hope wrote me a couple of times to 
make sure I was okay and prevents a wow.

1768
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:12,100
It was comics,
comics,

1769
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,380
real comics realize that we're all 
fucked up

1770
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,780
and I didn't go down your road,
but if I was in your shoes,

1771
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:22,781
I might've walked on your road.
It's very possible and to say that you 

1772
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:22,781
couldn't,
I would never be in that position.

1773
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:24,110
I would never do that.
I would never say those things.

1774
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:25,640
That's disingenuous.
It's not true.

1775
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:26,500
Right?
Right.

1776
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,110
I,
I wasn't.

1777
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:29,750
I didn't grow up in your house.
I didn't live your life.

1778
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,670
I don't have your experiences,
your genetics,

1779
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:32,230
your,
your,

1780
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:33,770
your environment.
I didn't have those things.

1781
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:36,170
If I did,
I easily could have gone down your road.

1782
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:41,390
Yeah.
And you know that definitely months 

1783
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:46,160
later when I reached out to Stan hope I 
just reached out to thank him and I said

1784
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:47,730
something that made him laugh and he was
like,

1785
01:16:47,731 --> 01:16:49,260
you can come back to comedy.
And I was like,

1786
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:49,890
no,
I kinda,

1787
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,420
you definitely could.
Well,

1788
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:56,421
yeah.
And he was the one and man after doing 

1789
01:16:56,421 --> 01:16:58,461
that festival and just hanging out with 
like hanging out with just fucking Bert 

1790
01:16:58,461 --> 01:16:59,850
and like a fun dude.
It was so fun.

1791
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:00,420
It was.
So.

1792
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:01,560
We do man.
We have fun.

1793
01:17:01,561 --> 01:17:02,410
Professionalist.
Yeah,

1794
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,940
that's all it is.
And everyone's with this fucking podcast

1795
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:05,270
is.
And you know,

1796
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:10,271
it was crazy.
My girlfriend said this where we were 

1797
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,430
talking about this,
where those guys ball buster more

1798
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,180
than anybody.
Right.

1799
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:14,000
I walked backstage with my girlfriend,
a hug,

1800
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:15,080
Morgan Murphy.
She said,

1801
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:20,060
please don't rate me hug burt hug Bert.
He just said he's touching my dick.

1802
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:25,061
He's touching my neck and started 
running around the room and then they 

1803
01:17:25,061 --> 01:17:28,031
had my back so fucking hard.
Whereas when I was around progressive's 

1804
01:17:28,031 --> 01:17:29,240
were when Diana and I were,
were around.

1805
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,060
They don't ball bust but they do not 
have your back.

1806
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:35,120
It is icy judgment pretty much around 
the clock.

1807
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:40,180
Will they feel like they have to know 
when to cut you off if you do anything 

1808
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:40,430
though.
You crossed the line.

1809
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,440
Right.
And it was,

1810
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,570
it was so wonderful where I was like,
all I want.

1811
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,850
So before that,
yeah,

1812
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:51,650
I assumed I had nothing.
Was literally a to do know.

1813
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,400
When you google how to kill yourself,
the first website that comes up is,

1814
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,190
it's a lie.

1815
01:17:55,370 --> 01:18:00,370
It's they say like easiest way to kill 
yourself and then you click it and it's 

1816
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:00,370
like,
just kidding.

1817
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:05,201
Don't kill yourself.
And it's like heart music and you're 

1818
01:18:05,201 --> 01:18:05,201
just like being rick rolled essentially,
but like a suicide hotline.

1819
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,370
It's nuts.
And then,

1820
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:08,810
uh,
let me kill myself.

1821
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,340
But that's what I was saying.
I was just like,

1822
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,090
I needed someone I could trust in my 
time of need and they were lying to you.

1823
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,000
And then I just started looking through 
ways,

1824
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,230
um,
where I was like,

1825
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:20,660
I don't have a gun,
get a gun.

1826
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,430
I would.
Now I'm Gunna win.

1827
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,870
This fucking happened to get a gun.
I'm like,

1828
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:25,180
I'm gonna kill animals.
I'm like,

1829
01:18:25,181 --> 01:18:29,240
I just fucking book listing.
How did it go from,

1830
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,030
how did you stop being a Vegan?
Like what would happen there?

1831
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,920
No,
I mean I still am like,

1832
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:35,540
I ate a steak with Stan.

1833
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,200
Hope.
Well,

1834
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:37,310
but that doesn't count,
right?

1835
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,080
Fuck.
It doesn't.

1836
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,790
If it's Doug,
how many times have you eaten meat since

1837
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:42,520
this all happened?
Uh,

1838
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:46,250
not many.
I hate that.

1839
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:47,870
I have to say be honest.
But I know I have to say,

1840
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:54,490
look,
let's just go back to me being an 

1841
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:55,921
accused Predator.
I'll give you shit for that meet that I 

1842
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:55,921
killed personally.
You know,

1843
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:56,600
factory farming.
You could eat that.

1844
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,290
Oh yeah,
we can do that.

1845
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,160
Maybe some of it.
Yeah,

1846
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,090
I'll do that.
Okay.

1847
01:18:59,130 --> 01:18:59,720
Yeah.
See there you go.

1848
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,500
Straight up.
You know,

1849
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,660
wild has done it yet.
And through the woods.

1850
01:19:02,661 --> 01:19:03,440
No,
he's going to.

1851
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:06,410
He's going to eat it here.
Should we all do it together?

1852
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,000
We could,
you know,

1853
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:10,700
but I don't know when it's gonna happen.
I can give you some meat right now.

1854
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,290
Alright,
keep me posted on here.

1855
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,750
I will have to commercial freezers back 
here.

1856
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,850
Yeah,
this place is fucking insane.

1857
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:17,680
It's pretty well.
Yeah.

1858
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,860
It's fucking insane.
Needed a fun house.

1859
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,620
I'm so excited for like the mats that 
comes this weekend.

1860
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,930
Does it to this fucking great.
Um,

1861
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:30,260
so this,
this whole journey that you've been on,

1862
01:19:30,261 --> 01:19:35,261
and this is again,
one of the reasons why I want you to 

1863
01:19:35,261 --> 01:19:37,811
come on.
I think we can all learn something from 

1864
01:19:37,811 --> 01:19:40,031
it.
I hope both communities learn something 

1865
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,130
from it.
I mean maybe it's wishful thinking on my

1866
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:42,220
part,
but I really think like we,

1867
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:47,980
this idea of right versus left is so god
damn crazy and we have more common 

1868
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:52,541
ground and we don't.
And I think reasonable people think all 

1869
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:56,291
these,
these core tenants that we were just 

1870
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,340
talking about,
like we think that we're egalitarianism.

1871
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:01,790
I think that women should be treated 
exactly the same way as men.

1872
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,920
That you should be judged by your 
character.

1873
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:07,560
You shouldn't be judged by the color of 
your skin or where are you from?

1874
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:07,910
I mean,

1875
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:10,680
how did the people that I know that are 
cool people we have,

1876
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:13,470
we have black friends,
we have Asian friends.

1877
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:15,360
We don't like.
Especially in the world of comedy,

1878
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:20,361
the,
the only currency that you carry around 

1879
01:20:20,361 --> 01:20:20,361
is your personality and whether or not 
you're good,

1880
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:25,370
whether you're funny,
whether you work hard and when you're 

1881
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:25,380
around people that are funny and work 
hard,

1882
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,790
they,
those people are fuel

1883
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,440
cute.
They're inspirational.

1884
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:29,340
Totally.
And,

1885
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:33,480
and I'll say this,
that I was not a good person.

1886
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:39,140
I don't think,
at least to the standard that I would 

1887
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:42,141
like to hold myself when I was just like
wrapped up into this world and we were 

1888
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:43,210
very.
Well,

1889
01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:44,520
yeah,
I am flawed.

1890
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:49,730
We all are.
But you are using a flawed operating 

1891
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:49,730
system.
Yeah.

1892
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:49,730
And also like,
but I was just,

1893
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:51,570
I was just desperately searching for 
validation.

1894
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:54,240
I was very selfish.
It was really depressed.

1895
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:57,320
And ever since this happened,
I,

1896
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,490
I don't fuck him.
I have not watched.

1897
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,500
I barely watch the news when people are 
like,

1898
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:02,830
trump called North Korea.
Gay.

1899
01:21:02,831 --> 01:21:03,690
I'm like,
I don't know,

1900
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,010
not to me,
like I don't want,

1901
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:07,320
I don't watch that shit anymore.
You just stepped back.

1902
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:10,140
I totally stepped back,
but ever since I sold a year.

1903
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,220
Yup.
Um,

1904
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:13,890
but I mean it wasn't,
I'm saying this right now,

1905
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:14,940
like I'm like,
you know,

1906
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:16,470
I'm just like walking the roads.

1907
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,860
I quite Chang Caine.
I was like,

1908
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,380
in the first I forgot about him.
You ever want to come through?

1909
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,520
The legend continues not as popular.
Uh,

1910
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,380
I fucked them quite as good.
No.

1911
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,930
Well,
but I was like different times.

1912
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:28,430
Yeah,
it was like,

1913
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:30,240
it was,
he was still,

1914
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:32,490
it was modern day.
He was still quite Chang Caine,

1915
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:34,620
but his son was like a street cop if 
it's the fucking.

1916
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,390
It was the best.
It's so good.

1917
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,180
And so,
yeah.

1918
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:43,320
So the first year that kind of died with
a dildo possess a hanging by his neck.

1919
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:44,460
Graduate Ham.
Yeah.

1920
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:46,020
That was Carradine,
that uh,

1921
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:46,880
that was,
that was,

1922
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,320
that was not on the list of suicide 
options that I looked up.

1923
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:54,350
They'll know in the ass hanging.
They think that he might've done 

1924
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:57,711
something to piss off tie gangsters 
because he died in Thailand and he died 

1925
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:01,470
like what would be considered either a 
shameful way.

1926
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,500
I mean,
it was auto erotic comics fixation was 

1927
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:06,600
what they listed,
but what I've heard is,

1928
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:08,460
by the way,
that means nothing,

1929
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:13,790
but what I have heard is that there are 
people that consider the possibility 

1930
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:18,651
that he was murdered.
That's the craziest Shit I've ever 

1931
01:22:18,651 --> 01:22:18,651
heard.
Um,

1932
01:22:18,651 --> 01:22:20,520
and put them in a wetsuit and shoved a 
dildo up his ass and we'll look.

1933
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:22,530
I can't,
I can't complain about my life anymore.

1934
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,110
I didn't have a dildo shoved up my ass 
by ty gangsters.

1935
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:27,300
Apparently.
He wasn't a nice guy really.

1936
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,370
Well that host,
like taking the show from Bruce.

1937
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:30,780
I don't know how much he had to do with 
it,

1938
01:22:30,781 --> 01:22:33,160
but like what companies like Bruce Lee 
that was present,

1939
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,950
he was probably just an actor.
Yeah.

1940
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,870
I just like his people.
Right.

1941
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,150
And nobody knew who he was.
Like no one knew who he was.

1942
01:22:39,151 --> 01:22:39,930
He had zero power.

1943
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:40,740
Yeah,
that's very true.

1944
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:42,420
Um.
Oh,

1945
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:43,650
what I was going to say as.
Yeah,

1946
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:47,070
I don't want to act like this fucking 
hero who just stepped back the first six

1947
01:22:47,071 --> 01:22:52,071
months.
I walked around like I was accused of 

1948
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:53,840
actual sexual crimes.
I had a Hoodie and fucking sunglasses 

1949
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,710
and I felt when I would meet new friends
I would sit them down and be like,

1950
01:22:55,711 --> 01:22:58,280
just so you know,
like there's something I've been accused

1951
01:22:58,281 --> 01:23:00,580
of,
like I was fucking Megan's law pedophile

1952
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,300
and uh,
it was only until recently,

1953
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:03,840
uh,
my girlfriend's like,

1954
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:06,070
you gotTa Stop Dude,
like are owning that.

1955
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,480
You're owning that as like a,
a part of your,

1956
01:23:08,481 --> 01:23:10,690
your person when you,
when you do this.

1957
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:16,050
And to a certain extent I have to write 
like if I meet with like an agent like 

1958
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:17,440
and they google it and they don't read 
it,

1959
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:19,720
it looks fucking shady.
It's not,

1960
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:24,900
but it looks shady and all people do is 
they google and they look at a headline 

1961
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:24,900
and they go,
Oh fuck that.

1962
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,630
I don't want to be around that.
Right.

1963
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,500
But for the second six months or 
whatever,

1964
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,620
I feel like I've been.
My family is like,

1965
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:35,020
this is the most present and 
communicative you've been.

1966
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,080
I feel like I've been a better friend,
my Jujitsu a skyrocket.

1967
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:40,090
I feel like I have a family at my 
Jujitsu school.

1968
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,240
Like I've become a really good teacher.
I read more,

1969
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:45,880
I fucking meditate more.
I'm like an awesome boyfriend.

1970
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:50,880
Like I have such a good healthy fucking 
relationship and I don't think any of 

1971
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:57,301
that shit would have happened if I was 
still in social media world if I still 

1972
01:23:57,301 --> 01:24:00,421
just woke up every day and was like,
what's the Hashtag that I have to tweet 

1973
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:01,240
about?
What are we angry about today?

1974
01:24:01,241 --> 01:24:04,140
Because that's how everyday starts as 
you check twitter and you all.

1975
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:09,150
There's a popular Hashtag.
I have to come up with a fucking joke 

1976
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:11,551
because trump did a thing and it drove 
me crazy and there's part of me that I 

1977
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,230
am like,
maybe I'm selfish,

1978
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:15,130
but uh,
I,

1979
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:20,180
I just,
I would rather be a better person now 

1980
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,030
and try to be a comic.
I also forgot to like comedy fans,

1981
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:24,460
just love comedy.
Like when people came up to me after the

1982
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:29,461
Stan hope show,
I wasn't political on this Dan hope 

1983
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:29,461
show,
but they were like,

1984
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:29,461
hey man,
that was really funny.

1985
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:29,800
And I was like,
oh,

1986
01:24:29,801 --> 01:24:34,801
that's right.
Like you don't have to be overtly 

1987
01:24:34,801 --> 01:24:35,620
fucking preachy or political to like 
make someone's Day.

1988
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,120
Right?
Like it sounds so cheesy.

1989
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:42,121
Currency that you were training in.
I just thought you were trading and 

1990
01:24:42,121 --> 01:24:42,121
progressive currency.
Yeah.

1991
01:24:42,121 --> 01:24:46,531
And I thought dude,
the best and if I ever did was a story 

1992
01:24:46,531 --> 01:24:49,531
about my dad and I almost didn't tell it
and I was with Janine Garafalo who's 

1993
01:24:49,531 --> 01:24:50,980
very political in New York and I was 
telling her the story that happened.

1994
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:53,500
We were just walking on union square and
she goes,

1995
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:55,990
you have to tell that onstage.
And I literally said to her,

1996
01:24:55,991 --> 01:24:57,640
I go,
but it's not political.

1997
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:59,410
And she was just like,
no,

1998
01:24:59,411 --> 01:25:01,060
you have to tell them on such a good 
story.

1999
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:02,560
It's about a relationship.
It's about,

2000
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:03,700
uh,
your flaw is about what?

2001
01:25:03,701 --> 01:25:05,500
It was totally about me being flawed and
fucked up.

2002
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:11,070
And it was the most enjoyable time I,
I had on stage was talking about that 

2003
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:16,921
and that's what I want to talk about now
is just like all the depression and 

2004
01:25:16,921 --> 01:25:17,550
flaws and fuck ups and stuff like that.
Well,

2005
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:22,570
don't be a human herself,
don't box yourself into some category.

2006
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:24,520
And that was the problem.
Um,

2007
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:27,130
but I felt like I could only talk about 
that stuff.

2008
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:27,880
You know,
it'd be like,

2009
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:31,000
if you could only talk about like,
UFC and he'll talk about other shit.

2010
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:36,110
Well,
I've been very fortunate that I don't 

2011
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:37,821
have to just talk about that,
but I think I've been very conscious 

2012
01:25:37,821 --> 01:25:39,660
about avoiding weird boxes.
You know what I mean?

2013
01:25:39,661 --> 01:25:44,661
I've been stuck in some in the past,
but I think that you can navigate this 

2014
01:25:44,661 --> 01:25:49,251
world of social media,
but it takes diligence and I think that 

2015
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:54,680
we're the first generation of human 
beings that have had to encounter this 

2016
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:59,030
weird environment.
I mean this is not an environment that 

2017
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,030
our parents grew up in.
Oh.

2018
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:02,730
So it's only if there's like a body of 
information that we can draw upon.

2019
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,040
You know,
it's not like a

2020
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,090
lot of people have sort of figured it 
out over the last hundred years and this

2021
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:09,830
is how you manage the winter.
No.

2022
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:14,831
Yeah.
Firewood and you got to do this and 

2023
01:26:14,831 --> 01:26:17,111
you've got to make sure that you drink a
lot of water when you go into the 

2024
01:26:17,111 --> 01:26:17,111
mountains fucking move to la.
There's,

2025
01:26:17,111 --> 01:26:17,930
there's no,
you know,

2026
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:21,530
there's no history so.
And you become a real make mistakes.

2027
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:23,450
You become really dependent on it and it
takes discipline,

2028
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:24,320
man.
I was like,

2029
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:29,321
I like logged onto my twitter the other 
day for the first time to like follow 

2030
01:26:29,321 --> 01:26:29,670
you guys and be like,
ah,

2031
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,780
am I going to tweet anything?
And I didn't because I just saw those 

2032
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:37,661
notifications and I'm like,
there's some dark shit behind those 

2033
01:26:37,661 --> 01:26:37,661
notifications that like of like I'm not 
clicking it,

2034
01:26:37,661 --> 01:26:40,850
just can't be reading it and definitely 
don't argue with people online.

2035
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,570
There's no benefit to that.

2036
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,960
I've almost essentially totally stopped 
doing that.

2037
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:47,720
Occasionally I'll fuck with someone if I
just am in the mood for it,

2038
01:26:47,721 --> 01:26:50,690
but the vast majority of the time my 
phone is like this.

2039
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:52,280
Oh yeah.
Face down.

2040
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:57,550
I think,
I forget if it was like a jock or Tim 

2041
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:57,550
Ferriss or,
or one of those guys,

2042
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,580
but talking about like,
uh,

2043
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:03,610
put it on airplane mode like an hour or 
two before you go to bed and then like 

2044
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:07,090
not turning that shit on until like,
I've started doing all that and I just 

2045
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:10,811
feel so much healthier and I'm telling 
you that when I was attacking people on 

2046
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:16,001
twitter everyday I was depressed as fuck
and straight up suicidal and projecting 

2047
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:21,220
and she's miserable and that happens.
It's a rush.

2048
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:23,210
You have a community,
you have people who go,

2049
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,830
you tweet,
I'm having a bad day,

2050
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,480
and you got 100 people being like,
dude,

2051
01:27:26,481 --> 01:27:27,110
you're awesome.

2052
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,310
You know what I mean?
Like,

2053
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:30,640
Shit's addictive.
Like it's really addictive.

2054
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:32,420
It is.
And that's,

2055
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,400
you know,
that whole sympathy,

2056
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:37,100
mining something that a lot of people do
do.

2057
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,620
Oh,
I did all that sympathy mining,

2058
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,650
um,
you know,

2059
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:46,030
virtue signaling.
It's like there's so many different 

2060
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:46,030
things that people,
just virtue signaling again,

2061
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:50,140
uh,
I think it's what you've been doing for 

2062
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:50,140
other.
Oh,

2063
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:50,140
cool.
Cool,

2064
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:50,140
cool,
cool.

2065
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:50,140
Cool.
Okay,

2066
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,200
great.
So you know how it is,

2067
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:53,540
I mean this,
this,

2068
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:58,541
uh,
it's a really simple sort of way to get 

2069
01:27:58,541 --> 01:27:58,541
love.
Yeah.

2070
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:03,710
I mean it's a.
and then what sucks is like the 

2071
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:06,360
important issues also get pushed aside.
Like [inaudible].

2072
01:28:06,361 --> 01:28:08,630
This isn't like whether or not in 
trump's coming go to jail.

2073
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:12,130
What the fuck is you talking about that 
before the podcast,

2074
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:13,340
literally it,
was he going to jail,

2075
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:18,580
going to jail.
I opened up cnn today for the first 

2076
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:18,580
time.

2077
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:18,580
I'm like,
I guess if I'm going on Joe's,

2078
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:18,680
I should know what's going on the news.
I'm like,

2079
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,200
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
I saw Kevin Spacey,

2080
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:22,640
I saw like people getting arrested and I
was like,

2081
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:27,670
I'm out.
Well that Mueller goes not playing 

2082
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:27,670
games.
No,

2083
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:27,670
he's not fucking around.
And he's,

2084
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:32,260
it mean that guy was the longest running
head of the FBI since j Edgar Hoover.

2085
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:34,040
He,
um,

2086
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:39,250
and he is like painstakingly broke down 
this collusion with the Russians 

2087
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:46,390
situation and what it seems to me as an 
outside person who doesn't really pay 

2088
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:49,430
too much attention to politics.
If I was going,

2089
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:53,240
I would look at it like the mob,
if I was going to attack the mob,

2090
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:56,100
I would go after some low level people 
first under at.

2091
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,340
Yes,
that's what he's doing.

2092
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,780
He's bringing in these dudes that were,
you know,

2093
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,030
manafort and he's bringing

2094
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:07,080
these,
these dudes that were running the 

2095
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:07,080
campaign and,
and,

2096
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,670
and trump is unhinged today.
Trump is making a bunch of,

2097
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:09,450
isn't it?
Yeah,

2098
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:12,480
it's great.
But you know what's interesting too.

2099
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:17,510
Then it just came out that Hillary and 
the DNC funded the dossier on trump and 

2100
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:20,340
they spent millions to enlight about it 
for the past year,

2101
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,880
which is by the way,
that's you're trying to influence the 

2102
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,151
political process as well.
And you're doing it by what you know is 

2103
01:29:29,151 --> 01:29:30,480
fiction,
fictional story on trump with hookers,

2104
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:34,260
pen on people and Shit like that.
So there's everyone's dirty and this is,

2105
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:39,261
I think really important.
I think the right has to recognize that 

2106
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:44,331
you're in a situation where you 
absolutely have people that have 

2107
01:29:44,331 --> 01:29:48,951
colluded with Russia the left half to 
recognize you were in a situation where 

2108
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:53,481
you had a really corrupt career 
politician who almost got in and don't 

2109
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:58,550
hold her up as some sort of high 
standard for womanhood and progressive 

2110
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:00,570
ideas.
This is a woman that didn't even believe

2111
01:30:00,571 --> 01:30:03,360
in gay marriage until $2,013.

2112
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:05,180
Dude,
I said that on stage when I was like,

2113
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:10,190
wow,
when if you criticize hillary or that 

2114
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:10,430
people would say you're not a feminist,
and I was like first rule of feminism,

2115
01:30:10,431 --> 01:30:13,100
like don't kill a bunch of fucking women
overseas.

2116
01:30:13,101 --> 01:30:15,020
Do you know what I mean?
Like you can't.

2117
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:17,510
That was another problem with like my 
whole thing is we couldn't.

2118
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:20,900
If you criticize a woman,
it would be one thing if you said,

2119
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:22,970
I disagree with Hillary Clinton's 
foreign policy,

2120
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,800
that's not.
That should not be called sexist.

2121
01:30:24,801 --> 01:30:29,801
If you were like,
I disagree with Hillary Clinton's 

2122
01:30:29,801 --> 01:30:29,801
foreign policy,
what a whore.

2123
01:30:29,801 --> 01:30:29,801
It's like,
okay,

2124
01:30:29,801 --> 01:30:29,810
well that's,
that's unnecessary.

2125
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:31,610
But you couldn't.

2126
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:36,250
You couldn't say she is a known lie 
because they would say,

2127
01:30:36,251 --> 01:30:37,040
well,
that's a dog whistle.

2128
01:30:37,041 --> 01:30:38,390
That's what you call crazy ladies.
It's like,

2129
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:43,391
no,
that's when you call a fucking 

2130
01:30:43,391 --> 01:30:43,391
politician.
Well,

2131
01:30:43,391 --> 01:30:45,610
when they're crazy ladies,
you should call them crazy crazy lady 

2132
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:46,550
politics or just crazy person will not 
be specific to.

2133
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:48,450
Yeah,
and it's also like,

2134
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:53,451
yeah,
like the whole Caitlyn Jenner thing 

2135
01:30:53,451 --> 01:30:56,151
where it's like,
I don't hate her because she's 

2136
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:57,441
translator because he's kind of a cut,
like she's a little bit of a fucking 

2137
01:30:57,441 --> 01:30:57,441
republic.

2138
01:30:57,441 --> 01:31:01,060
The thing about Caitlyn Jenner,
Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in gay 

2139
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,790
marriage,
which is fucking patently insane.

2140
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,910
Right?
And that's what people need to know.

2141
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,660
You're a bad person.
Ale,

2142
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:08,790
Kardashians.
That's what it is.

2143
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:12,600
Who became a female car dash in and got 
what he wanted,

2144
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:17,720
which is massive amounts of attention.
If you go back and look at Bruce Jenner 

2145
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:22,040
when he was Bruce Jenner and then look 
at Caitlyn Jenner goal achieved 

2146
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,910
Katelyn's going at massive amounts of 
attention.

2147
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:26,880
People celebrating you're a hero.
You're amazing.

2148
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:29,340
Same dumb person.
The

2149
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:34,200
thing is I feel like you should this.
It sounds like such a.

2150
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:40,250
like,
it's easy for me to say it because I'm 

2151
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,620
like a white dude,
but it's like I wish you could just 

2152
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:46,131
judge people as being people.
Now we have systematic oppression of 

2153
01:31:46,131 --> 01:31:47,520
certain groups of people.
Right.

2154
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:51,600
And I think a lot of people who say a 
just judge people as people,

2155
01:31:51,601 --> 01:31:55,170
they're saying that while there's like a
black lives matter rally and it's like,

2156
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,420
well,
not the best time to like say it.

2157
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,660
Right.
Um,

2158
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,010
but well,

2159
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:04,510
the only reason why black lives matter 
works at all is because it's an issue.

2160
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:07,550
It's a matter doesn't work.
No.

2161
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,210
Right.
It's a real simple.

2162
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,190
Like the only reason why people go,
well,

2163
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,260
you know,
we'll all lives matter.

2164
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,280
Okay.
But no one.

2165
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:18,730
See there's a reason why no one's saying
white lives matter.

2166
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:23,731
Right?
Because the white people aren't being 

2167
01:32:23,731 --> 01:32:23,731
oppressed.
And people were like,

2168
01:32:23,731 --> 01:32:24,670
if you disagree with black lives matter 
as an organization.

2169
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:26,440
Yeah.
Because it was kind of run by.

2170
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:29,050
One of them was really not really a 
black guy.

2171
01:32:29,051 --> 01:32:30,400
You know,
the whole Shaun king thing.

2172
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,650
I don't know.
I think he followed me on twitter.

2173
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,860
Shut up.
He's kind of a fake black guy,

2174
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:41,640
but there's a lot of issues.
There's a lot of issues for sure with 

2175
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:45,541
racism in this country.
You have a group that addresses those 

2176
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:46,990
issues and the group gets attacked by 
people you gotta wonder like,

2177
01:32:46,991 --> 01:32:48,330
why is that group getting attacked?

2178
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:53,370
And I'll even bring this back to like 
even with the rape culture stuff,

2179
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,080
which I did not think I would be saying 
on the show again,

2180
01:32:56,170 --> 01:33:01,170
which is that they're there.
You'd have guys online who every time a 

2181
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:04,060
woman got raped there'll be like,
well,

2182
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:06,220
what about men who get raped?
And you go,

2183
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:09,760
well that's awful,
but why do you say it when we're talking

2184
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:14,761
about a woman being raped or why do you 
only say all lives matter after like a 

2185
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:16,600
black kid was shot all the yeah buts,
yes.

2186
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,740
Yeah,
yeah,

2187
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,570
but,
but,

2188
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:20,650
but,
but what about us?

2189
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:22,450
It's like it can not be about you for a 
second.

2190
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:25,720
And I was just as guilty of that.
Like black lives matter when they go,

2191
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:27,160
oh,
they're racist against white people.

2192
01:33:27,161 --> 01:33:29,710
It's like the title itself,
black lives matter.

2193
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:32,500
That's a low bar.
They're just saying we exist,

2194
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:32,770
right?

2195
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:36,100
Like look at us like look at as being 
gunned down in the St Louis being killed

2196
01:33:36,101 --> 01:33:37,000
by cops.
Right?

2197
01:33:37,001 --> 01:33:42,001
It's not saying the black lives matter,
therefore like white people should be 

2198
01:33:42,001 --> 01:33:43,660
killed by cops.
Like there's nothing like that pool gets

2199
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,680
so mad when it's not their group and 
they always want to concentrate on 

2200
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:52,150
people that are black that make 
ridiculous claims.

2201
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:57,270
Like instead of just looking at the idea
behind why was black lives matter 

2202
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:00,740
formed,
then they start looking at black people 

2203
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:01,930
to make ridiculous claims like black 
people can't be racist because racism is

2204
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,960
right.
Our plus influence and prejudice,

2205
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:09,990
which is just not read and that's the 
same shit that people on the left would 

2206
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:12,751
do where they were just sort of like 
nitpick at these very specific little 

2207
01:34:12,751 --> 01:34:15,010
arguments and it's like there are bigger
things to fucking worry about.

2208
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,820
Right?
Yeah.

2209
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:19,600
And I think that's why an organization 
like black lives matter kits any heat at

2210
01:34:19,601 --> 01:34:20,470
all because right.
If,

2211
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,640
if,
if people just said,

2212
01:34:21,641 --> 01:34:25,090
yeah,
well course cops are absolutely shooting

2213
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,420
black people at a disproportionate rate,
you know?

2214
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:33,421
I mean,
if you just look at these incidences 

2215
01:34:33,421 --> 01:34:33,421
that we've been forced to see in the 
news,

2216
01:34:33,421 --> 01:34:37,560
there's been so many of them and these 
people march and like what would that 

2217
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:41,161
one black woman who got pulled over and 
refuse to put out a cigarette and the 

2218
01:34:41,161 --> 01:34:43,300
cop was telling her to put out a 
cigarette and she wants to be in dead in

2219
01:34:43,301 --> 01:34:44,710
her cell,
like a adult.

2220
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,500
I think it was Sandra Bland.
Yeah.

2221
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,000
Yeah.
She was just like hung herself.

2222
01:34:48,001 --> 01:34:52,990
That is a fucking insane story.
That woman,

2223
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:54,640
that cop was a piece of shit.
I mean,

2224
01:34:54,641 --> 01:34:57,650
the way he was communicating with her,
he was not communicating with her.

2225
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,010
Like she

2226
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,840
was a woman that just got pulled over 
for speeding.

2227
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:02,330
He was communicating with her like she 
was under him.

2228
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,900
Like it was like he had.
He had to force his power on her.

2229
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:09,410
I mean we've seen that kind of shit 
before and if that's not racism,

2230
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,380
it's absolutely shitty policing.
Well that's the thing.

2231
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:17,410
That's what we should talk about.
And that's like what we were talking 

2232
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:19,841
about with the Islamophobia where it's 
like you're also being 

2233
01:35:19,841 --> 01:35:19,841
counterproductive.
Right?

2234
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:24,350
Like you want to say that the cops want 
to go with like blue lives matter too.

2235
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:25,760
It's like,
cool,

2236
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:31,150
why don't you guys should be the most 
mad when there's Douche bags like that 

2237
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:32,480
who pulled over Sandra Bland,
right?

2238
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,900
You guys should be the most mad to clean
up your fucking organization to clean up

2239
01:35:35,901 --> 01:35:38,610
your shit and you should be on the front
lines.

2240
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:44,040
How powerful would that be?
Like them on the front lines with black 

2241
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,841
lives matter being like,
we don't want that shit in our 

2242
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:46,841
precincts.
And by the way,

2243
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:48,230
it's not even just about the way they 
attack black people.

2244
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:53,440
You saw that woman in Utah that was 
arrested because she refused to draw 

2245
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,040
blood on someone who was in a coma.
No,

2246
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,650
I didn't say you didn't see that?
No.

2247
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:02,890
Someone got taken into custody or 
someone got to take to the hospital 

2248
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:02,890
rather.
Uh,

2249
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:06,380
the cops showed up and demanded blood be
drawn without this person's consent,

2250
01:36:06,381 --> 01:36:08,180
which is against the law.
She said,

2251
01:36:08,181 --> 01:36:10,220
no,
the cop arrested the woman.

2252
01:36:10,221 --> 01:36:15,221
Now he's been fired.
But I think most people are unqualified 

2253
01:36:15,381 --> 01:36:17,900
to be police officers.
That's a big job.

2254
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:22,980
It's a big job and I think that there it
should be much more respected in which 

2255
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:29,590
it should be a much more difficult 
position to attain and I think that this

2256
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:34,790
here in lies the problem you're asking 
regular people to deal with insane 

2257
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:39,581
amounts of power.
Literally the ability to pull the 

2258
01:36:39,581 --> 01:36:41,780
trigger on a person and their life and 
we've seen time and time again,

2259
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:46,930
people get away with ending lives in a 
way in a matter that we the citizens 

2260
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:47,580
don't agree with.
Yeah,

2261
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:50,780
and the,
the bar is kind of crapped right?

2262
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:54,680
Where now the things that you should be 
using hand to hand combat for.

2263
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:57,290
You're using tasers for the things that 
you should be tasting four,

2264
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:58,310
you're shooting,
right?

2265
01:36:59,040 --> 01:36:59,900
See,
here's the thing,

2266
01:36:59,901 --> 01:37:01,950
you can't,
you can't expect a,

2267
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:06,990
the average police officer to be able to
use hand to hand combat on some person 

2268
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:08,540
when they have no idea what that 
person's skill level.

2269
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,500
Yeah.
Unless it's the cop is fucking steep.

2270
01:37:11,501 --> 01:37:13,220
Emile chick.
What is the,

2271
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:15,110
what are the odds?
You're going to come out ahead.

2272
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,540
You might get your fucking gun taken 
away from you.

2273
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:18,560
You might get shot.
Well,

2274
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,750
I don't think they should have to use 
hand to hand combat.

2275
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:24,890
I mean it's fucking insane position or 
at least be trained better.

2276
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:26,630
Right?
Like people should not be dying.

2277
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:31,930
You shouldn't be tasting like mentally 
ill people who are writing articles 

2278
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:35,000
also.
There's a lot of like really frail 

2279
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,000
people that are police officers.
I've seen them.

2280
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Uh,
there was some.

2281
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,550
God that was the other day.
They were pulling this guy over and they

2282
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:39,950
had this guy out on the curb and I 
looked at this guy,

2283
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:42,560
he had a little pot belly and these 
little skinny arms.

2284
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:46,220
That's adorable.
Not really look at it like I'm like this

2285
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:47,300
guy,
a victim.

2286
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:48,740
Like if,
if someone,

2287
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:52,790
if someone just decided to turn on him 
and punch him in the head,

2288
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:56,190
he would be unconscious and he's a cop 
and he's like this frail

2289
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:01,190
cop dude.
I used to have a friend who did 

2290
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:02,160
psychological profiles for people who 
want to join the police academy.

2291
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:04,080
And she told me some of the answers for 
what,

2292
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:06,450
why these guys wanted to be cops.
Like one guy,

2293
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:09,450
she said literally wrote in his essay 
like,

2294
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:13,290
I want to become a police officer so I 
can finally get the respect I deserve.

2295
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:14,620
And it's like,
well,

2296
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,010
I mean they didn't,
she didn't like,

2297
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,950
you know,
he didn't go through,

2298
01:38:16,951 --> 01:38:20,550
but it's like there are those people,
not all cops Hashtag.

2299
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,170
There are those people who are just 
like,

2300
01:38:22,171 --> 01:38:24,930
there's one fucking power they want.
They got fucking bullied.

2301
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:28,050
They got for every good dumb enough to 
say that on his application.

2302
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:30,060
How many guys just internalized.
That's what I was saying.

2303
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,100
All that guy that it was not fucking say
that.

2304
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:37,160
Right.
And like that guy was so nuts enough 

2305
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:37,160
that he's like,
you know what?

2306
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:37,160
They'll,
they'll understand.

2307
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:37,920
They'll see where I'm coming from and he
fucking wrote it.

2308
01:38:37,921 --> 01:38:41,700
There are so many fucking people that 
they need.

2309
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:44,700
I mean there's a lot of people that 
don't want to be police officers.

2310
01:38:44,701 --> 01:38:49,701
Like in La for awhile they hit these 
giant billboards where they're 

2311
01:38:49,701 --> 01:38:50,190
advertising how much you get to start.
Oh,

2312
01:38:50,191 --> 01:38:52,800
they're having trouble recruiting and 
shit because nobody wants that job.

2313
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:55,290
You're essentially the professional 
enemy,

2314
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,970
right?
Pulling people over.

2315
01:38:56,971 --> 01:38:59,070
Most of them have committed some sort of
a crime.

2316
01:38:59,071 --> 01:39:01,350
They're going to lie to you,
so they're dealing with liars all day.

2317
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:03,630
Jesus.
I'd ever thought about that,

2318
01:39:03,631 --> 01:39:08,310
but that's another thing where if you 
also can't,

2319
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:13,790
just like the cops should be trying 
super hard to get rid of the bad ones.

2320
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:20,270
If we demonize every cop,
then those cops who have like a really 

2321
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:22,890
hard fucking job are going to be like,
well fuck you guys.

2322
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:24,270
You know what I mean?
For sure.

2323
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:28,200
Again,
it's that it's that balance where and so

2324
01:39:28,201 --> 01:39:32,340
much of it comes down to just like the 
economy and people's life sucking,

2325
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,630
right?
Like it's really easy,

2326
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:38,070
for example,
for people to shit on these like black,

2327
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:40,650
like a inner city neighborhoods and they
go,

2328
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:43,140
why don't they call the cops?
Why is a neighborhood trash?

2329
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:43,530
It's like,
well,

2330
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:46,200
because they called the cops and then 
the dog gets shot or whatever.

2331
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,750
Sure.
And so it's like people just need.

2332
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,460
I think that's why you sound like trump 
and Bernie,

2333
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:52,380
right?
People need fucking jobs.

2334
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:57,440
They want to take care of their family.
They're not reading twitter or the news 

2335
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:01,491
like I used to or that most of us,
most of us who live in this twitter 

2336
01:40:01,491 --> 01:40:04,911
bubble,
all these fucking so many of these 

2337
01:40:04,911 --> 01:40:05,370
progressive journalists I hung out with 
who were like 99 percent,

2338
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:10,371
like so many of them were like fucking 
just spoiled rich kids who want it to 

2339
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:10,371
feel oppressed.

2340
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:10,830
You know what I mean?
Dude,

2341
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:11,770
you know,
uh,

2342
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:17,600
I hang out with all my white journalist 
friends were like white kids.

2343
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:22,530
I'm like,
I see more diversity and fucking Jujitsu

2344
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:27,150
than I ever did with the people who are 
constantly talking about diversity.

2345
01:40:27,151 --> 01:40:32,151
It was a bunch of white kids trying to 
feel more progressive or more 

2346
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,870
intelligent and I'm very much including 
myself.

2347
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:36,330
And then I started going to Jujitsu and 
I was like,

2348
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:38,490
ah,
that's what a Mexican looks like.

2349
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,200
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2350
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,240
Well,
getting back to what we're saying,

2351
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:47,241
I think that one of the good things 
about these groups like black lives 

2352
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:49,140
matter is regardless of whatever 
controversy,

2353
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:51,540
it's forcing the conversation.
Do you have to have it?

2354
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:56,570
You have to have that.
I just think they have to be careful 

2355
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:56,570
with

2356
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:58,980
what they do,
like when kids get crazy and they want 

2357
01:40:58,980 --> 01:40:58,980
to block off the highway,
you know,

2358
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:02,691
they're like,
don't do that kind of shit because that 

2359
01:41:02,691 --> 01:41:04,651
gives people a very bad impression of 
what your organization stands for and 

2360
01:41:04,651 --> 01:41:08,580
you're blocking off the highway and that
could stop people from saving your mom 

2361
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,540
who fell down and broke her head open.
I mean,

2362
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:15,541
you,
you're gonna you're going to block off 

2363
01:41:15,541 --> 01:41:17,461
the ambulance,
you're going to block off people that 

2364
01:41:17,461 --> 01:41:17,461
are,
that have to make a flight.

2365
01:41:17,461 --> 01:41:17,830
You're,
you're in and you're saying,

2366
01:41:17,831 --> 01:41:18,310
well,
yeah,

2367
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,020
that's how you make noise.
You know,

2368
01:41:20,021 --> 01:41:21,580
you cause people in convenience.
No,

2369
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:26,581
you disrupt the,
the very systems that we need in order 

2370
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:30,211
to make civilization run correctly.
So you don't have to do that to get 

2371
01:41:30,211 --> 01:41:31,810
attention.
So you're saying you still okay now.

2372
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:32,380
Okay.
Got It.

2373
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,560
Because the problem is,
and this you can blame on the media 

2374
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,190
where it's like those are the only 
protest that get covered.

2375
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:42,610
If you have a,
a peaceful protest with speakers,

2376
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:47,730
you know,
standing out for at a south side of 

2377
01:41:47,730 --> 01:41:49,441
someone's like congressional office,
then it's like that shit doesn't get 

2378
01:41:49,441 --> 01:41:49,441
covered.
I remember going to hold on a second.

2379
01:41:49,441 --> 01:41:50,830
You're right,
the media,

2380
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:55,890
but I think the media is slowly but 
surely becoming irrelevant and the real 

2381
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:59,990
meat,
the real media is what's left.

2382
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:05,200
The only reason why the news,
we don't even have to name an 

2383
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,821
organization in in quotes the news is 
the news is because they have a long 

2384
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:11,080
history of disseminating information.
Right?

2385
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:13,810
But people,
regular people are doing that now.

2386
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:18,870
A lot of people are doing that now 
through different websites and youtube 

2387
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:21,160
channels and I think that that's the 
future and if we don't have to be,

2388
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:25,570
as long as you're honest and you have a 
real objective point of view,

2389
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:30,720
you don't have to be sanctioned by some 
gigantic corporation to get the fucking 

2390
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:31,040
truth now.

2391
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:31,870
No.
In fact,

2392
01:42:31,871 --> 01:42:36,871
you,
you're less likely to get the truth out 

2393
01:42:36,871 --> 01:42:37,840
because of your sponsors because of.
I mean Msnbc is owned by Ge.

2394
01:42:37,841 --> 01:42:42,841
MSNBC is the quote unquote liberal 
network and they're owned by like a 

2395
01:42:42,841 --> 01:42:43,930
company that like fucking profit off a 
war.

2396
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,960
Dave Rubin had a post that he did today 
to go to Dave Rubin's a twitter page 

2397
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:54,450
about why people distrust the media and 
why the media is garbage today in their 

2398
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:58,771
coverage of this Kevin Spacey thing 
because all of these different outlets 

2399
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,440
were saying that Kevin Spacey came out 
as gay.

2400
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:03,970
That was the name,
the main headline,

2401
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,230
isn't it?
You can't fuck a kiss.

2402
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,110
Kevin Spacey came out as gay.
Kevin Spacey came out as gay.

2403
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:09,390
This was like,
well,

2404
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,870
let's have a it up.
Pull it up.

2405
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,460
That sounds like we should be 
applauding.

2406
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:13,750
Well,
this is.

2407
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:17,200
This is.
It just shows you what it is like,

2408
01:43:17,201 --> 01:43:20,640
look at this media.
Why grow up?

2409
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:23,410
Why doesn't the public trust us?
Because this.

2410
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:28,090
Look at this actor Kevin Spacey Decides,
declares he lives as a gay man.

2411
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:33,160
Kevin Spacey announced Sunday night that
he will live as a gay man and we look at

2412
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:35,140
all these different than New York Daily 
News.

2413
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,420
Reuters,
the daily beast.

2414
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:42,450
They're saying that he's gay,
but they're saying he's gay because a 

2415
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:46,540
kid came out where a man now came out 
and said Kevin tried to fuck him when he

2416
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:51,541
was 14.
So this is like saying that he declares 

2417
01:43:51,541 --> 01:43:52,070
he lives life

2418
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,720
as a gay man.
God Damn it.

2419
01:43:53,721 --> 01:43:56,060
That's not the store know.
That sounds like a festive thing.

2420
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:58,460
We should all be like congratulations to
Kevin Spacey.

2421
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:03,490
Not only that,
he said this in this statement where he 

2422
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:05,330
was apologizing for this thing,
so like this.

2423
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:09,200
This is so crazy one also.
That's how they choose,

2424
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:13,820
but choose to frame it that way because 
someone coming out is going to get a lot

2425
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:15,680
of people paying attention.
Right.

2426
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:21,100
Well and also I don't have the link to 
link pedophilia always to.

2427
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:26,140
Homosexuality isn't true.
Like there are a lot of of people who 

2428
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:27,770
would consider themselves heterosexual,
whether it was in the church or whatever

2429
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,800
who are raping kids because it's,
it's a power thing and they're sick or 

2430
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,671
pedophilia is just different.
Being attracted to kids is different 

2431
01:44:36,671 --> 01:44:39,671
than being attracted to like,
like men and this is like also really 

2432
01:44:39,671 --> 01:44:42,560
dangerous for to equate like uh,
trying to fuck a 14 year old,

2433
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:46,310
which just like going down to west 
Hollywood to like do some gay shit,

2434
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:51,370
you know,
I mean he has admitted that he did and 

2435
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:51,750
he said he doesn't recall it at all,
but he did say that

2436
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:53,900
he had a problem with drinking and you 
know,

2437
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:56,680
if he did do anything,
he was very sorry.

2438
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,640
And we're talking about something that 
happened at least 30 years ago.

2439
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:03,810
Right?
So here's also a problem and this is,

2440
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:08,850
this needs to be addressed because we 
really don't know whether or not this 

2441
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:10,810
guy's memory is accurate because 
something 30 years ago,

2442
01:45:10,990 --> 01:45:13,780
the problem with being 14 years old,
his first of all,

2443
01:45:13,781 --> 01:45:17,020
14 years old,
you're so God damn confused.

2444
01:45:17,021 --> 01:45:19,060
I don't remember shit.
He don't remember shit.

2445
01:45:19,061 --> 01:45:23,620
You are a wash in hormones and confusion
and insecurity.

2446
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,100
And

2447
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:27,790
he might've had something the last five 
years of my life too.

2448
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:28,630
He,
yeah.

2449
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:33,910
He,
he might've had some weird run in with 

2450
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:34,570
Kevin Spacey that may or may not have 
been sexually predatory.

2451
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:36,310
I don't know.
I don't know what happened,

2452
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:41,760
but to to decide that he's absolutely 
telling the truth and Kevin Spacey's 

2453
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,960
absolutely covering this up by coming 
out as gay to using that sort of 

2454
01:45:46,241 --> 01:45:47,990
diffused the situation.
Is this sort of

2455
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:53,650
the.
This is almost the opposite of when 

2456
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:57,500
twitter declares you guilty.
This is like the news declaring you 

2457
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:57,500
almost like innocent,
right?

2458
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:02,120
Where I don't know what happened to 
letting a courts decide and talk about 

2459
01:46:03,451 --> 01:46:08,451
people being accused and whatnot where 
twitter can just like be like if they 

2460
01:46:08,451 --> 01:46:11,370
say you're done.
Like you had a John Ronson on.

2461
01:46:11,371 --> 01:46:12,480
Right?
Did he talk?

2462
01:46:12,481 --> 01:46:15,510
Did he read that publicly?
Shamed looks good and it's just like,

2463
01:46:15,511 --> 01:46:17,010
man,
these people's lives are done.

2464
01:46:17,011 --> 01:46:18,520
And I was part of all that shit.
I,

2465
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,180
I tweeted about fucking justine sacco.
Yep.

2466
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:21,330
Straight up.
I did.

2467
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:23,430
And I read that book and it's like,
yeah,

2468
01:46:23,431 --> 01:46:26,280
you don't,
you don't think of that.

2469
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:27,240
You know what I mean?

2470
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,180
Shot.
I mean,

2471
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:32,540
that's the worst example of that is 
people that are completely anonymous,

2472
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:34,070
right?
You weren't completely anonymous,

2473
01:46:34,071 --> 01:46:39,071
which is why you face the blowback where
there's a lot of people that are just 

2474
01:46:39,071 --> 01:46:41,360
have a twitter egg and they mean they're
completely anonymous.

2475
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:46,361
They have a bunch of random letters and 
numbers is their name and they fucking 

2476
01:46:46,361 --> 01:46:48,110
attacked people left and right.
It's a common thing on twitter.

2477
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:50,100
I,
we're seeing

2478
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:55,160
a new kind of interaction with human 
beings and this interaction where 

2479
01:46:56,011 --> 01:47:01,011
there's no social cues involved.
There is virtually no repercussions for 

2480
01:47:01,011 --> 01:47:02,790
saying the most evil,
vile shit.

2481
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:06,510
And then people take it as a badge of 
honor that they been blocked.

2482
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:07,490
Right,
right.

2483
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:09,720
Yeah.
And make it their twitter bio.

2484
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,770
I mean,
so it's,

2485
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,600
it's weird times.
Yeah,

2486
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:13,680
man,
I just wish,

2487
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,660
I mean,
being off twitter has I,

2488
01:47:16,661 --> 01:47:19,110
I wish it didn't happen in such a 
horrific way,

2489
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:22,650
but has definitely made me like I talk 
to people more now.

2490
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,990
I talked to people who disagree with me.
I'm like,

2491
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:27,300
I look people in the eyes more than I 
used to.

2492
01:47:27,301 --> 01:47:29,010
I like,
I'm not checking my phone.

2493
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:34,750
Good thing to you all to ultimately to 
because how else would you have escape?

2494
01:47:34,751 --> 01:47:35,760
I went live.
Yeah.

2495
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:40,180
I mean it's almost like you were in a 
cult because I had a,

2496
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:45,640
a Bret Weinstein's brother Eric on 
recently and Eric was talking about the 

2497
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:49,600
cult of progressive ideology that it 
literally is a cult.

2498
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:54,900
Like the,
one of the things that core things that 

2499
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,620
people keep saying is that biology and 
gender are not related.

2500
01:47:57,010 --> 01:48:02,010
You know,
like there's some weird things that 

2501
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:02,010
people say in order to be supportive of 
trans people.

2502
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:05,590
There's a lot of weird but these,
these things that they're saying they're

2503
01:48:05,591 --> 01:48:09,430
not supported by science and they're 
very culty and everyone repeats them and

2504
01:48:09,431 --> 01:48:14,431
they repeat them for the same reason why
people in certain religions repeat 

2505
01:48:14,801 --> 01:48:15,640
religious phrases.

2506
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:20,860
Yeah.
And this goes back to that progressive 

2507
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:20,860
thing I was talking about where,
you know,

2508
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:24,760
to me it was the reason that I wouldn't 
fully read a lot of those articles is 

2509
01:48:25,521 --> 01:48:28,250
because I was like,
but I want to support those people.

2510
01:48:28,251 --> 01:48:33,251
Right?
And because I don't think trans people 

2511
01:48:33,251 --> 01:48:36,311
should be discriminated against.
I don't give a shit where they want to 

2512
01:48:36,311 --> 01:48:36,560
go to the bathroom unless it's like on 
somebody,

2513
01:48:36,561 --> 01:48:37,790
right?
Like I don't care.

2514
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:39,600
I,
I think that everybody should,

2515
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,840
should live and feel free as long as 
you're not being,

2516
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:43,010
you know,
predatory.

2517
01:48:43,011 --> 01:48:45,030
Or like when the Republicans were like,
well,

2518
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:47,420
men are going to dress up as women.
It's like,

2519
01:48:47,421 --> 01:48:50,150
that's,
that's men like bosom buddies.

2520
01:48:50,151 --> 01:48:55,151
Right?
Like that's like that was that like 

2521
01:48:55,151 --> 01:48:57,071
trans people are different than men who 
dress up as women and like sneaking the 

2522
01:48:57,071 --> 01:49:00,991
fucking band,
going to be men who dress up like women 

2523
01:49:00,991 --> 01:49:01,640
and seeking the bathrooms because they 
can.

2524
01:49:01,641 --> 01:49:06,641
Because it's a loophole.
I mean they can just walk in the 

2525
01:49:06,641 --> 01:49:06,641
bathroom.
It's just now though,

2526
01:49:06,641 --> 01:49:06,641
just like

2527
01:49:06,641 --> 01:49:08,390
there's going to be people that drive 
into cards,

2528
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:10,050
crowds of people with their car.
Right.

2529
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:12,480
It doesn't mean that you shouldn't be 
able to drive a car.

2530
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:13,180
Right?
I mean,

2531
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:18,460
you're going to have aberrations,
but it's not like there's a million 

2532
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,630
people right now sneaking into the 
women's room to try to fuck kids.

2533
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:22,970
I mean this is,
this is just,

2534
01:49:22,971 --> 01:49:27,320
you can't use those individual 
incidences as aberrations.

2535
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:30,000
No,
and so on awfulness.

2536
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:32,190
Totally.
And so to go back to your cult thing,

2537
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:37,300
um,
I do feel like you would have never 

2538
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:37,300
gotten out.
I mean,

2539
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:37,300
I,
I,

2540
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:39,390
God,
I wish this wasn't the way it happened.

2541
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:40,590
I,
I wish what happened?

2542
01:49:40,591 --> 01:49:45,591
Why?
Because look at you didn't get anything 

2543
01:49:45,591 --> 01:49:45,591
wrong.
I know really bad,

2544
01:49:45,591 --> 01:49:47,440
no big deal.
That shit still exists and like

2545
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,920
fuck did it,
uh,

2546
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:51,400
like the fact that anyone would,
would think that.

2547
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:52,800
I'm like,
fuck,

2548
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,010
that fucks with you.
Well,

2549
01:49:54,011 --> 01:49:56,210
why don't you write a counter article?
So,

2550
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:58,420
so I,
I think eventually I will,

2551
01:49:58,421 --> 01:49:59,110
one of the,
I mean,

2552
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:04,170
one of the reasons I didn't say 
published by like the men in this or 

2553
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:04,170
something like that.
Yeah,

2554
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:04,840
exactly.
What's the red pill?

2555
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:06,640
Yeah,
that sounds good to say guys.

2556
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:11,641
I don't because I'm about to become a 
fucking four Chan for Chan's happy with 

2557
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:14,740
us because we were making fun of the uh,
radio lab thing.

2558
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:19,640
I got some tweets from people that 
pulled down this thing where they shiela

2559
01:50:19,641 --> 01:50:21,130
above put up,
uh,

2560
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:23,620
some stupid flag and said,
uh,

2561
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:27,430
he will not divide us.
And four Chan went and found the flag,

2562
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:32,460
it was in the middle of Tennessee and 
took it down and walked up to the 

2563
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:35,071
caramel and fuck sheil above and it was 
on his Webcam live and it was a great 

2564
01:50:35,381 --> 01:50:40,381
way radio lab podcast,
but radiolab took it down because some 

2565
01:50:40,381 --> 01:50:43,660
people complained that four chan is 
awful and missing the whole point.

2566
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:46,600
What they did was not awful.
These are individuals.

2567
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:50,690
Fortunate is comprised of hundreds of 
thousands of unique individual.

2568
01:50:50,691 --> 01:50:54,460
Fucking around in this incident was 
amazing.

2569
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:56,740
Yeah,
Shiela buffs a fucking Dork.

2570
01:50:56,890 --> 01:51:01,890
So the whole thing was great.
We could have come together with four 

2571
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:04,501
chats.
We missed our opportunity radio lab and 

2572
01:51:04,501 --> 01:51:04,501
four Chan like as one for a day radio 
lab.

2573
01:51:04,501 --> 01:51:04,520
Just,
you know,

2574
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:09,680
there again,
they're there on that progressive 

2575
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,851
ideology team.
It's scary when you can't hear other 

2576
01:51:11,851 --> 01:51:16,561
voices and there I think there's an app 
they were talking about and Sam Harris 

2577
01:51:17,091 --> 01:51:18,970
is show where it tells you if you're 
reading too many,

2578
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
like either left Wayne articles or right
Wayne articles.

2579
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:21,610
Like it's like,
hey,

2580
01:51:21,611 --> 01:51:24,460
we're steering a little too left.
You want to balance this shit out.

2581
01:51:24,461 --> 01:51:25,900
And there's like an APP that can do 
that,

2582
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:28,330
now goes,
it aggregates your news.

2583
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:29,700
So yay.

2584
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:34,720
Yeah.
And will that just tells me you're 

2585
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:34,810
reading too much shit on your phone,
on your phone in general.

2586
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:38,620
That's why I've started reading books 
and it's much better and,

2587
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:43,480
but fucking a.
I forgot I was going to say off of.

2588
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:44,560
Oh,
the cult thing.

2589
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:47,860
I mean,
I don't know because I still.

2590
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Yeah.
So I don't want to walk around a few 

2591
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:53,000
other way.
One of the reasons I didn't respond,

2592
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,880
one of googling suicide and then I 
shouldn't say this for my poor 

2593
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:57,580
girlfriend once she came back and like 
had my back.

2594
01:51:57,790 --> 01:52:01,270
Like I said this on Doug actually 
brought her up on stage for the podcast.

2595
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:02,490
But she,
uh,

2596
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,900
I thought she was going to break up with
me and she was like,

2597
01:52:04,901 --> 01:52:07,390
well I kind of wish you were more 
predatory towards me.

2598
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:08,290
And that's when I was like,
I'm gonna,

2599
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,970
I'm gonna marry you,
you're great.

2600
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
You're a keeper.
And she totally had my back and creepy 

2601
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,531
thing to say.
There's so many girls right now warming 

2602
01:52:19,531 --> 01:52:21,421
up their fingers,
getting ready to attack a horrible 

2603
01:52:21,421 --> 01:52:21,470
article was excited that his girlfriend 
wants him to be friends.

2604
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:23,470
She was kidding.
She's just funny.

2605
01:52:23,471 --> 01:52:25,060
She's a funny person.
You can be funny.

2606
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:28,580
You can be funny.
It can be funny and but fuck in.

2607
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:31,660
When she had my back and like I kind of 
walked it back and was just like,

2608
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:34,420
what am I going to do?
There was another part of me that didn't

2609
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:37,030
want to write an article.
I had people say to me,

2610
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:42,100
I had one person who spoke at the 
women's March who called me to be like,

2611
01:52:42,101 --> 01:52:46,070
this makes my job harder because when 
you start to call

2612
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:50,260
fighting with your girlfriend abuse,
when you start to call a a bad break up,

2613
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:55,780
whatever.
When you start to call consensual 

2614
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:58,990
hookups on the road predatory.
It's like this is what sexist point to 

2615
01:52:58,990 --> 01:53:03,550
when they go the APP.
All these girls who talk about being 

2616
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:03,550
preyed on,
it's bullshit.

2617
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:07,420
You know what I mean?
They point to like these in innocuous 

2618
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,670
normal situations and so that's really,
really scary.

2619
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:15,671
But I also had people be like,
if I defended myself and some people 

2620
01:53:15,671 --> 01:53:16,820
told me this,
if I defended myself,

2621
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:22,270
I would suddenly look like I'm saying 
don't believe women or I'm saying that 

2622
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:26,630
because I'm defending just one person,
me and I'm like,

2623
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:28,340
I didn't want to be and I don't want to 
be.

2624
01:53:28,341 --> 01:53:30,860
I just want to be a fucking comic.
I don't want to be a voice for like,

2625
01:53:30,861 --> 01:53:33,860
bitches are crazy.
And I also don't want to be a voice for,

2626
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:36,290
you know,
every guy is a fucking evil rapist,

2627
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:37,830
right?
I just want to tell jokes.

2628
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:42,620
I move on.
This experience in a lot of ways sort of

2629
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:48,160
can guide you through it.
That's what's been happening just in 

2630
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:52,060
this.
Having this example of how it could all 

2631
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:54,800
go completely sideways,
sideways and sideways,

2632
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:56,450
you know,
admittedly.

2633
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:59,510
But even before it went bad,
it was going sideways.

2634
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:04,550
Yeah.
We're attacking people without reading 

2635
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:06,971
the full story.
When I was depressed then and she 

2636
01:54:06,971 --> 01:54:07,220
looking to get this sort of response by 
attacking people,

2637
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,660
gay people to say,
Yo,

2638
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:11,020
Jamie's on our side,
James Positive total.

2639
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,430
And then being addicted to this response
thing.

2640
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:18,431
And checking your phone all the time to 
making sure you know the people on your 

2641
01:54:18,431 --> 01:54:19,610
side where you're battling with someone 
and calling them as sexist,

2642
01:54:19,611 --> 01:54:22,210
racist shit.
How many followers this person has

2643
01:54:22,290 --> 01:54:25,800
just retweeted you like,
that's all I did.

2644
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:29,720
And,
and now just being able to like,

2645
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:33,450
like wake up early,
take care of myself,

2646
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:35,460
read books,
hang out with my dope girlfriend,

2647
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:40,520
go do Jujitsu all day and then write 
jokes and live your life as a human and 

2648
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:43,740
just be nice to people do.
I'm telling you I am nicer to people not

2649
01:54:43,741 --> 01:54:46,500
being this like fucking progress because
I was just judging everybody.

2650
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:48,330
How can you be nice to everyone?
You can just like,

2651
01:54:48,331 --> 01:54:49,830
look at that guy.
He's fucking eating meat.

2652
01:54:49,831 --> 01:54:50,880
Look at that guy.
He's,

2653
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:56,120
you know,
he's got this fucking bumper sticker or 

2654
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:58,011
whatever.
You're just constantly looking to be 

2655
01:54:58,011 --> 01:54:58,011
outraged.
Yeah.

2656
01:54:58,011 --> 01:55:00,210
The attack machine of this,
not just the progressive ideology,

2657
01:55:00,211 --> 01:55:02,880
but the,
the right wing ideology as well.

2658
01:55:02,881 --> 01:55:05,700
It's an attack machine and you can't 
enjoy things like,

2659
01:55:05,701 --> 01:55:06,930
you know what I mean?
Anytime you tweet,

2660
01:55:06,931 --> 01:55:08,160
like I went to this movie and they're 
like,

2661
01:55:08,161 --> 01:55:12,250
well this actor is problematic or this 
movie is fucking racist because of.

2662
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:13,500
And it's just like,
I don't know man,

2663
01:55:13,501 --> 01:55:16,140
I just had a good night.
I just wanted to go see a fucking movie.

2664
01:55:16,141 --> 01:55:19,590
Like I think that people are getting 
tired of it though,

2665
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:24,680
and this is what I'm hoping if you were 
talking about this sort of balances out 

2666
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,150
and that this is a new form of 
communication that we're engaging in and

2667
01:55:27,151 --> 01:55:28,500
people are doing it poorly.
Well,

2668
01:55:28,501 --> 01:55:29,510
and I'll say this,
I was

2669
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,170
very surprised because I was like,
when I was taught,

2670
01:55:32,171 --> 01:55:37,171
when I,
when I told some comic friends that I 

2671
01:55:37,171 --> 01:55:38,380
wanted to go back to standup or Improv 
you people and I was like,

2672
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,170
I was like,
no one wants to hear about my shit.

2673
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:44,010
No one wants to hear a rant.
Being a moderate

2674
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,990
and so many people like hush hush.
We're like,

2675
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:51,020
yeah,
they do because they're sick of the 

2676
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:51,020
extremes on both sides.
They're sick of all this.

2677
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:54,981
Like just everyone's just like,
all these trump jokes are just like so 

2678
01:55:54,981 --> 01:55:56,040
fucking just it's white noise,
white noise.

2679
01:55:56,041 --> 01:56:01,041
So these progressive,
they're trying to out progressive each 

2680
01:56:01,041 --> 01:56:03,950
other.
So people that consider themselves 

2681
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:04,110
progressives are also getting attacked.
Like the Bret Weinstein thing,

2682
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,940
or do you mean he's getting called a 
racist?

2683
01:56:05,941 --> 01:56:10,941
Like if you'd know him,
he's like one of the most deeply 

2684
01:56:10,941 --> 01:56:13,491
progressive guys.
Like probably I've ever had a chance to 

2685
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:13,491
talk to why that was the rose McGowan 
thing.

2686
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:16,010
That was the guy I heard on on Sam 
Harris's where if,

2687
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:19,980
if something happens to a white person 
than someone will be like,

2688
01:56:19,981 --> 01:56:21,150
well what did that happen to a black 
person?

2689
01:56:21,151 --> 01:56:21,530
It's like,
right,

2690
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,140
that would be bad too.

2691
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:23,150
And it's like,
well what if it happened to.

2692
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:28,160
And then someone else would be like,
what about a black trans person or 

2693
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,660
lensing?
The silencing thing is so fucked up and 

2694
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:31,560
this is what people are trying to do.
They're trying to silence people.

2695
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,650
They're trying to get people fired.
But the,

2696
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:37,980
the answer to bad speech is not 
silencing people.

2697
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:39,480
It's better speech,
right?

2698
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,090
Isn't that one of the things that nick,
what's his name?

2699
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:45,030
What is his last name that was on Sam 
Harris' podcast.

2700
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:47,580
I'll pull it up.
Well,

2701
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:50,190
and I think that's great.
I was one of the really important things

2702
01:56:50,191 --> 01:56:51,990
that he said that I completely agree 
with.

2703
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:57,080
I will say that I do think both sides 
say that like even when I was on not the

2704
01:56:58,971 --> 01:57:01,430
comedy side of the.
Of the thing,

2705
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:06,460
right.
It's like shouting down at the female 

2706
01:57:06,591 --> 01:57:08,600
journalists are trying to get them 
fired.

2707
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:13,010
Is still just as bad as complaining 
about tosses joke.

2708
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,750
You know what I mean?
Like it is both sides.

2709
01:57:14,751 --> 01:57:18,350
Trying to shut the other person down 
instead of like a dialogue.

2710
01:57:18,351 --> 01:57:20,090
Nicholas Christakis.
That's,

2711
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:21,350
that's his name.
Oh,

2712
01:57:21,351 --> 01:57:22,780
is that the guy who was talking about?
Yeah.

2713
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:23,660
Yeah.
That's his name.

2714
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:27,090
Sam Harris with the gross pop up.
Kill those on your website.

2715
01:57:27,091 --> 01:57:29,220
Dude.
Those are gross sinew for newsletter.

2716
01:57:29,221 --> 01:57:30,390
I'm not going to sign up now.
Sam,

2717
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:33,110
you fucked your shelf with that little 
pop up.

2718
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:35,400
God,
I hate pop up windows.

2719
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:37,750
This is the new twitter war.
Just Joe over.

2720
01:57:37,751 --> 01:57:39,300
Sam.
I love Sam.

2721
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,110
Who knows?
I love him,

2722
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:45,140
but I hate popups.
So he was the CO director of the aliens 

2723
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:47,850
too for network science and uh,
he wound up having to step down

2724
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:54,340
if this is the,
is the CO director of the animals too 

2725
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:54,340
for network science.
So he was a,

2726
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:56,570
he was a professor of social and natural
science.

2727
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:58,850
Was this a guy whose wife also got into 
trouble?

2728
01:57:58,910 --> 01:57:59,660
That's the guy.
Okay.

2729
01:57:59,661 --> 01:58:03,890
So this episode literally changed a lot 
of my views on everything.

2730
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,380
Yeah,
it was.

2731
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:07,070
Well,
it's a very important episode in was the

2732
01:58:07,071 --> 01:58:11,180
name of the episode Jamie.
So facing the crowd facing the crowd.

2733
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:16,270
It was about women.
This woman shouted him down and you 

2734
01:58:16,270 --> 01:58:16,490
know,
you're supposed this is our home.

2735
01:58:16,491 --> 01:58:20,840
You supposed to be fucking protecting us
about Halloween costumes.

2736
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:25,960
And the wife had made a letter that she 
had sent out and then let her 

2737
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:30,460
essentially said you people should be 
allowed to have like,

2738
01:58:30,461 --> 01:58:31,490
we'll play some of this here.

2739
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,710
I hear that.
I'm looking at this record your face.

2740
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:38,900
I'm disgusted and I'm sick.
Watching them argue with you.

2741
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:43,990
I've been,
we've been standing outside literally 

2742
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,800
for at least five to six hours between 
you and Holloway,

2743
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:50,280
which we last night to now.
We've been arguing with people who are 

2744
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,440
not willing to be listened to for a long
time and all I see from you is arrogance

2745
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:58,090
and ego.
I am sick looking at you.

2746
01:58:58,150 --> 01:59:00,770
I am disgusted watching.
Argue with you.

2747
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,190
You are not listening.
You are disgusting.

2748
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:11,640
I don't think you understand that.
And before I wasn't I before,

2749
01:59:11,641 --> 01:59:14,490
I was not angry per say,
I was disappointed.

2750
01:59:14,491 --> 01:59:17,490
Maybe I thought maybe there was room for
before an apology.

2751
01:59:17,491 --> 01:59:20,070
You've clearly told us that children are
plant.

2752
01:59:20,071 --> 01:59:25,071
Offer an apology for your words.
You left the meeting last night to go 

2753
01:59:25,071 --> 01:59:26,880
home and then tweaked.
Do not interrupt me.

2754
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:30,630
Two tweets from your twitter and then 
the filaments.

2755
01:59:30,631 --> 01:59:32,280
Twitter,
you showed no remorse.

2756
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:35,730
You tried to let your wife leave that 
conversation without having answered for

2757
01:59:35,731 --> 01:59:37,590
herself.
That is disgusting.

2758
01:59:37,650 --> 01:59:40,350
That is sick and now I wasn't angry 
before.

2759
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:43,620
I was not angry before,
but now I'm actually angry.

2760
01:59:43,621 --> 01:59:45,390
Sir.
I really do not interrupt me.

2761
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:49,530
I was not angry and now I want your job 
to be taken from me.

2762
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:55,160
I don't want to have this job.
I am disgusted knowing that you worked 

2763
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:55,980
at Yale University where I will get my 
degree.

2764
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,570
Well,
I will look back and think.

2765
01:59:57,571 --> 01:59:58,750
I used to argue with you.

2766
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:03,710
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

2767
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:09,020
To not do it.
This is not the day you do not want to 

2768
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:09,020
play this game with or anything.
You don't wanna.

2769
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:10,230
Play this game with me.
Okay?

2770
02:00:10,231 --> 02:00:15,231
I understand that.
Look at me in my face first of all and 

2771
02:00:15,231 --> 02:00:16,680
understand that you are such a 
disappointment to this university,

2772
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:18,480
to your students,
to yourself,

2773
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:20,710
to the things that you claim to agree 
with you.

2774
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:24,420
If you want free dialogue,
you want free speech.

2775
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:26,280
This is how it works.
Someone speaks,

2776
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:28,290
you listen,
you're not cut them up.

2777
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:30,790
You did not do these,
these condescending gesture.

2778
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:33,740
You not smirk.
You look them in the face and you wait.

2779
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:35,940
You wait,
your turn.

2780
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:43,670
I think napping is amazing.
I'm just so fucking characteristic.

2781
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:48,700
The most upsetting part of that.
I think what upset me the most is she 

2782
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:50,520
has my poetry cadence.
It was like she was doing the same moves

2783
02:00:50,521 --> 02:00:55,521
and the same delivery.
Well she was just trying to be 

2784
02:00:55,521 --> 02:00:56,030
intelligent and say something and shut 
him up and sound sin.

2785
02:00:56,031 --> 02:00:58,370
But that's the most important thing is 
that she didn't want a dialogue.

2786
02:00:58,420 --> 02:00:59,720
She wanted to be.
He also,

2787
02:00:59,721 --> 02:01:02,480
from what I remember on the podcast,
he didn't need to be out there.

2788
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:05,200
He stayed up there for hours and talk to
those people are super reasonable.

2789
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:07,460
So when she was saying like,
you're wasting my time or whatever.

2790
02:01:07,461 --> 02:01:12,461
Like he came out to try to Kinda like 
have his wife's back and like calling 

2791
02:01:12,461 --> 02:01:14,810
him like he came out to have a dial when
I hear them out.

2792
02:01:14,811 --> 02:01:16,950
But like he didn't fucking need to be 
there.

2793
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:19,370
What she was saying,
I'm going to have your job.

2794
02:01:19,371 --> 02:01:20,600
This is where I'm going to get my 
degree.

2795
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:22,210
And guess what fucker.
I mean,

2796
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:27,230
I'll tell you this,
as somebody who lost their job and as 

2797
02:01:27,831 --> 02:01:30,710
someone who has gone after people on 
twitter,

2798
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:36,040
those people that we tried to get fired 
or from a writing job or whatever,

2799
02:01:38,780 --> 02:01:43,780
you think about them the next day,
like the people who tried to get that 

2800
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:46,070
guy fired on twitter or whatever,
like they don't think about him anymore.

2801
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:48,080
If he got fired.
Those are kids.

2802
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:50,570
I mean you're looking at an 18 year old 
or a 19 year old,

2803
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:54,470
but the twitter and intoxicated 
intoxicated by that moment as well,

2804
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:55,130
you know?
Yeah.

2805
02:01:55,131 --> 02:01:57,440
But the twitter mob behind them,
it's like a lot of me's,

2806
02:01:57,590 --> 02:01:59,180
a lot of adults too,
you know,

2807
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:01,520
and like that dude got fired and his 
wife got fired.

2808
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,200
Like,
I mean that's,

2809
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,030
that's like somebody's life who's done a
lot of really good progress.

2810
02:02:06,031 --> 02:02:08,360
They're saying even if he did fuck up 
legitimately,

2811
02:02:08,370 --> 02:02:13,370
it's like.
And it's also the consequence of 

2812
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:13,580
actually being able to be fired.
That's a problem.

2813
02:02:13,610 --> 02:02:16,640
Like say if you were running a,
the Jamie Kilstein show,

2814
02:02:16,641 --> 02:02:18,600
you got your own podcast,
someone can't fire you,

2815
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,790
you know?
And that's,

2816
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:23,690
that's really important to be able to 
fully and completely express yourself.

2817
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:28,720
Yeah,
I mean if you had done something 

2818
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:30,761
horrible,
the marketplace of free ideas should 

2819
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:31,730
step in and say we're not going to watch
his show anymore when I got to listen to

2820
02:02:31,731 --> 02:02:34,250
him anymore and that,
that would be normal and real.

2821
02:02:34,830 --> 02:02:38,510
The problem with being a professor of 
the university is twofold problem,

2822
02:02:38,511 --> 02:02:43,511
right?
There's tenure and tenure makes 

2823
02:02:43,511 --> 02:02:45,461
professors arrogant.
It makes professors realized that they 

2824
02:02:45,461 --> 02:02:46,940
can't leave and then they suck at it and
they're terrible.

2825
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:48,410
I mean,
it's really common.

2826
02:02:48,411 --> 02:02:53,411
It's almost like winning the lottery,
like they become lazy and weak or they 

2827
02:02:53,411 --> 02:02:55,340
become the idea.
Uh,

2828
02:02:55,450 --> 02:03:00,450
and the,
the ideal situation is they become 

2829
02:03:00,450 --> 02:03:00,450
completely dedicated to being a 
professor.

2830
02:03:00,450 --> 02:03:02,480
I don't have to worry anymore about 
their job.

2831
02:03:02,481 --> 02:03:06,020
And so now they completely dedicate 
themselves to being an educator.

2832
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:11,240
That's,
that's what we would hope that they 

2833
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:11,240
don't have to worry about being fired.
Yeah.

2834
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,610
And I really hope that the people 
listening to this,

2835
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:17,860
because I wouldn't have listened to that
podcast if I brought up that podcast and

2836
02:03:17,861 --> 02:03:20,270
my old circle,
I would have gotten in trouble.

2837
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:25,540
Um,
I wanted to listen to a lot of your 

2838
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:27,371
shows and I'm sure there are people who 
completely disagree with me 

2839
02:03:27,371 --> 02:03:28,400
ideologically who wouldn't,
you know,

2840
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:31,370
read whatever that the interceptor 
democracy now or,

2841
02:03:31,371 --> 02:03:32,420
or,
or something on the other side.

2842
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:37,780
And it's like my life has gotten so much
better and wider and vaster and I think 

2843
02:03:38,091 --> 02:03:40,280
it's made me a more empathetic person 
because again,

2844
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:45,310
on the left,
you just assume you're empathetic 

2845
02:03:45,310 --> 02:03:45,310
because you're on the left.

2846
02:03:45,310 --> 02:03:48,550
Yeah.
Even though you're trying to get people 

2847
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:50,081
fired,
even though you're going out for their 

2848
02:03:50,081 --> 02:03:50,081
jobs and you're insulting them,
you're,

2849
02:03:50,081 --> 02:03:51,620
you're labeling them.
And the,

2850
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:56,640
the broadest strokes of racism and 
sexism and know you're calling them 

2851
02:03:57,530 --> 02:04:02,530
terrible.
And that's the problem where it's like 

2852
02:04:02,530 --> 02:04:03,350
framing and then that makes your larger 
ideals,

2853
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:05,150
which are,
can be correct.

2854
02:04:05,870 --> 02:04:07,600
They don't matter as more.
Yeah,

2855
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:10,400
because you're not acting like I came in
being.

2856
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:15,401
And then it's also like,
do you actually even care about those 

2857
02:04:15,401 --> 02:04:15,401
groups you're defending or do you just 
want to be on sort of the right side and

2858
02:04:15,401 --> 02:04:17,600
get your bonus points?
Which is like,

2859
02:04:17,690 --> 02:04:18,870
that's a big part of it,
right?

2860
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:21,410
I would like to think I was both,
you know,

2861
02:04:21,411 --> 02:04:26,411
like when they turned,
I wasn't suddenly just like fuck gay 

2862
02:04:26,411 --> 02:04:26,411
people,
you know.

2863
02:04:26,411 --> 02:04:27,560
But you did eat a steak right away,
man.

2864
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:32,980
But it was a heterosexual CIS cow.
Most cows are actually dumped the 

2865
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:35,510
Navajo.
Yeah,

2866
02:04:35,511 --> 02:04:36,980
that's what a steer is,
is.

2867
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:38,190
Yeah,
they,

2868
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:39,700
they cut their balls off.
I got it.

2869
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:42,600
But even that,
like I was emailing with,

2870
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:47,220
I was emailing with Robb Wolf,
the big Paleo guy and it's like,

2871
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:52,640
you know how much.
There's a lot of shit that vegans and 

2872
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:54,741
Paleo people could have in common when 
it comes down to like hating factory 

2873
02:04:54,741 --> 02:04:56,810
farms or like trying to get like the 
healthiest like that,

2874
02:04:56,811 --> 02:05:00,180
like animal welfare and like,
I mean eating show many of the,

2875
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:05,210
these Paleo guys are like,
the majority of what you're eating 

2876
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:05,210
should be fucking vegetables.
Sure.

2877
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:05,210
You know what I mean?
And,

2878
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:06,050
and,
and,

2879
02:05:06,051 --> 02:05:11,051
and they're just talking about health 
and they are talking about animal 

2880
02:05:11,051 --> 02:05:11,051
welfare and that's so fascinating where 
it's like,

2881
02:05:11,051 --> 02:05:15,470
oh,
those conversations will never fucking 

2882
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,470
happen.
Well,

2883
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,470
what we've done,
it's a real problem,

2884
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:18,780
is jam too many people into a small area
where there's no one growing any food.

2885
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:24,050
And so to solve that problem,
they've figured out how to consolidate 

2886
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:26,850
massive amounts of growing into these 
areas.

2887
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:32,030
Both agriculture in terms of like 
vegetables and grains and animals.

2888
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:34,500
I mean it's all fucking gross.
Oh yeah.

2889
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:39,501
What they do,
the way they grow vegetables is totally 

2890
02:05:39,501 --> 02:05:42,321
unnatural.
You're not supposed to have a gigantic 

2891
02:05:42,321 --> 02:05:42,321
swath of land.
No.

2892
02:05:42,321 --> 02:05:42,321
It's only dedicated to wheat.
Well,

2893
02:05:42,321 --> 02:05:44,370
and then all the steroids that they give
the do.

2894
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:49,430
I saw a picture of a cow,
ones that I couldn't stand up because I 

2895
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:49,560
could utter was so fucking big.
It was like Wayne down.

2896
02:05:49,561 --> 02:05:52,860
Like that shit is.
That's actually a misconception.

2897
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:56,880
There's,
it's very rare that they put steroids in

2898
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:58,300
cows.
So what is it?

2899
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:03,120
What they do do is they put a lot of 
antibiotics in the cows because the cows

2900
02:06:03,121 --> 02:06:08,121
are eating things that they're not 
supposed to be eating like grain and 

2901
02:06:08,121 --> 02:06:11,181
they get really sick and they're doing 
that to fatten them up to make it 

2902
02:06:11,181 --> 02:06:11,181
bigger.

2903
02:06:11,181 --> 02:06:11,181
Right,
exactly.

2904
02:06:11,181 --> 02:06:12,510
And also that grain.
You could feasibly feed two people.

2905
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:13,620
Yeah,
you can.

2906
02:06:13,621 --> 02:06:18,621
Sure.
I'm also the thing which was people 

2907
02:06:18,621 --> 02:06:19,350
don't want to eat grass,
but the yield is much higher.

2908
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,970
You know,
if they can get a cow,

2909
02:06:20,971 --> 02:06:24,480
they come to market quicker,
they grow faster,

2910
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:27,840
but there are unhealthy there.
When you get a marbled steak,

2911
02:06:28,190 --> 02:06:33,190
like what's that?
Why goo stuff that people cherish and 

2912
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:34,680
love that Wagyu steak.
I'm the wrong person to ask,

2913
02:06:34,681 --> 02:06:35,570
but.
Well it's.

2914
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:37,890
It's a really obese cow as well.
Okay.

2915
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:42,740
But if you eat grain and you're a cow,
that's what happens to your basket.

2916
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:46,230
I'll just get fat and gross chicken is 
another one.

2917
02:06:46,231 --> 02:06:49,170
People always think the chickens are 
getting pumped up with steroids.

2918
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:53,400
Steroids are expensive.
What would they do with chickens is it's

2919
02:06:53,401 --> 02:06:58,401
really a breeding thing.
It's just like the way you make a 

2920
02:06:58,401 --> 02:06:58,401
bulldog or the,
you know,

2921
02:06:58,401 --> 02:07:00,090
how do you improve the biggest massive.

2922
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:03,090
They take the biggest animals,
they breed them with the biggest animals

2923
02:07:03,091 --> 02:07:08,091
and they've gotten to this position 
where these chickens are so fucked up 

2924
02:07:08,091 --> 02:07:10,650
because they bred them to be so large 
they can't even stand up.

2925
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:15,680
Oh yeah.
When they're like a clause like mold 

2926
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,510
around the cage and they're jammed into 
these little areas to tough,

2927
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:20,070
but then on top of that,
the real issue is that these animals are

2928
02:07:20,071 --> 02:07:22,560
on top of each other.
They're living in each other's shit.

2929
02:07:22,561 --> 02:07:24,360
They get sick all the time.
Yeah.

2930
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:26,970
That was that super chicken.
That chicken is actually healthy,

2931
02:07:27,030 --> 02:07:28,740
but by the way,
you see it walk around.

2932
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:31,530
That's just an enormous large breed of 
chicken.

2933
02:07:31,531 --> 02:07:33,600
That chicken,
sesame street character.

2934
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:36,110
It's a perspective issue too.
I'm sure if you were standing next to it

2935
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,860
wouldn't look as big,
but I mean,

2936
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:38,890
you know,
there's Turkeys.

2937
02:07:38,891 --> 02:07:40,690
Turkeys are pretty big,
but the,

2938
02:07:40,691 --> 02:07:42,760
the,
the real issue is antibiotics.

2939
02:07:42,761 --> 02:07:46,030
Antibiotics is a huge issue because 
those antibiotics are,

2940
02:07:46,510 --> 02:07:49,420
first of all,
you get these animals like pigs.

2941
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:51,010
The worst is pigs,
man,

2942
02:07:51,011 --> 02:07:54,150
because pigs are fucking smart.
At least chickens or reptile.

2943
02:07:54,290 --> 02:07:55,570
Yes,
they're birds.

2944
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:58,720
They're brains are fucking tiny.
Baby pigs are like.

2945
02:07:58,721 --> 02:07:59,980
Poppies are so cute.

2946
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:05,350
Heard.
There was a Glenn Greenwald article 

2947
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:08,570
recently that he published about these 
people that got arrested because they 

2948
02:08:08,941 --> 02:08:13,941
adopted these pigs.
They actually stole these pigs from a 

2949
02:08:13,941 --> 02:08:14,340
factory farm and nurse them back to 
health,

2950
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:17,070
but in doing so and them getting 
arrested,

2951
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:20,450
expose the horrific conditions.
Oh yeah.

2952
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:25,230
FBI's hunt for two missing piglets 
reveals the federal cover up of barbaric

2953
02:08:25,231 --> 02:08:30,231
factory farms and that is a real cover 
up because it's money and that's why 

2954
02:08:30,231 --> 02:08:32,130
they have what they call ag gag laws and
I'm sure you're aware of these.

2955
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:37,020
These AG gag laws are fucking insane.
Where they make it illegal for people to

2956
02:08:37,021 --> 02:08:42,021
take footage and film what's going on in
these factory farms because they think 

2957
02:08:42,021 --> 02:08:43,400
they will negatively impact the business
and the farm.

2958
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:43,990
Yeah.
It's like,

2959
02:08:43,991 --> 02:08:45,440
yes.
Yes it will.

2960
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:48,420
Because you're fucking break here.
Your main.

2961
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:50,490
You're denying people information.
Yeah,

2962
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,630
and that deny people information like 
that.

2963
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:54,970
That was one of those issues that I 
think I.

2964
02:08:55,060 --> 02:09:00,060
I think will potter,
I think I knew a couple of those guys 

2965
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:00,060
because mercy for animals has done a 
bunch of those,

2966
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:03,430
like undercover operations and stuff and
that's one of those things that again,

2967
02:09:03,431 --> 02:09:05,740
that that should bring together both 
sides.

2968
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:09,220
We're all eating these animals.
Right?

2969
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,830
Or you're Vegan and you're trying to 
stop this,

2970
02:09:11,831 --> 02:09:14,020
but you know,
no one for the most part,

2971
02:09:14,021 --> 02:09:19,021
it's like a fucking monster.
No one is like asking for like a 

2972
02:09:19,021 --> 02:09:21,601
tortured animal like this who's like 
rolling around in their own feces where 

2973
02:09:21,601 --> 02:09:23,320
it's like everybody has the right to 
know this.

2974
02:09:23,321 --> 02:09:28,321
This is something that I think the Vegan
community can be very mainstream about 

2975
02:09:28,321 --> 02:09:32,390
and should get a lot of support and 
greenwald to always been like a softie 

2976
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:35,581
for animals too.
Like he does all of his like snowden 

2977
02:09:35,581 --> 02:09:38,341
stuff,
but dude has like 15 rescue dogs in 

2978
02:09:38,341 --> 02:09:38,341
Brazil and he loves animals.
I know I'm,

2979
02:09:38,341 --> 02:09:40,190
I'm glad this is getting coverage from 
these guys.

2980
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:43,090
Getting coverage too and Kudos to him 
for putting that out.

2981
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:43,870
You know,
he's,

2982
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:49,920
he's highlighting something that's a 
real issue and that if that issue is 

2983
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:54,250
there's,
there's a concerted effort to deny 

2984
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:56,461
people information because that 
information would change the way they 

2985
02:09:56,461 --> 02:09:57,050
feel about the food they eat and you 
know,

2986
02:09:57,070 --> 02:10:02,070
the argument is that these,
they have to have these conditions 

2987
02:10:02,070 --> 02:10:06,390
because this is the only way to give 
people food very cheaply because you 

2988
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:07,490
have to feed,
you know,

2989
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:09,610
20 million people in Los Angeles.
But I don't,

2990
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:11,710
I don't buy that article,
I don't buy that argument.

2991
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,830
I think this is just how it's convenient
to run.

2992
02:10:14,831 --> 02:10:15,000
Right?

2993
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:16,600
Yes.
And you also look at like,

2994
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:19,030
what's the Shit we actually do subsidize
for poor people?

2995
02:10:19,031 --> 02:10:24,031
It's garbage.
It's like coke and like processed food 

2996
02:10:24,031 --> 02:10:24,220
and it's like subsidized corn as well,
but,

2997
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,620
but even that isn't,
that's not the best thing for,

2998
02:10:26,621 --> 02:10:31,621
you know,
especially like when it turns into like 

2999
02:10:31,621 --> 02:10:33,781
high fructose corn syrup and shit like 
that where it's like people need to be 

3000
02:10:33,781 --> 02:10:37,651
educated doctors or barely educated 
about nutrition and health and if we 

3001
02:10:37,651 --> 02:10:41,471
actually had healthy food,
whether it be meat or vegetables or 

3002
02:10:41,471 --> 02:10:44,681
whatever in these food deserts.
And so that's why I always got mad when 

3003
02:10:44,841 --> 02:10:45,680
people were like,
oh,

3004
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:47,960
look at that fucking fat person on food 
stamps.

3005
02:10:47,970 --> 02:10:52,970
It's like,
well it's not because they're like 

3006
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:54,280
eating a ton of grass fed beef.
It's because like they're fucking food 

3007
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:58,151
stamps can buy them and serial and Mac 
and cheese boxes and shit like that.

3008
02:10:58,820 --> 02:10:59,930
But that's another thing where it's 
like,

3009
02:10:59,931 --> 02:11:01,880
well that's not a conversation we have 
because we go,

3010
02:11:01,881 --> 02:11:06,240
you're either on the Vegan side or the 
Saturday or the pro government or your,

3011
02:11:06,241 --> 02:11:08,810
your antigovernment.
It's like there are answers.

3012
02:11:08,811 --> 02:11:13,811
I feel like if people put their heads 
together and weren't just trying to get 

3013
02:11:13,811 --> 02:11:13,811
like,
yeah,

3014
02:11:13,811 --> 02:11:18,080
the guy who used the wrong pejorative 
fired from the New Yorker or whatever.

3015
02:11:19,590 --> 02:11:21,660
It's again,
just like everything else.

3016
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:24,810
There's more information available now 
than ever before.

3017
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:27,900
And I think more people are aware of 
this information.

3018
02:11:28,350 --> 02:11:31,680
It's just so many people are distracted 
by nonsense all day.

3019
02:11:31,890 --> 02:11:32,540
Like,
uh,

3020
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:34,110
yesterday,
Tony and I,

3021
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:39,140
Tony Hinchcliffe and I,
we did a Gig in San Francisco and when 

3022
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:41,331
we were coming back were at the airport 
and we were next to this gal at the 

3023
02:11:41,331 --> 02:11:43,710
airport and she's talking on the phone 
about the most inane bullshit.

3024
02:11:43,890 --> 02:11:46,140
She's talking about amazing race and 
amazing,

3025
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:49,110
right?
The teams on amazing race are just not,

3026
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:52,050
they're just,
I'm so annoyed with them so I'm not even

3027
02:11:52,051 --> 02:11:53,370
watching it anymore,
but oh my God,

3028
02:11:53,371 --> 02:11:58,200
I'm so hungry and this place has this 
amazing Chiro and this is blah,

3029
02:11:58,201 --> 02:11:58,560
blah,
blah,

3030
02:11:58,561 --> 02:11:58,890
blah,
blah,

3031
02:11:58,920 --> 02:11:59,340
blah,
blah.

3032
02:11:59,341 --> 02:12:01,260
And I'm supposed to be getting this 
thing at work,

3033
02:12:01,261 --> 02:12:06,261
but know so far my pay increase hasn't 
come through and when it comes through 

3034
02:12:06,261 --> 02:12:10,230
I'm going to save up my money and I'm 
going to get this thing so mattered.

3035
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,260
But this is what,
you know,

3036
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:14,500
this is the average person's life.
It just,

3037
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:17,280
they get distracted by nonsense.
They talk about bullshit.

3038
02:12:17,281 --> 02:12:18,870
They're watching stupidity.

3039
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:20,160
One,
it's hard because it's getting,

3040
02:12:20,190 --> 02:12:25,190
it's getting fed to you and a lot of 
people aren't doing what they actually 

3041
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,670
want to do and they don't believe they 
can.

3042
02:12:26,671 --> 02:12:31,671
Actually do it and and they go to 
college because they're told they're 

3043
02:12:31,671 --> 02:12:33,360
supposed to go to college and then 
they're riddled and student debt so they

3044
02:12:33,361 --> 02:12:35,870
get a job they hate that.
They'll stick into it.

3045
02:12:35,970 --> 02:12:40,970
Point was what I was going to get to was
that you in your obsession with twitter 

3046
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:42,370
and you're,
you're,

3047
02:12:42,430 --> 02:12:47,430
you're being addicted to it and 
constantly checking in on it and going 

3048
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:50,981
back to it.
That was your distraction because my 

3049
02:12:50,981 --> 02:12:53,711
first one was finding distractions in 
stupid television shows and bad food to 

3050
02:12:53,711 --> 02:12:57,170
eat and nonsensical raises at work and 
because of that,

3051
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:01,940
this occupies so much of your time 
between your job and your family and all

3052
02:13:01,941 --> 02:13:06,941
this.
You don't have time to think about 

3053
02:13:06,941 --> 02:13:06,941
factory farming

3054
02:13:06,941 --> 02:13:09,500
totally well and even now I can judge 
that girl when I was doing the same 

3055
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:11,010
thing on twitter,
but I could feel like well minds for the

3056
02:13:11,011 --> 02:13:13,920
cause.
Mine's not for minds,

3057
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:18,480
not for the amazing race minds like for 
equal whatever.

3058
02:13:18,481 --> 02:13:19,670
And it's like,
well it's not,

3059
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:21,240
it's not.
I'm not making a difference.

3060
02:13:21,241 --> 02:13:23,250
I'm just doing it for,
for a,

3061
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:24,480
a little,
a fav.

3062
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:27,330
I didn't even have a fucking twitter 
followers to be addicted to twitter.

3063
02:13:28,150 --> 02:13:30,030
It doesn't mean you don't mean having 
followers,

3064
02:13:30,070 --> 02:13:35,070
not what makes you did and anybody can 
engage with a large group of followers 

3065
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:39,891
just by saying something mean to someone
like Glenn Greenwald or someone who has 

3066
02:13:40,861 --> 02:13:45,861
a lot of followers.
It's not hard to do glen get shit from 

3067
02:13:45,861 --> 02:13:46,260
all sides,
all sides.

3068
02:13:46,261 --> 02:13:48,390
You know,
once the Edward Snowden thing came out,

3069
02:13:48,391 --> 02:13:50,270
he became a lightning rod for it.
Right.

3070
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,050
I mean,
there's a lot of people like that.

3071
02:13:52,051 --> 02:13:53,340
There's a lot of people that are doing 
that.

3072
02:13:53,341 --> 02:13:55,050
It's a,
again,

3073
02:13:55,070 --> 02:14:00,070
it's,
it's a unique time for the distribution 

3074
02:14:00,070 --> 02:14:03,021
of information.
It's a unique time because we have to 

3075
02:14:03,021 --> 02:14:05,790
sort out ourselves how we manage this 
information and where it's,

3076
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:07,370
how it's kitten in man

3077
02:14:07,650 --> 02:14:12,650
say like once I just sort of started 
focusing on in a weird way being 

3078
02:14:13,831 --> 02:14:15,060
selfish,
like whereas like,

3079
02:14:15,061 --> 02:14:20,061
how can I just be a better person?
You end up that like,

3080
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:21,300
I mean,
how can I better myself?

3081
02:14:21,301 --> 02:14:23,730
You end up being a better person where 
I'm like,

3082
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:28,790
I don't know what's going.
I don't know who's getting arrested 

3083
02:14:28,790 --> 02:14:29,040
right now for the Russia thing,
but I'm like,

3084
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:34,370
I know that like I'm picking my 
girlfriend up from work after I like do 

3085
02:14:34,370 --> 02:14:34,800
a bunch of Jujitsu at like a dope gym,
you know,

3086
02:14:34,801 --> 02:14:36,450
and I'm like,
I'm kind of fine with that,

3087
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:38,460
you know?
Um,

3088
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:40,500
I think it's just a healthier way to 
fucking live.

3089
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:41,370
Well,
you know,

3090
02:14:41,371 --> 02:14:43,100
you're,
you're talking about yourself and your,

3091
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:48,120
you're talking about your own sort of 
management of your life where it had 

3092
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:53,421
gone completely off the rails and now 
you've got it back on track and you're 

3093
02:14:53,421 --> 02:14:57,051
feeling yourself in a good place to 
health and now it's like maybe there is 

3094
02:14:57,051 --> 02:14:57,051
a middle ground.
Right?

3095
02:14:57,051 --> 02:14:57,051
And maybe there isn't

3096
02:14:57,051 --> 02:15:01,230
way that.
Like if I start doing shows again I can 

3097
02:15:01,230 --> 02:15:01,980
like be on twitter and I'll be a douche 
bag.

3098
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:03,350
You can,
you definitely can.

3099
02:15:03,410 --> 02:15:07,490
And I think that having this negative 
experience and getting through it,

3100
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:11,510
that's how you learn and grow.
I mean these bad,

3101
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,560
these big moments are big opportunities 
for growth.

3102
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:19,280
Whereas the same grind day in,
day out,

3103
02:15:19,281 --> 02:15:21,050
you become like the Gal at the airport,
it's like,

3104
02:15:21,051 --> 02:15:26,051
well,
these teams and amazing range here and 

3105
02:15:26,051 --> 02:15:26,230
nine to put these chairs are their best 
churros in their chairs.

3106
02:15:26,231 --> 02:15:29,240
Cheros are dry and boring.
You know,

3107
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:34,300
there's nothing happening.
Having a big moment where all these 

3108
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:37,400
people attacked you and things went 
totally wrong.

3109
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:42,460
It gave you this opportunity for self 
reflection and in a way that you're 

3110
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:45,680
really probably were very unlikely to 
achieve without this moment.

3111
02:15:45,681 --> 02:15:46,620
No,
I was even going to.

3112
02:15:46,621 --> 02:15:51,621
I was either going to be off the 
Brooklyn Bridge or a bigger Douche bag 

3113
02:15:51,621 --> 02:15:55,230
and I don't know which one was worse.
You were at the all things comedy 

3114
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:55,230
festival.

3115
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:55,760
You're hanging out with Bert and to 
Oregon.

3116
02:15:55,761 --> 02:16:00,020
It was just literally the funniest 
people on the planet and [inaudible] are

3117
02:16:00,021 --> 02:16:03,520
like the funniest people on the planet.
Doug on Ari.

3118
02:16:03,770 --> 02:16:04,730
He peed on him.
Right.

3119
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:07,010
That might've been the day after I left.
I saw so mature.

3120
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:10,530
I definitely saw red friends.
I've seen artistic.

3121
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:12,020
Yeah.
I saw red deck.

3122
02:16:12,021 --> 02:16:13,010
I didn't see DAX.
Dax,

3123
02:16:13,011 --> 02:16:15,380
you know,
if I was in the wrong circles.

3124
02:16:15,390 --> 02:16:18,560
Ari could have sexually assaulted me 
with his Dick by showing me his deck.

3125
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:20,300
It would be considered some sort of,
uh,

3126
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:23,330
my girlfriend pointed that out when he 
came out on stage naked.

3127
02:16:23,331 --> 02:16:28,331
It's like,
would there be women in there that'd be 

3128
02:16:28,331 --> 02:16:29,891
like,
that is sexual assault because I saw it 

3129
02:16:29,891 --> 02:16:30,370
as a citizen's radio show.
You

3130
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:31,890
definitely,
people would like,

3131
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:36,930
they would be like,
their fingers would hurt from typing so 

3132
02:16:36,930 --> 02:16:37,710
much to Jezza Bell.
It would fill the comments.

3133
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:42,740
I wouldn't feel good about himself.
I a fascination with Meghan Kelly or 

3134
02:16:43,201 --> 02:16:47,350
reject Jaza bells.
Daily breakdown of Meghan Kelly's name.

3135
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:48,980
Retarded show.
Yeah.

3136
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:50,800
It's,
you know,

3137
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:51,470
man,
we,

3138
02:16:51,490 --> 02:16:53,710
we all,
we could all be nicer.

3139
02:16:53,890 --> 02:16:57,100
We could all find some sort of a middle 
ground and look,

3140
02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:57,960
get all,
you know,

3141
02:16:57,990 --> 02:17:00,250
we could all learn from all these 
experiences,

3142
02:17:00,251 --> 02:17:05,251
you know,
I can learn from your experience for 

3143
02:17:05,251 --> 02:17:05,251
sure.
Yeah.

3144
02:17:05,251 --> 02:17:06,010
I guess that random women.
Well,

3145
02:17:06,011 --> 02:17:10,090
I'm not a Predator like a Hashtag.
You're the problem.

3146
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:13,630
Know everyone's doing it now.
Uh,

3147
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:18,870
yeah man.
I got to say like a listening to like 

3148
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:20,410
you and Bert and Doug and I started 
listening to Fitzsimons pocket all these

3149
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:23,150
podcasts about comedy and,
and,

3150
02:17:23,151 --> 02:17:26,560
and thinking about how,
you know,

3151
02:17:26,561 --> 02:17:28,570
just because I feel like I failed.

3152
02:17:28,570 --> 02:17:33,570
I was like,
I guess I shit on all comics and 

3153
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:33,570
forgetting about that.
Like even the comics,

3154
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:35,080
you say the most horrific shit on stage 
for the most part.

3155
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:40,350
There's a lot of really cool broken 
sweet guys who like through all of the 

3156
02:17:40,781 --> 02:17:43,690
bullshit had my back.
Like I remember I heard burt,

3157
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:46,930
I told burt this,
I think actually on the podcast,

3158
02:17:46,931 --> 02:17:51,931
maybe backstage,
but I told burt that like I was going 

3159
02:17:51,931 --> 02:17:54,451
back and listening to a bunch of his 
podcasts and I listened to the one he 

3160
02:17:54,451 --> 02:17:56,410
did with metzker because I wanted that 
other fucking side to it.

3161
02:17:56,411 --> 02:18:01,411
Right.
One of the other side's situation was 

3162
02:18:01,411 --> 02:18:01,411
fascinating,
but you know,

3163
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:01,960
to,
to.

3164
02:18:01,961 --> 02:18:03,520
I don't know if curt wants us to be 
known,

3165
02:18:03,521 --> 02:18:08,521
but he was devastated by that.
I mean like really bad loss and hurt a 

3166
02:18:08,521 --> 02:18:12,870
lot.
He was super unhealthy mean he felt he 

3167
02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:12,870
felt it.

3168
02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:13,090
That he raged.
Man,

3169
02:18:13,091 --> 02:18:14,320
when they come after you.
Well,

3170
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:16,870
and when I heard him on the podcast and 
not,

3171
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:21,960
he gets a little mouthy on facebook,
but when I actually heard him on the 

3172
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:21,960
podcast,
articulate what he was talking about,

3173
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:22,720
where he was like,
no,

3174
02:18:22,721 --> 02:18:24,970
I think this.
So for people who don't know,

3175
02:18:24,971 --> 02:18:29,971
like some fucking dude at ucb was 
accused of rape I think.

3176
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:33,160
And,
and Kurt essentially said,

3177
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:37,780
you know,
he made it sort of in parody saying that

3178
02:18:37,781 --> 02:18:41,350
no woman could ever lie and a woman is 
like my Bible.

3179
02:18:41,351 --> 02:18:42,610
It's always true.
And Yeah.

3180
02:18:42,710 --> 02:18:47,710
But he was also saying that like UCB 
said like they did an investigation and 

3181
02:18:47,710 --> 02:18:49,750
found this guy guilty and he was like,
you can't,

3182
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:54,880
you can't do it.
Like I don't know how to play an Improv 

3183
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:54,880
theater can like yes.
And their way to the clues.

3184
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:55,310
Like I don't know how that happened.

3185
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:56,770
Not Detectives.
No,

3186
02:18:56,771 --> 02:19:01,771
but now this dude can fucking,
if he is guilty he can like shoot the 

3187
02:19:01,771 --> 02:19:01,810
ucb he like,
he can get.

3188
02:19:01,811 --> 02:19:06,811
And that's what Kurt was saying to where
it's worded it poorly and it turns out 

3189
02:19:06,811 --> 02:19:11,400
that they believe the guy who is a piece
of shit and curse will be the first to 

3190
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:11,400
say that.
So anyway,

3191
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:13,270
so I listened to badly.
No,

3192
02:19:13,271 --> 02:19:18,271
totally.
And so I listened to this interview and 

3193
02:19:18,271 --> 02:19:18,271
that has to do with,
again,

3194
02:19:18,271 --> 02:19:19,030
just judging people on the Internet 
without facts.

3195
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:24,120
Right.
So I listened to this interview with 

3196
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:26,491
Kurt and burdens really good and I think
that was the first time I heard bird 

3197
02:19:26,491 --> 02:19:28,280
show and at the end I was like,
ah,

3198
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:33,370
alright the,
they started talking about me and they 

3199
02:19:33,370 --> 02:19:34,490
weren't really wrong about a lot of the 
stuff they said.

3200
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,000
And I had this moment where burt,
who I only met once,

3201
02:19:40,071 --> 02:19:45,071
we did some weird TV show together and 
like Amsterdam and I only met him once 

3202
02:19:45,071 --> 02:19:49,750
and he,
I thought it was going to be like him 

3203
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:50,360
just being like this fucking faggot 
feminist because that was the idea I had

3204
02:19:50,361 --> 02:19:51,980
of like all comics and how they thought 
about me.

3205
02:19:51,981 --> 02:19:53,480
Right.
And he was just like,

3206
02:19:53,481 --> 02:19:55,520
yeah man,
I was just bummed out because I remember

3207
02:19:55,521 --> 02:19:58,980
like Jamie was nice and then like it 
just like made me sad that he liked,

3208
02:19:59,030 --> 02:20:00,950
didn't stick up for comics and I was 
like,

3209
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:06,640
it was just like really sweet and 
sincere and kind of like even like 

3210
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:10,900
vulnerable.
And I remember turning to my girlfriend 

3211
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:13,311
and be like,
I want to apologize to Burton more than 

3212
02:20:13,311 --> 02:20:13,640
I do these women.
He sounded so sincere and sad and I just

3213
02:20:13,641 --> 02:20:15,820
forgot about that.
Like that,

3214
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:18,740
that sort of comic camaraderie,
you know,

3215
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:23,820
it's easy to characterize us in just to 
lump us into this boarish group of 

3216
02:20:24,850 --> 02:20:28,040
asshole men that are massage agnes and 
you know,

3217
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:33,080
you.
Did you ever see that thing where a Jim 

3218
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:36,390
Norton went on w Kamau bell and that was
Lindy West.

3219
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:42,870
Lindy,
her characterization of that kind of 

3220
02:20:42,870 --> 02:20:44,560
comedy was so caricature issue was so 
ridiculous.

3221
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:45,190
Yeah.
And,

3222
02:20:45,191 --> 02:20:47,310
and they're,
they're characatures of like,

3223
02:20:47,390 --> 02:20:50,260
like I know feminists who aren't fucking
insane and who like,

3224
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:55,300
you know,
like she was wanting it to be a certain 

3225
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:58,061
way.
I think a lot of people do because it's 

3226
02:20:58,061 --> 02:20:58,370
easier to eliminate,
stereotyped and demonized.

3227
02:20:58,371 --> 02:21:00,400
Yeah.
Because like you know,

3228
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:03,420
it making that decision where I'm like,
all right,

3229
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:05,660
fucking Rogan hates me.
I don't need to listen to that podcast.

3230
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:08,360
Like I'll just get the information 
that's easier to digest that.

3231
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:09,620
That's cake,
right?

3232
02:21:09,621 --> 02:21:10,190
It's like,
cool,

3233
02:21:10,191 --> 02:21:15,191
I'm just going to listen to the shows 
that agree with me and gave me 

3234
02:21:15,191 --> 02:21:15,191
information that says you're right,
you're smart,

3235
02:21:15,191 --> 02:21:17,390
you're good.
As opposed to the stuff that's like,

3236
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:18,860
ah,
I gotta look that up.

3237
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:23,950
I have to like think about this.
I have to maybe change a behavior of 

3238
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:23,950
mine.
Right.

3239
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:26,960
And people do that on both sides and 
that's why it is so important where it's

3240
02:21:26,961 --> 02:21:29,290
like no one is the fucking stereotype of
anything that,

3241
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:30,800
that people think,
well,

3242
02:21:30,801 --> 02:21:31,970
I think we're in a

3243
02:21:31,970 --> 02:21:34,010
boat that's in rocky water,
right?

3244
02:21:34,011 --> 02:21:36,680
And I think it's going to rock left and 
it's going to rock right.

3245
02:21:36,681 --> 02:21:41,681
And hopefully we're going to right the 
ship and we're going to figure out what 

3246
02:21:41,681 --> 02:21:44,591
the fuck we're doing.
And I mean collectively the human race 

3247
02:21:44,591 --> 02:21:47,420
has probably never communicated clear 
ever and then we do now and it's because

3248
02:21:47,421 --> 02:21:52,421
of our access to information,
there's definitely going to be these 

3249
02:21:52,421 --> 02:21:53,020
groups of people that so you know,
they,

3250
02:21:53,021 --> 02:21:58,021
they haul off and they get confirmation 
bias and they made sure their walls up 

3251
02:21:58,581 --> 02:22:01,430
with this group of likeminded folks in 
an echo chamber.

3252
02:22:01,431 --> 02:22:02,690
There's always going to be that,
that.

3253
02:22:02,691 --> 02:22:07,570
But I think that is more obvious for 
what it is today than ever before.

3254
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:09,350
Totally.
And I think that's a good thing.

3255
02:22:09,351 --> 02:22:12,260
You know,
and I think that your ability to express

3256
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:17,261
yourself like this on this podcast,
we've been talking now for two and a 

3257
02:22:17,261 --> 02:22:17,261
half hours.
She is this.

3258
02:22:17,261 --> 02:22:22,090
Yeah,
this is a very unique way to 

3259
02:22:22,090 --> 02:22:24,851
communicate.
I think this is a way to communicate 

3260
02:22:24,851 --> 02:22:26,260
where you really get to know somebody 
versus someone characterizing

3261
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,290
uses.
Why have a problem with blogs?

3262
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:32,520
When someone writes a blog entry on you 
and you don't get a chance to respond,

3263
02:22:32,521 --> 02:22:34,200
they don't get a chance to see who you 
really are.

3264
02:22:34,220 --> 02:22:36,060
No.
And then when someone like me who's in a

3265
02:22:36,061 --> 02:22:40,770
position to amplify it just reads that,
you just read it as fact,

3266
02:22:40,771 --> 02:22:42,630
just like you watch the news as fat 
because you go,

3267
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:47,640
well fucking called the news.
That's why it's interesting to see it 

3268
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:48,270
come back and bite you in the ass.
Right?

3269
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:50,700
And then see your response and see.
You realize like,

3270
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:55,760
oh,
and then go through this essentially in 

3271
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:55,760
exile,
period.

3272
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:56,400
Yeah.
You know,

3273
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:59,340
I mean you,
you went a year without performing.

3274
02:22:59,490 --> 02:23:03,730
I mean that's good without talking to 
people like without talking to,

3275
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,310
to,
to comics with,

3276
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:10,370
you know.
But it was also like working on me 

3277
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:13,251
because like I,
it's not like the article was,

3278
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:18,320
was garbage,
but it's not like I wasn't like a 

3279
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:18,320
Shitty,
selfish,

3280
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:19,710
depressed in a bad spot person.

3281
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:24,360
Like there were a ton of things I needed
to fucking look at myself and fix.

3282
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:29,361
And,
and was I being selfish and wasn't 

3283
02:23:29,361 --> 02:23:32,720
making this all about me and was I.
But it's not necessarily an accurate 

3284
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:33,360
characterization of who you are as a 
person.

3285
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,710
No,
no,

3286
02:23:33,711 --> 02:23:33,870
no,
no,

3287
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:34,180
no,
no.

3288
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:37,920
But it was good for me to fix those 
other things.

3289
02:23:37,921 --> 02:23:38,400
I was like,
well,

3290
02:23:38,401 --> 02:23:43,401
I didn't do that,
but I was kind of a Douche bag so I can 

3291
02:23:43,401 --> 02:23:43,401
fix this,
you know?

3292
02:23:43,401 --> 02:23:43,880
Um,
that's why I,

3293
02:23:43,881 --> 02:23:46,350
you know,
I thought comics believed that,

3294
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:49,050
believed that article.
And when I was talking to doug and I was

3295
02:23:49,051 --> 02:23:49,980
like,
I didn't read it.

3296
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:50,660
No,
I know,

3297
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:55,710
I,
they just thought it was funny because 

3298
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:55,710
I,
I was talking to doug and I was like,

3299
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:55,710
yeah man,
I,

3300
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:55,710
I,
I know,

3301
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:55,710
I,
I,

3302
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:58,120
I don't really want to apologize because
I reread it and I,

3303
02:23:58,130 --> 02:23:59,100
I don't think it's.

3304
02:23:59,100 --> 02:23:59,670
And he's like,
no,

3305
02:23:59,671 --> 02:23:59,830
no,
no,

3306
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:00,080
no,
no,

3307
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:05,100
no,
none of us think you're a fucking 

3308
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:06,291
predator.
You're apologizing for being a Douche 

3309
02:24:06,291 --> 02:24:06,291
bag.
And I was like,

3310
02:24:06,291 --> 02:24:06,291
oh,
I get it.

3311
02:24:06,291 --> 02:24:07,170
It was the,
the turning on comedy,

3312
02:24:07,171 --> 02:24:10,070
this self righteousness.
I saw the article and I,

3313
02:24:10,071 --> 02:24:15,071
I looked at him like,
Damn Joseph is going after Jamie 

3314
02:24:15,071 --> 02:24:15,510
Kennedy.
And I laughed,

3315
02:24:15,511 --> 02:24:18,240
but I didn't think it was real.
And I felt like,

3316
02:24:18,241 --> 02:24:19,680
wow,
he's probably trying to get laid.

3317
02:24:19,890 --> 02:24:24,890
And he said something and someone took 
it and turned it into some horrific 

3318
02:24:24,890 --> 02:24:28,761
offense against all women and turns out 
that he's actually a Predator and you 

3319
02:24:28,761 --> 02:24:28,761
know,
fuck him,

3320
02:24:28,761 --> 02:24:30,510
he's cast out from the kingdom.
I mean,

3321
02:24:30,511 --> 02:24:31,650
that's just what people do,
man.

3322
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:36,800
And one of the reasons why they do it is
because they're absolutely terrified 

3323
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:37,680
that they themselves are going to get 
cast out from the kingdom.

3324
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:39,540
Dude,
I have,

3325
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:41,730
I totally,
totally.

3326
02:24:41,731 --> 02:24:45,720
Because everyone has their shit.
And it is.

3327
02:24:46,050 --> 02:24:51,050
I mean it like this,
although the Weinstein stuff and the 

3328
02:24:51,050 --> 02:24:53,880
like,
there are a lot of due to probably would

3329
02:24:53,881 --> 02:24:56,940
be supporting this more butter just 
like,

3330
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:57,540
oh,
but I,

3331
02:24:57,870 --> 02:24:59,970
I flirted with that one girl at the 
office,

3332
02:24:59,971 --> 02:25:01,350
like,
am I like Weinstein?

3333
02:25:01,351 --> 02:25:06,351
And it's like you can't compare the 
Mustang because you have to go after 

3334
02:25:06,351 --> 02:25:08,280
Weinstein with as much,
uh,

3335
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:10,470
you know,
whatever vigor,

3336
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:15,640
uh,
as you do not go after the people who 

3337
02:25:15,640 --> 02:25:16,440
were fucking flirting with the Weinstein
thing.

3338
02:25:16,441 --> 02:25:21,441
What's unique about the Weinstein thing 
is it is one of the worst cases you 

3339
02:25:22,021 --> 02:25:23,070
could imagine.
Sort of like,

3340
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:24,100
the cosby

3341
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:29,100
thing is to drugging and raping.
It's like when you read about the number

3342
02:25:29,741 --> 02:25:32,620
of people that are accusing cosby and 
you're like,

3343
02:25:32,650 --> 02:25:34,720
oh my God,
did he rape people for like,

3344
02:25:34,721 --> 02:25:37,930
this is like your full time job.
Next to the cosby show is a rapist.

3345
02:25:37,950 --> 02:25:42,950
Somebody characterized him as the worst 
serial rape or in human history.

3346
02:25:43,541 --> 02:25:47,200
I heard you say that.
That might be real.

3347
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:49,930
That might be real.
I mean he really might be.

3348
02:25:49,931 --> 02:25:52,690
He might have drugged and raped hundreds
of women.

3349
02:25:52,691 --> 02:25:54,730
We don't even know the numbers by the 
way.

3350
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:59,880
That's another fucking example now that 
I think about it of what you were just 

3351
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:03,601
saying where the last however many years
he went from comic to lecturing like 

3352
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:10,740
black people about how to wear their 
pants and how to articulate and he was 

3353
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:12,160
talking about manners and how to present
yourself and it's like,

3354
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,140
oh,
you're covering up drugging them,

3355
02:26:14,141 --> 02:26:16,420
raping people where it's like you're 
like,

3356
02:26:16,421 --> 02:26:17,090
you know what I mean?

3357
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:22,110
That is what bit him in the ass because 
Hannibal burress talking about him on 

3358
02:26:22,110 --> 02:26:22,110
stage,
which in a comic,

3359
02:26:22,110 --> 02:26:26,640
that's what got him.
I still can't handle comic saying,

3360
02:26:26,831 --> 02:26:27,310
you know,
hey,

3361
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:28,810
you know,
you tell me not to swear,

3362
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:30,380
hey,
at least I'm not out there raping women.

3363
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:31,950
People were like,
wait,

3364
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,310
what?
What?

3365
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:35,650
Like the average person didn't know.
No,

3366
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:40,270
I mean I heard about it way back in the 
day when I was on Newsradio somebody who

3367
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:43,450
the fuck just told me the other day.
Oh my friend Curtis,

3368
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:48,660
my friend Curtis,
his mom worked with bill cosby in the 19

3369
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:54,530
sixties,
the 19 sixties and she was an extra on 

3370
02:26:54,641 --> 02:26:58,690
something that bill cosby was doing and 
someone pulled her aside and said,

3371
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,120
be careful around him.
He's a fucking creep.

3372
02:27:01,121 --> 02:27:03,380
Whoa.
He will do something and you know,

3373
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:07,050
I don't know if they specifically said 
that they would drug him or the,

3374
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:08,170
that he would drag her.

3375
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:09,730
Oh my God,
be careful.

3376
02:27:09,731 --> 02:27:14,731
So people that worked with him knew he 
was doing creepy shit like drugging 

3377
02:27:14,731 --> 02:27:19,321
women in their sixties.
So we might be talking literally about 

3378
02:27:19,321 --> 02:27:24,061
50 years up dragging rip 50 years of 
drugging and raping.

3379
02:27:24,131 --> 02:27:25,780
And he did jokes about it.
Let's see.

3380
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:28,630
I think curtis was talking about,
he had bits about,

3381
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:32,890
about putting Spanish fly into women's 
drinks and about drugging women,

3382
02:27:33,690 --> 02:27:35,740
actual bits about it,
Jesus,

3383
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:40,860
but he got away with it forever until 
this distribution of information that 

3384
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:41,270
we're experiencing now.
Yay.

3385
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:46,280
And this is what would cause however you
want and that's why it's good and that's

3386
02:27:46,331 --> 02:27:47,030
why,
you know,

3387
02:27:47,050 --> 02:27:50,510
I would never be like a social media is 
the problem because you know,

3388
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:51,510
the,
the,

3389
02:27:51,511 --> 02:27:56,511
the me too campaign and Harvey Weinstein
and Cosby like it is good that these 

3390
02:27:56,511 --> 02:27:59,821
people are being exposed is not good 
when you also then go on witch hunts for

3391
02:28:00,190 --> 02:28:04,120
people who like aren't like Dla fucking 
rapists or whatever.

3392
02:28:04,150 --> 02:28:09,150
Well that's the difference and this is 
the thing that a lot of men like they 

3393
02:28:09,150 --> 02:28:10,360
see the Harvey Weinstein thing and they 
start thinking about themselves and go,

3394
02:28:10,361 --> 02:28:15,361
oh my God,
what if every girl that I ever tried to 

3395
02:28:15,361 --> 02:28:15,361
fuck came out and said,
you know,

3396
02:28:15,361 --> 02:28:15,940
John Tried to,
you know,

3397
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:20,560
he tried to feel me up or John tried to 
get me to go back to his house one night

3398
02:28:20,820 --> 02:28:22,250
after,
had a couple of drinks together.

3399
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,670
And then,
yeah,

3400
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:27,230
because what does that look like?
Is it a guy actually pressing up against

3401
02:28:27,231 --> 02:28:28,820
you and like violating your physical 
space?

3402
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:30,080
Or was it a guy being like,
hey,

3403
02:28:30,081 --> 02:28:31,310
do you want to come up for coffee?
And they're like,

3404
02:28:31,311 --> 02:28:31,910
no.
And they go,

3405
02:28:31,911 --> 02:28:32,630
oh,
fuck my bad.

3406
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:34,000
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

3407
02:28:34,260 --> 02:28:39,260
And then how you characterize that,
I mean if you write a blog about it and 

3408
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:40,610
you take all these women that,
you know,

3409
02:28:41,090 --> 02:28:44,470
Bill tried to fuck and I'm going to say 
bill because of Cosby,

3410
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,640
say John,
John Tried to have sex.

3411
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:51,080
Harvey.
Well now the crazy thing about harvey is

3412
02:28:51,081 --> 02:28:54,980
how many of them were famous.
Like these were like famous women with a

3413
02:28:54,981 --> 02:28:57,440
voice and he still did it to them.
Yeah,

3414
02:28:57,740 --> 02:29:02,740
I mean it's just like he just had some 
crazy addiction to doing that to women.

3415
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:06,510
It wasn't just simply like he was trying
to get laid off.

3416
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:11,560
It's like you are a bad person because 
you could get laid because you're 

3417
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:11,560
fucking harvey wind.
You are a very rich,

3418
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:13,820
powerful man.
He could have hired prostitutes.

3419
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:14,840
I mean,
if you wanted to,

3420
02:29:14,841 --> 02:29:19,841
if he just wanted sex,
it's pretty obvious that he wanted to 

3421
02:29:19,841 --> 02:29:19,841
fuck the leading lady.
Yeah.

3422
02:29:19,841 --> 02:29:21,350
You know,
he wanted to stick his dick in the mouth

3423
02:29:21,351 --> 02:29:25,040
of the woman who was in the movie and 
know what he's watching the movie I came

3424
02:29:25,041 --> 02:29:25,880
in her mind.
I did that.

3425
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:30,110
Boy,
you don't want to get that rich.

3426
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:35,140
You don't want to know.
It also was this new one accused of 

3427
02:29:35,140 --> 02:29:37,280
raping employee in the Seventies.
Oh God.

3428
02:29:37,850 --> 02:29:42,850
As more women come forward.
It's a Goddamn rape fest out there.

3429
02:29:43,490 --> 02:29:45,800
Yeah.
But it's,

3430
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:48,500
you know,
it's horrible.

3431
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:51,560
Right.
And it also reinforces a lot of negative

3432
02:29:51,561 --> 02:29:56,561
ideas that women have about men too.
That's another part of the problem is 

3433
02:29:56,561 --> 02:29:56,561
that they would go,
look,

3434
02:29:56,561 --> 02:29:56,561
we were right.

3435
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:57,790
There is a rape culture.
It,

3436
02:29:57,791 --> 02:29:58,550
look,
we're right.

3437
02:29:58,551 --> 02:29:59,270
You know,
men do.

3438
02:29:59,271 --> 02:30:00,470
I'll do this.
Well,

3439
02:30:00,471 --> 02:30:05,270
and I think if people could actually go 
after these rapists,

3440
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:08,570
then again,
same thing with all of the middle ground

3441
02:30:08,571 --> 02:30:10,010
issues we were kind of finding,
right?

3442
02:30:10,011 --> 02:30:10,760
Where it's like,
well,

3443
02:30:10,761 --> 02:30:15,410
let's go after the actual bad guys and 
then not make,

3444
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:21,220
you know,
if there's a day where there's not a 

3445
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:21,220
rapist,
instead of like looking,

3446
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:24,760
I mean statistically I'm probably wrong,
but like looking for like who can we 

3447
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:25,190
even be mad at for being sexist?
Just go enjoy the day,

3448
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:27,890
right?
Like um,

3449
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:31,400
there doesn't always have to be a new 
bad guy.

3450
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:36,430
Like you can just like go after the 
legit fucking predators and,

3451
02:30:36,431 --> 02:30:36,920
and,
and,

3452
02:30:36,990 --> 02:30:37,520
and,
and,

3453
02:30:37,580 --> 02:30:40,610
and rapists and there,
there's plenty of actual real targets.

3454
02:30:41,150 --> 02:30:41,570
Yeah,
yeah,

3455
02:30:41,571 --> 02:30:42,330
exactly.
We talked to you.

3456
02:30:42,331 --> 02:30:43,660
You don't need to invent that.

3457
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:48,660
And also like is that the thing to do or
is the thing to do to try to educate 

3458
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:51,740
humans is to how to behave with each 
other and that this,

3459
02:30:51,750 --> 02:30:56,750
this.
One of the reasons why this was he got 

3460
02:30:56,750 --> 02:31:00,041
away with it is because he had this 
extreme amount of power to control the 

3461
02:31:00,041 --> 02:31:03,341
future of these women.
It was just that that's how he got away 

3462
02:31:03,341 --> 02:31:06,191
with getting them to do these things and
keep their mouth shut because he held 

3463
02:31:06,191 --> 02:31:09,170
this incredible power over them because 
he could control their future career.

3464
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:14,171
He had the money and the influence to 
get them and give them the career that 

3465
02:31:14,171 --> 02:31:14,770
they desire.
Yeah.

3466
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:17,360
It was that legit casting couch cliche.
It's just like,

3467
02:31:17,361 --> 02:31:17,900
oh,
it was real.

3468
02:31:17,901 --> 02:31:20,130
And it was him and it was girls Whitney.

3469
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:23,640
Cummings knows people that know,
like the,

3470
02:31:23,641 --> 02:31:25,050
the,
the whole inside story.

3471
02:31:25,051 --> 02:31:26,410
And she,
what she said is like,

3472
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:28,890
what you're hearing is all the women 
that said no.

3473
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:34,340
She's like,
do you know how many famous women said 

3474
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:34,340
yes,
like graduating,

3475
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:34,340
like I said,
to ask you mean,

3476
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:35,880
oh no data.
Because it was a deal.

3477
02:31:35,881 --> 02:31:38,190
They made a deal.
This is how I get the leading part.

3478
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:39,680
This is how I get,
you know,

3479
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:43,170
a influence over editing.
This is how I get more lines.

3480
02:31:43,171 --> 02:31:43,710
So sorry,
get.

3481
02:31:43,711 --> 02:31:46,200
And that literally he,
they negotiated this.

3482
02:31:46,650 --> 02:31:51,650
She said he literally would negotiate 
certain aspects of their careers with 

3483
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:57,050
sex and these women did it and you know,
some of them probably be grudgingly and 

3484
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:58,320
some of them willingly,
some of them happily,

3485
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:02,040
who knows,
but it's just what you're seeing is just

3486
02:32:02,250 --> 02:32:06,390
this is how this guy operates.
Do you saw the.

3487
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:11,840
Harvey Levin is his name who released 
all the various aspects of the contract 

3488
02:32:12,331 --> 02:32:16,800
that he had where they had worked in 
some glass?

3489
02:32:16,940 --> 02:32:18,660
No,
he would get fined a certain amount,

3490
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:20,550
like $100,000
for one,

3491
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:22,590
$250,000
for this little,

3492
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:25,190
like $500 for the naughty boy.
Fine.

3493
02:32:25,350 --> 02:32:26,220
Yes.
Yes,

3494
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:29,300
like literally,
but negotiated into the car.

3495
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:30,390
Look at this.
Here it is.

3496
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:32,530
Um,
uh,

3497
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:35,880
according to the contract of Weinstein 
treated someone in properly in violation

3498
02:32:35,881 --> 02:32:38,190
of the company's Code of conduct,
which obviously means rape.

3499
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:41,670
He must reimburse the Weinstein Company 
for settlements or judgments.

3500
02:32:41,671 --> 02:32:46,671
Additionally,
you will pay the company liquidated 

3501
02:32:46,671 --> 02:32:47,400
damages of $250,000
for the first such instance,

3502
02:32:47,401 --> 02:32:50,010
$500,000
for the second 7:50

3503
02:32:50,011 --> 02:32:53,280
for the third and a million dollars for 
each additional instance.

3504
02:32:53,300 --> 02:32:54,630
Subcontract is like,
look,

3505
02:32:54,631 --> 02:32:57,990
you're going to get raped.
We know we know you're a piece of shit,

3506
02:32:58,170 --> 02:33:00,850
so we want to protect ourselves from 
your piece of shit.

3507
02:33:00,860 --> 02:33:04,680
Place it is 100 percent known what the 
contract says,

3508
02:33:04,681 --> 02:33:08,550
as long as Weinstein pays,
it constitutes a cure for the misconduct

3509
02:33:08,551 --> 02:33:11,430
and no further action can be taken.
Translation.

3510
02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:16,170
Weinstein could be sued over and over 
and as long as you wrote a check,

3511
02:33:16,171 --> 02:33:17,670
he keeps his job.
Oh,

3512
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:20,490
which is fucking crazy.
It's just like they made a deal with the

3513
02:33:20,491 --> 02:33:22,110
devil.
They knew what they were doing,

3514
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:25,380
but he just had a pile of like rape 
checks and can just dole them out.

3515
02:33:25,381 --> 02:33:30,381
It's just amazing that this went on for 
so long and that they literally had 

3516
02:33:30,601 --> 02:33:33,520
negotiated this into a contract.
Right?

3517
02:33:33,550 --> 02:33:38,040
I mean that is fucking.
But it takes that to change the culture.

3518
02:33:38,190 --> 02:33:41,490
It takes the cartoonish level.
Yes.

3519
02:33:41,550 --> 02:33:46,550
It takes that to change the culture and 
then all the people that are terrified 

3520
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:50,001
of being outed like him now will 
recognize the consequences of those 

3521
02:33:50,001 --> 02:33:52,320
actions and hopefully they're gonna 
change their ways.

3522
02:33:53,250 --> 02:33:54,990
That's what we're hoping.
Yeah.

3523
02:33:55,050 --> 02:33:55,590
I mean,
yeah,

3524
02:33:55,591 --> 02:33:56,300
you don't.
Uh,

3525
02:33:56,340 --> 02:34:01,340
but these are fucking say that you don't
like a rub your hard dick against your 

3526
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:01,340
employee.
Right?

3527
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:03,100
Like you list your employee likes it.
Yeah.

3528
02:34:03,150 --> 02:34:07,320
And how do you know until you do it lies
the problem.

3529
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:09,930
I was reading some fucking article,
uh,

3530
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:13,050
another article,
an advertisement from,

3531
02:34:13,410 --> 02:34:18,040
it was like the 19 twenties and it was 
an

3532
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:22,570
advertisement for a type of like 
antiseptic gum,

3533
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:25,160
like a listerine type gum.
And the,

3534
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:29,680
it was how to kiss a woman is that you,
you know,

3535
02:34:29,681 --> 02:34:32,860
you look in her eyes,
so do not ask for permission.

3536
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:34,970
You just do it.
It's amazing like that.

3537
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:40,090
But it just shows you the way our 
culture has shifted from the 19 twenties

3538
02:34:40,091 --> 02:34:42,790
to today.
I mean a hundred years of progress.

3539
02:34:42,791 --> 02:34:44,170
And if people recognizing like,
hey,

3540
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:46,270
no,
you can't just stare at a woman and then

3541
02:34:46,271 --> 02:34:49,420
fucking kiss her and not ask permission.
Like she's just like,

3542
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:51,100
be confident and strong like,
no,

3543
02:34:51,101 --> 02:34:51,450
no,
no,

3544
02:34:51,451 --> 02:34:52,510
no.
What if your gross,

3545
02:34:52,710 --> 02:34:54,970
if she doesn't want to kiss,
you got to have more information.

3546
02:34:55,030 --> 02:34:55,810
Our product.
Yeah.

3547
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:58,810
Sometimes here's the problem.
Sometimes that works.

3548
02:34:58,811 --> 02:35:03,811
If the woman is really attracted to you 
and you're really attracted to her and 

3549
02:35:03,811 --> 02:35:03,811
you look at each other and you don't 
have to say anything and your tests,

3550
02:35:03,811 --> 02:35:05,200
but you don't know when the fuck that 
is,

3551
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:10,710
how do you know?
And you definitely can't put that in a 

3552
02:35:10,710 --> 02:35:10,710
gum add humans.

3553
02:35:11,290 --> 02:35:16,290
But they didn't know that the 19 
twenties because no one was there to 

3554
02:35:16,290 --> 02:35:18,961
tell them like they were dealing with 
the information that they got just from 

3555
02:35:18,961 --> 02:35:22,441
communicating with their friends and the
people that worked with and the limited 

3556
02:35:22,441 --> 02:35:22,441
amount of media that some dude was like,
yeah,

3557
02:35:22,441 --> 02:35:23,650
there was just some fucking girl.
And I kissed her and they were like,

3558
02:35:23,651 --> 02:35:26,500
got it.
How did you meet your wife?

3559
02:35:26,501 --> 02:35:27,070
Well,
it looked in the.

3560
02:35:27,071 --> 02:35:29,920
I didn't ask permission.
I kissed her and now we're married.

3561
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:31,810
We have a happy family and that's how 
you do it.

3562
02:35:31,811 --> 02:35:33,750
Like a fucking man.
Chew Gum,

3563
02:35:34,170 --> 02:35:39,170
chew gum.
But that was how much information they 

3564
02:35:39,401 --> 02:35:41,980
had to go off back then.
Whereas today,

3565
02:35:41,981 --> 02:35:43,300
I mean if you asked me like,
hey,

3566
02:35:43,301 --> 02:35:45,060
how do you know when a kiss a girl will 
there,

3567
02:35:45,580 --> 02:35:47,410
will he kiss her?
No teeth.

3568
02:35:47,411 --> 02:35:48,490
White and three shades of death.

3569
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:49,660
That's a,
that's a different one,

3570
02:35:50,110 --> 02:35:54,370
but it was a yellow.
Add a mate upper left.

3571
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:55,510
That's it.
That's it.

3572
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:57,730
That's it.
Do you know how to kiss a girl?

3573
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:00,220
Then learn.
Stand facing her.

3574
02:36:00,370 --> 02:36:03,820
Do not tell her your intentions.
Do not ask permission to kiss her.

3575
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:07,090
Look dreamily into her eyes.
Look into my eyes,

3576
02:36:07,091 --> 02:36:07,690
Jamie.
Look,

3577
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:10,660
let me see.
Dreamy dreamily my predatory.

3578
02:36:11,130 --> 02:36:11,480
No,
no.

3579
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:12,910
You're dreaming.
You're looking dreamily.

3580
02:36:13,650 --> 02:36:18,650
Don't know how I'm not going to act.
You may hold her right hand and your 

3581
02:36:18,650 --> 02:36:22,300
right hand if you wish.
It is well to cy.

3582
02:36:22,301 --> 02:36:25,240
A couple of times about this stage of 
the game.

3583
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:30,270
What?
What those per softly that her Rosebud 

3584
02:36:30,270 --> 02:36:30,910
lips reminds you of.
Cupid's.

3585
02:36:30,911 --> 02:36:31,960
Bow.
Holy Shit.

3586
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:37,080
Wow.
She will probably drop her eyes and 

3587
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:39,751
blush when you say that.
Place the fingers of your left hand 

3588
02:36:39,751 --> 02:36:41,740
under her Chin and tilt back her head 
slightly.

3589
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:43,750
Draw her attention.
By the way,

3590
02:36:43,751 --> 02:36:48,751
this is all like you could see it in a 
in a like you could see the cartoon of 

3591
02:36:48,751 --> 02:36:50,650
it all.
One and the guys,

3592
02:36:50,651 --> 02:36:53,980
just like a cop,
draw her gently towards you.

3593
02:36:54,190 --> 02:36:59,190
Do not hurry.
Gaze deeply at the love lights which 

3594
02:36:59,190 --> 02:37:01,030
slumber in her eyes.
Cy.

3595
02:37:01,031 --> 02:37:03,640
Once more.
Hold the sign thing of editing.

3596
02:37:03,641 --> 02:37:05,920
You need to edit this thing.
This is terrible writing.

3597
02:37:06,430 --> 02:37:09,580
Incline your head towards her until your
lips,

3598
02:37:09,610 --> 02:37:14,610
but wait all caps.
Do not kiss her until you know that she 

3599
02:37:14,610 --> 02:37:15,560
uses lists.
Rated pepsin gum.

3600
02:37:15,561 --> 02:37:16,040
The only

3601
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:21,040
antiseptic gum in the world.
The only chewing gum that makes it safe 

3602
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:21,800
to kiss.
Safe to kiss,

3603
02:37:21,930 --> 02:37:25,540
to your being a creep.
But then you're putting the onus on some

3604
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:30,170
bullshit that's excess.
If she is a list of rated pepsin.

3605
02:37:30,171 --> 02:37:32,550
Gum Girl Kisser.
Oh,

3606
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:34,400
that sound like a really bad penthouse 
letter.

3607
02:37:34,401 --> 02:37:36,290
Not a fucking gum.
And 1911.

3608
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:39,650
Copyright in 1911.
Comments since gum company.

3609
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:44,710
So what is it common see common c o,
m,

3610
02:37:45,651 --> 02:37:48,970
m,
but it looks like it's just a shitty old

3611
02:37:48,971 --> 02:37:51,260
font.
Blurry font sense,

3612
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:55,970
common sense gun company,
common sense gum company.

3613
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:57,080
Jesus.
Nineteen 11.

3614
02:37:57,350 --> 02:37:58,340
Well that's,
you know,

3615
02:37:58,341 --> 02:38:00,740
limited access to information.
Just the fact that that,

3616
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:06,190
that would be torn to shreds if somebody
tried to write that today and put it in 

3617
02:38:06,861 --> 02:38:09,080
an ad and like say esquire or something 
like that.

3618
02:38:09,081 --> 02:38:10,580
Right.
But that's,

3619
02:38:10,610 --> 02:38:13,820
it just shows you the evolution of human
culture.

3620
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:14,650
Yeah,
I mean,

3621
02:38:14,990 --> 02:38:17,120
and I think we're experiencing that 
totally.

3622
02:38:17,470 --> 02:38:19,460
And,
and I think there's a lot of good.

3623
02:38:19,580 --> 02:38:20,570
I think like,
yeah,

3624
02:38:20,571 --> 02:38:22,490
that shit shouldn't happen.
You should just be creepy.

3625
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:26,090
Sign into a girl's mouth.
That was bizarre works.

3626
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:31,180
Here's the thing,
if a man and a woman are deeply 

3627
02:38:31,180 --> 02:38:31,180
attracted to each other and she's a 
moron and you're a moron,

3628
02:38:31,180 --> 02:38:32,510
you say more on things,
she's like,

3629
02:38:32,511 --> 02:38:33,710
oh,
cupid's bow.

3630
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:35,810
And next thing you know,
wait a minute,

3631
02:38:35,811 --> 02:38:37,960
what kind of gum are you using?
Kind of gum shit.

3632
02:38:38,750 --> 02:38:40,980
Yeah.
I mean it says,

3633
02:38:41,450 --> 02:38:44,660
who are we to judge Jamie Kilstein?
That's should be the episode.

3634
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:48,350
The name of this episode related judge,
no,

3635
02:38:49,070 --> 02:38:52,330
Judge Jamie Kilstein,
but you know Comma Jamie Kilstein,

3636
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:54,230
or are we to judge?
I support that.

3637
02:38:54,580 --> 02:38:57,020
Who are we to judge?
Listen,

3638
02:38:57,170 --> 02:38:59,930
come back to being a comedian and 
actually I want it back.

3639
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:00,280
You're back.

3640
02:39:00,370 --> 02:39:01,940
I think I'm back.
Start showing up.

3641
02:39:01,990 --> 02:39:04,050
Still doing subsets.
Calling for spot.

3642
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:06,040
I've got to figure out how to do that.
You'll figure it out.

3643
02:39:06,060 --> 02:39:07,400
I'll just start showing up.
Weird.

3644
02:39:07,430 --> 02:39:08,960
You'll get back in.
Get back in.

3645
02:39:08,990 --> 02:39:13,990
That's what I'm going to try to do.
That show was so fucking fun and being 

3646
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:15,100
around comics were so fun.
Forgot how much I love comedy.

3647
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:16,850
My girlfriend's much happier and took a 
break,

3648
02:39:16,851 --> 02:39:17,680
bro.
Yeah,

3649
02:39:18,810 --> 02:39:19,730
it'd be like,
why did you take a break?

3650
02:39:19,731 --> 02:39:21,110
And I'm like,
I don't talk about that.

3651
02:39:21,111 --> 02:39:23,420
Sufism got sick.
I got sick.

3652
02:39:23,570 --> 02:39:25,200
I got sick with the left.
Alright,

3653
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:26,370
thank you.
Yeah,

3654
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:28,460
no thanks.
I'll get back.

3655
02:39:28,590 --> 02:39:30,200
I'll get back on twitter.
Yes,

3656
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:30,740
Rebecca.
Well,

3657
02:39:30,741 --> 02:39:33,580
I'll be careful with that.
Check my mentions that it worked yet.

3658
02:39:33,590 --> 02:39:36,170
Don't for a day that they will come for 
you,

3659
02:39:36,171 --> 02:39:37,870
especially if they know you're 
vulnerable bulbs.

3660
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:38,480
Oh,
that's share.

3661
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:40,190
Okay,
thank you man.

3662
02:39:40,850 --> 02:39:41,510
We did this.
Me Too.

3663
02:39:41,630 --> 02:39:42,760
It was great.
I'm glad I did.

3664
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:43,690
Alright.
Alright.

3665
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:48,700
We will be back tomorrow with a colon.
