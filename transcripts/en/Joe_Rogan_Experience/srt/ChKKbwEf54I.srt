00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:20,080
Pinches jody is a good experience

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,660
with a backup generator.
Enhance.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,730
So Diaz returns.
It's up vegas.

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,920
Last time Joey Diaz is here.
The fucking power went out,

10
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,470
man.
That's ridiculous.

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,960
That was ridiculous because by the time 
the power came back on,

12
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,410
he was so high and we hadn't talked for 
like 20 minutes and he was basically 

13
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,041
asleep.
It was such an organic podcast because 

14
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:15,150
shit happened and we just kept going.
We just fucking get it moved up.

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,310
Yeah.
We started an audio podcast while it was

16
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,390
all going on.
Red Band.

17
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:20,340
What's happening?
Are you doing what's going?

18
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,690
What the fuck?
Get out of the mic though.

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,240
I am.
I'm trying to just sort of general Keith

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Richards head to toe.
Look at you look sharper than a 

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,240
motherfucker.
Yeah,

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,240
I,
I,

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,240
you know,
I've been noticing I wear hats way too 

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,661
much and it's not like I'm wearing hats 
to cover a baldness or anything like 

25
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:35,661
that.

26
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,680
I just fucking hate fucking with my 
hair.

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,250
I hate it.
I hate it.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
I like being able to hide if I wanted to
try and right now he's trying to make up

29
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,820
for the fact that he's trying to look 
sexy and is of like looking,

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,420
not look at this picture.
Joe.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,280
This is the short answer is this is the 
shirt we're going to be offering on 

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,300
higher-primate.com.
It is a Joey Diaz shirt by popular 

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,680
demand in the shirt.
Says Joey Diaz says if you ain't high by

34
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,600
two in the afternoon,
go fuck yourself.

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,020
I took attendance and that will be our 
number one selling shirt for sure.

36
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,190
All those other monkey,
Buddha marijuana,

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,620
those are fine,
but this is going to take it to the next

38
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,540
level.
You got to get the word out.

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,610
This is a jump,
Brian.

40
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,400
I lost my in my ear where you were just 
doing sound in your ear.

41
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,410
Okay.
Whatever you just did.

42
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,350
You just adjusted something and just 
lowered something right there.

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,280
That's it.
That's it.

44
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,710
Just turns it off like that.
Like off and on.

45
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,150
Oh,
that something's not right then.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,810
Oh,
it's weird.

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
I've barely touched it.
Oh,

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,810
well.
This is a big difference.

49
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,130
We got.
We got to fix that thing.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,790
Anyway.
Whatever.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,350
Uh,
so the Joey Diaz,

52
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,670
if you ain't high by two in the 
afternoon,

53
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,320
two in the afternoon and go fuck 
yourself.

54
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,690
The t shirts done.
The design is ready.

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,760
It's going to be printed up as soon as 
we can get it to the,

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,920
to the shop.
Should be any minute now.

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,980
So I'll let you guys know and Joe Diaz 
will be appearing where you have this 

58
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:00,980
weekend.

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,010
This week.
I've nowhere nowhere you on Friday 

60
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,010
night.
You were in the city.

61
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,730
I'm at the bitter end in New York City 
on Tuesday at 9:00.

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,760
What is the bitter end to bitter renders
an old rock comedy club that Lenny 

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,130
Bruce,
George,

64
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,500
Carl and him prior and.
Yeah,

65
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,200
but the last guy to do it.
What's the guy from the daily show?

66
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,510
It's a small little rustic place.
Yeah,

67
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:24,511
it's a small little rustic place in the 
village and the guy's name is Peter 

68
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,100
Fogel guy that I met him during the UFC.
I met them in Columbus.

69
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,300
We were both.
You guys went in without me and I had 

70
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,300
had to go in Columbus.
They got a weird airport.

71
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,871
You just can't wait online.
You have to get a ticket and wait on 

72
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:37,360
fucking lines.
So I waited an hour and Austin,

73
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,470
they're like,
you ain't got no ticket.

74
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,590
Neither did he.
So he has this look on his face.

75
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,170
He's furious.
I got to get to the hotel.

76
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,260
You guys leaving at 4:45
and for some reason I looked at him and 

77
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,280
I just seen this pain in his face and 
something.

78
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,600
I never do this.
Just maybe pull back and I go,

79
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,780
hey doug,
you need to but don't you?

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,470
And he looked at me like I was Jesus.
He goes,

81
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:04,471
how'd you know?
I left my weed on the fucking counter 

82
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:07,470
and I went and my ball sack and they 
just got it right there at the fucking 

83
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,670
taxi cab line.
Him a.

84
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,630
He just looked at.
It looked at me like,

85
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,150
are you fucking crazy?
I was like a spirit that day.

86
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,110
Who gives you a line?
I bought a fucking weed at the airport.

87
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,300
Right there.
Online gives you weed out of their body.

88
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,660
That's the most important part.
That's the crazy thing,

89
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,860
right?
I would probably deny it.

90
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,770
I'd probably like.
No,

91
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,420
no,
that's good.

92
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,720
So I met him at the UFC after that.
And every UFC,

93
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,060
he's a devoted fan.
He goes to all of them.

94
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:33,580
He goes to the q and a's.
So when we spoke,

95
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,240
he asked me if I was coming.
I told him I couldn't and he goes,

96
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,610
why don't you to do a show a show it my 
club now the village,

97
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,820
it's close to Chinatown.
So I just killed two birds with one 

98
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:44,820
stone.
You know what I'm saying?

99
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,340
Wow.
So you're going to do a show with who?

100
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,720
Who's doing it with you?
Solo.

101
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:50,310
Solo show in between two bands.
Holy Shit.

102
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,300
Why not?
I like that thing.

103
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,290
Wow.
I love that.

104
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,530
I love that little stand.
Hope really created a monster with meat.

105
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:57,880
When he,
when he started the,

106
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,930
uh,
they're not doing the comedy club 

107
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:02,930
revolution because I really liked that.

108
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,810
Every once in a while you got to step 
outside of the comedy club and just get 

109
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:06,980
down.
They only seek to 60.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,980
The tickets are going to go.
And everybody's standing.

111
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,480
No,
no,

112
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:09,850
no,
no.

113
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,090
Everybody.
They got little tables.

114
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,750
Isn't old fucking rap club.
Jimi Hendrix.

115
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,240
Neil diamond,
Bob Dylan.

116
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,510
You know this is old school.
Fucking geriatrics from the cafe was 

117
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,840
off.
I mean this is a real little club.

118
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,410
So you know what?
I don't want to do nothing in Jersey for

119
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:29,590
my friends and nothing like that.
So I figured let me go into the city and

120
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,770
if I call a comedy club,
they're going to break my balls and 

121
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:34,770
Columbia,
they're going to break my balls.

122
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,170
I'm going to put me up at two in the 
fucking morning.

123
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,970
Eight 15 when this will be their wife.
Go through the aggravation one stop 

124
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,130
shopping.
All we have to do is just pump it up on 

125
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,130
twitter.

126
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,130
We'll pack.
That place will be packed.

127
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,040
So how do people get tickets?
I get tickets if there's no tickets.

128
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,200
You got to go that night.
Tickets go on sale that night.

129
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,520
Old School,
old school,

130
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,360
old school.
Push cash.

131
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,840
They take.
They take credit.

132
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,200
He got a credit card machine.
They got everything.

133
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:02,201
Wow.
So tickets go on sale when you get 

134
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:02,201
there.
When you get there,

135
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:02,480
you just got to get there.
That sounds pretty good.

136
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,340
Idea of $10.
No drama.

137
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,080
Come on down bro.
It's a Tuesday night.

138
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,260
You know what?
I don't want a Friday and you don't dog 

139
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,510
any fucking mobile on a Friday night.

142
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,450
Get out of that.
Go to Chinatown.

143
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,720
That's what I wanted.
And I'm on the rock chester the next 

144
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,090
day.
So Suzanne and what are you doing in

Rochester?

146
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,250
I'm doing a club called the comedy club

147
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,710
New York in webster.

And how do they.
The comedy club can do they think I'm 

153
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,400
some kind of name Bro.
It's rock.

154
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,860
Not announced out there,
but there's nothing up there but out.

155
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,690
You know what I liked in bodies?
Frozen bodies.

156
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,410
This is my third time.
I mean,

157
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,530
the first time it was January.
That's brutal.

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,150
I'll never do that shit.
Oh,

159
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,940
but then now I go at least towards late 
March,

160
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,750
just because,
uh,

161
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,160
you know,
what don't you like to,

162
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,590
to name a comedy club.
Would that be a cool thing?

163
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,570
Yes.
So what would you name your county czar 

164
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,850
tans or some shit.
Like the fuck up you baby joe?

165
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,170
Nothing.
Nothing.

166
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,970
My family looks great man.
Thank you.

167
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,540
Say it's amazing to know you a long time
to see what's come of your life.

168
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,100
They're fucking beautiful.
Thanks man.

169
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,460
That's amazing to have your wife and the
supremes as I call it.

170
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:21,461
That's what you have a bit.
You like the Anna Ross had the three 

171
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:21,461
sisters,
the supremes.

172
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:23,450
Mrs Rogan has the supreme.
She got the three girls.

173
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,040
It's all over for you.
You like the manage.

174
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,570
Have they done any dance numbers for 
you?

175
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,550
Yeah,
like a choreographed dance numbers.

176
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,470
Great.
Joe Rogan's.

177
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,510
Greg got tears in my eyes.
It's looking at you that were very,

178
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,730
very nice.
Especially you know,

179
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:35,210
you,
you,

180
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,300
you didn't grow up in no fucking mansion
when you were a kid.

181
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,080
You had it,
you know,

182
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,730
look at your little family you've put 
together.

183
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,080
He was very proud of you.
Thanks man.

184
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,670
You don't see this much in men and he's 
great with them,

185
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,970
isn't he?
He's fucking great with them.

186
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:47,930
They love it.
They like,

187
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,390
that's big.
Motherfucking daddy came.

188
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,480
Rogan show.
Yeah.

189
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,540
I like your hair today.
Yeah,

190
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:57,541
it's really nice hair.
It's like you're going to come here and 

191
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:57,541
look.
Yeah.

192
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:57,830
Let's see.
This is my first communion.

193
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,620
I'm bringing them back.
You know you're on your way to court.

194
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,950
Not on those.
Do you know what a fucking cop tried to 

195
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,321
shake me down today?
What a fucking cop pulled me over and I 

196
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:08,321
asked,
you know,

197
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,550
I know they have the camera on the cars.
I just asked him.

198
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:11,990
Is there any reason why you pull me 
over?

199
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,360
Because.
No,

200
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:12,680
no,
no.

201
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,180
We had,
you're mistaken.

202
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,620
Then we ran.
You play in your.

203
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,760
Okay.
You're free to go.

204
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,230
Then what the fuck you pulling me over 
for?

205
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,910
I think it was pulling me over to see if
I was smoking herb,

206
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,240
smoker room in my car.
So you fucked guy.

207
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,950
Really?
You don't think it might've been?

208
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,710
Just exactly what he was saying that 
they just get confused.

209
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,060
I know how he did it.
I,

210
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,100
I parked in a different place by my 
house and he was on my corner and as I 

211
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,950
made a left I seen how he looked at me 
and I was doing the speed limit.

212
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:41,951
I don't fuck around.
I went down and by the time I got to to 

213
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:44,500
hunger,
he had made a u turn and got right 

214
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:44,500
behind me.
Like,

215
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,231
you know when you're looking at your 
radio and you look up and there's a cat 

216
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:47,231
behind him,
but he couldn't have been that.

217
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:48,940
He just thought you were somebody else.
Maybe saw your haircut,

218
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,990
English attracted to you.
He never had another guy with fuck is 

219
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,500
wrong with you,
Brian.

220
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,110
Strong possibility Brian.
He thinks so,

221
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,860
but no.
Maybe.

222
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,880
I don't know,
but I thought I was going to be awake.

223
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,900
That's why I called you.
That's why I said this mother fucker's 

224
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:05,900
know.
Pulling me over.

225
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,040
I tell you what makes you think he was 
trying to shake it down,

226
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,540
like did they really do that anymore?
You can see in your package.

227
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,640
Just see what's going on.
Maybe he sleep.

228
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,890
I was smoking dope in the car,
you know,

229
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,910
and then when he knows he's got weird 
Joe,

230
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:29,341
you would smoke in the car everywhere 
you would smoke in the car and fucking 

231
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:32,810
Texas.
And I'm like dude this is not a smart 

232
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,300
move.
And they would give me a hard time.

233
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,370
Don't smoke in the car.
Robin.

234
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,820
Robin.
I just want to go to jail.

235
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,340
I don't know what else.
This is like,

236
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,720
this is not California.

237
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,100
I don't do it because of that.
I just don't do it because what?

238
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,470
Sometimes the daytime,
I don't need to be that fucking store.

239
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,450
They really gets stalled in the morning.
That's good enough.

240
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,730
If I take with me in the car,
I'd be a mess.

241
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,260
It's funny,
not a smart move.

242
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,570
It is funny how California makes you 
totally forget that.

243
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:57,600
Like in Ohio I was paranoid about 
smoking weed,

244
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,520
like a clean up the seeds for my car.
I mean,

245
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:03,330
I was like,
now I fucking feel like it's everywhere.

246
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,850
That's where their state's laws.
I mean that's how it's supposed to be.

247
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,370
It's not supposed to be that someone can
stop you from doing it,

248
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,190
but it is supposed to be someplace is.
Can decide.

249
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:15,191
It's okay.
What happened in West Hollywood last 

250
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:15,191
night?
Did you hear about this?

251
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:18,081
I heard nothing.
All these we'd stores got raided and 

252
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,270
some one of them caught fire res Res.

253
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,200
We'd store a is gone zen weed or 
something like that.

254
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,410
Yeah,
it,

255
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,250
it's gone.
It's,

256
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:27,330
there's a sign that says it's closed 
forever or something like that.

257
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,700
And since I heard that one of the places
they set on fire,

258
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,010
like,
I don't know if it was the grow yard or 

259
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,140
whatever,
but there was one place on fire,

260
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,130
zed fucking you see best jolly rancher 
candies.

261
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,250
Yeah.
You will ever eat in your life.

262
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,830
And I was eating them popular with 
Ralphie May,

263
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,200
like they were candy.
He'd want a bag of this fucking vape.

264
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,740
And by the third one I'm at the Sushi 
place.

265
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,780
I didn't even know where the fuck I was.
Do you guys realize how alien this 

266
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,530
conversation is to most people listening
all over the world?

267
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,830
We had this conversation that 30 during 
the morning you will learn,

268
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,160
called you and I said,
you know,

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,470
as a kid you expect jet packs and you 
expect people to Mazda Shit never did.

270
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,420
I thought if any of my youth that at 
eight in the morning,

271
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:10,930
that would be at,
uh,

272
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:15,931
we store bagels and smoking dope next to
the attorney and a construction way to 

273
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,000
come.
Fucking cops up.

274
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,310
Medical marijuana license here to do.
I think so.

275
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:24,900
I think they're allowed to.
I don't think you can.

276
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't think you can piss clean cleans.
Yeah.

277
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,200
Immediately.
Yeah.

278
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,420
I mean to get worse.
I mean I don't think they,

279
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,620
they're allowed to test them.
I shouldn't be talking about in my ass 

280
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,641
because I don't know what kind of 
testing they do once they're in office 

281
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:40,641
or once they're on the,
on the,

282
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,090
on the job.
But to get to be a cop,

283
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,710
I'm sure they must have to Piss test 
yet.

284
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,870
I think at the beginning of something 
with a new psychological,

285
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,410
all that shit.
But man,

286
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,530
look,
there's too many fucking restrictions.

287
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:54,010
If you're a guy who's just got

288
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,120
a fucking job,
all right?

289
00:11:55,121 --> 00:12:00,121
If you're just a guy who works at ups 
and you know you've got a decent 

290
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:04,201
management job and you like it and you 
got to fucking piss new acup every 

291
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,920
couple of months,
so you can't even enjoy yourself at your

292
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:10,921
brother's wedding.
Everyone's sitting around smoking a 

293
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:10,921
joint,
listening to some good songs,

294
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,610
and you've got to stand over there by 
the fan.

295
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,720
Isn't worried.
Yeah,

296
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:17,290
you're worried that shit's gonna.
Get your hair the fuck man.

297
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,970
That's nonsense that if you get high,
you're only hiring for like two hours at

298
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,880
the most and then it goes away.
Unless you're really high,

299
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:27,040
unless you eat it.
And even then with the fuck,

300
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:32,041
by the time you get to work,
most likely you'll be sober if you ate 

301
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:32,050
so much weed that you're still high the 
next day.

302
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,590
Have you behind the car guys and 
something happens that you go that was 

303
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,001
close,
like you missed an accident or somebody 

304
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,430
who was next to you and you just put the
blinker on it.

305
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,610
When you realize I've done that so much 
and when I'm not high though,

306
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,630
so I can't really judge if that was.
If I would have done that regardless if 

307
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:52,630
I was hiring not,
you know,

308
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,260
like something where you're like looking
down at your shoe or something like 

309
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,260
that.
Like what's on my shoe?

310
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,360
I've never been shy and I slipped.
I said,

311
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,000
wow,
that fucking was close something.

312
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,230
No,
no.

313
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,270
I'm,
I'm very conscious of two things.

314
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:12,271
I don't drive.
If I'm high like that and I don't ever 

315
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:16,111
not pay attention to the road.
Paying attention to the road is 

316
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:16,111
variable.
I always paid.

317
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:17,620
You'll never catch me texting.
I don't text in my car.

318
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:19,240
Get the fuck Outta here.
And you know,

319
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:23,500
I was in a car and once with a check,
she was a publicist for one of the clubs

320
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:28,240
and she was driving me to radio and 
she's fucking texting on the highway.

321
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,510
I'm like,
you got that kind of control over your 

322
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:33,510
car.
Really.

323
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,550
You're gonna.
You hit a rock and that steering wheel 

324
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,740
twist to the right and you got this,
you got this.

325
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
You're really paying attention to what 
you see in front of you.

326
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,780
Are you crazy?
We're going 80 miles an hour.

327
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,490
I had to tell her stop.
I said,

328
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,050
please stop doing that.
You know,

329
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:48,520
if you're going to text,
you know,

330
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:49,590
let me drive.
You know,

331
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,940
don't do it.
It's not worth it.

332
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,100
It's not worth it.
But for a lot of people,

333
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,270
man,
it's too God damn easy.

334
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:57,400
It's too tempting.
You know it's right there.

335
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,700
My car has a little thing.
BMW has a little knob that you can dial 

336
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,110
the phone from all this,
so you got like your,

337
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,810
you know,
your,

338
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,680
your ad just shows up on a screen.
You could scroll through it so you never

339
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,120
have to take your eyes off the road.

340
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,140
You can,
you can just,

341
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,410
you know,
you're right there,

342
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,070
man.
Very Lord has a button.

343
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,920
You just go dial Joe.
Then we have that to BMW.

344
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:19,030
Has.
They all have that now?

345
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,120
But my point is like,
even that's tricky even that you got to 

346
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,390
watch what the fuck you're doing when 
you're cooking gas and okay,

347
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,320
but at least you're looking ahead and 
you're getting the peripheral in there.

348
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:31,630
At least you know,
you're getting a decent vision.

349
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,450
But man,
fucking people texted their car,

350
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,340
freaked me out.
I see it all the time.

351
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:40,300
You're,
you're holding a giant metal machine,

352
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,230
70,
80 miles an hour around a bunch of other

353
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,690
ones and you're not even fucking paying 
attention.

354
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,710
You can't do think eventually,
uh,

355
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:52,160
us as a race is going to get to the 
point where is just common.

356
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,620
Like you can do it super easy.
Like you just get trained in,

357
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,070
grown up and effective it.

358
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,520
There'll be another input.
I mean,

359
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,130
it's going to get to some sort of a 
neural input at that point.

360
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,190
But,
you know,

361
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,440
that's,
that's all coming.

362
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:03,830
You know,
we're,

363
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,170
we're resisting all of that.
But I mean,

364
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:11,171
look,
everything we've got today is fucking 

365
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:11,171
witchcraft.
Three hundred years ago,

366
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:11,330
witchcraft,
total,

367
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,160
witchcraft,
and iphone is sorcery.

368
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:18,161
Man,
that Shit would fucking burn you at the 

369
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:18,650
stake if you showed up with an iphone.
And now it's here.

370
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,910
What,
what comes next?

371
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:23,600
We're going to have to get over this,
this human machine interface.

372
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,760
We're going to have to get over the idea
of implants.

373
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:30,761
People are going to have shit implanted 
into their body and you're going to be 

374
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:30,980
able to communicate with,
with other machines.

375
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:31,810
And uh,
another,

376
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,620
uh,
other people who have chips implanted in

377
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,780
their body,
the human body will become a computer.

378
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,420
My buddy of laughed because my buddy has
a joke.

379
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,270
They did a Texas.
He did a what?

380
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,310
Did either the club,
the part of the Texas that was so 

381
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,221
backwards that the opening act was the 
magician that they thought he was a 

382
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:48,221
devil worshiper.

383
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,540
Magic.
It was magic.

384
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,670
One of the funniest bit.
And he goes,

385
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,410
Joey,
it was a night from hell.

386
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,430
Oh,
because they were all like White 

387
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:02,430
Christians and this guy was in there.
Vacant birds disappeared shit.

388
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,090
And the devil,
they will like get that devil out of the

389
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,350
building.
They pay them.

390
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,420
That's the fucking lead.
That's beautiful.

391
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,410
That's hilarious.
I thought it was the fucking devil.

392
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:15,050
You know,
man,

393
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:20,051
this is a thing about religion.
You can tell me you believe in God all 

394
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:20,051
day,
but as soon as you started talking about

395
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:21,710
the devil,
Holy Shit.

396
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,760
Did you throw yourself in a box?
Because you can't be all spiritual.

397
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,020
You know,
even spiritual people like,

398
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,850
well,
I didn't believe in religion,

399
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,970
but I'm very spiritual and I definitely 
believe in God,

400
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,830
you know?
But they don't go well,

401
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:36,260
the devil's real.
I'm pretty sure of that.

402
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,160
Yeah,
pretty sure.

403
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,250
The devil's real like,
lives under ground.

404
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,690
Joe.
The devil.

405
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,600
Come on the fuck on.
Come on.

406
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,590
Really?
Come on.

407
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,590
I can't fucking say you'll.
You believe in the devil.

408
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,620
That's where people draw the line.
When you're saying you believe in the 

409
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:53,620
devil,
you're just going deep,

410
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,110
deep,
deep.

411
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,100
You're going fire brimstone.
Fucking dragons.

412
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,840
This resolved this morning out in the 
fucking morning.

413
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,910
Oh,
I get back and I'm just going through 

414
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:04,910
the channels.
I put the news on it.

415
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,290
It was like spiked from last night 
watching the UFC countdown without like,

416
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,210
it's this,
the fucking excesses at nine.

417
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,230
Oh,
five in the morning.

418
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,860
Spike is lost at Goddamn mind was on 
spike,

419
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:20,861
probably just people that don't have 
this in perspective because it's 2011 

420
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:22,010
and you've had some amazing,
you know,

421
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,040
fucking Avatar type movies and movies 
just there on such another level now 

422
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,180
than they were back then.
But when the extra ces came out,

423
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,240
dude,
that was the scariest movie of all time.

424
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,820
When that little girl spun her head 
around and starts stabbing herself with 

425
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,930
a crucifix going,
your mother's sucks.

426
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:46,931
Cox In hell and she's,
it's meat stabbing into the meat of or 

427
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,190
pussy with a.
It was

428
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,290
about will taste them.
I watched the movie this morning for 20 

429
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,230
minutes while I was making breakfast and
I sat there and it got me to turn it off

430
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:03,231
and get the fuck out wrong.
They find that little devil in Africa 

431
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:08,210
and that's why I feel that Africans 
always fuck that devil.

432
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,260
They found them that Africans never 
looked back.

433
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,120
There's always something going on in 
Africa.

434
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,940
Always something dog.
Somebody is getting killed.

435
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,490
There's a war.
Oh Egypt,

436
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,580
this.
Think about it.

437
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,670
Look at Africa.
Every week they got something,

438
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
except this week my prayers go out to 
fucking Japanese people.

439
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:28,881
It's crazy.
Every day that gets crazier and crazier 

440
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:28,881
with it,
but you know,

441
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:32,570
this exorcise was brilliant.
What's the fucking movie with no 

442
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:32,570
interruption?
No,

443
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,540
it's a brilliant move on that movie.
Like a lot of problems,

444
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,570
like a lot of weird things that the 
studio burnt down.

445
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,310
It was just fucking crazy.

446
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,310
You know that really.
I think the guy named my cat after 

447
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,801
there's a cat in there when she's the 
rocking chair and she keeps telling the 

448
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:51,940
priest that priest to be a boxer.
That's Jackie gleason's motherfucking 

449
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:53,820
son in law.
Really?

450
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,620
That's,
that's a shit.

451
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,720
Whatever his father,
real life.

452
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,050
He's enacted.
The kids are active,

453
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:04,051
but that guy never dimitria remember 
like his name is Demetrius and she used 

454
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:04,680
to call them dd my,
you do this to me.

455
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,060
And that was the boxer.
That was the boxer briefs.

456
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,680
Cigarettes and act yet he just beats the
fuck out of the devil.

457
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,800
He got up and live the blessed taking on
the bottom position and then she just 

458
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:19,590
throws them up and let me get it up and 
he just goes out the fucking window.

459
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,510
It's a brilliant movie.
They can't do that.

460
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:23,910
She'll never get.
They don't have that kind of writing.

461
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,320
They don't have that.
Well,

462
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,500
it hadn't been done yet,
so when it was done,

463
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,240
it was.
They went so far with it to you.

464
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,350
He didn't want me.
There wasn't some arguments about 

465
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,780
whether or not they should have her stab
herself in the pussy with a cross.

466
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,840
There must've been some studio 
conversation back then.

467
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,280
Thought she's screaming,
your mother's sucks.

468
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:49,281
Cox In hell,
and she's stabbing herself in the 

469
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:49,281
position.
Yeah.

470
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,660
That has had a crazy hats,
but here's the point.

471
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:56,661
I was wanting.
Terrifying man was brilliant when she's 

472
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,000
one of the devil first coming into the 
house,

473
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,240
there's a fight one night and her house,
she's having her because she's an 

474
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,060
actress to mother and she's having like 
a party and the guys,

475
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:08,061
Germany,
the waiter and the guy keeps saying 

476
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:09,210
something to him,
you fucking Nazi and two days later they

477
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:14,211
find the guy in the bottom of the 
stairway with his neck twisted and they 

478
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:14,211
couldn't figure out.
I mean,

479
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:16,820
it's a deep.
It's a lot deeper memory.

480
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:18,360
When she goes up to the astronauts,
she goes,

481
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,700
you're gonna die up there.
Yes.

482
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,460
That was like the first creepy little 
girl.

483
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,890
Like in movies.
There's nothing.

484
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,840
I mean the Stephen King,
the twins and shining.

485
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,970
Those are creepy little girls.
Those are kind of interesting.

486
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,160
You know the one.
What does that?

487
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
The Japanese one.
What does that one?

488
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Oh the fuck.
Is that the a TV girl?

489
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,310
Yeah,
that the fucking TV.

490
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,790
What?
The TV that crowds out the TV and an 

491
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,820
goddammit.
There's an American version of it to 

492
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:48,820
write whatever it is.

493
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,430
That spooky little scary Japanese girl.
I would have sex and the movies.

494
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,130
Would you?
Yeah,

495
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,530
you would.
You fucking idiot.

496
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,320
She was like,
well,

497
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,340
these little twins,
the twins that did full House and Oh my 

498
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,870
God.
Yeah.

499
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,400
They were on TV.
They never got to have a childhood bitch

500
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,630
that Blair was putting across and how 
Pussy at the age of 12 the somebody went

501
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,280
to Linda Blair said,
Linda,

502
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,660
hi,
can you sit out for a second one,

503
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:18,661
your mother in the room in this film,
we want you to take a fucking cross of 

504
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:21,610
putting in your little Twat and say,
this sucks Cox and how can you say that?

505
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:24,550
Repeat that to me.
This movie fucked her up so much.

506
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,320
She ended up hanging out with Rick James
Twenty years later wishing that she was.

507
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,630
She never recovered from that film.
That was one of the.

508
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,650
How could she.

509
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,760
How could you do a movie when you're 12 
where you're.

510
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,240
You're stabbing yourself in the pussy 
with a cross.

511
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,480
How could you do that and then walks 
back and be normal in the house and 

512
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,751
she's screaming it.
Mother's sex and that crazy voice.

513
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,180
That was the first original.
Really scary movie because there have 

514
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,080
been monster movies before like Dracula 
and shit,

515
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,260
but there was nothing that seemed to 
real show scary when I was at great one.

516
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,670
I never,
I never saw accesses as a kid.

517
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,330
I saw it as an adult,
but creep show was fucking used to freak

518
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:06,670
me out.
I used to have old hbo all the time.

519
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,010
Commercial hub of rate creep show is 
great.

520
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,270
Elm Street,
the first one fucked my world up a 

521
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,270
little bit.
Yeah,

522
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,270
that was a total on xylophone.
Brilliant,

523
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,790
Bro.
That's fucking brilliant.

524
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:20,791
I don't give a fuck what I believe says 
when he goes to pick that up in that 

525
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:20,791
little tongue starts moving.

526
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,630
Yeah.
We were talking about this the other 

527
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,921
day,
but the silence of the lambs still 

528
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,391
fucking hometown.
There's movies that still night they're 

529
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:28,860
going to do a whole thing on and I've 
seen it before about the making of that.

530
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,520
Yeah.
How much went into that?

531
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,890
How about this character movie is a work
of art.

532
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,660
He's a bad motherfucker.
She's bad.

533
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,360
She's so bad ass.
Even when she's nervous,

534
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,220
like she's talking to him like,
you know,

535
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,630
Mr Lichter,
you know,

536
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,070
like the,
like her nervousness.

537
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:47,071
It's like so fucking real.
Like she must've made herself nervous 

538
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:47,950
for that.
Like the way she's doing it.

539
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,970
It's like these little weird twitches in
your lip that you can't even fake.

540
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,890
You know what I mean?
Like you,

541
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:57,891
you would literally have to be nervous 
to be having these little twitches and 

542
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:58,690
quivers in your mouth as she's 
communicating.

543
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,370
She's having a hard time getting it out.

544
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,240
She's brilliant dude.
And he hammered vertigo.

545
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,440
Jesus fucking Christ.
Anthony Hopkins.

546
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:06,310
Come on,
man.

547
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,420
You're just a fucking.
There's so much about that movie that 

548
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,130
was so bad ass.
The way he got out of the jail,

549
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:17,310
the way trick them and got out of the 
jail and it's like this suspension of 

550
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,310
disbelief.
You don't need much of it.

551
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,720
When he's spiderman,
he throws commenter.

552
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,750
Remember Meigs Meigs made.
That was my nickname from one one 

553
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,740
friend,
my friend Jon Jon Tobin,

554
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,370
he used to call me migs because of that.
Why is fucking crazy?

555
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,620
He made Miguel killed himself.
Yeah.

556
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,510
Yeah.
I'll talk to him.

557
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,470
Tell him to kill himself.
Yeah,

558
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:40,530
nobody's done that.
Since Robert Duvall in Godfather to 

559
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,070
talk,
the Freddy is angles into,

560
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,080
to kill himself with a TUB member.
He goes to visit them in jail and he 

561
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,110
goes at the end of the party,
that robe is,

562
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:51,111
we'll get together and eat fruit and 
then they'd slice their fucking risks 

563
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:51,111
and the next day they played cards.

564
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,370
And uh,
what's his name?

565
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:54,260
He cut himself with the TUB.
What's it?

566
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,730
That's a fight.
Holy Shit.

567
00:23:55,731 --> 00:24:00,731
I forgot about that.
Godfather two is one of the few movies 

568
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,750
where it was just as good as godfather 
one or good enough for me at least.

569
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,820
There's very few that are like that.
What a great fucking film like Alien One

570
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:12,851
and alien to the is debatable because 
like alien too is kind of fun because 

571
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:16,410
there was a lot of God damn aliens and 
there was a big giant fucking alien.

572
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,510
It's still pretty bad ass,
but alien one was creepier.

573
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,720
It was a different thing.
It was scale.

574
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:27,721
You couldn't see it.
He didn't know where it was by the time 

575
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:27,721
you saw that.
Got You.

576
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,970
Yeah,
and it was impossible to kill for is 

577
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,951
alien to.
It's like you're killing them left and 

578
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:32,951
right.
Like,

579
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:32,951
okay,
now this is a totally different thing.

580
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:33,830
Still ask because these things are 
stupid now.

581
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:37,100
They were super smart and clever and 
they would get you in.

582
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:42,101
Hi Don people.
Now there's like they're killing 10 of 

583
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:42,101
them before one person gets killed.
Like that's silly.

584
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,310
So if you look at that,
but it's still a bad ass fucking movie.

585
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,370
So it's like not,
I don't think it's as good as alien one,

586
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:52,160
but Goddamn it's still one of the best 
all time science fiction movies,

587
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,570
you know,
alien to it.

588
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,670
It just,
the alien one was so fucking bad ass 

589
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:58,670
when that shit came out.
Dude,

590
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,370
I remember I went to see that and the 
first thing I said when I got out of the

591
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:01,850
theater,
I said,

592
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:04,940
Fuck Star Wars,
Star Wars.

593
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,730
Like that's like written.
I'm a huge star wars fan.

594
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:10,160
I saw star wars like 13 times and I was 
a little kid,

595
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,670
but when I saw alien and I and I was 
like,

596
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,480
this dance,
what?

597
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,080
Aliens are going to be like,
man,

598
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:18,590
it's not going to be like some fucking 
furry dude with a bandolier on it.

599
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:20,870
A gun,
the girl that's not going to be aliens,

600
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:25,871
man.
Aliens is going to be some weird 

601
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:26,960
parasites that lock onto people and grow
inside our bodies and explode out of our

602
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:29,620
chests.
Weaver was a bad motherfucker,

603
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
wasn't she?
She's bad.

604
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,900
She's bad ass.
That is when she was young too.

605
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,670
You know,
she was fierce.

606
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,680
She didn't give a fuck.
There's a few,

607
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:44,681
you know,
there's a few people that make acting 

608
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:44,681
worthwhile and they don't seem to need 
that much attention.

609
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:45,800
They,
they seem to be pretty fucking like that

610
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,620
guy who's got my left foot,
Daniel Day Lewis,

611
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,650
that guy,
that guy's a brilliant actor and he 

612
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:53,650
picked you barely even fucking hear a 
peep about that guy.

613
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,510
He's never going to like events and 
making a big deal about things and 

614
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,840
holding press conferences and fucking,
you know,

615
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:02,420
sitting in talk shows and you know,
crossing his legs,

616
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:04,150
talking about his fucking vacation,
you know.

617
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,740
No,
no,

618
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,220
no.
That guy's hiding in Ireland.

619
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:09,050
Learning how to box.
You know what I mean?

620
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:14,370
He's fucking eaten girl and living in a 
prison because he's got to be in a 

621
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,590
prison movie was no light to that.
I really respect.

622
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:20,591
I really respect that part of the ass.
He's the baddest motherfucker of all 

623
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:20,591
time.
Daniel Day Lewis.

624
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:23,180
Between him and Gary Oldman.
It's like it's a toss up,

625
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,520
you know Gary Oldman even in this stupid
red riding hood move in with us.

626
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:28,190
He red riding.
I just was that good by the way.

627
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:31,010
I don't think he ever said it's okay.
It was decent.

628
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,360
You know what it was?
It was like,

629
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,030
it was,
it was.

630
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,170
It was entertaining,
but it was part of it will you say,

631
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:37,820
wow,
this could have been really good.

632
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,110
It could have been really good,
but it got a little twilight id at the 

633
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,110
end.

634
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,920
It got a lot twilight e at the end,
but there's parts of it that.

635
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,180
But Gary Oldman's a bad motherfucker.
Even in a silly movie,

636
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,060
he still comes across like the creepiest
motherfucker.

637
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,860
You makes you uncomfortable when you see
him,

638
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,390
you know,
like a shit.

639
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,490
He's here like you feel it when he's in 
the room.

640
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,730
I came.
No fucking cardboard cutout of a 

641
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:01,730
villain.
He's thinking like a fucking villain.

642
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,490
He's,
he's.

643
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:04,830
His eyes are lit up like a killer.
Like for real.

644
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,610
He's not,
you know,

645
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:10,611
there's some dudes that don't,
don't know how to do that or they can't 

646
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:10,611
do that.
I don't know what it is.

647
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:10,740
I,
I can't do it.

648
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,690
I don't know what it is they did.
They do it.

649
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:14,700
I don't,
I've never been a successful actor,

650
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,790
but whatever the fuck it is that those 
guys have those like,

651
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,460
what's his name?

652
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,770
Russell Crowe.
He's got it too.

653
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,100
They can just become somebody.
They can just really become someone 

654
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,761
different than who they are.
There's only a few dudes who can do 

655
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:28,761
that,
but those guys were valuable.

656
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,810
You know those guys.
That's a,

657
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:32,730
that's a crazy trick man.
When you know when you,

658
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:37,731
you don't.
You know what this guy really fucking 

659
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:39,831
talks like and it's not weird new out,
but all of a sudden he's got this 

660
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:39,831
strange accent.
Like,

661
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:40,770
you know what Russell Crowe really talks
like,

662
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,590
but all of a sudden he's playing some 
guy from Brooklyn and you buy it.

663
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,770
How are you buying into this?
Why?

664
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,760
Why come on?
I know what his real voice sounds like,

665
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,400
but yet I'm still roped in.
He does that good.

666
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,820
You know who's worth $12 million of 
funding twice.

667
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,360
You know who's the worst at doing that 
though?

668
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,080
Michael stairs.
My flyers.

669
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,530
I mean every single movie is the same 
fucking character.

670
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,210
Exactly.
Well,

671
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,570
it's different when you're trying to be 
funny.

672
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,720
You know?
He's just trying to fucking act is 

673
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:05,720
listening.
That's a motherfucking actors that could

674
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,310
act as fuck.
And when they.

675
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:07,820
They're around around

676
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,460
you though that xcel.
Marlon Brando,

677
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,670
that chick from the Postman always rings
twice.

678
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:16,940
That Jessica Lange bitches were 
treacherous.

679
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,030
Willie's fucking little bitches that I 
couldn't deal with these,

680
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,730
this tray hanging out at the fucking on 
Hollywood.

681
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,880
You'd take half.
These motherfuckers could run with 

682
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Marlon Brando when he was swinging Dick 
in his day.

683
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,020
Are you fucking kidding me?
They went down a pot.

684
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:35,050
What's that movie?
Get on the island when he met with him 

685
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,050
before he bought the island of Dr 
Moreau.

686
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,390
No,
the one before that with a treasure with

687
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,520
warner brothers said,
yeah,

688
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,740
go down and have a blast.
They went down,

689
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,910
wasn't even directly.
He was banging fucking chicks at a time.

690
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,760
He had some water boy fucking film at 
the fucking movie.

691
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,800
He had footage in bolts go in birds.
They're like,

692
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,500
what the fuck you been doing on the 
months?

693
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,480
That wasn't even going to give the 
godfather because when they were like,

694
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:58,280
we don't even want to hear that fucking 
name.

695
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,490
That guy flew eight months of all we 
went down and his wildlife or drawing 

696
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,640
pictures were sending checks out here.
He pulled the fucking island.

697
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,200
Really?
You don't know about?

698
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:14,290
Well,
I knew he lived on an island and then 

699
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:14,290
for superman that trying to call them 
up,

700
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,030
come back.
He's English and I read the scripts.

701
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:18,480
I me 100 grand.
You had to pay him to read the script.

702
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,710
When he grabbed you want them to show 
up?

703
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,360
That's 100 grand for a.
But I come off the island dog,

704
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,350
so 20 grand to 100 grand to.
Why did they hate dive?

705
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,270
He hit the them wall for 30 fucking 
years and they couldn't do nothing,

706
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,910
bro.
The guy showed up at the Oscars,

707
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:40,010
didn't even show up.
We sent an Indian and go online and look

708
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,070
it up.
She's up.

709
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,950
Fucking shoot this guy last week.
Oh,

710
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,130
well what's this little fact name?
Anne hathaway and the guy all.

711
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,640
They wouldn't be your pitch back to know
what happened.

712
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:51,920
What happened?
What happened there?

713
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,010
People complaining online that he wasn't
funny.

714
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Bitch you James Franco.
Marlon Brando set the fucking Indians 

715
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,270
with a feather that to pick up his 
Oscar.

716
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,490
They went Buddha.
That's real Hollywood.

717
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:05,200
Steve Brown,
Steve McQueen.

718
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,820
Those.
We've had this conversation.

719
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,490
Well that was their only outlet to 
express themselves back then.

720
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,380
They didn't have twitter or the internet
or anything like that.

721
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:15,910
You couldn't like stage a protest fresh 
yourself if you wanted to do something,

722
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:17,890
you wanted to protest something.
Yeah.

723
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:19,870
You had to do it in during an award 
show.

724
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,920
Like on television.
It's good for people to see.

725
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,350
I,
I'd never thought about that completely.

726
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,270
Not only that,
people wouldn't really see it.

727
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:29,710
How do you receive.
There was no reason you had to make,

728
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:34,711
like if you wanted to make a stand,
making public stance was very important 

729
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:34,711
back then.
There's the only way you had a voice.

730
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,670
They'll put more in the movement of 
those black guys at the Olympics.

731
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,350
They held their fists up and the black 
gloves on the black power fist,

732
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,610
you know,
because they're tired of being fucking 

733
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:49,610
treated like their shit their whole 
life.

734
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:49,990
And finally they get to do something.
They will,

735
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,120
they win the Olympics and then like,
look bitch,

736
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,860
you know,
stop all this nonsense,

737
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:58,861
all this racial hatred.
And everybody looked at it like as if 

738
00:30:58,861 --> 00:30:59,020
they're their racist,
you know what they're doing.

739
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,280
Oh,
they're black separatists,

740
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:02,590
whether they're dangerous.
So that's a reaction.

741
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:07,591
It's a reaction to the society that they
lived in and where else are they going 

742
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:07,591
to make that protest?
That's the praise.

743
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:10,600
That's exactly the right place to do it.
They did it subtle enough for me.

744
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:15,601
They,
they hold their fucking fist up in the 

745
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:15,601
air.
That's subtle enough for me.

746
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:16,480
That's how the fuck else use.
I'm talking about that message that they

747
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,320
sent.
Sixty.

748
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,540
You know what it was 1960 something.
What did he say?

749
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,160
What does public enemy?
We got a solid.

750
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,120
Raise your fist to the music.
United we stand yet you're violet.

751
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,880
We fought together.
We cast that tall brothers.

752
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:32,881
Got To work it out.
Celltech sometimes realize it's super 

753
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,340
bad.
What's up?

754
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,510

He's a very loyal,
very boy.

758
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,160
Swinging slinging.
He's breaking everybody's records.

759
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,970
Let's get that pop star or whatever.
He's looking over it.

760
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,980
Whatever.
So over.

761
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57,790
I'm going to do a food truck.

762
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,030
Brian?
What fucking do you guys ever gone to?

763
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:05,110
What's up with these food trucks?
I don't know if it's like this 

764
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,941
everywhere,
but in la the food trucks have attacked 

765
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:07,730
La.
Like now food trucks are so popular.

766
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:12,731
They have twitters where you like go on 
twitter and find out where the truck is 

767
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:12,731
and they called melrose.
The other date,

768
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,410
the whole street was this food trucks 
lined up.

769
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,040
Thousands of people everywhere.
This is a new recent trend,

770
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,200
right brandon?

771
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,700

We can't live without the food.
The food's okay.

775
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,140
Grilled cheese.
When have you been chief?

776

00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:35,100
Top.
Top is God.

778
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,810
Damn.
And they don't pay rent.

779
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,760
There's no overheads.
The food's very cheap.

780
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,160
You know,

So there's that to have an open mic at 

783
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,181
skinny's.
You'd go in there and do comedy and 

784
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:49,181
other way.
I got these fucking trucks everywhere.

785
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:49,490
So.
Wow.

786
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,020
I see those Mexican ones,
I don't take the chance.

787
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:52,640

00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:05,291
valley who I'm going to take you there

795
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm like van owner,

796
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,780
That plays in the jet dude there.

797
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:20,520
Carnitas.
Oh,

They have the dirty bowl of pickled 

799
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,590
Jalapenos and carrots just sitting out 
there.

800
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,750
Anybody could just stick their fucking 
hands in there.

801
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:35,030
No one cares.
Big little play to Jalapenos and and 

802
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,330
radishes and shit like that and those 
Jalapenos will fuck your world up.

803
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,820
These are the Jalapenos they grew.
You know what I'm saying?

804
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,010
Like they grew these shits in their 
backyard.

805
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,580
They got these new Jalapenos that'll 
make your ass bird like just when you're

they stay there all day.

807
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,400
It's subtle fucking Berg to remind you 
all day you're in the bathroom.

808
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:54,230
Triple wiping because you think you 
didn't wipe right.

809
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:56,630
You think you have like the second 
remorse coming out of your muffler,

810
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,170
but these new Jalapenos where they burn 
your ass all fucking day.

811

812
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,290
My ass was on fire all fucking day.
I'm done with that stuff.

813
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,520
What?
You don't eat Mexican food.

814
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,320
How is that shit just fucked me up dude.

815
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:16,321

chop them up in there when I chop up 

816
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:21,080

in one burrito and it just fucking 

817
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,070
cleans the whole system out.

818
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,970
Sun snots from.
Oh God.

819
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,520
Tears are coming down your eyes.
Your tongue is on fire for God.

820
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:31,310
Damn.
Your body's like gets like a jolt.

821
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,340

822
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,340
bullshit.
Yeah.

823
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,890

825
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,480

Thank you.

827
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:44,030
Do you have milk?
Mashed potatoes?

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,090

Shit on that motherfucking stopped.
Has another strong place to eat.

831
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,170
There's a place called chicks out here 
in the valley.

832
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,440
And uh,
I think that's an calabasas maybe 

833
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:02,440
somewhere around that.
Anyway,

834
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,990
this fucking place has made their own 
rotisserie.

835
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,660
They throw wood in it.
It's a wood burning rotisserie.

836
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:13,661
Family owned.
They've owned this place fucking 

837
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:13,661
forever.
You have to pay cash.

838
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:13,661
Yeah,

839
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,170
You have to pay cash.
They don't have credit card machines.

840
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,070
Fuck you.
Cash.

841
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,600
And they got this fucking brisket 
sandwich dude.

842
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:26,790
It's a barbecued brisket with,
with mashed potatoes in the sandwich.

843
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,450
Those.
There's a layer of mashed potatoes and a

844
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:34,451
layer of this mouth watering brisket and
it's all in together.

845
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:35,330
And you,

846
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:38,160

I'll take you there after

847
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,450

850
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,440
irregular shits ever since then.
I am so backed up.

851
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,600
That's all from this thing.
It's giant.

852
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:53,601
It weighs 13 pounds.
It's the biggest sandwich you've ever 

853
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,001
eaten.
I shit green like fluorescent green 

854
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:59,661

And the only thing I can think of

00:35:59,661 --> 00:35:59,661
mushrooms,

856
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,140
That's tripped your whole gates bro.
It was weird when I talk about that.

857
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,580
The I,

858
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:09,610

859
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,620

860
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,480
Beautiful.

861
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,270
I could get the fuck.

865
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,430

866
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,840

00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:33,240
I'm so excited to do the Wayans.
Can't wait to do shows like Gotham.

869
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,500
Excited about everything,

870
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,880
You Dot.
I'm sorry I missed you.

871
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,060
It was just that I didn't want to ask 
you that really beloved gave me the rock

872
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:45,070
chest the week when I was there last 
year and all of a sudden I see the UFC 

873
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,870
is back to this year,
so I didn't want to leave for 10 days in

874
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:46,520
a row.
And Ashley.

875
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,310

00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:48,490
I understand.
No,

877
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:49,470
no worries man.
No worries.

878
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:51,840
I said fuck it because a,
I wanted to go back,

879
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:56,841
but I didn't want to go back there 
because it's going to be busy the next 

880
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,510
couple of weeks and it's weird because I
was telling you that I'm going to visit 

881
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,031
a buddy of mine that wanted to tell you 
the story just so you didn't know it at 

882
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:02,031
83,
you know,

883
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:06,841
I was a fucked up kid and I was at a bar
one night and this kid came in and I 

884
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,530
knew his whole family.

885
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,530
I knew his younger brothers and this kid
had gone to the Air Force Academy where 

886
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,230
you had one you got onto the train or 
something once?

887
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,640
No,
I went to the Olympic training center 

888
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,930
and his other brother went to Brown and 
we used to go visit his brother and his 

889
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,270
brother used to be there with Kennedy 
was on campus.

890
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,780
They were in the same fucking thing.
So we would go up there and watch jackie

891
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:29,781
o come to the campus and people would 
throw shit at her and call her jackie o 

892
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:29,781
Yukon.
It was fucking crazy.

893
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,170
But just to get back to the story,
uh,

894
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,960
I wanted to get out of jersey,
you know,

895
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,400
I wasn't doing the right thing,
you know,

896
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:36,960
and uh,
he came to me,

897
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:38,850
he's like,
I got a place in Colorado if you want to

898
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:39,780
come.
He goes,

899
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:41,100
we'll buy a car and drive out.

900
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,810
And I was like,
I'll give you the money for the car.

901
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,360
But I wanted to rob this dude.
Right.

902
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:48,090
I wanted to rob this drug dealer that I 
used to hide three kilos.

903
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,520
They used to deliver three kilos a month
to his,

904
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,180
to his building and he would hide it in 
his parking garage.

905
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,600
So if somebody slipped one night of the 
party and said that his buddy got three 

906
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,270
kilos delivered and he didn't want to 
put the coke in his house.

907
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:05,271
So I was,
my plan was to rob the kilos now at the 

908
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:05,400
time I used to deal with a loan shark 
all the time.

909
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,570
And he was my,
you know,

910
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,680
he wasn't my friend,
but I knew him for years and I was 

911
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:11,680
trying to set him up to.
I would make him payments.

912
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,461
Every resource that was going to do is 
rob the drug deal is give him the five 

913
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:20,091
grand I owe to wait 10 days and then hit
him for 50 and then take off the 

914
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:20,091
Colorado.

915
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,050
If I was gonna do right.
Wait a minute,

916
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:23,940
wait a minute.
When I got lost dog,

917
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:28,941
I used to be the real deal.
I've been trying to tell you this for 

918
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:30,951
years.
So you were going to pay him back and 

919
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:30,951
then Robin,
I was going to pay him back.

920
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:31,290
I used to borrow from this guy 
constantly.

921
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,980
Okay.
Years.

922
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,260
He owned a bar.
He was a mob guy.

923
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:37,160
We used to borrow from constantly,
constantly like you.

924
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:41,980
You fucking borrow $500 to 7:50.
So that was 10 weeks of $75 a week.

925
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,040
So people would come to me and said,
Bro,

926
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,390
I'm in a bind with George.
I'm in a bind.

927
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Can you get me money from George?
And I would borrow it and I get a point 

928
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:51,420
every week.
So I was lending out money.

929
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,050
So altogether my bill was six grand with
him,

930
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,940
but it was people that were paying the 
guy.

931
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Do you understand,
and I have a weird thing like lending 

932
00:38:59,960 --> 00:38:59,960
money.
Oh,

933
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,070
it's amazing.
It's an east coast thing.

934
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,760
This is huge.
It's not an east coast thing.

935
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,800
If everybody loans loan this loan sharks
in facts alone.

936
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,630
Sharks,
banks,

937
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,030
and that's.
Yeah,

938
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,340
no,
you're right.

939
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,990
Some people have a card business and 
they really.

940
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:16,300
They're in a bind.
They legit people,

941
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,730
but they want to buy 10 cars.
They don't have the cash on him,

942
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,930
but you know what?
God Damn.

943
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,460
Could you imagine?
There's no banks.

944
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,240
How much it would suck if you had to 
carry all your money around,

945
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,260
you know,
it's sort of you had gold,

946
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,240
one of your work like fucking second 
there.

947
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,770
I come with a horse and stab me in the 
fucking what the fuck?

948
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:38,370
That's when people used to like hold up 
money and dig holes in the dirt and 

949
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:38,710
burry shit it.

950
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,630
That's why they did because they 
couldn't carry it on.

951
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,880
It's stupid.
I know how much money is buried still.

952
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,060
Whatever banks cost their worth and even
when they rip everybody off,

953
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,830
God,
it would suck if there's no banks.

954
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,480
He has no banks.
What?

955
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,710
Where's the money?
Monday doesn't even read the problem.

956
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:56,650
Money is.
It doesn't really mean anything anymore.

957
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,760
It's not like this hundred dollar bill 
is worth $100 worth of gold.

958
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:03,880
It's not based on gold anymore.
It's based on like confidence,

959
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:06,250
like you have to like believe in,
in the money.

960
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,600
Silly.
That's crazy.

961
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:10,630
That's why everyone should just spend it
as fast as possible.

962
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:11,800
It doesn't make sense.
I mean,

963
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:13,550
gold makes no sense anyway.
I mean,

964
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:18,551
even if you get to that,
I mean the fact that everybody was in 

965
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:18,551
the gold,
you know,

966
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,500
the only thing that makes sense about 
gold is that I guess it's,

967
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,380
it's rare.

968
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,540
You know,
it's,

969
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,900
it's,
you can't just have it.

970
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,730
You can't just like say,
look,

971
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,090
I've got millions of dollars because 
it's everywhere.

972
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,510
Just go out into the woods and cut it 
down.

973
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,180
It's hard to get.
But what the fuck man.

974
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,860
So can I just got to be a better way to 
fucking go?

975
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,880
You right away,
right away.

976
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:41,881
You're poor.
Reveal with gold was thought about but 

977
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:41,881
fascinating.
Fascinating.

978
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:43,540
$800 a fuck.
So you're ripping people off.

979
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,600
So I'm not ripping nobody off.
I'm going to set this guy up because I 

980
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,030
wanted a new life in Colorado.
So we're gonna rob this drug deal.

981
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,110
I was going to take that money,
pay the loan shark off,

982
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,570
wait 10 days and go,
Hey,

983
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,360
I've got a line on a kilo Kokanee 
$50,000.

984
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:58,850
He probably gave me 30 and I was gonna 
move to Colorado and buy property,

985
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,220
whatever the fuck is.

986
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,290
And why didn't you think he was going to
go after you?

987
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,970
Because they don't.
They don't go outside.

988
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:05,710
Fucking New York City.
That's only in the movies.

989
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:08,550
These fucking.
These guys go to Miami and escape.

990
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,620
What I'm saying?
You know the people you grew up with in 

991
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Boston,
where do they go?

992
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,860
They go to the fucking whatever.
That the fucking pigeon place in Boston 

993
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,100
in the summer and that.
Anything out of that area,

994
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,780
that comfort zone,
they fucking freak pro.

995
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,010
They can't take it.
You know?

996
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:26,011
The mob really lost a lot of credibility
when sammy the bull gravano got away 

997
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:26,860
with everything.
Everybody lost credit.

998
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,390
No,
that was the most ridiculous thing.

999
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:33,391
I was like,
I thought for sure it was going to kill 

1000
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:33,391
that guy.
Right.

1001
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:33,440
That's what happens.
You can't be a rat.

1002
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,370
You know?
He walked the Donna up.

1003
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,390
Whoa.
There must be like people coming after 

1004
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,390
him.

1005
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,390
That's when you realize like,
Whoa,

1006
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,060
this is not the organized thing than it 
appears.

1007
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:46,070
You know,
Sammy the book who Chicago cops were 

1008
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,230
putting together the murder.
Sammy the bull really to make money.

1009
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,070
Yeah.
How much was the money?

1010
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,520
I had no idea,
but they knew that there was a contract 

1011
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:54,990
that will and Chicago cops are going to 
go down and blasting.

1012
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,560
That's a crazy hand.
Used to be a dirty cop,

1013
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,880
man.
You've got to really take a chance.

1014
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:00,470
You got to really put yourself out 
there,

1015
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,680
you know,
and to get a bunch of other dirty cops 

1016
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,021
together.
Like you gotta like assumed that you're 

1017
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:08,021
all going to keep your mouth shut and 
you're all wet.

1018
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,410
But it happens all the time.
Man,

1019
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,210
all the time.
They're always busting cops.

1020
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,580
This is too much.
Too much power.

1021
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,650
There's certification.
I've searched before.

1022
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:17,720
There's tons of dirty cops on Craig's 
list.

1023
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,980
Oh Bro.
Like he stumbled on that one too,

1024
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,600
so excited to get it out.
You know what's crazy man?

1025
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,670
Because after a cop is a cop,
you know,

1026
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,671
I can just imagine being living lawyer 
life to protect your country and blah 

1027
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:34,610
blah blah blah blah.
And also one day you actually,

1028
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,560
to be a cop,
you have to have a certain gene.

1029
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:41,561
You really want to help people.
You really have to genuinely hurt help 

1030
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:42,530
people because it's $30,000
a year or it's just you'd want the job.

1031
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,810
Some people just want that.
I think it's more than that.

1032
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Thirty 8,000
to start is that a little walk a beat 

1033
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,080
and carry a gun at people shoot at you 
melodies.

1034
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,430
Cops are getting fucking rich.
You got to be a cop for years and become

1035
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:57,431
a detective.
And First Brad and how much can I 

1036
00:42:57,431 --> 00:42:57,431
detective make?
Seventy,

1037
00:42:57,431 --> 00:42:59,000
80,000,
maybe 100,000.

1038
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,650
A commander,
chief.

1039
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,130
One hundred and $50,000.
I don't know,

1040
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,660
but I don't think a lot.
That's why this dirty fucking cops.

1041
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,960
That's why one day they go,
what the fuck am I doing right?

1042
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,700
I have to take a little bit here,
take a little bit,

1043
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,320
you know,
I'm making $38,000

1044
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,420
a year,
you know,

1045
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:16,480
and this guy wants to give me 5,000
so I don't.

1046
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,620
Buses book making operations on the 
corner would have fucking ain't 

1047
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:21,620
bothering,
you know,

1048
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,880
that's how it starts and it's A.
I guess it's like,

1049
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:27,881
Hey,
we were talking about the idea that you 

1050
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:27,881
had had a dick on and he said that 
sometimes when you're doing a bad show,

1051
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:30,370
you're so upset with yourself that you 
resort to doing genome.

1052
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,290
You're just not happy with you 
conditionally your life.

1053
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,520
And what's happened for a cop to.
It's fucking tough being a cop every 

1054
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,741
night and at the end of the day you go 
home at eight in the morning after a 12 

1055
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:44,561
hour shift and you're making 40 grand a 
year and people shooting at you and you 

1056
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:45,950
got to be out there in the rain and you 
know,

1057
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,460
nobody.

1058
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,460
You know,
it's funny because only on tv if people 

1059
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,460
nice to cops,
cops put up on a lot.

1060
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,580
On the other end,
you know,

1061
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:53,930
people like me,
I was a criminal,

1062
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,980
so I'm always a gentleman to cops.
I don't want to fight in that war and so

1063
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:58,770
it was nice as honey.
I was nice,

1064
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,820
you know what I'm saying,
but there's people that didn't have a 

1065
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:03,820
little money or take that bad to the 
bone.

1066
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,740
They're like,
why are you pulling me over for a bit?

1067
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,340
You get a ticket motherfucker for 
opening up like that.

1068
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:12,341
So the officer was I doing something 
else inside there because there's a lot 

1069
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:15,810
of people that are fucking crazy and you
need some protection from those peanuts.

1070
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,070
You need somebody pulling them over when
they're weaving in between lanes.

1071
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:24,250
He needs someone tackling them when 
they're ready to shoot people in a 

1072
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:24,250
fucking mall.

1073
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,580
You need cops.
People that don't think you need cops 

1074
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:27,800
are crazy.
I give this talk.

1075
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,520
I go,
oh,

1076
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,420
the older I got and the wiser you get.
I give my life to teachers,

1077
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,010
cops.
Anybody who's a public servant,

1078
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,210
you know,
all last week we're talking about this 

1079
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,871
fucking Mutt.
Charlie Sheen was basically a fucking 

1080
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:45,081
rich junkie.
If you come down to it that's just 

1081
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:47,331
sitting there talking shit,
do you have the balls to go on a plane 

1082
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:47,331
right now and go to Japan and helped 
those fucking people?

1083
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,630
Nobody talks about those fucking people.
Nobody really.

1084
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,700
Nobody listens to a fucking doctor.
If a doctor did a fucking podcast today 

1085
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,210
and tried to tell you how to stay 
fucking healthy,

1086
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,060
you think you'd get the views.
You get all this fucking mole,

1087
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:00,990
mole,
Charlie Sheen.

1088
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:05,350
Now Dr Oz,
Dr Oz show.

1089
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,880
Think about that fucking society.
Those guys in Japan right now picking 

1090
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,140
the fucking walls and there's kids under
the yelling,

1091
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:13,680
the screaming.

1092
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,470
They'll see things we wouldn't even 
imagine seeing in a lifetime.

1093
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,620
Those guys are going to come back and 
next week we'll have another disaster in

1094
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:22,500
Venezuela when Oregon and those guys 
will never get.

1095
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,740
Not even a fucking thank you.
You don't want that.

1096
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:27,480
That that's always killed me.
I can never be a public servant.

1097
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,140
I'm too much of a fucking piece of shit.
There's people out there that are just.

1098
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,000
That's what they live for,
you know,

1099
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:34,590
and they really believe in it,
bro.

1100
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:39,591
The day after that earthquake,
think how many people just got on a 

1101
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:39,591
plane and they just came back from 
somewhere else.

1102
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:40,140
Where was there an earthquake?
They just.

1103
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,290
They just got battling bucket,
Earthquake Zealand,

1104
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,080
New Zealand.
When the church and the hotel.

1105
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:50,081
A lot of God damn earthquakes lately.
Fucking dude was sitting here like 

1106
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,391
pigeons on a pond.
I don't know what the fuck we're doing 

1107
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:55,000
here and giggling like a bunch of 
fucking wouldn't that.

1108
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:00,230
It's either going to be San Francisco 
oriented bias and more time and then 

1109
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,870
we'll fucking next because we need to go
to fucking taxes when shit goes down.

1110
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:07,890
Texas is the best place to live.
At least all the guns are going to come 

1111
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,971
on and ship,
but think about all that shit last week 

1112
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:13,161
with these people.
Thinking about what it takes to go over 

1113
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:13,161
there right now.
One of those people get paid to get on a

1114
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:15,450
plane and go help those Japanese people.
It's a good question.

1115
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,210
Fucking I.
I turned down $50 fucking gigs.

1116
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:23,211
If I got to drive an hour,
these motherfuckers are going over 

1117
00:46:23,211 --> 00:46:23,211
there.
I think about that,

1118
00:46:23,211 --> 00:46:23,211
bro.
You know,

1119
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,200
what can they even do right now?
Right now,

1120
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,350
what they have to do is figure out how 
to deal with those nuclei.

1121
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You can walk into a reactive place when 
you have no idea who they are,

1122
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:38,360
but people in this country give a 
Frenchman fuck about that physical 

1123
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:38,360
sucker.

1124
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,890
Charlie Sheen that's around the state.
I think no one cares about charlie sheen

1125
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:42,080
anymore.
I think it's Ah,

1126
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,820
it's fucking feels like,
what the fuck?

1127
00:46:44,821 --> 00:46:46,380
Who gives a fuck?
It's really quick.

1128
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,240
It burned out quick.
I loved it for,

1129
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,940
for the call,
like Belushi,

1130
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,820
Dan Stream video killed it for me.
I think.

1131
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,840
Yeah,
me too.

1132
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,900
It's just all first one.
When the guy was playing the fart 

1133
00:46:59,900 --> 00:46:59,900
noises,
I'm like,

1134
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,231
Whoa,
these are the people he's hanging out 

1135
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:03,231
with.
That's when he dug.

1136
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:03,231
Or you believe that shit.
That's.

1137
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:04,350
Those are coke people.
Those Code People Are Idiots.

1138
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,080
You know?
And that's,

1139
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:10,110
that's what it is.
COPD people are these weird fucking 

1140
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:10,110
selfish,
indulgent,

1141
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,550
self-destructed people to not fun to 
hang out with.

1142
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:16,551
There's no cool conversation.
I just did it for 30 fucking years and 

1143
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:16,551
for the first 10 I did it with people 
because it was fun.

1144
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:17,700
You know how it's fine.
Oh my God,

1145
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,100
let's do as great.
After that,

1146
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,980
I became this person that was inside.
I can be out with people,

1147
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,140
but I'd never hung out with those.
I don't like it.

1148
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:26,700
I can't listen to people when they doing
coke,

1149
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,710
I want to kill him.
That's why after a while he came and 

1150
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:31,710
chicks hall because all you want

1151
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:35,100
them to do is suck your Dick.
I got listen to this fucking story 

1152
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,100
again.
There's a line snot.

1153
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,550
It sucked.
I'm fucking.

1154
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:40,551
Well,
when everybody likes about this whole 

1155
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:40,551
Charlie Sheen thing is that this guy is 
saying,

1156
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:40,551
you know,
fuck it.

1157
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:42,490
I'm just gonna have fun.
This is what I do.

1158
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,290
This is how I roll.
You know,

1159
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,460
you don't like it.
Fuck you.

1160
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:50,060
I'm a rockstar and you know that he's 
got this crazy confidence and everything

1161
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:50,730
is doing,
you know,

1162
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,100
winning next and everybody wants to be 
able to think like that.

1163
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:55,690
Everybody wants to be able to,
you know,

1164
00:47:55,691 --> 00:48:00,691
like people that are struggling and 
they're going through some shitty job 

1165
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:04,200
like God damn,
how bad ass would it be to be fucking 

1166
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Charlie Sheen right now?
It's really fun though.

1167
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,290
You said something to me after the Vegas
show.

1168
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,020
You took me aside and you're like,
ah,

1169
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,880
yeah,
Joey,

1170
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:08,770
you know you're standing up.

1171
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,320
I can see you're working on it or 
whatever the fuck you had to say to me.

1172
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Well,
the coke was doing the same thing to my 

1173
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:16,560
fucking stand though.
Instead of writing jokes,

1174
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,880
all I used to say was fucking I'm Joey 
Diaz.

1175
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,020
I could bang it 50 percent.
I grew up.

1176
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:22,810
There lies the Bro Drugs.
Coke cigarettes.

1177
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:27,811
They lie to you this 80.
It's buying into some Columbia and I'm 

1178
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:27,850
not saying he's a,
he's on the money,

1179
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:30,130
but I am saying that if he didn't die 
this way,

1180
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:32,950
what is he going to live forever and 
cure cancer with the fuck differences in

1181
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:33,300
May?
He's,

1182
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,320
I mean,
the only thing that's sad and tragic 

1183
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,320
because his kids are gonna miss him,
but you know what I mean?

1184
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,130
What is he doing?
What does he want to do with himself?

1185
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:40,840
This is what he wants to do.
And what's a fucking party?

1186
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,380
I don't think you should stop them.
Oh No,

1187
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,110
you're kidding me.
Is so for swore.

1188
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:49,690
I thought it was off.
Nobody important.

1189
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:55,020
Felt right.
It happens to the Times I made the 

1190
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,030
mistakes to a call.
Of course it's sussman.

1191
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,440
So yeah,
showrooming man was fucking amazing.

1192
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,630
But you have a great honor.
It was visual.

1193
00:49:03,631 --> 00:49:05,730
It was to the point where the person I 
was with,

1194
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:09,450
I could see their like energy flowing 
through their skin and then like we went

1195
00:49:09,451 --> 00:49:14,451
outside and the stars are going crazy 
and then like shadows looked like they 

1196
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,410
had texture.
It was amazing for a,

1197
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,380
for good our diary or anything.
Just just bright green shit today.

1198
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:24,780
That's what kills me to the.
That trip when I was.

1199
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,240
I used to get the diarrhea while I was 
on the mushroom.

1200
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:31,020
I that last time just got,
when I lived in Colorado,

1201
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,410
I'd eat a mushroom in 10 minutes late.
I'm going to shit.

1202
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,310
Trying to figure out how many trees they
cut,

1203
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:40,311
but have you done the.
Have you done it the t way before that 

1204
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,801
seemed like it was so much easier on 
your stomach and it didn't have any 

1205
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:43,890
proxy is fucking Greg's done.
The Tif.

1206
00:49:43,891 --> 00:49:44,800
A conscience.
That's great.

1207
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,260
Had

1208
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,130
the emoney to Mascara.
T what's that?

1209
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:48,260
And how was that the,
uh,

1210
00:49:48,261 --> 00:49:51,300
the mushroom that they believe is 
responsible for Christianity?

1211
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,980
I was so crazy.
Red and white mushroom.

1212
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:54,900
It looks like Santa Claus.
Is it like a mushroom mushroom?

1213
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,360
Like our main psychedelic mushrooms,
psychedelic mushroom,

1214
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,950
but it's a different sort of a 
psychedelic.

1215
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:00,070
It's very weird,
you know,

1216
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,010
I don't know if what I got was good 
stuff.

1217
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:07,180
It is very strange.
And then Doug and I did it and the day 

1218
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,370
we did it was the day the war broke out.
Nine slash 11.

1219
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,960
Yeah.
The day we went to war and we decided to

1220
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:14,820
go this dude yawns house,
you know,

1221
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,360
showing your shit,
Bro.

1222
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,030
That's you son.
Anyway,

1223
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:19,110
we'd go to this kid,
uh,

1224
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,750
John's house and he lives out in the 
middle of the desert.

1225
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,550
Weird fucking town out in Palmdale area 
or something,

1226
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:26,520
you know,
not there,

1227
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:28,070
but one of those towns where you're 
like,

1228
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:28,490
what the fuck?

1229
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,240
WHO's out here?
Why?

1230
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:34,241
What are you doing out here?
And we get blitzkrieg on mushrooms out 

1231
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:38,531
there.
And then we watched the news and the 

1232
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:38,531
news.
I'll never forget this,

1233
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:39,770
I've talked about this before,
Doug.

1234
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:42,830
Stan Hope said the guy goes on,
he goes,

1235
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,830
war coverage begins at five and Stan 
help goes,

1236
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,590
holy shit,
there's a kickoff.

1237
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,930
We're shroom to the gills to the point 
where everything I see,

1238
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:58,931
I shouldn't be social.
I should've been alone in the room 

1239
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,450
called closing my eyes and my back.
Oh you see the.

1240
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,070
I saw the fabric of the universe as I 
was walking.

1241
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:08,270
Everything was a pattern in front of me.
It was all really intense,

1242
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:09,940
complex geometrics.
It was like,

1243
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,350
like the,
the,

1244
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:16,390
the covering of the walls,
like wallpaper or doors or anything that

1245
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:21,610
all that stuff was be.
It became transparent and you could see 

1246
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:24,560
literally the structure of the universe 
through everything it was.

1247
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,420
We were fucked.
I mean,

1248
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:31,421
we were gone and,
and the fucking war coverage starts and 

1249
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,300
it was so strange that she's crazy.
I couldn't imagine it was so bizarre.

1250
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:40,301
Man Just didn't seem real.
It's like it's 2000 and whatever the 

1251
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:41,540
fuck it was back then to three and I was
like,

1252
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,970
this is how we're rocking it.
This is how we're rocking it.

1253
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:47,600
We're just going to the fuck.
That probably fucked you up somehow.

1254
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,720
You know,
it's really like burned into your mind 

1255
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,541
because mushrooms with nine slash 11.
That's insane because nine slash 11 was 

1256
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,020
crazy for everybody because that was 
something they'd never saw ever.

1257
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:02,090
You saw it in a psychedelic way going 
off.

1258
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,190
Not nine slash 11,
so nine slash 11.

1259
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,040
I,
you remember when we were hanging out?

1260
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,010
Interesting.
We went over to a Mike pavements house.

1261
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:15,290
It was Eddie and Ralphie and Joey.

1262
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:20,310
It was an interesting fucking day 
because a boy at the shit had went down 

1263
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,250
and we went to Baja fresh and we had 
some burritos and we were just sitting 

1264
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,181
there and shooting the shit and just 
talking and not a fucking plane in the 

1265
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:28,550
sky.
That was one of the weirdest things when

1266
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:30,580
they shut down on the flights,
not a plane.

1267
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,270
This guy speaking,
a favorite man.

1268
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:34,370
He has a new book out and he's been 
actually doing real.

1269
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:39,420
Yeah.
Tour like the morning show toured all 

1270
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:39,420
around and stuff.
Him and his other book?

1271
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,050
Yeah,
it's a cookbook.

1272
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,540
He writes it for camping for like,
like gourmet food while you're camping 

1273
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,050
and stuff or outside.
And I haven't ever eaten food but I hear

1274
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:49,280
he's a bad motherfucker.

1275
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:55,060
Chicken is chicken Lod puts on it,
but it's crazy because I did a,

1276
00:52:55,501 --> 00:52:58,490
a hit a window pane acid one night when 
I was,

1277
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,310
why do they call it window says was like
a clear acid.

1278
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,560
It was like a,
it looked like a piece of glass.

1279
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:04,870
So,
uh,

1280
00:53:04,871 --> 00:53:07,420
I did it one night and the people I were
with,

1281
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:12,430
the one guy was with freaked out.
It was a Monday night football game and 

1282
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:12,430
he goes,
Bro,

1283
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:12,430
I got to go home.
Like,

1284
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:12,710
all right,
I fucking call.

1285
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:18,130
I guess I'll trip solo.
So I went and I got a call for a buddy 

1286
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:18,560
of mine and knock on his door.
There's dances,

1287
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,610
he's like,
Joey,

1288
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,460
come on.
If I'm like Mr Bender,

1289
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:25,170
I can't ya come on in and have a soda.
Wait him,

1290
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:26,510
he should be back from the gym or 
something.

1291
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:32,060
So I sit down and I'm sitting at 
tripping my ass off watching fucking 

1292
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:35,130
Monday night football with him and he's 
telling me about the stats of the game.

1293
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,740
It was the jet game and I'm sitting at 
its dark.

1294
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,220
He watched the TV and the dark and all 
of a sudden Howard cosell comes on.

1295
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,800
He goes,
I like to report something.

1296
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,040
John Lennon has just been shot in front 
of the coders and here I am tripping on 

1297
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:53,180
acid and I'm flying by this time and 
he's watching tv,

1298
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,210
the darkness and he's talking about,
and I'm thinking about John Lennon and 

1299
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,910
getting shot reports are coming in.
He's getting just got shot in the Cota.

1300
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,860
We'll keep you posted.
Oh my God.

1301
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:05,100
America.
I have a sad former beat or he just went

1302
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:06,840
into the speed.
You could hear it on youtube,

1303
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,390
but I'll never forget sitting there 
thinking to myself,

1304
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,070
you know,
like because when you,

1305
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,890
when you're tripping,
you really can't comprehend the foot and

1306
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:18,891
they go through you.
It's like John Lennon got shot and they 

1307
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:18,891
shoot the other Beatles.
Well,

1308
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:22,491
I hope they shout out just fucking going
and you can't stop these fucking 

1309
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:27,351
thoughts.
But that was what happened to me that 

1310
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:29,480
day.
Like I just want to call for Brian and 

1311
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:29,480
he's like,
Brian ends up playing out of his league,

1312
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,480
but if you want to sit and watch the 
game,

1313
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,230
weird.
When you remember when people died,

1314
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,190
the jolt.
Like,

1315
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:39,191
what is it?
What is it about memory that some 

1316
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:39,350
memories are so much more potent than 
others.

1317
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:44,590
Some memories just stay forever.
They just locked in and you just don't 

1318
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,500
get rid of them.
You remember where you were sitting,

1319
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:50,710
you remember what the room looked like 
or you think you remember what the room 

1320
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:50,710
looked like?
A,

1321
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:50,990
but it would be a little bit different 
if you actually saw in real life.

1322
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,380
But when people died,
like I remember I was at my girlfriend's

1323
00:54:54,381 --> 00:54:58,190
house when I was like 18 and the space 
shuttle Challenger blew up and I watched

1324
00:54:58,191 --> 00:55:03,191
it blow up on tv and I didn't realize 
what had happened while I was flying to 

1325
00:55:03,191 --> 00:55:06,821
the.
I'm not sure if I saw a replay of it or 

1326
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:06,860
if I saw it live,
but I didn't know what was happening.

1327
00:55:06,861 --> 00:55:11,861
And then it blew up and then I realized 
what they were showing and then I had 

1328
00:55:11,861 --> 00:55:12,500
turned the volume up and I'm watching 
this.

1329
00:55:12,501 --> 00:55:13,580
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

1330
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:17,570
Like it blew up in the sky,
but I can see the carpet,

1331
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,020
I can see the walls of her room.
I mean I can see the whole thing.

1332
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,260
I remember everything.
It's like it's a locked in on me know.

1333
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,160
What is that?
Why,

1334
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,390
why?
How come?

1335
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:31,780
I mean is it just that we'd not have 
enough capacity to remember shit like 

1336
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:31,780
that all the time?

1337
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,090
I don't know if it's that or what,
because sometimes that kind of shit pops

1338
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:37,400
out of nowhere though.
Like it wasn't deleted.

1339
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,420
Like,
like Oh my God,

1340
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:40,760
I forgot all about that.
And like all these memories come rushing

1341
00:55:40,761 --> 00:55:42,650
in like out of nowhere.
So it's,

1342
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,720
it's almost wonder,
makes me wonder if there is a drug or 

1343
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,360
something that could just open all the 
doors are open all the memory.

1344
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,820
Have you access to all files?
I've been taking this five htp.

1345
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:57,470
What does that shift from GNC where it's
supposed to be pumping more serotonin,

1346
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,190
serotonin and stuff like that where I've
been only taking it for a week,

1347
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:05,090
but immediately I already find my,
my mind working better in memory.

1348
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:05,840
It really?
Yeah.

1349
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,210
In a happy and happiness.
I feel like more.

1350
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,920
Of course there's other reasons too.
Well,

1351
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,360
you know,
Chris and I are

1352
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:12,260
coming up with a,
uh,

1353
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,320
like a supplement line.
We're going to figure out all the best 

1354
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,351
shit like we're working on right now.
He is working on it and we're going to 

1355
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:23,621
have pills where it's all of the best 
vitamins for mental throw that shit in 

1356
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,890
function.
Throw that shit in there.

1357
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:30,930
If he can do five act.
You know what I'm talking about that 

1358
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:30,930
I've never done it before.
But you know what I'm talking about,

1359
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:31,540
right?
If I take a bunch of different stuff,

1360
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:34,810
but that's not one of them,
what exercises me is what I really write

1361
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,890
about a situation when I sit down like,
okay,

1362
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:43,210
can I have on the right about the time I
tried off a freshman football and even 

1363
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:46,770
though I have no fucking idea about it,
and then the memories come back to that.

1364
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,210
Everything.
Everything in that genre.

1365
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,660
Yeah.

1366
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:54,750
Everything in that genre that maybe had 
to do with music music when we're 

1367
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,100
driving stuff,
nobody ever gets teary eyed in the car.

1368
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:02,310
You hear a song man,
my buddy johnny be my best friend had 

1369
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,870
died and whenever I hear van Morrison,
marvelous knife for a moon dance,

1370
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,880
that was like his son,
we would go to the diner.

1371
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:12,270
These diners in New York,
they're all lot of them are here like 

1372
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:12,820
this that you split around a little bit.
Yeah,

1373
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:17,870
and they had the fucking thing when you 
can pick the songs to listen to and you 

1374
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:17,870
put a couple of quarters in there and 
you can play songs.

1375
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,790
Yeah.
You have like little shitty speaker,

1376
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,080
two bucks and we'd be eating 
cheeseburger.

1377
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:26,440
Deluxe is at 3:00
in the morning after playing pool and he

1378
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:29,140
would play moon moondance,
so now it doesn't matter where I am.

1379
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:31,360
I was in Germany,
I was in Germany,

1380
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:33,100
in the hotel and it's playing in the 
lobby.

1381
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,080
Marvelous knife or a moon dance and I'm 
like,

1382
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:39,700
mom saw you just think about that dude.
Things get stuck in there man.

1383
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,400
But you know what?
Nothing gets stuck in there.

1384
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,000
My Act,
no.

1385
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,050
My old material shit on some of the 
people will like yell out at a show.

1386
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,720
Like I've had that a bunch of times,
especially when I was doing the q and a,

1387
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:54,721
which I haven't been doing recently 
because I'm trying to do more like a 

1388
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:54,721
tighter,
hard,

1389
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,310
tighter id too.
I,

1390
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:57,680
you know,
I,

1391
00:57:57,681 --> 00:58:02,681
I thought of that after I saw Norton,
saw Norton in Austin and killed.

1392
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,730
He had a great set and he only did it 
like 50 minutes and I thought about.

1393
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:07,150
I'm like,
man,

1394
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:12,151
that's really all you need to do.
These hour and a half sets that I'm 

1395
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:13,360
doing two hour sets and a lot of it is 
just quick q and a.

1396
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:18,420
Some people like it,
but some people feel obligated to stick 

1397
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,030
around like it's just like it's too much
attention that you're asking for,

1398
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:22,150
tell them your show's over and then do 
the cube with A.

1399
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,550
Maybe I'll figure out another way to do 
q and a,

1400
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,760
maybe do a night where it's just q and a
or it's not gonna make it real cheap,

1401
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:34,950
you know,
just to pay for the room and make it so 

1402
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,950
that like one night maybe there's not a 
standup show.

1403
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,200
It's a q and a show because it's like,
it's a little indulgent.

1404
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,540
But anyway,
my point is when people yell out shit,

1405
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,260
like yell out,
you know,

1406
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:46,261
do this bid,
do like Noah's Ark or something like 

1407
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:46,261
that.
Man,

1408
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:46,261
I fucking forget a lot of them.
Like if you,

1409
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:50,860
you yelled out,
Anna Nicole Smith was one of my best 

1410
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,281
buds ever.
But if I go back and try to figure out 

1411
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:53,281
how to do it now,
I'll fuck it up.

1412
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:53,620
You didn't know his arc.
Pretty good.

1413
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:58,621
The other day somebody would pull that 
out because I was baked as Jesus was 

1414
00:58:58,621 --> 00:58:59,410
Jesus on an asteroid.
Like I even forgot it,

1415
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,560
I can't believe I remembered it because 
that was the first time I had done it in

1416
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:04,600
years and this guy asks for it.
I was like,

1417
00:59:04,601 --> 00:59:06,670
wow,
I don't even know if I can do this,

1418
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,980
but I did it and close with it,
but that's,

1419
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:13,981
you know,
that was a mistake in vegas too to do a 

1420
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:14,590
q and a in front of 2000 fucking people 
and there's just too many people.

1421
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:19,830
Too many people yelling shit out.
If I was going to do something like 

1422
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:19,830
that,
I had to do with microphones,

1423
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,010
like have like a little line like we did
in Columbus when we did the DVD.

1424
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,750
When does the UFC coming back to 
Columbus?

1425
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,420
Are they ever going to come and think we
are maybe in the future,

1426
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:28,900
but we just did striked with aged 
strikeforce.

1427
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,940
Did the last Columbus Shell to Arnold 
was just two weeks ago.

1428
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,180
Yeah.
I was always a cool weekend.

1429
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:36,570
He had the arnold show.
Fuck.

1430
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:37,520
Yeah,
it was awesome.

1431
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,760
Yeah,
that's why I did my special club.

1432
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:41,870
That's funny bumps.
Great.

1433
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,020
Did the theater that I did too was um,
what's it called again?

1434
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:50,110
The southern theater,
the theater that we filmed the special 

1435
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,740
and Mae West used to perform there and 
fucking Groucho Marx.

1436
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,490
Wow.
Oh No,

1437
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:52,730
no,
no.

1438
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,980
Not Groucho Marx.
WC fields.

1439
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,920
WC fields and Mae West perform there.
What the fuck,

1440
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:59,780
man?
That's some history.

1441
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,390
That's amazing.
Imagine trying to be an actor back then.

1442
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:05,330
How fucking tough it must have been.
I mean,

1443
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,380
shit,
there's,

1444
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,340
there's no internet.
There's,

1445
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:10,160
I mean you got to get picked to do 
things.

1446
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,130
You got to get picked.
The state studio has to choose you.

1447
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:19,180
That's probably.
There must have been so much chicanery 

1448
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,180
going on back then.
What's that should carry?

1449
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:24,650
I'm like in appropriate behavior.
It was different than it was

1450
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,940
words like,
like,

1451
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,180
like an African.
Sometimes the patient cracks like an 

1452
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,640
African person.
Huge word sometime.

1453
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:36,150
I'm like,
what?

1454
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,600
Gina is probably a big word.
That's how it even intelligent.

1455
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:41,490
Where it's a silly word.
I think it's like a swine term.

1456
01:00:41,491 --> 01:00:46,491
Yeah.
But that's way different than the 

1457
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:46,491
vocabulary.
Then I met Joey Diaz.

1458
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:46,640
Did you know what that word with?
No,

1459
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,620
what?
I'll all,

1460
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:53,621
I'm trying to remember what the fuck I 
was trying to say about weird

1461
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:02,060
because if you talk to people from them,
like even in Hollywood was different 

1462
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:05,971
than they'd move out here and you and 
you suck everyone's Dick and then they 

1463
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:07,660
give you a script and get a loaf of 
bread.

1464
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,490
They gave you a paycheck every week and 
you just got assigned different films.

1465
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:15,490
All those guys that you see from the 
sixties and fifties that way here.

1466
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,740
They all lived in Burbank,
Burbank,

1467
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,720
all those houses that look the same 
shit.

1468
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,900
You remember all those movies about like
jfk,

1469
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,080
like they always have those belongings 
that were with jfk that were like sort 

1470
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,621
of semi disposable.
They would always be like hanging 

1471
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:31,621
around,
but they never really addressed them.

1472
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:35,730
Right.
That's like 90 percent of what came to 

1473
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,330
Hollywood.
People came here last looking to stick.

1474
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:39,610
Some people stuck.
The people that did stick,

1475
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:41,350
all the other people's had look,
they stuck,

1476
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,150
they stuck,
looked a little stilted,

1477
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:43,930
they stuck.

1478
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:48,930
They're still there.
They're famous and they get sucked into 

1479
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:49,630
the system and wind up being one of 
those little quiet girls.

1480
01:01:49,631 --> 01:01:52,540
And JFK is arm that's still happens 
today.

1481
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,500
Fuck yeah,
it does.

1482
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:55,090
This is it,
man.

1483
01:01:55,091 --> 01:02:00,091
This is the land of dreams.
This is the strangest fucking place on 

1484
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,851
earth.
This is the place where you go to 

1485
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:02,851
maximize how many people who know who 
you are,

1486
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:06,850
what you can make a living.
Just on that.

1487
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:11,851
Now you got to suck a little Dick and do
something where people pay attention to 

1488
01:02:11,851 --> 01:02:12,880
on the Internet,
like Kim Kardashian and move.

1489
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:17,940
Basically.
She started out blowing her boyfriend 

1490
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,070
and fucking him on the Internet and 
videos obviously produced videos,

1491
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:21,230
you know,
obviously produced.

1492
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:25,400
Absolutely.
And then she's fucking macy's.

1493
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,540
Now she's signing perfume bottles at 
macy's.

1494
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,670
I was in Australia and there was a 
fucking billboard with Kim Kardashian on

1495
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:33,870
it in Australia.

1496
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,590
She goes around the girl,
good for her,

1497
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,610
figured whatever.
I mean,

1498
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,430
she's not diabetic dog.
This is,

1499
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:47,330
there's nothing wrong.
But it's fascinating that this is the 

1500
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,881
spot where all this goes down.
This is the spot where everybody comes 

1501
01:02:49,881 --> 01:02:50,070
to to make something happen.
It comes to,

1502
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:55,100
to get some attention.
There's a lot of people that fall 

1503
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:55,100
through the cracks.
You know?

1504
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:55,100
There's a lot of victims in this fucking
town,

1505
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,870
so people have come and gone since 
you've been a lot,

1506
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,160
how have you ever gotten facebook and 
saying,

1507
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,670
hey,
no.

1508
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:02,510
You're like,
Ooh,

1509
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,520
those are creepy.
I just happened to that guy because I 

1510
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,431
forget about half the people that moved 
to upstate New York member Laszlo 

1511
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:10,880
Laszlo.

1512
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,990
He used to hang out at the comedy store 
all the time.

1513
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,670
A long time ago.
Laszlo.

1514
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:16,170
He moved to Florida.
Anyway,

1515
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,330
nevermind.
He's somebody that just slipped away.

1516
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:23,340
Used to.
We used to talk to him like every week 

1517
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:23,340
it.

1518
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:23,340
I do not remember that guy.
I remember.

1519
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,390
I don't remember what it looked like.
What was the town coordinator?

1520
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:28,500
When we first got to the store,
he hits me up.

1521
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:31,350
He's like in fucking Jerusalem.
Jerusalem,

1522
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:37,250
walking through Europe right now.
People have come and gone that had big 

1523
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,490
plans and deals.
Yeah.

1524
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:42,480
Scripts and I've met with Pachino last 
week.

1525
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,980
These motherfuckers ain't God Jack.
We've seen a lot of the real estate.

1526
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:52,130
I got an email last week on my regular 
email from some dude and I call them 

1527
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:52,130
back and I'm like,
hey,

1528
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,820
how you doing?
He was my first manager.

1529
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,090
Whoa.
And He.

1530
01:03:55,110 --> 01:04:00,110
He was a filter.
His family was filthy rich and he went 

1531
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:00,110
back to sell real estate.
He's like,

1532
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,830
Hey man,
I'm just calling you because I'm opening

1533
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:06,831
up comedy clubs again.
What I'm finding steady goes the bottom 

1534
01:04:06,831 --> 01:04:08,190
fell out,
but it's amazing that I forgot all about

1535
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,150
that fucking dude.

1536
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,520
That was fucking years ago.
Yeah.

1537
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:13,170
Some people just decide it's not for 
them.

1538
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,200
What am I?
Just too much stress that we were 

1539
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,470
friends with that one day she 
disappeared,

1540
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:25,940
but we were friends.
How many friends and we had that got a 

1541
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:25,940
lot.
How many people with talent?

1542
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,360
People that came to the store,
so I got a script I just sold and you've

1543
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:31,440
got both.
A year later they're like,

1544
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:33,210
oh no,
I'm doing radio in Wisconsin.

1545
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,560
What the fuck?
You would just sell the script.

1546
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:38,690
That paramount.
It's amazing how many people come and go

1547
01:04:38,691 --> 01:04:40,200
through it and get spit out.

1548
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,010
Do this.
So many.

1549
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,920
How about guys with talent?
How about Mike Ricco?

1550
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,560
Huh?
How about Mike Greco?

1551
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,750
Greco.
When I started out in 1994.

1552
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,820
Mike Ricco was a funny fucking comic.
He's a funny guy.

1553
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:56,060
I'm sure he's very funny.
I saw when I saw Mike Recur at the 

1554
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,120
store,
I remember thinking we were probably 

1555
01:04:59,120 --> 01:04:59,120
around the same age or something and I 
remember thinking,

1556
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,020
this fucking guy is going to be huge.
This guy is funny.

1557
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,150
He's funny.
He's confident up there.

1558
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:05,430
He'd already had the article written,
written about them.

1559
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:10,431
When I went to the store that was like 
an article that was framed like in the 

1560
01:05:10,431 --> 01:05:13,251
lobby,
like a little article about Mike Rucker 

1561
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:13,251
or think that's kind of fucking take 
off,

1562
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:16,230
but for whatever fucking reason to the 
pieces,

1563
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:19,300
don't fall in the right order,
you know?

1564
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,400
It's just amazing.
It was a weird.

1565
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:25,120
Chelsea Chelsea handler was up there 
with us from day one.

1566
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,630
She's going gang busters now.
That crazy bitch look at her.

1567
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,140
She's kind of like sitcoms and she's got
her own fucking show,

1568
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:36,010
like a reality show about her show.
So she's got her show and then she's got

1569
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:38,480
a reality show about are so good for 
her.

1570
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:42,370
I hope she's the white drunk oprah.
That's what I hope for.

1571
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:47,430
You know,
who I heard was on that reality show 

1572
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:47,430
about Chelsea?
Uh,

1573
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:48,490
the girl from Denver that the assistant.
Oh really?

1574
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:50,230
Awesome.
He's one of the characters.

1575
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,110
Yeah,
she drove from Denver.

1576
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:57,270
Remember the assistant that you to 
always drive us around or the comedy 

1577
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:57,370
works.
Yeah,

1578
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,380
I do remember,
but why am I blanking on her name?

1579
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,420
Eve?
Eve.

1580
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,470
Eva,
Eva.

1581
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,910
Eva.
Jesus Christ.

1582
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:05,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1583
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:07,750
She's awesome.
She works with Chelsea handler now.

1584
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:08,740
Yeah.
You know,

1585
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:13,741
I'm fucking.
I'm always happy when someone figures 

1586
01:06:13,741 --> 01:06:14,350
out a way to make it through the crazy 
net that you know,

1587
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,730
that like the salmon ladder or whatever 
the fuck it is to get to the top.

1588
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,410
You know,
I'm always fascinated.

1589
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:25,411
You know,
we have like the people that I thought 

1590
01:06:25,411 --> 01:06:26,320
were going to be fucking stars.
How have you been like Dane Cook?

1591
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:31,680
You know,
I would have never guessed that Dane 

1592
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:31,680
Cook would have hit the way he hit.
No disrespect.

1593
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,220
It's just.
I couldn't believe that he.

1594
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:38,460
Dude,
you knew that he was going to get that 

1595
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:38,460
big.
I do it by one conversation we had after

1596
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:38,600
the width of the lap.
Stop.

1597
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:41,050
Really for the laugh factory.
I said to him,

1598
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:42,610
what'd you think of the laptop when he 
goes,

1599
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:44,860
Bro,
it was good,

1600
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:50,370
but it was too much fucking work.
I got to figure out how to narrow it 

1601
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:53,260
until one night and I knew right there.
I feel like that was a year before he 

1602
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,750
hit her to doing a whole month.
That was before the whole weekend.

1603
01:06:55,751 --> 01:06:56,230
Which is.
Yeah.

1604
01:06:56,231 --> 01:06:57,490
He was like,
that's just bullshit.

1605
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,520
That's just garbage.
So you knew he was going to be that huge

1606
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:01,720
though.
How could you have predicted that?

1607
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,600
That's just had a feeling.
You just have.

1608
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:09,060
All the arrows are pointing at him.
I didn't know he was the sell out 

1609
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,700
Madison Square Garden twice as dual.
Fuck that.

1610
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,090
You know,
he's the first guy that ever figured out

1611
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:15,220
how to really connect with people over 
the Internet.

1612
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,060
You know?
That guy is still to this day,

1613
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:20,230
he's constantly answering emails,
constantly connecting with people.

1614
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:22,900
Uses that say now thing gets on that.
That's on twitter.

1615
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:28,240
There's twitter,
there's facebook for people to connect 

1616
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,411
with these guys.
That's why there's this podcast is a 

1617
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:31,411
fame.
I mean,

1618
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:34,111
we started out this podcast,
Brian and I were just sitting in front 

1619
01:07:34,111 --> 01:07:36,511
of a laptop with fucking snow falling.
Can remember we gave visual effects.

1620
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,710
Let's try snowflakes.
Okay,

1621
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,150
let's try rain.

1622
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,640
Let's have a spinning apple.
It's amazing.

1623
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:46,530
It's called black and red.
This economy,

1624
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,860
what's going on right now?
You could do standup,

1625
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:54,040
you know all the time,
but you need to open up different doors 

1626
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:54,490
for yourself and this is where this 
comes in.

1627
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,250
The podcast will definitely.
I mean,

1628
01:07:57,251 --> 01:07:58,900
you know,
where the podcast really comes in,

1629
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:03,901
it comes in for everybody else.
It comes in for all these other people 

1630
01:08:03,901 --> 01:08:03,901
that don't have people like us around 
them.

1631
01:08:03,901 --> 01:08:04,390
You know,
it sounds arrogant,

1632
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:09,391
but I mean there's a lot of people out 
there that live in shitty neighborhoods 

1633
01:08:09,391 --> 01:08:09,710
and they have dumb friends and they 
don't have anybody to,

1634
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:14,800
to,
to really connect with where they feel 

1635
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:14,800
like,
you know,

1636
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,470
these people are also growing along with
them.

1637
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:16,130
Like they're all growing

1638
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:21,130
together.
It's a lot of people that don't have 

1639
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:21,130
that.
They just don't.

1640
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,990
It's not available.
So this podcast gives them an 

1641
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:26,450
alternative way to look at things,
gives them a way to see how all of us in

1642
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:31,451
our own lives are overcoming adversity 
and dealing with situations and being 

1643
01:08:31,451 --> 01:08:35,081
honest about ourselves and honest about 
our friends and honest about life and 

1644
01:08:35,081 --> 01:08:36,130
you know,
and that's inspires an ethic and that,

1645
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:38,600
that inspires other people to be 
likeminded.

1646
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,820
And that's where it helps.
It helps everybody.

1647
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:43,870
It doesn't just help like feel comedy 
clubs and you know,

1648
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:47,060
get people to buy your book or get 
people to come see you in Rochester.

1649
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,250
It also helps them,
you know,

1650
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,450
this shit all helps.
Everybody will tell you what,

1651
01:08:51,451 --> 01:08:54,980
when I really got into this and when I 
came on your podcast,

1652
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:56,900
as you know,
people always ask what?

1653
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:58,700
I'm going to come on your podcast for me
Bro.

1654
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,190
I've always hated radio.
If you've noticed on the road,

1655
01:09:01,191 --> 01:09:02,180
I don't show up.
Yeah,

1656
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:03,320
you don't get.
They don't like to do it.

1657
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,600
I don't want to hear that shit.
Well,

1658
01:09:04,601 --> 01:09:09,601
it's awesome.
I don't want to hear about you 

1659
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:09,601
promoting.
You don't want to hear about you talking

1660
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:10,610
and that's what the podcast avenue has 
done for all of us.

1661
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,550
That's why these people come here and do
well on your pocket.

1662
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,320
It lets people come up here and want to 
sell jokes.

1663
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:16,790
The date,
I don't want to sell rock,

1664
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:21,791
just myself.
The other place I came up here to open 

1665
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:21,791
up about what's on my mind today.
Well,

1666
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,440
weekly.
I don't come here.

1667
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,640
That's why I don't like doing this shit.
That's why they were doing radio.

1668
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:30,730
So tell us why you don't like flying.
And I got to go into a job like comics 

1669
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:30,730
unleashed.

1670
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:32,760
They'll fuck you.
So I want to be me dog.

1671
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,790
I want to talk about the loan shot I 
owed the.

1672
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,340
That was going to beat you.
That's what this entails.

1673
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:42,490
That's why I hate radio.
That's why I hate going down there with 

1674
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:42,710
these fucking fake MCS that try to be 
fucked up.

1675
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:46,970
Can you write down what we did was the 
last time I came here and fucking a lead

1676
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,980
and get the fuck out of my coming here.
It was from the heart and that's what a 

1677
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,991
podcast is and use it and your podcast 
will is people come up and they try to 

1678
01:09:55,991 --> 01:10:00,461
force the funding and the podcast don't 
work and you know the fucking fun and 

1679
01:10:00,461 --> 01:10:01,040
I'm the other end of it and the other 
end of it,

1680
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:06,070
I get emails and twitter messages and 
facebook messages from some really 

1681
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:08,100
fucking cool people.
Interesting people and you,

1682
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:13,101
you get,
you get something out of it when you 

1683
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:13,101
connect with them and we're all getting 
something out of.

1684
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:17,030
I was in San Diego of moon dog and the 
nicest guy in San Diego,

1685
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,000
art dot Com.
He drew a picture of Charles Bronson for

1686
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:23,030
me was to me in the mail.
This is fucking beautiful with him,

1687
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:28,031
with his hat and we've become friends 
like he shows up to the gigs of San 

1688
01:10:28,031 --> 01:10:28,280
Diego.
We smoked the bone.

1689
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:33,281
Oh Gee.
Last night was a lot and it was just 

1690
01:10:33,281 --> 01:10:33,281
great to connect with somebody.
I mean,

1691
01:10:33,281 --> 01:10:34,700
listen,
there's good and bad on par or whatever.

1692
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:36,200
It was pure.
Either be cute,

1693
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:38,330
dress on soldier,
but deep down inside,

1694
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:43,331
especially with the podcast,
I've always tried to put myself in this 

1695
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:46,511
way,
so if you don't like people Mcginn 

1696
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:46,511
fucking faggots.
Don't listen to me,

1697
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:47,480
don't talk to my fucking show.
This is what I did.

1698
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,550
This is who I am now,
let's work it out.

1699
01:10:49,551 --> 01:10:54,551
I go fuck yourself.
And a lot of people liked the honesty 

1700
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:54,551
and they come up.
You know what,

1701
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:54,840
if you come out,
I always talk to you.

1702
01:10:55,190 --> 01:11:00,190
I don't like smoking dope but everybody,
because next thing you know you're 

1703
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,630
writing your mind on the way home.
You smoke 80 joints body.

1704
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,910
But I like meeting people.
This is part of this fucking business.

1705
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:06,260
You know,
it's interesting.

1706
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,200
The connection between human beings is 
becoming,

1707
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,620
you know,
it's becoming more and more expansive.

1708
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,230
You know,
it's like,

1709
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,150
you

1710
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,290
know,
you have like a,

1711
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:20,291
a network of people that you interact 
with now and you could just develop a 

1712
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,500
really cool network and only be around 
really cool people for the most part.

1713
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,720
Like twitter.
Overwhelmingly,

1714
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,810
I've kind of like 280 something thousand
people on there now.

1715
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,120
Overwhelmingly Nice.
Overwhelmingly,

1716
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,520
it's very rare that someone will say 
something,

1717
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,050
do should you be on twitter when they 
do,

1718
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:36,030
you just block them and it you just 
click a link,

1719
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:41,031
a pink block.
It's really simple and then you don't 

1720
01:11:41,031 --> 01:11:43,311
have to deal with that guy anymore and 
then you're nice to everybody and 

1721
01:11:43,311 --> 01:11:44,010
they're nice to you and you try to 
fucking know have a little exchange.

1722
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:49,070
Every day.
People were sending me cool shit on 

1723
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:49,710
twitter every day,
some new fucking thing on the earthquake

1724
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:54,711
or a new video of a tsunami or new crazy
monkey that they found in Liberia or 

1725
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:55,890
whatever.

1726
01:11:55,890 --> 01:12:00,890
You know what I mean?
It's like every day there's some new 

1727
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:00,890
fascinating shit.
It's a network unlike any other.

1728
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:05,541
I've never.
There's never been a time where you had 

1729
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:06,630
so much access to interesting people and
information and ideas.

1730
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:07,270
Never.
You know,

1731
01:12:07,271 --> 01:12:12,271
when we were kids and we liked the band,
there was none of this from the album 

1732
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:15,510
covers and the sleeve of an album.
We paid for the tickets or one interview

1733
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:20,511
on television.
Nobody ever got this personal and is 

1734
01:12:20,511 --> 01:12:23,160
down and dirty with people now know this
is why I do these things.

1735
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:24,480
This is why I come up here with you 
guys.

1736
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,430
I do the podcast with.
They're not fake.

1737
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:30,320
That's why people love you too.
I mean that's why fake comedy guide dog.

1738
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,640
That's not my bag.
Oh Shit.

1739
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,600
We're up here talking about what's in my
heart and what's in my.

1740
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,470
By the way,
I was thinking of you guys today.

1741
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:42,500
Not in a sexual way.
I had a ticket that because I got home 

1742
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,161
late last night.
I went through the why this morning I 

1743
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,601
got home like I take it that when I was 
better I got like a Roddick and I want 

1744
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:51,480
to go back with that.
So I backed out but it was on my bed so 

1745
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:51,480
I couldn't come because if my wife would
go like,

1746
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,530
hey,
on my side of the bed.

1747
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:54,100
So I'm like,
what am I going to wipe the sweat?

1748
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:59,101
So I had a soccer.
I wanted to like pigeon pose and I took 

1749
01:12:59,101 --> 01:12:59,760
the sock off and just because I always 
hold the top of the egg roll.

1750
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:02,710
It doesn't slow me too.
He thinks that's crazy.

1751
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,470
He never heard that one of the pigeon 
pose.

1752
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:09,471
I hope you hold the top of the turtle 
neck so it doesn't blow up like a 

1753
01:13:09,471 --> 01:13:09,471
volcano.
Right.

1754
01:13:09,471 --> 01:13:10,350
And I just came into the sock but then 
it was fucked up.

1755
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:12,020
I took the sock on the floor and I woke 
up.

1756
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,530
I went to put it on a bucket shot would 
shit big.

1757
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:20,880
Both these a sock would come in and 
they'll sit there and go,

1758
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:26,080
Huh.
So you pinch it to like at the top and 

1759
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:26,080
keep it like a little pig.
Something like a Kiddie pool size?

1760
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,530
No,
it blow you're uncircumcised bolt,

1761
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,840
right?
Let's not just loads up and I just go 

1762
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,160
and it's like your spider man.
He didn't know he was.

1763
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:37,450
He's just been talking about being 
uncircumcised and trying to figure out.

1764
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,540
And it's like,
spoiler.

1765
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:43,140
No spoiler alert.
Disgusting People.

1766
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:49,380
Why do you.
Have you ever thought about maybe 

1767
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:49,380
getting it now?
Synthesize?

1768
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:49,380
Yeah,
yeah,

1769
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,050
yeah.
That's what I want to do it now.

1770
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:56,480
Thinking about getting my dick cut 50 
Brian actually at this point,

1771
01:13:56,971 --> 01:14:01,971
who gives a fuck?
It's supposed to feel better and then 

1772
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:01,971
you have the skin over it.
If I can feel great,

1773
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:03,510
if I had a boy bro,
I would absolutely not have them cut.

1774
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,760
Have you them six girls.
Most girls think it's disgusting.

1775
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:10,320
What the fuck them.
Tough Shit.

1776
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:13,120
Crazy bitches.
They're all crazy bitches.

1777
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:15,220
You're better off without them.
What might pick a swollen?

1778
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:20,230
Listen,
they're not going to see my dick when 

1779
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:21,571
it's dead.
They're going to see it in full effect 

1780
01:14:21,571 --> 01:14:21,571
and you just pulled the skin back and 
all they see is down with anyway.

1781
01:14:21,571 --> 01:14:22,820
Can you like tie it in and not or 
anything but like

1782
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,210
girl that used to fuck,
I forget her name,

1783
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,020
but she used to hang out with one of the
girls at the comedy store and she was.

1784
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:33,320
She was having a dilemma because she was
dating a guy at first for the first time

1785
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:36,050
was uncircumcised and she didn't like 
the way it felt in her mouth.

1786
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:39,730
She was drinking and she was telling 
everybody I just,

1787
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,890
I really like them but just don't.
It feels like like skin and

1788
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,800
it probably feels like those little 
rubber things mended.

1789
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,550
Those things that you try to hold,
but you can't hold it.

1790
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,440
It's like a little rubber thing filled 
with water.

1791
01:14:51,441 --> 01:14:53,670
It's like a toy in.
Nevermind.

1792
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:57,680
No.
You would have known what it was,

1793
01:14:57,681 --> 01:15:00,470
so you really would cut your Dick just 
so girls would like it.

1794
01:15:00,471 --> 01:15:04,400
Like what if you were uncircumcised?
Just gross looking.

1795
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,790
I think it's dirty.
I think it's pick one.

1796
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,800
A condom on it.
That's exactly what your take is 

1797
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,210
cleaner.
It's not the fuck you talking about.

1798
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:19,300
There's more.
You have more disease when you have so 

1799
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:22,390
much propaganda used.
Guilty motherfucking.

1800
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,140
If you fuck a chicken and what it looks 
like.

1801
01:15:24,141 --> 01:15:26,300
An elephant trunk.
That's what that song.

1802
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:26,750
Evil Boys.

1803
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,960
Yeah.
Eva Boys about.

1804
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:34,230
They want to like.
There's a tradition when they come on 

1805
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,891
man,
they go and circumcise him with a 

1806
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:36,891
fucking rusty knife out in the woods.
That's why I was like,

1807
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:38,800
you know my,
my Dick's only for penis.

1808
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:40,480
Penis.
Brother is only for girls.

1809
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:43,120
It's not for men know.
What's this?

1810
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,150
Beaver boy,
he circumcised dee aunt word.

1811
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,810
It's a.
it's a great fucking song put.

1812
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,140
Please pull it up.
Pull it up.

1813
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:55,140
No,
I don't want to hear that shit right 

1814
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:55,140
now.
Let's do.

1815
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:55,140
I want to hear it.
It's good.

1816
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,560
It's good goddamn song,
but it's about.

1817
01:15:56,561 --> 01:15:59,230
We're talking about traditions of 
cutting people's skins off their dick.

1818
01:15:59,231 --> 01:16:00,580
It's ridiculous.
It's stupid.

1819
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:02,380
Did you notice like throughout that 
song,

1820
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:04,240
there's a lot of references to south 
park.

1821
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,870
What cows?
Mom's a big fat bitch.

1822
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,230
Is that what it is that who it is?
Cut.

1823
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:14,900
It's Kyle's mom.
Mom's a big fat because that's what I'm.

1824
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,530
Carmen would say.
Wow.

1825
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:21,070
I didn't think of that.
I didn't even realize that.

1826
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,840
I thought she was talking about someone 
she knew.

1827
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:26,020
That's what I thought too,
but it's a south park thing.

1828
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:27,820
See,
look at that.

1829
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:30,760
Kids growing up in South Africa,
getting some South Park influence.

1830
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,890
Yeah.
It's weird.

1831
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,660
That is funny though.
Yeah.

1832
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,660
South Park.
Just to get the most reach ever.

1833
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,350
There's never been a show like that 
before.

1834
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,200
It's been on for this many years.
It's still good.

1835
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:42,910
Do you ever watch it,
Joey?

1836
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,840
It's frustrating.

1837
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:45,260
I'll watch it,
but I'm an adult.

1838
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,760
We're like family guy.
I like family guy from time to time,

1839
01:16:49,761 --> 01:16:53,300
but that won't sit there and you like 
family guy,

1840
01:16:53,301 --> 01:16:54,830
but you won't watch South Park to have 
a.

1841
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:56,210
Why am I mean?
It's not that like it.

1842
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,240
It's that I watch it.
If I got 10 minutes.

1843
01:16:58,270 --> 01:16:59,940
Did you see team America?
No.

1844
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:04,000
You did on Bro.
I wish I could do that.

1845
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,090
Guys.
I wish we could do that.

1846
01:17:05,091 --> 01:17:08,090
Erase movies through your head so you 
can rewatch it again.

1847
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,400
Yeah.
Wow.

1848
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,020
Interesting.
How

1849
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,520
my mom died when I was 14.
I became a magnet for.

1850
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,780
There was no fucking game stuff.
I don't even play.

1851
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:19,781
I played monopoly two weeks ago.
We were talking to the guys pot all day 

1852
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:19,860
in place of his cat.
Listen to.

1853
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,410
He's talking about he's a navy seal.
His mouth.

1854
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:27,450
I crawl into the desert.
I've never played games playing fucking 

1855
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:27,450
cards.
Okay.

1856
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:32,370
I don't have that time,
that luxury that you can play pool my 

1857
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:36,630
mom's bar and that was there.
That's how I babysat myself by playing 

1858
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:40,180
pool,
but I've never been a cartoon guy like 

1859
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:40,180
Popeye dog pain,
you know,

1860
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,800
we grow up eventually and you know,
you move on,

1861
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:45,170
it's cute ad,
but you got to go out.

1862
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,270
It's a man's world.
Like James Brown said,

1863
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,140
you know what I'm saying,
Doug?

1864
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:51,080
And that's why I'm happy about going to 
New York in the next four days.

1865
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,020
I'm going to hang out with men for a 
couple of fucking days.

1866
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:57,040
You guys are going to die on the 
twitters.

1867
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,090
There ain't none of that shit.
I'm gonna go hang out with my buddies.

1868
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,670
Like grew up with a couple of days to 
different place over there.

1869
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:07,140
You know,
you really realize that once you've 

1870
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:08,921
lived here for a few years and you know,
after a while you get comfortable with 

1871
01:18:08,921 --> 01:18:12,311
wherever the fuck you are.
But there's a different thing over 

1872
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:14,381
there.
Just just as many Douche bags over here 

1873
01:18:14,381 --> 01:18:14,390
as over there,
but they pretend to be nicer over here.

1874
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:19,810
Listen Bro,
I got my people that I've known since I 

1875
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:22,001
was a fucking kid that was in trouble.
Those are the people I hang out with 40 

1876
01:18:22,001 --> 01:18:22,490
years later.
I trust those people.

1877
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:25,520
What do you think it is though,
about people over there where there's,

1878
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:30,521
you know,
everybody always uses the cliche or 

1879
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:30,521
they're real.

1880
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:30,521
People on the east coast are real.
What the.

1881
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:30,521
What is that?
Is the weather.

1882
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:31,610
The weather.
Make them do that.

1883
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:34,130
Is it people are real or fake?
Fucking everywhere.

1884
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,400
I got fake motherfucking friends here.
Sure.

1885
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,650
I got motherfuckers will get stabbed for
me here too when I got back home.

1886
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,150
Right.
But Dude,

1887
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,360
don't you think the high percentage is 
higher in New York of real people?

1888
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,890
Because I do.
I think they're,

1889
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,000
yeah.
I think there's more real people in the 

1890
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,740
east coast than there are here.
I think there's a lot of silly,

1891
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,740
goofy Fox come out here from these 
coasts.

1892
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:56,590
There's a lot of that.
These are the creative artsy.

1893
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:02,020
Yeah,
but I mean there's a lot of real people 

1894
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,401
here too.
I'm saying it's not like it's a 

1895
01:19:03,401 --> 01:19:03,810
generalizations like it's not like it's 
like one side is really in.

1896
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:05,210
People always try to play that card.

1897
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,100
East Coast is real.
West Coast is Craig now.

1898
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:09,410
There's plenty of real people on the 
west coast too,

1899
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:14,650
but I think to Senate Manhattan,
there's tons of little cuts and men and 

1900
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,310
men of course.
It's just like the sunset bullshit.

1901
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,010
Little young kids drinking water trick 
of five hour energy.

1902
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,230
Still dudes living in Jersey.
This.

1903
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:24,170
I know what you're saying.
There's still ice think long island.

1904
01:19:24,171 --> 01:19:28,370
I think if you add it all up,
there's still more others on the suburbs

1905
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:30,560
is a ton of shit.
I thought I grew up with my buddies.

1906
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:35,561
I love my buddies.
They were there for me when I needed 

1907
01:19:35,561 --> 01:19:35,561
them the most and they're still fucking 
there.

1908
01:19:35,561 --> 01:19:38,450
You follow me on hold for five days to 
smoke some dope.

1909
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:41,320
I already fluent over there.
It's flown over there.

1910
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:46,540
They got an ounce of earthquake and 
announced the fucking moon rocks over 

1911
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,270
there and I'm taking a sour diesel and 
man I got.

1912
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,580
I got a sativa now at the fucking.
Oh,

1913
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:52,290
an OCC.
They got a got a deer.

1914
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:54,710
Sour diesel.
That's so fucking strong dog.

1915
01:19:55,250 --> 01:20:00,250
So I'm just going back to smoke dope.
Are you worried at all about all this 

1916
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:00,250
shit?
That's happening.

1917
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:05,230
Are you worried at all?
But all these fucking people in the 

1918
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:05,230
Middle East are trying to overthrow 
their government,

1919
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,580
all these different countries at a fight
mile.

1920
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:11,600
Where are we doing fucking 12 or is it 
really of the world is not coming.

1921
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,810
Two thousand 12 is this and all this 
shit's going to go somewhere.

1922
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,690
This radiation is going to leak.
Are these people going to fucking go?

1923
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:23,160
What's this is all about adjustment.
What's our next fucking mood now I 2:12.

1924
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,800
We might not be able to drink a water 
ever again.

1925
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,880
The something.
Something's got to work.

1926
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,570
You know,
we might not be.

1927
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,460
What's going to happen there?
We're going to have to all drink bottled

1928
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,970
water and half of the ocean is 
contaminated with oil.

1929
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,090
Yeah.
You take your shower.

1930
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,150
Japan should do it.
You should just have it.

1931
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:38,370
Have a room

1932
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,660
where you just get a couple of extra 
bottles like arrowhead every week,

1933
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,360
you know,
and just,

1934
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:44,720
you know,
if,

1935
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,540
if something really bad happens,
you gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

1936
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:48,290
You know,
that's,

1937
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:53,291
that's the reality.
The reality is California is massively 

1938
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:56,430
overpopulated and everyone is playing 
musical chairs and everyone is hoping 

1939
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:57,440
that that fucking music doesn't stop on 
their watch.

1940
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:01,210
They're hoping that somehow or another 
there are safely in the backyard,

1941
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,230
not near any trees.
When the shit hits the fan,

1942
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,600
you know,
just taking a guess.

1943
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,260
Just hoping.
Well,

1944
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,150
nothing's happened since [inaudible] 94.
Yeah,

1945
01:21:08,151 --> 01:21:10,370
but if you look over the course of human
history,

1946
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:15,400
94 is a blink of an eye.
If you look over the course of the 

1947
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,670
history of the world,
it's not even that there's a lot of shit

1948
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,470
that's going to happen to this place.
This did not,

1949
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:19,790
was not shaped like this.

1950
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,800
When you look out the window and you see
those mountains,

1951
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:25,100
those didn't just.
They weren't like made with a mold.

1952
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:30,290
Right?
That's the lava and the fucking ground 

1953
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:32,711
moving and the tectonic plates shifting 
and you know there's a reason why it's 

1954
01:21:32,711 --> 01:21:35,150
12,000
feet above sea level.

1955
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:40,300
That shit rocketed over the course of 
who knows how long the changes and we 

1956
01:21:40,821 --> 01:21:43,760
know that the entire earth supposedly 
had one content.

1957
01:21:43,761 --> 01:21:47,090
That's the whole pangea theory that 
there was one content and they split up,

1958
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,950
you know,
because of all sorts of different events

1959
01:21:48,951 --> 01:21:52,610
and became Africa and North America and 
some shit's happening.

1960
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:56,000
We just got through offer rotation a 
little bit from that earthquake.

1961
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,430
The fuck is that going to Japan?
They fit.

1962
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:03,580
Yeah.
The shore moved eight feet by eight 

1963
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,160
feet.
There's a divide somewhere out there.

1964
01:22:04,161 --> 01:22:07,910
They said it's 270 miles long and 50 
miles wide.

1965
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,030
Where were the actual epicenter of the 
earthquake was like what?

1966
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:17,040
What happened was beyond our 
comprehension and yet still nothing in 

1967
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,470
comparison to shit that's happened 
before.

1968
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:20,330
You know,
they still don't know what the fuck stop

1969
01:22:20,331 --> 01:22:23,330
the Ice Age.
The Ice Age was just 10,000

1970
01:22:23,331 --> 01:22:24,890
years ago,
which is nothing.

1971
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:30,040
Ten thousand years ago,
most of North America was under a mile 

1972
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,120
high sheet of ice.
Wrap your fucking head around that.

1973
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:35,930
Canada ice.
All the fucking North Dakota south.

1974
01:22:35,931 --> 01:22:40,931
That shit was a mile high of ice.
Woolly mammoths were running around 

1975
01:22:40,931 --> 01:22:43,790
saber tooth tigers and shit.
It was a totally different world.

1976
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,260
Just 10,000
years ago.

1977
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:49,070
What that global warming because of 
humans,

1978
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:49,890
you know what,
what,

1979
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:54,891
what caused that?
What caused that radical change in the 

1980
01:22:54,891 --> 01:22:55,090
atmosphere?
They don't know what if it just keeps on

1981
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,000
getting hotter and hotter and it turns 
into a sun.

1982
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:59,780
Like the sun was like the last earth.
That stupid.

1983
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:05,290
They know more than that.
It's just like shit that you would say 

1984
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,070
when you were 14 before

1985
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:11,070
you even went to any science classes 
with the earth comes like a person who 

1986
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,560
says say,
stop polluting my water.

1987
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:18,470
It doesn't take a fucking genius to tell
you that is either here or Seattle,

1988
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:20,130
Oregon.
Yeah.

1989
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,440
Fucking genius.
You know this whole,

1990
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,810
this whole west coast,
all we could do is pray for Vancouver.

1991
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,250
It could be vocal.
You bitches.

1992
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:32,251
What iphone is?
You better make sure that shift hooks 

1993
01:23:32,251 --> 01:23:32,251
up.
Leslie,

1994
01:23:32,251 --> 01:23:32,251
have you got an APP for your fucking 
earthquake?

1995
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,890
Right.
Great.

1996
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,960
Absolutely.
Tell you where the earthquakes are.

1997
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:40,570
Great maps.
It has no patient notification with half

1998
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,450
and what it's going to be here like 10 
minutes before Claudia.

1999
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:45,010
Right?
Because that's the fucking app I need.

2000
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:50,040
Well I need to get a dog.
You need to get a dog sit really close 

2001
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,190
to a fucking treach yet ultimately,
what can we do though?

2002
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:51,840
What can we do?

2003
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,620
Do we escape?
How do we live like,

2004
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:56,380
like survivalists and moved to the 
fucking mojave and,

2005
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,310
and,
and you know,

2006
01:23:57,311 --> 01:23:59,620
by space and one of those underground 
bunkers that you can,

2007
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,760
you know,
you want to get probably go to the 

2008
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,680
middle of the country taxes Austin,
Texas.

2009
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:10,740
Well,
what if that's where the fucking 

2010
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:11,970
asteroid hits one thing about Texas,
you know they're going to go down 

2011
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:12,160
swinging.
Yeah.

2012
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:17,720
Down that the Mexicans were going down.
So I like Texas and I like Austin.

2013
01:24:19,511 --> 01:24:24,511
I would totally be down with taxes.
If they could just do something about 

2014
01:24:24,511 --> 01:24:26,761
their fucking weed laws that we'd lost.
And yet we don't get this.

2015
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,730
Trust me,
you don't get the same we'd,

2016
01:24:30,731 --> 01:24:32,380
I've friends in our days.
You do?

2017
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,190
No,
you don't.

2018
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,710
You can't get sativas Brown.
Not The shit.

2019
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:42,980
It ain't easy bro.
It ain't easy and it's not the same 

2020
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:47,341
yield.
Like the reason why people grow sativas 

2021
01:24:47,341 --> 01:24:49,701
is because there's a bunch of people 
here are kind of sewers and that's what 

2022
01:24:49,701 --> 01:24:49,701
they want and the people that have grown
at one,

2023
01:24:49,701 --> 01:24:50,830
but the people that are just looking to 
make money,

2024
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:53,780
it takes more time to grow sativas and 
it does indiegogo.

2025
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,500
They have to be grown indoors.
You can grow them outdoors here.

2026
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:56,780
Yeah,
I know,

2027
01:24:56,790 --> 01:25:01,430
but there's weed snobs in Texas.
I'm sure there are easy to find and that

2028
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:04,580
I get up at 7:30
in the morning and go buy a bag of dope.

2029
01:25:04,581 --> 01:25:06,830
One of the attorney and the construction
work to people.

2030
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,410
That's the question.
Hey,

2031
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,440
you know what?
As long as nobody else to find more 

2032
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:13,440
weed,
no,

2033
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:13,720
I'm going to wait.
No,

2034
01:25:13,721 --> 01:25:18,721
you're wrong Brian,
because you got to deal with drug 

2035
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:20,731
dealers.
You got to deal with people that are 

2036
01:25:20,731 --> 01:25:22,321
willing to go to jail because they're 
selling weed and that's the reality of 

2037
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:22,321
the situation.
Ninety nine percent,

2038
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:26,260
that's what we work on yet,
but it ain't as good as what we've got.

2039
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:30,520
Now.
If you want to live in Texas,

2040
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:31,330
you can live in Texas.

2041
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:38,880
You could figure out a way to tell us 
about where the fuck I lived in control 

2042
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:38,880
weed.
I'm telling you.

2043
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,700
Do you hire some kid who's like a 
fucking buy a big house and growth a 

2044
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:48,871
couple plants,
but you hire some kid is like a PA on a 

2045
01:25:48,871 --> 01:25:48,871
set.
He'll listen buddy.

2046
01:25:48,871 --> 01:25:50,230
You wanna make a quick thousand bucks 
and you give them $5,000

2047
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,900
a week to take him to his body and you 
put them on a greyhound bus.

2048
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,790
I used to.
I mean I used to grow in my,

2049
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,540
in my closet in Ohio and you know,
and it was great.

2050
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:00,610
It was awesome.
We'd awesome.

2051
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:05,680
See,
I've always been a real motherfucking 

2052
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:05,680
head since day one guys.

2053
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,790
So the people I ran with were real heads
and we attract each other.

2054
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:10,810
When I live in Colorado,
I some of the wildest fucking weed I got

2055
01:26:10,811 --> 01:26:12,800
gotten aspen to that high altitude in 
boulder,

2056
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,720
but the people I ran with our heads,
people who understand that concierge,

2057
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,160
likeminded people will find.
Like when I find people,

2058
01:26:19,161 --> 01:26:21,020
I can tell when somebody's a 
professional,

2059
01:26:21,021 --> 01:26:26,021
I can tell a fucking amateur and when 
you run it through a professional pot 

2060
01:26:26,021 --> 01:26:29,341
smoker just to look as good as a wink,
do a blind or they just give you that 

2061
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:29,520
look,
a real weed guy,

2062
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:31,130
a pull you over like I did with that 
dude.

2063
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,460
I didn't know this motherfucker.
I didn't know,

2064
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:35,070
but that's a nigger.
I fucking man.

2065
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:40,390
I said to him,
you look how you look like this might 

2066
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,390
have looked at me like I was a fucking 
genius.

2067
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:41,050
He's like,
you know,

2068
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,610
I left it on the dresser right there.
I went in my pocket.

2069
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:46,340
Game of butter.
We a professor would say,

2070
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,530
did you take this out of your boss?
Oh my God.

2071
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,490
He's a professional.

2072
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,450
I used to.
True.

2073
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,550
You check it.
Believe it came out of your book.

2074
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:00,260
No fractional pot smoker or looking at.
But in Ohio and go,

2075
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:02,890
you're a bad motherfucker.
Guns.

2076
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,560
We don't think.
Joey,

2077
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:11,050
I don't think I'm a professional plasma.
This is 30 years ago.

2078
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,650
This is 30.
I got news for you.

2079
01:27:12,651 --> 01:27:14,840
If you pulled the bed out of your balls,
I've been like,

2080
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,130
no,
you smoke weed for.

2081
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:23,000
That was in my fucking deal.
That's a professional though.

2082
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,530
I don't play that stupid nonsense 
shared.

2083
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:27,320
Imagine showing coming.
I could.

2084
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:29,300
You really don't imagine joey coming up 
to you and go,

2085
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:31,590
whoa guys.
I got some weed in my bars.

2086
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:36,420
I don't say that when you're in an 
airport and you're waiting to go outside

2087
01:27:36,421 --> 01:27:41,421
and get some and you're a professional 
you for fucking three hours and then 

2088
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:47,050
trust me bro.
A professional will never let you leave 

2089
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:47,050
the house without.
We've,

2090
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:49,070
there's things professionals do dog that
they know.

2091
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,780
You call it professor two in the 
morning.

2092
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,880
I can't sleep.
They'll say,

2093
01:27:52,881 --> 01:27:57,881
come over here and get high with you.
They will not answer the fucking phone 

2094
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:58,030
professionals or different to you.
Um,

2095
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,560
to take days off.
Every once in a while,

2096
01:28:00,561 --> 01:28:02,540
like Sundays or Saturday,
I'll take it off.

2097
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:05,030
Take the whole day off.
How do you feel when you saw her?

2098
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,120
Like a fucking,
like,

2099
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:09,260
I can't put.
I can't focus.

2100
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,240
I'm walking around confused now.

2101
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:16,450
I've got to be honest.
It's kind of Nice to take a couple of 

2102
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:16,450
days off.
Yeah.

2103
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:16,450
Yeah.
It's Kinda Nice.

2104
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:19,120
I take many days off in a row,
but I still like getting high at night,

2105
01:28:19,121 --> 01:28:21,640
like sometimes at night just to sizzle 
it,

2106
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,720
you know,
when I don't take off when I'm writing,

2107
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:28,870
I don't write.
I write hi everybody got to ride high 

2108
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:28,870
because I ran my.
Every time I get goofy.

2109
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,130
Well I don't.
I mean I do read high.

2110
01:28:30,131 --> 01:28:35,131
I mean I do write sober sometimes,
especially when I wake up in the 

2111
01:28:35,131 --> 01:28:37,451
morning.
A lot of times I do revisions on things 

2112
01:28:37,451 --> 01:28:37,451
and I like to review it for a bunch of 
different states,

2113
01:28:37,451 --> 01:28:38,690
but when I write,
hi man,

2114
01:28:38,691 --> 01:28:41,510
it's like a symphony playing in my mind,
you know?

2115
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:44,480
It's like there's music,
then music comes through these words and

2116
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:49,481
there's lights and and fucking there's 
dancing going on in my head when I'm 

2117
01:28:49,481 --> 01:28:49,481
high.

2118
01:28:49,481 --> 01:28:51,080
There's a lot of shit happening when I'm
sober.

2119
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:56,081
I'm like slowly piecing it together.
It's like the difference between typing 

2120
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,050
with your fingers when you don't know 
how to type.

2121
01:28:57,180 --> 01:29:01,590
When you're just using your index finger
and you're going t age a,

2122
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,390
W,
n when you can type,

2123
01:29:03,391 --> 01:29:04,830
when you don't even have to look,
you know,

2124
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:06,840
like right now I can type.
I don't have to look at the keys.

2125
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:11,841
I know how to type,
especially if I get loose and get 

2126
01:29:11,841 --> 01:29:11,841
relaxed.
Is that much of a difference?

2127
01:29:11,841 --> 01:29:16,160
It's like good flows.
It's like it connects you to whatever 

2128
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:16,380
the fuck it is,
whatever we're.

2129
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:18,820
Whatever it is that makes you creative,
it connects you to it.

2130
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:24,940
Blanket.
I like to be stone when I write the one 

2131
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:24,940
man,
Charlotte,

2132
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:24,940
to be a little district side.

2133
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,200
Really?
Are you still writing the.

2134
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,070
You did that a bunch?

2135
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:29,270
No,
this is completely.

2136
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:34,330
This is the real deal.
This is from the time I came from Cuba 

2137
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:34,330
to me.
Finally,

2138
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,930
and this is a new one that you're doing.
I'm doing the workshop April 20th.

2139
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:40,950
I got to Hollywood and I got a producer 
to put some money up and do it like in 

2140
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:41,560
Hollywood.
Nice.

2141
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:43,700
I'm going to really wrap the Houseman 
April 20th.

2142
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:45,920
It's a Thursday night.
And where's it at again?

2143
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:46,720
It's,
it's a.

2144
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,330
it's something to do that this theater 
in Lankershim just for 40 people,

2145
01:29:50,331 --> 01:29:55,331
you know,
just to get the writing down and have 

2146
01:29:55,331 --> 01:29:55,331
people make notes to say Joe.
Yeah.

2147
01:29:55,331 --> 01:29:56,450
Like this way,
like this,

2148
01:29:56,451 --> 01:29:57,160
you know.
Uh,

2149
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:58,760
April 20th.
Is that what you said?

2150
01:29:58,761 --> 01:30:01,160
It's a Thursday night I think,
or 20 baby.

2151
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:04,550
So Wednesday night.
So now for the 21st 21st.

2152
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,390
Yeah,
Thursday night,

2153
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,080
yeah.
Okay.

2154
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,570
Well I'm going to go there that,
you know,

2155
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:13,571
it's really weird when.
And that's what I do when I'm having a 

2156
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:14,210
hard time writing comedy.
I ranked a one man show and I get myself

2157
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:15,210
in a different state.
Like it's,

2158
01:30:15,211 --> 01:30:18,080
it's the one man shows a little sad.
It's about my,

2159
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,210
you know what I'm saying?
It's about what was going up as a kid.

2160
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:24,710
So you try to find the humor in it and 
sometimes it's pretty fucking cool.

2161
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:27,110
Dude is another quake that just hit 
Chile.

2162
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,560
There you go.
Bitches number

2163
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:31,300
Santiago and Santiago Chile weight 
number.

2164
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:33,040
I Dunno,
I dunno.

2165
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:38,130
Can I just say yesterday that said that 
some guy predicted a from some weather 

2166
01:30:38,631 --> 01:30:43,631
thing,
but it was going to either be on the 

2167
01:30:43,631 --> 01:30:43,631
16th or the 17th,
it's going to be another earthquake.

2168
01:30:43,631 --> 01:30:45,350
So he was money.
He was fucking Melissa's.

2169
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,490
Another earthquake was definitely gonna 
Happen on the 16th.

2170
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,470
Today is the motherfucking 16th.

2171
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:55,840
This fucking this thing in Japan with 
this nuclear reactor is freaking me out,

2172
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,010
you know,
and we're,

2173
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,940
here's what's freaking me out that they 
didn't know what to do.

2174
01:31:00,941 --> 01:31:05,941
If the power went off,
they had like eight hours of backup and 

2175
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:05,941
then they,
the.

2176
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:09,010
It starts a meltdown because they can't 
call the rods,

2177
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,730
so they're pumping ocean water onto the 
rod to try to cool them off.

2178
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:18,360
I can't believe that this is.
This is how they design these things 

2179
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,020
that you're living in a place where 
earthquakes happen all the time.

2180
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:25,230
Now if an earthquake happens and the 
power goes out and if something goes 

2181
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:25,230
wrong,
you can't.

2182
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:30,060
You don't have a way to cool this 
fucking thing in the ocean water work 

2183
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:30,060
though.
No,

2184
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:30,700
not really.
I mean it's doing okay.

2185
01:31:30,701 --> 01:31:35,701
It's keeping it,
keeping it from fucking exploding and 

2186
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:38,641
blowing a hole through the earth.
What they're doing right now is real 

2187
01:31:38,641 --> 01:31:41,260
dangerous because all this shit is going
to get into the atmosphere.

2188
01:31:41,261 --> 01:31:43,390
All this radiation,
they can't really contain.

2189
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,800
I mean,
unless they're gonna,

2190
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:49,830
figure out a way to drop some sort of a 
gigantic dome over the whole area and 

2191
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:50,560
seal it off.
You know,

2192
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:53,440
a giant led dome.
How the fuck are they going to stop this

2193
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:55,120
radiation from getting out into the 
atmosphere?

2194
01:31:55,300 --> 01:32:00,300
Worst thing that.
What's the worst case scenario you're 

2195
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:00,300
looking at?

2196
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,710
And another dude they're talking about,
see they tried to downplay it at first 

2197
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:04,810
saying that it's going to be fine,
but now there's on CNN,

2198
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:09,811
there's a new official report and this 
guy says that spent fuel rods are 

2199
01:32:09,811 --> 01:32:10,540
exposed,
is heightened concerns,

2200
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:14,290
so spent fuel rods and unifor of Japan's
stricken food.

2201
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:18,850
Fukushima nuclear power plant have been 
exposed,

2202
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:22,150
resulting in the emission of extremely 
high levels of radiation.

2203
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,390
The head of the wild,
the nuclear regulatory commission set on

2204
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:27,370
Wednesday,
this is the fucking dangerous shit man.

2205
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,830
And what's scary is we have these things
all over the place.

2206
01:32:29,831 --> 01:32:31,510
There's like 150 of these in this 
country.

2207
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:32,790
You know,

2208
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:36,330
maybe it will morph,
like get into the human.

2209
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:41,740
I don't know.
Like do you see the map of the 

2210
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:41,740
radiation?
Like it's going to hit California.

2211
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:44,560
I don't know if that was legit,
legit going to hit California saying,

2212
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,870
oh,
well how do you know our ways?

2213
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:47,430
Does that map real?
Really?

2214
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:48,630
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

2215
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,660
I Dunno how it carries now.
What direction is like,

2216
01:32:51,661 --> 01:32:56,661
you know,
what's sad about Japan that they have 

2217
01:32:56,661 --> 01:32:56,661
that,
that place called Oakland our where it's

2218
01:32:56,661 --> 01:33:01,461
beautiful.
It's the place in the earth where the 

2219
01:33:01,461 --> 01:33:02,820
people lived the longest will inflate 
their 100 and something that they.

2220
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:05,460
That's where that coral calcium fad came
from.

2221
01:33:05,461 --> 01:33:06,320
Rent.
They don't take it.

2222
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:08,730
They don't know if it's the fish.
Don't know if it's the island.

2223
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:14,250
You know,
it just kills me that that's the end of 

2224
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,360
that fucking party.
That's it.

2225
01:33:15,361 --> 01:33:20,010
That's all going to be contaminated.
The radiation's gonna Make A.

2226
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,520
Yeah.
What is gonna Happen?

2227
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:22,110
I mean,
see,

2228
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,040
that's the crazy thing about nuclear 
powers.

2229
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:24,650
Like,
yeah,

2230
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,110
it works great,
you know,

2231
01:33:26,111 --> 01:33:31,111
and it's better than coal because coal 
totally fucks up the atmosphere and 

2232
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:31,690
creates greenhouse gases and all that 
shit.

2233
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:35,320
But man,
when nuclear goes bad it goes bad.

2234
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,680
I mean this is the idea behind is so 
crazy.

2235
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,480
You know what nuclear powers,
I mean,

2236
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:45,010
you're harnessing the very power that 
like the very thing that makes sons,

2237
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,980
the very power of the sons is it's all 
atomic.

2238
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:53,410
There's,
that's you're dealing with shit that we 

2239
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:56,461
don't totally have control over yet.
We have control over for periods of 

2240
01:33:56,461 --> 01:34:00,571
time,
but the bottom line about nuclear power 

2241
01:34:00,571 --> 01:34:03,301
is no matter what you do,
you've got nuclear waste and you've got 

2242
01:34:03,301 --> 01:34:05,350
nuclear waste that's going to be around 
for you.

2243
01:34:05,351 --> 01:34:06,730
GotTa.
Figure out a place to put it.

2244
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:08,370
You know what I mean?
That's what they do in,

2245
01:34:08,371 --> 01:34:09,840
in Nevada,
like all these,

2246
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:13,600
there's always like the disputes and 
debates about where to put this shit.

2247
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:17,560
That's one of the reasons why Nevada got
gambling or the Vata was allowed to have

2248
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:22,561
casinos.
They let them blow bombs off in the 

2249
01:34:22,561 --> 01:34:23,080
fucking desert.
Shit,

2250
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:24,670
let's move.
Here's the thing,

2251
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:28,720
men move to where when you get a bunch 
of million people like we have an la,

2252
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:32,110
20 million people will fuck man,
how are you going to power everything?

2253
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,210
You had a lot of refrigerators going on,
man.

2254
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:36,700
You got a lot of gas machines pumping 
gas.

2255
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,830
You get a lot of trucks that have to 
drop off that cash.

2256
01:34:38,831 --> 01:34:40,360
You had a lot of shit happening,
man.

2257
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:43,050
Do people start leaving here?
If something bad does happen,

2258
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:48,940
oh my God,
it's impossible bro.

2259
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:51,000
We would all have to just walk out of 
here.

2260
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:56,120
It would take days of bumper to bumper 
traffic to clear out la days and days 

2261
01:34:56,120 --> 01:35:00,951
and no work.
No one to be able to go far but all get 

2262
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:01,060
stuck in the desert and cars will be 
broken down.

2263
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:06,080
People would be screaming,
let me in your car and your car can be 

2264
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:06,320
some Zombie Shit Bro.
It would be some Zombie Shit.

2265
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:08,840
Shit.
It's really possible,

2266
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:10,190
man.
It's really possible.

2267
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,150
Our society's incredibly fragile and 
we're starting to see it.

2268
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:19,151
It's like this seems like a weird thing 
that's happening because like everyday 

2269
01:35:19,151 --> 01:35:20,150
things you see,
keep getting weirder and weirder.

2270
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:25,300
It really does seem like we're in a 
movie now like this Charlie Sheen thing 

2271
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,820
happens and even the Kim Kardashian 
thing and it all seemed so surreal.

2272
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:31,610
And then as all this is going on,
earthquake in Chile,

2273
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:36,640
earthquake in New Zealand,
floods in Australia and it's just 

2274
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:36,640
constantly happening.

2275
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,120
A million people dying with the fish 
die.

2276
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:42,350
Whether was was this piss test that 
that's that.

2277
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:45,000
The Algal Silva fuck that earthquake and
Chili's.

2278
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,030
I have five point three that's bolted.
Earthquake.

2279
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:50,880
It's still an earthquake every day.
I'm a map.

2280
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:55,960
It's a five point three eight and I'm 
scared.

2281
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,950
So Joey Diaz is going to be in New York 
this weekend for no bullshit,

2282
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:01,030
but we'll say there's a big difference.
Tumbled.

2283
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:04,460
Tell him what you were saying the there,
but northridge that the five point four.

2284
01:36:04,461 --> 01:36:06,710
What's the tipping point for every 
point?

2285
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:09,790
Is 100 percent stronger than the 
proceeding point?

2286
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:14,630
So five point one is 100 percent 
stronger than a five point zero.

2287
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:20,080
That is crazy.
Now the crazy one is the one in Alaska 

2288
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,920
apparently that happened in the sixties.
I think it was.

2289
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:25,310
I think it was 65.
It was a nine point two,

2290
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:30,880
nine point one.
One hundred percent stronger than the 

2291
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,460
one in Japan and it was 100 percent 
stronger than that.

2292
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:31,920
Wow.

2293
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:38,180
Nine point two for four fucking minutes.
That shit rock.

2294
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:40,700
Apparently you could.
You could feel it in San Francisco.

2295
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:45,850
That's if,
if right now would have to happen in 

2296
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:48,161
Japan.
If you hold today at a five point three 

2297
01:36:48,161 --> 01:36:48,161
earthquake,
you think it's the end?

2298
01:36:48,161 --> 01:36:51,110
Just when you think to like,
fuck it.

2299
01:36:51,111 --> 01:36:53,310
I just get to my hands and knees and say
a prayer.

2300
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,840
I get the fuck out of my house.
I run right people.

2301
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:58,100
Chili.
What they were thinking.

2302
01:36:58,101 --> 01:37:00,380
Five point.
This is the beginning of the year again.

2303
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:01,850
They just got here a year and a half 
ago.

2304
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:04,100
Not even.
And you know guys.

2305
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,830
The reality is that this is not the big 
concern.

2306
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:10,640
This is one small minor thing that you 
can avoid by not living on a fault line.

2307
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:13,880
The real concern is super volcanoes and 
asteroids.

2308
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:19,030
Those are the real concerns because 
there's hundreds of thousands of rocks 

2309
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:23,651
out there in space that can fuck up 
everything and they're flying around and

2310
01:37:23,901 --> 01:37:28,901
every now and then they collide with one
another and one of them gets hurled 

2311
01:37:28,901 --> 01:37:29,390
towards earth and it slams in and that's
a wrap.

2312
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:32,510
That's a wrap for this life.
That's a wrap for this generation.

2313
01:37:32,511 --> 01:37:34,880
That's a wrap for this developmental 
cycle of,

2314
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:37,730
of biological matter.
It's all going to have to regroup.

2315
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,210
You're going to have nothing but rats.
Rats will survive.

2316
01:37:41,211 --> 01:37:44,600
A few mice and rats are going to be 
picking off decaying flesh and surviving

2317
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:49,601
on cannibalism until they slowly evolved
over billions and billions of years and 

2318
01:37:49,601 --> 01:37:53,291
that's why you want to live in New York 
or Washington dc or la because they 

2319
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:53,291
asked to.
Right.

2320
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:55,710
If that really hit one of those places,
that would be too cheesy,

2321
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,760
you know,
cheesy because that's what you would 

2322
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:06,430
expect that you would expect it to do.
That one even one that liked the one in 

2323
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:08,700
Nevada where you can go visit that 
crater.

2324
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:10,520
That crater was,
you know that.

2325
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:11,990
That wasn't that long ago.
That was,

2326
01:38:11,991 --> 01:38:14,250
you know,
I think it was like $100,000

2327
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,400
or 80,000
years ago when that fucking thing 

2328
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,561
Hitman,
it probably killed everything was in 

2329
01:38:21,561 --> 01:38:21,561
miles and miles,
you know,

2330
01:38:21,561 --> 01:38:22,140
it's a half a mile long.

2331
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,730
The crater I think are a mile.
Maybe what?

2332
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:29,850
Whatever the fuck it is.
I mean that thing must have killed so 

2333
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:30,360
many fucking people are so many things.
Whatever was near it.

2334
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:32,280
And when you think about something like 
that,

2335
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:35,040
landing right in the middle of La,
like right in the middle of downtown,

2336
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:36,690
that's crazy.
Fuck.

2337
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,480
Just a half a mile wide crater,
right?

2338
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:40,830
We're downtown.
La used to be.

2339
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,870
Nothing's there.
Boom.

2340
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,730
Just a bowl,
a bowl and everything out.

2341
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:48,570
We're all dead.
We're dead right out here for sure.

2342
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:50,580
We're dead 30 miles away,
whatever it is,

2343
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:55,730
hundreds of miles away.
You're probably dead people on Pasadena 

2344
01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:56,370
dead.
People out in Pittsfield dead,

2345
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,060
dead,
dead.

2346
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,350
You're dead.
You're too far away.

2347
01:38:58,840 --> 01:38:59,970
I mean,
you can't get too far away.

2348
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,770
I mean you probably,
even San Francisco people would be dead.

2349
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:06,771
Four hundred miles.
I'd probably be dead and this happens 

2350
01:39:06,771 --> 01:39:06,771
all the time.

2351
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,330
It happens all the time.
The saddest thing was yesterday,

2352
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:10,980
my wife said to me,
Joe,

2353
01:39:10,981 --> 01:39:15,981
something happened.
It would take me three hours to go from 

2354
01:39:15,981 --> 01:39:16,140
work.
Wow.

2355
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,970
Fourteen miles.
It's true.

2356
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:20,340
Take you forever.
For her to say that to me.

2357
01:39:20,341 --> 01:39:22,290
I was like,
she had to think about shit like that.

2358
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,150
Are you thinking too hard to bring a 
pair of roller?

2359
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:27,030
And the problem is three hours.
If she gets off work at six,

2360
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,010
then you're dealing with creepy shit at 
night.

2361
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:34,220
You know,
you're walking home at night and who 

2362
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:35,721
knows what the fuck is happening by the 
time these three hours are up or total 

2363
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:35,721
chaos has said.
And I asked him,

2364
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:37,050
what would you do?
Would you walk on?

2365
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:42,090
And she goes,
I would just stay right on the fucking 

2366
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:42,090
highway or something.
I don't know.

2367
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:47,270
These concerns didn't even enter into 
people's heads just weeks ago to just 

2368
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:48,180
this fucking earthquake just weeks ago,
weeks ago.

2369
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:50,250
People were like,
immune to it all,

2370
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,460
you know.
Now it's like slowly letting us know 

2371
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:55,460
it's on its way.
Stupid.

2372
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:55,460
Yeah.
It was uh,

2373
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:58,140
it was in a whatever that magic club,
the other,

2374
01:39:58,141 --> 01:40:00,150
you know,
wherever it comes in my.

2375
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:05,270
Yeah,
and just go into her Mosa was kind of 

2376
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:05,280
like,
kind of weird because he would just,

2377
01:40:05,281 --> 01:40:10,281
I just got done watching all this Japan 
shit and then being by the ocean just 

2378
01:40:10,281 --> 01:40:10,281
kinda like,
yeah,

2379
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,060
that's the stuff people died in 
California,

2380
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:13,980
Bro.
People who died in the tsunami,

2381
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,830
they get sucked into the water.
There's a bunch.

2382
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:20,870
There was a photographer that was taking
pictures in front of a crowd of people 

2383
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:20,880
and you just got sucked in northern 
California,

2384
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,410
sucked right off the beach,
man.

2385
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:27,440
Wow.
It fucked up and they just stare off 

2386
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,010
screaming for him.
This guy's just drowned sea.

2387
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:29,130
They pull it out,
you know?

2388
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:31,260
I mean when,
when that tide comes in,

2389
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:31,760
you know,
I mean,

2390
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,110
you just see some of those waves.
It's been incredible.

2391
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:34,830
The deal.
A lot of damage.

2392
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:37,290
And Marina del Rey read a lot of damage 
in docs.

2393
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:39,270
Yeah,
I mean the tide went really high.

2394
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:42,240
Fidelity it,
especially in northern California.

2395
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:47,241
Apparently that's where it really hit.
But this support fuck was taking 

2396
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:47,250
pictures in front of a bunch of people 
last week,

2397
01:40:47,251 --> 01:40:48,690
supposedly.
Good for the earthquake.

2398
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:54,080
A bunch of fish would redondo.
I read something to still stinks over 

2399
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:54,290
there,
man.

2400
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,950
Still stakes.
They said that May.

2401
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:57,340
Most of stock,
man.

2402
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:58,780
Most of stuck.
Really?

2403
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:01,040
Yeah.
Fish apocalypse man.

2404
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:06,060
It's not like worms smelling like really
old dead ship because there was a 

2405
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,300
million dead fish.
Do you think it had something to do with

2406
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:12,320
your grade?
I don't know what the fuck it had to do 

2407
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,320
with.
Well,

2408
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,321
they said that they died because of the 
lack of oxygen and then they said that 

2409
01:41:16,321 --> 01:41:16,450
there's some sort of a toxin in the 
water.

2410
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:21,720
So they.
They were poisoned by something so they 

2411
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,821
don't know exactly.
They don't get the full results of what 

2412
01:41:23,821 --> 01:41:26,071
happened.
But what's really spooky is the same 

2413
01:41:26,071 --> 01:41:26,071
thing is happening in Mexico in 
Acapulco.

2414
01:41:26,071 --> 01:41:27,910
There's photos of all these fish that 
are on the surface of the water.

2415
01:41:27,911 --> 01:41:32,911
It's the same type of fish,
so sardines and some macro and there's 

2416
01:41:32,911 --> 01:41:36,691
millions of them and they're on the 
surface of the fucking water and they 

2417
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:39,511
can't figure out why.
But people are driving up and boats and 

2418
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:39,820
they're scooping up these fishing 
buckets and the fish can't go anywhere.

2419
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:43,520
They're literally stuck the surface of 
the water like it.

2420
01:41:43,521 --> 01:41:48,521
They don't know what they're trying to 
do if there's no oxygen to trying to 

2421
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:48,850
like snap at the air to get oxygen into 
their body.

2422
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:51,520
Somehow no one knows exactly why they're
at the surface of the water.

2423
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:56,521
It's a total mystery,
but people are just scooping them up in 

2424
01:41:56,521 --> 01:41:56,521
buckets.

2425
01:41:56,521 --> 01:41:58,060
So this is basically sort of similar to 
what happened in Redondo.

2426
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:01,030
Something is happening to giant schools 
of fish and they don't know why.

2427
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,550
And they're thinking that,
you know,

2428
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:03,730
in Redondo,
like I said,

2429
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:05,350
they think some,
some sort of a poison,

2430
01:42:05,351 --> 01:42:08,790
but they don't have any idea why or what
or probably some kind of weird terrorist

2431
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,530
act she imagined it was some crazy 
Christian motherfucker.

2432
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:16,710
One of these May 21st assholes,
all employees in the water just to get 

2433
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:19,600
their attention by some retard held,
chilled them.

2434
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:23,960
The Lord is very mysterious,
crazy assholes.

2435
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:29,380
This,
these billboards all over town are so 

2436
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:29,380
nuts.
Have you seen these,

2437
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:32,401
Joey,
that God has come and May 21st you 

2438
01:42:32,401 --> 01:42:32,401
mother wife,
May 21st.

2439
01:42:32,401 --> 01:42:35,980
I can't figure out why May 21st knows 
the idea behind that is so ridiculous.

2440
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:40,120
The idea behind the first of all that 
you could predict the fucking day,

2441
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,610
you know,
come on and then the days in,

2442
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:43,960
what is it in the Bible?

2443
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,120
Is that where you getting this day from?
I've never heard that before.

2444
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:48,040
And not only that,
even if it wasn't the Bible,

2445
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:50,890
the Bible is a translation of ancient 
Hebrew,

2446
01:42:50,891 --> 01:42:53,740
which nobody really,
totally understands ancient Hebrew.

2447
01:42:53,741 --> 01:42:58,741
To this day they don't know all the 
words and the letters double his 

2448
01:42:58,741 --> 01:42:58,741
numbers.
You know,

2449
01:42:58,741 --> 01:42:59,950
like the,
there's no numbers in Hebrew.

2450
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:03,490
So the letter a is also the number one.
So when you translate that Shit,

2451
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:07,030
the Latin and you translate it to the 
Greek and then to English,

2452
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:09,550
who knows what the fuck it really said 
in the first part,

2453
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:12,250
you're not going to get made 21st out of
it.

2454
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:13,330
Dude.
You know?

2455
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:15,490
And even if it did,
you really think they were right.

2456
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:17,620
I mean you really believe it all is.
It,

2457
01:43:17,621 --> 01:43:22,621
no.
Is it a religious thing at all or is it 

2458
01:43:22,621 --> 01:43:22,621
a vision?
I mean,

2459
01:43:22,621 --> 01:43:26,301
he's just going to be a crackpot,
but this motherfucker's buying 

2460
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:26,301
billboards everywhere.

2461
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:29,270
You know?
He's buying billboards everywhere and 

2462
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:29,270
got financing.
Yeah.

2463
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:32,060
I get this money.
There's a lot of money and retards do 

2464
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:32,710
retards were everywhere and they want to
believe.

2465
01:43:32,711 --> 01:43:33,310
I mean,
look,

2466
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:35,070
we're friends with Alex.
all right.

2467
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,540
Alex Jones is a nice guy.
I like Alex a lot,

2468
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:42,660
but there's a lot of people that follow 
Alex that might as well be following 

2469
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:42,760
this guy.
You know what I'm saying?

2470
01:43:42,761 --> 01:43:43,960
I mean they just,
they just pick,

2471
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:49,230
pick something to get obsessed with,
whether it's a the Mayan calendar in 

2472
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:51,140
2012 or it's fucking the Jesus 
apocalypse more.

2473
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:54,290
Whether it's Ufo shows.
It's all the same mentality to get these

2474
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:55,820
motherfuckers obsessed with these 
things.

2475
01:43:55,821 --> 01:43:58,020
But what got you off the Mayan County?
Well,

2476
01:43:58,350 --> 01:44:01,070
it was never on it.
I'm not attached or married.

2477
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:06,071
I try not to be at least to almost 
everything that I think everything that 

2478
01:44:06,071 --> 01:44:06,440
I believe about everything I,
I,

2479
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:09,170
I'm open to re-interpretation at all 
times.

2480
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:13,670
And the thing about the Mayan calendar 
is I think with the mind mines did,

2481
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:18,671
and I got this mostly from going to 
teach an Eatsa and talking to this guy 

2482
01:44:18,671 --> 01:44:22,721
was a professor who was our guide who 
was really an interesting guy and we 

2483
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:26,060
talked to this guy for hours.
He gave us a tour for like five hours.

2484
01:44:26,061 --> 01:44:27,500
And he was like,
he loved.

2485
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:32,710
Yeah.
And He loved the fact that I knew so 

2486
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:34,090
much about about the mind civilization.
So he was an individual guy,

2487
01:44:34,091 --> 01:44:35,300
like you hire him,
you know,

2488
01:44:35,301 --> 01:44:36,110
for the,
for the tour.

2489
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:39,380
So he was like really into it because 
the guy loved the culture man.

2490
01:44:39,381 --> 01:44:42,560
He was really obsessed with it and 
obsessed with the fact that there's this

2491
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:45,590
incredible society that basically just 
vanished.

2492
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:48,580
I mean these guys created some 
incredible works of,

2493
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,180
of,
of architecture,

2494
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:55,330
these incredible designs,
incredibly intricate calendars and 

2495
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,840
really psychedelic languages of images 
and shit like that.

2496
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:58,630
I mean they're,
they're the way they,

2497
01:44:58,631 --> 01:45:01,460
they formed sentences and thought it was
very fascinating stuff.

2498
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:05,150
And then on top of that there was all 
this evidence of a massive deterioration

2499
01:45:05,151 --> 01:45:08,000
of their society.
Like it's human sacrifice and you know,

2500
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:09,380
and that kind of shit.
Like what all,

2501
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:13,100
what caused all this man,
it's all fucking fascinating thing.

2502
01:45:13,101 --> 01:45:15,680
But I was never,
I never believed that they had it wired,

2503
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:17,840
that they knew that December 20,
first 2012,

2504
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:23,020
the end of the cycle,
they don't even think that it's the end 

2505
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,020
of the world.
And knowing the Mayan calendar calendars

2506
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:26,801
that say the world ends December 21st,
what it is is the end of the long count 

2507
01:45:26,801 --> 01:45:28,010
and it's just another sequence of 
events.

2508
01:45:28,011 --> 01:45:33,011
It's like,
it shows in a news cycle what that 

2509
01:45:33,011 --> 01:45:33,011
means.
Who knows?

2510
01:45:33,011 --> 01:45:33,550
It could be a new consciousness,
it could be a,

2511
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,620
uh,
an astrological or an astronomical cycle

2512
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:41,770
where you know,
something in the cosmos aligns in a 

2513
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:41,770
different way.

2514
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:42,230
I mean,
we know when the moon is closer to us or

2515
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:44,720
they're moving further away,
it reacts to changes the tides.

2516
01:45:44,721 --> 01:45:45,860
It does things,
you know,

2517
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:50,890
if there's some other astronomical body,
that cosmic body that when it lines up 

2518
01:45:51,141 --> 01:45:56,141
with us,
it's gravity affects us in a certain 

2519
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:56,141
way.
And it changes some certain things about

2520
01:45:56,141 --> 01:46:00,220
people or some new understanding or new 
appreciation or some new sort of a 

2521
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,870
natural disaster that makes us sort of 
rethink the way we communicate with,

2522
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,590
whether it's with cell towers or whether
it's with satellites,

2523
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:11,720
the satellites get burned out.
So we have to figure out a way to 

2524
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:11,720
reinvent the whole idea of mass 
communication.

2525
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:16,010
But now that's all possible.
That could be the reasons why these 

2526
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:16,010
things,
while what's thought of that.

2527
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,100
A new age is coming,
you know,

2528
01:46:17,101 --> 01:46:22,101
into the mayans predicted it because 
they predicted there would be a new 

2529
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:22,101
atmosphere in earth.

2530
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:22,101
There would be,
maybe it's,

2531
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:24,570
you know,
something as simple as the polar ice cap

2532
01:46:24,571 --> 01:46:27,680
shift and it causes all sorts of fucking
havoc and chaos.

2533
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:30,880
It could be solar storms,
it could easily be that man,

2534
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:34,010
there's a lot of predicted solar storms 
activity in 2012,

2535
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:39,330
you know,
they think they could get unprecedented 

2536
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:39,330
levels of,
uh,

2537
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:39,330
of,
of,

2538
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:43,240
of gamma bursts.
And they've had those before solar 

2539
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:43,240
storms,
like way,

2540
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:45,650
way in the past where we didn't have 
like all these satellites and shit.

2541
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:46,400
You know,
there was,

2542
01:46:46,401 --> 01:46:49,410
I believe it was a fucking thing as the 
19 fifties,

2543
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:54,411
I think it was,
whether it was a giant solar storm like 

2544
01:46:54,411 --> 01:46:57,290
on the one the highest one's ever 
measured and they were saying that if 

2545
01:46:57,290 --> 01:46:57,450
that's all restoring happened to us 
today,

2546
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,150
we literally would knock out 
communication.

2547
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:05,360
It would be fucked.
We would probably still have the 

2548
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:08,061
internet and a lot of areas,
but like a lot of our power grid would 

2549
01:47:08,061 --> 01:47:08,061
be fucked.

2550
01:47:08,061 --> 01:47:10,470
A lot of our satellites would be fucked.
You know,

2551
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,890
solar storms are really unpredictable 
and when they happen,

2552
01:47:13,891 --> 01:47:18,891
man,
that really big ones really big ones 

2553
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:21,411
could toast this whole society and maybe
that's what happens in 2012 and maybe 

2554
01:47:21,411 --> 01:47:23,700
nothing happens.
So fucking bullshit.

2555
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:28,950
I mean the math,
David said that the math might even be 

2556
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:28,950
wrong.
It might even 60 days off.

2557
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:31,530
You know,
we're going to have a good time,

2558
01:47:31,531 --> 01:47:33,450
bro.
We're going to be there in New York City

2559
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:38,570
and then we're going to be in New Jersey
for the fucking championship over the 

2560
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:38,580
world.
Jonny bones,

2561
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:41,910
Jones fights more resio shogun.
Who are.

2562
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:43,800
This is the opportunity,
bro.

2563
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,020
I'll see you in the city.
Yeah,

2564
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:47,970
I'm staying in the city.
I'm staying in the city.

2565
01:47:47,971 --> 01:47:49,320
I'm going out there.
Yeah.

2566
01:47:49,321 --> 01:47:54,321
The last time I stayed in New York I got
tired of hearing sirens all throughout 

2567
01:47:54,321 --> 01:47:54,321
the middle of the night.

2568
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,570
All night there were sirens.
I was like,

2569
01:47:57,571 --> 01:47:59,550
okay,
I don't need to stay here.

2570
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,680
I'll just drive here the next day.
So that's my new card.

2571
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:07,990
Fuck yeah,
that was a favorite for that 

2572
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:07,990
motherfuckers.
Definitely.

2573
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,370
Justin Bieber.
What are you talking about?

2574
01:48:08,371 --> 01:48:12,750
Just like Justin bieber derive favor the
same fucking person.

2575
01:48:12,751 --> 01:48:15,640
I think he thinks the motherfuckers once
every other week.

2576
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:17,630
That's a great fight.
There's crumpled.

2577
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:20,130
Great fights of his favor is a 
fascinating dude.

2578
01:48:20,131 --> 01:48:21,420
I really liked talking to him,
man.

2579
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:26,720
I did an interview with him and one of 
the things he talked about is very 

2580
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:27,210
interesting.
He's a very inspirational guy,

2581
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:32,510
you know,
he's like one of those dudes that gets 

2582
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:34,611
up in the morning and he has like a list
of like things that he has written on 

2583
01:48:34,611 --> 01:48:34,611
the wall.
These are my goals.

2584
01:48:34,611 --> 01:48:37,110
I'm going to be world champion by the 
end of 2011.

2585
01:48:37,111 --> 01:48:39,320
I'm going to meet the girl of my dreams,
have you know,

2586
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:42,300
three kids and like he has all this shit
like on his wall.

2587
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,320
I keys like the secret.
Yeah.

2588
01:48:44,321 --> 01:48:49,321
And when he's,
well he's big into setting goals and 

2589
01:48:49,321 --> 01:48:52,101
working hard and accomplishing things.
Like he's Kinda a gang of different 

2590
01:48:52,101 --> 01:48:56,151
things going on at once.
He owns like three different houses and 

2591
01:48:56,151 --> 01:48:56,151
they,
all the fighters live in these houses.

2592
01:48:56,151 --> 01:49:01,090
They have on a block.
They all live together and they get 

2593
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:01,090
together and cook healthy meals and 
hanging out together.

2594
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:02,730
He imagined it accidentally robbing that
place.

2595
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:09,030
Yeah.
And Talking Shit because the guy who 

2596
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,340
meets you at the door is only five foot 
four.

2597
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:12,580
Next thing you know,
you're flying through the air and landed

2598
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,120
on your head.
Yeah.

2599
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:17,460
This,
this is an awesome card man.

2600
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:21,510
John Jones versus Shogun Hua is some 
fascinating shit man.

2601
01:49:21,511 --> 01:49:25,920
Because Shogun is the oldest Acen and 
Shogun used to be John Jones.

2602
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:28,830
He was the 23 year old guy when he won 
the middleweight Grand Prix.

2603
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,010
Shogun was these young guy that was 
fucking everybody up,

2604
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:37,040
you know,
but he had a lot more competition and 

2605
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:37,040
had a lot of struggles,
you know,

2606
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,130
he had heard Cheerio Nogueira that was a
struggle,

2607
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:39,390
you know,
he had some tough fights.

2608
01:49:39,391 --> 01:49:40,310
He fought,
you know,

2609
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,890
if it had some,
some real good competition over there.

2610
01:49:42,891 --> 01:49:44,610
He had some battles,
you know,

2611
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,760
and they also had some fucking 
destructing winds to mass shogun go out 

2612
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:49,760
and fuck people up.
Like,

2613
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,210
uh,
like when I'm a rampage was injured when

2614
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:57,211
they,
when they fought rampage came into the 

2615
01:49:57,211 --> 01:49:57,211
fight with uh,
with a hurt rib.

2616
01:49:57,211 --> 01:49:57,480
Shouldn't never took the fight in the 
first place.

2617
01:49:57,481 --> 01:50:02,481
Well,
I guess he just needed the money and 

2618
01:50:02,481 --> 01:50:02,481
Shogun just fucking took it to them.
Man.

2619
01:50:02,481 --> 01:50:05,650
Shogun is up fucking killer.
Everybody doesn't have to.

2620
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:07,630
Yeah.
Shoguns a killer.

2621
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:13,050
He's a killer and he's been around a 
long time and he's not going to get 

2622
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:13,050
rattled.

2623
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:16,530
And you know,
and I'm not saying that Jon Jones is 

2624
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:16,530
because I think Jon Jones is the fucking
truth.

2625
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:18,220
I think he's the real deal dude.
And I think he's a super athlete.

2626
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:21,430
I think there's certain dudes that just 
can do things that you can't do,

2627
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:23,310
you know,
and physically you know,

2628
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,600
and when you combine it with 
intelligence,

2629
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:29,200
which he has and work ethic,
which he has all the,

2630
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:31,390
doing all the right things,
treating people the right way.

2631
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:32,530
Good Karma.
I mean,

2632
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:37,531
yeah,
he says some things sometimes and I'm 

2633
01:50:37,531 --> 01:50:37,531
sure he'll regret,
but he's 23 years old,

2634
01:50:37,531 --> 01:50:38,230
you know,
it's hard to not be confident.

2635
01:50:38,330 --> 01:50:40,330
Fear of a black planet discussed this 
already.

2636
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:43,750
You said this a long time ago.
They may be super slaves.

2637
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:45,180
They thought they were going to get the 
bags,

2638
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:50,190
bang out of your buck.
That's super slave league is called yet 

2639
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:53,220
motherfuck NFL and now they're taking 
everything from us because they'll be 

2640
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:53,220
taking.

2641
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:55,210
Look at film Mr Davis.
I didn't know he was fighting.

2642
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:56,890
I told him,
you know Garrett,

2643
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:58,600
Mr.
Yeah,

2644
01:50:58,601 --> 01:51:00,070
he's fighting.
Oh yeah.

2645
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:04,990
They're both Antonio.
Antonio Hijirida and attorney Rodrigo.

2646
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:06,280
But a Tara.
Tara,

2647
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,320
the heavyweight guy.
And Rodrigo,

2648
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,140
excuse me.
Yeah,

2649
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:13,420
her Jericho is the light heavyweight 
guy.

2650
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:14,710
So who was fighting the light?
Heavyweight.

2651
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,620
Okay.
So he's got.

2652
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:17,950
He's still a bad motherfucker that guys 
submitted Dan Henderson,

2653
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,120
you know,
he uh,

2654
01:51:19,150 --> 01:51:20,500
he beat over him,
I believe.

2655
01:51:20,501 --> 01:51:25,501
I'm pretty sure.
And Him and him and Ninja or him in 

2656
01:51:25,501 --> 01:51:25,540
Shogun had a fucking war.
They had a killer.

2657
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:27,250
Warren Pride.
Yeah man.

2658
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,510
He's a,
he's a bad motherfucker.

2659
01:51:28,511 --> 01:51:30,490
He's getting real good.
Hands to Nigeria does.

2660
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,860
That's a great fight.
But John Jones,

2661
01:51:32,861 --> 01:51:34,310
man,
what I said about John Johnson,

2662
01:51:34,311 --> 01:51:36,340
I always say this is when he throws 
people around,

2663
01:51:36,341 --> 01:51:39,250
it doesn't look like like a normal 
person doing it.

2664
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:39,910
You know what I mean?

2665
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:43,990
Like when you watch a normal strong dude
that just horse somebody around,

2666
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:46,330
like Matt Hamill when Matt Hamill horses
somebody around,

2667
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:51,450
he looks like here's this big ass tufts 
strong motherfucker and he's going to 

2668
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:52,660
grab a hold unit is going to slam you on
your ass.

2669
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:54,790
And it just looks like it's supposed to 
be happening that way.

2670
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,510
When John Jones does it,
it looks like some fucking insect,

2671
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:01,480
some insect that can just pick up a log.
You know,

2672
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:03,340
there's something about how easy he does
it.

2673
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:06,070
It just doesn't look right.
It doesn't look fair.

2674
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:11,460
You know what I'm saying,
like you watch like a beetle move or an 

2675
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:15,270
aunt move like a something like ants can
pick up some big ass shit and move it 

2676
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:17,440
around like it's nothing.
It doesn't even shift their balance.

2677
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,940
That's what it looks like with John 
Jones.

2678
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:23,941
He's just like,
he's got like Arachnid power or 

2679
01:52:23,941 --> 01:52:23,941
something.

2680
01:52:23,941 --> 01:52:24,910
He's fucking Spiderman.
He launches dudes.

2681
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:29,970
You know like when,
when he gets that double over hooks and 

2682
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:30,160
throws guys through the air,
who the fuck is doing that?

2683
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,060
Who the fuck is doing that?
A kick.

2684
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:38,560
You know how some people catch your kick
off call and spun around with an l but 

2685
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,990
hope Stephan Bonner,
he also taught deaf and bond over the 

2686
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:43,500
fucking over his heels.
Head over his heels,

2687
01:52:43,501 --> 01:52:46,060
his heels up in the air.
Who the fuck does that to?

2688
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:51,070
Stephan?
Bonner and Stephen Bar has been around 

2689
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:51,070
forever.
Forever.

2690
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:51,070
Because to show you how tough Stephan 
Bonner is.

2691
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:51,070
By the way,
look,

2692
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:53,430
Jon Jones stops everybody and then stop 
bar.

2693
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:56,210
You know he gave him a beating.
But Bonner's,

2694
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:58,910
that guy's an assassin.
He's tough shit.

2695
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:00,530
This is an interesting fight,
man.

2696
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,680
Very interesting.
Mark Wahlberg,

2697
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:03,800
shoguns killer,
Bro.

2698
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:09,520
You know,
I wished Miller had a full training 

2699
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:09,520
camp.

2700
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:09,520
You know,
it's a tough fight.

2701
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:09,870
Nate Marquardt a beast,
you know,

2702
01:53:09,871 --> 01:53:11,750
in Miller's toughest fucking and those 
Miller boys,

2703
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:12,590
man,
they'll take a fight.

2704
01:53:12,591 --> 01:53:14,790
You can call them 20 minutes before the 
fight starts and they'll,

2705
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:19,930
they'll change their shoes.
That was that middle of training for a 

2706
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:19,930
fight.
Yeah.

2707
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:20,030
Well he's always training.
Those guys are real.

2708
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:22,290
They're real conscientious.
Miller.

2709
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:25,040
And they know that you always have to be
ready because anything can happen.

2710
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:26,670
I don't know.
It was great.

2711
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,380
Mark was a fighter and he's great with 
these guys,

2712
01:53:30,381 --> 01:53:31,820
but I don't know.
Now this motherfucker's got.

2713
01:53:31,821 --> 01:53:34,700
This is Dan.
This is to New Jersey Bitch.

2714
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:36,320
Yeah.
Got To go with the Jersey.

2715
01:53:36,321 --> 01:53:41,321
It's like the,
it's like the cowboys go with the 49 

2716
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:41,321
Avila one.
What do you think about cro?

2717
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:42,380
Cop fighting still.
Does that freak you out?

2718
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:43,250
He's uh,
he's,

2719
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:48,270
he's fighting.
Brendan Schaub the kid who lost two big 

2720
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:48,270
country in the ultimate fighter.

2721
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:51,280
I think that Brendan sharp is improving 
so bad mother fucker.

2722
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:52,890
And I think,
uh,

2723
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:55,520
I think that cro cop and just try to 
finish up his contract.

2724
01:53:55,710 --> 01:53:58,010
I don't think so.
But why?

2725
01:53:58,190 --> 01:54:03,190
I mean,
when the guy keeps getting knocked out 

2726
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:03,190
like that,
I mean,

2727
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:03,190
I wonder what.
I wonder if he needs money.

2728
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:04,940
Do you think it needs money or you.
It's like an ego thing.

2729
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:06,400
He's not willing to be,
you know,

2730
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,400
I don't know,
man.

2731
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:10,010
This is his last fight.
I don't know.

2732
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:12,920
I hope I was hoping that he was going to
walk away after the Pat Barry fight.

2733
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:14,720
That was a good fight.
You got a nice victory,

2734
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:19,780
you know?
But then he fights frank Mir and gets 

2735
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:19,780
knocked down and it just doesn't look 
right.

2736
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:20,570
You know,
you know,

2737
01:54:20,571 --> 01:54:22,010
like seeing a,
a hero.

2738
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,440
I would hope the fucking guy could pull 
it back together.

2739
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:29,570
He will look.
The people don't know that Alistair 

2740
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:29,750
overeem was stopped like nine times.
He got,

2741
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,260
he got beat up by Bobby Hoffman.
He got stopped by.

2742
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:36,740
I think he got no Verdugo,
finished them for doom,

2743
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:39,500
submitted them.
A bunch of guys have stopped him though,

2744
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,260
including being stopped in k one and 
being stopped.

2745
01:54:42,261 --> 01:54:44,900
And kickboxing chocolate down stopped 
him guys.

2746
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,070
Guys beat him.
Oh,

2747
01:54:46,071 --> 01:54:47,720
a surge.
A curtain off.

2748
01:54:47,721 --> 01:54:49,610
Knocked him out.
He stopped him.

2749
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:52,550
So easy to look at all those guys that 
beat allister.

2750
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:57,551
And now alister is a fucking destroyer.
Like he bounced back fully.

2751
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:02,740
What he did is he started lifting 
weights and doing crazy power lifting 

2752
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:02,740
and shit.
He got a lot stronger,

2753
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:07,680
got super dedicated,
really dedicated his whole life and 100 

2754
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:11,621
percent to training.
And now he's like one of the most 

2755
01:55:11,621 --> 01:55:11,630
dangerous and scary guys on the claimant
by July 18th.

2756
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:14,420
So you can't say cro cop is done.
He never say he's done.

2757
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:16,820
But man,
it hurts me to watch him lose,

2758
01:55:16,821 --> 01:55:21,821
you know,
it hurts me to watch him be a shadow of 

2759
01:55:21,821 --> 01:55:24,161
who he was.
So excited about him coming over to the 

2760
01:55:24,161 --> 01:55:24,980
UFC because I thought about the cro cop 
that fought Nogueira and pride.

2761
01:55:24,981 --> 01:55:26,830
I thought about the cro cop that fought,
you know,

2762
01:55:26,831 --> 01:55:28,010
um,
uh,

2763
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:28,830
over,
um,

2764
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,910
which feed or his brother,
uh,

2765
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:32,930
Alexander Elamela.
Namco.

2766
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:36,140
He fuck that dude up high.
Kicked Him Igor.

2767
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:38,900
He fucked him above chanting.
I kicked him.

2768
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:44,010
He owed him.
He was just jack and everybody back 

2769
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,010
then,
dude,

2770
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,930
his standup was fucking nasty,
but by the time he came over to the UFC 

2771
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:48,030
man,
it wasn't quite the same.

2772
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:50,130
You know,
we didn't quite have the motivation that

2773
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:52,120
he had back.
There was something that was missing.

2774
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:57,680
It's almost like he achieved so much 
over there that it was like you went on 

2775
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:57,680
a mad sprint.

2776
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:58,110
Here's a good fucking fight on this 
card,

2777
01:55:58,111 --> 01:56:01,470
man.
Jim Miller and Komal shallow roots whole

2778
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:02,100
year.
That's a good.

2779
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:04,860
That's a good fucking fight.
Jim Miller is a beast dude.

2780
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,430
Especially after he submitted that kid.
I'm Charlie.

2781
01:56:08,431 --> 01:56:10,020
I'm fucking.
What is his name?

2782
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,110
Oliveira Charles.
That,

2783
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:15,060
that really good Jujitsu kid with the 
good Moitai.

2784
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:17,190
This small kid.
But Miller grabbed a hold of him,

2785
01:56:17,191 --> 01:56:19,080
got him in a fucking nasty leg lock.
Quick.

2786
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:21,180
Really surprised that kid when he tapped
down,

2787
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:22,420
you know,
and Miller's tap.

2788
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:25,310
Duane Ludwig off his back.
He's a fucking dropped.

2789
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:26,340
Ludwig too.
Before that.

2790
01:56:26,341 --> 01:56:26,780
Which is,
you know,

2791
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:29,710
Ludwig's is sick.
Kickboxer says Komal shallow roots.

2792
01:56:29,711 --> 01:56:33,150
Dude's a bad motherfucker to really 
tough strong dude.

2793
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:35,610
This Iranian,
I believe he's Iranian and uh,

2794
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,760
he's a wrestler,
he's got a wrestling base,

2795
01:56:37,761 --> 01:56:39,720
but like a powerful punch and he comes 
forward.

2796
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:41,870
So that's a good fucking scrap right 
there.

2797
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:44,220
We got Mike power were caught on Beta.
Fuck.

2798
01:56:44,221 --> 01:56:45,730
Yeah,
that's going to be real good to,

2799
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:50,910
you know,
Mike Powell is really fucking turning 

2800
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:50,910
that around.
My piles.

2801
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:54,171
Tricky is fuck.
He's tricky and he's got a real good 

2802
01:56:54,171 --> 01:56:54,171
guard dude.
Ever.

2803
01:56:54,171 --> 01:56:55,230
We got to be careful about that guy when
he's on his back.

2804
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:56,400
Man.
And Kurt.

2805
01:56:56,401 --> 01:56:59,280
Bella Green glace and t there's a lot of
good fights in this car.

2806
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:05,430
Yeah,
it was a lot of fucking good fights and 

2807
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:07,290
this car's slugfest going to be great.
Yeah.

2808
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:09,540
And uh,
what the fuck is that dude's name?

2809
01:57:09,541 --> 01:57:12,680
Barboza.
He's fighting to Edson Barboza.

2810
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:15,780
That kid's a fucking beast.
That kid's a beast,

2811
01:57:15,781 --> 01:57:19,380
man.
He's fighting Anthony Anthony.

2812
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:22,050
Andrew Cohen is a bad ass stryker from 
the WEC.

2813
01:57:22,051 --> 01:57:23,790
One of those guys.
Last couple of fights,

2814
01:57:23,791 --> 01:57:25,920
but still it's fucking real dangerous 
kid.

2815
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:31,190
But this barboza is a fucking assassin.
He's a bad ass striker due to bad ass.

2816
01:57:31,930 --> 01:57:33,810
Try.
Well,

2817
01:57:33,811 --> 01:57:38,811
I think the car,
the paper view card is going to be an 

2818
01:57:38,811 --> 01:57:38,820
hour early this week.
So in the east coast,

2819
01:57:38,821 --> 01:57:42,240
if it used to be on at 9:00,
it's now going to be on at 8:00.

2820
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,190
It's going to start a day or it's going 
to start out.

2821
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:49,380
It's going to start instead of nine.
It's going to start it instead of 

2822
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:49,380
tenants.
Gonna start at nine.

2823
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:49,380
Six,
okay.

2824
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:50,520
Yeah.
Six here.

2825
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,320
So,
um,

2826
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:55,290
so that's the deal.
I get off the plane at 4:45.

2827
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,920
I go to my hotel,
take a shower like a shoot right back 

2828
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:03,621
after the exam.
We're going to have some fucking fun 

2829
01:58:03,621 --> 01:58:03,621
next weekend.
Uh,

2830
01:58:03,621 --> 01:58:05,790
I am in Portland.
No,

2831
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:07,200
where am I?
Seattle.

2832
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:09,420
Seattle.
At the Moore Theater.

2833
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:11,640
Yeah.
And there's still a few tickets left,

2834
01:58:11,641 --> 01:58:13,450
but not much.
So that is a,

2835
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:14,390
that's on Friday.
It's,

2836
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,750
it'll probably sell out that day.

2837
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:20,750
So if you want and don't snooze bitches 
and then following week joey will be 

2838
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:23,020
with me at helium in Portland.
Joe,

2839
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:25,180
he can go to Portland.
Oregon is.

2840
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:28,290
If Oregon is still there,
will be there too.

2841
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,890
Which is a scary,
scary fucking consideration.

2842
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,870
So we'll see you there at the end of the
month.

2843
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:39,050
And Joey this weekend or this Tuesday
