1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,600
The joe rogan experience.
He's very strong on the ground,

2
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:07,060
which is one of the reasons why it was
so impressive that he took his back and

3
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:08,200
choked him like that.
Yeah,

4
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:10,060
I mean I think I have a different style
than,

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,760
than uh,
a lot of people can see,

6
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:13,161
you know,
you,

7
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,200
you,
you go back to [inaudible] and all this,

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,440
like his style is,
it's good.

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,230
It's obviously very good,
but I can see a lot of holes in it.

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,140
And I saw those holes many years ago.
I've been called how big could beat for

11
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:26,680
years I've been wanting to fight them
just because people got those questions.

12
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,930
I've got those questions too.
So I'm like,

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,580
let's see what this mother fucker got.
Like,

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,110
cause I see it,
I see them hoes,

15
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,180
you know,
I don't really focus on too much of the

16
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:35,014
good.
I'm like,

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,240
what holes?
I got that boy number.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,230
No telly you.
What are the holes?

19
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,410
What do you see it,
you know,

20
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,700
even on some of his take on a lot of his
takedowns,

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,250
he,
he misses a lot of them.

22
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,570
You know,
he's very square.

23
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,730
He kinda just bum rushes.
You know,

24
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:51,370
people were talking about the Barboza
fight before and they're like,

25
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,130
are you looking at that fighter and
you're going to try and build off that

26
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,420
when I'm like,
yeah,

27
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,740
I mean he did.
Okay.

28
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,590
The fight was good.
He beat the hell out of Barboza,

29
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,180
but I saw the holes in it.
You know,

30
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:03,100
he's just running square forward.
Adam,

31
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:03,420
you know,
he's,

32
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,200
he got hit with a lot of shots.
I didn't see it for,

33
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,450
for people in the outside watching him
because the way he just came forward on

34
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:12,210
Barboza was like,
he was indestructible.

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,900
I mean just,
it didn't matter.

36
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm just going to get you,
it's just a matter of time.

37
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,230
Keep throwing your kicks.
I'm going to get you.

38
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:18,400
I'm going to get you.
I got you.

39
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,560
You got those guys.
But the body gives up.

40
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:21,470
You know,
you got Justin Gait,

41
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:24,460
she has the same way the body will give
up and the rest of it,

42
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,460
hey,
I just felt like shaky and just weird.

43
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,480
And then I realized,
oh,

44
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:32,630
this is like a,
almost like a cocaine type thing.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,420
Like,
do you know why we have wider cane

46
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,920
because of cocaine or,
yeah,

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,890
that's a guy named William Stewart
Halston who was uh,

48
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,380
so near and dear to my heart because he
was the original,

49
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:46,610
he was the founding surgeon at Johns
Hopkins and one of the original four

50
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:49,340
horsemen.
So the four main physicians that

51
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:53,210
basically have shaped medicine in this
country all started out at Hopkins.

52
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,280
Uh Oh,
slur in medicine,

53
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,800
Hopkins in surgery and two other guys,
Walsh.

54
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,870
And I'm blanking on the,
Kelly was the third one.

55
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,950
Um,
and he basically figured out,

56
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:08,780
cause you got to remember like there was
a day when surgery was staggeringly

57
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:13,250
barbaric.
Like prior to ether surgery was like,

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
all right,
can you hold him down?

59
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,910
Like gag,
um,

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,580
get them drunk,
gag him and like we're going to do our

61
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:20,340
thing.

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,650
It's fucking crazy.
So God,

63
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:27,230
I used to know all of this shit.
I don't remember any of the exact dates

64
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,320
anymore,
but it was like kind of like mid 18

65
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:35,321
hundreds to late 18 hundreds when up at
Massachusetts General Hospital.

66
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,120
I forget the name of who it was,
but someone basically came up with

67
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:40,130
ether.
So ether became the first form of

68
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:41,630
anesthetic.
But you know,

69
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,490
you were sort of knocking people out.
Well it was,

70
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,170
you know,
fast forward probably 20,

71
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:49,490
30 years when Halstad figured out that
this thing called cocaine could provide

72
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:52,640
local anesthetic.
So he began experimenting with like

73
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:56,300
crazy and of course in the process
became like patently addicted to it.

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,720
So you have this entire generation of
surgeons at Hopkins from that early era

75
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,080
that were completely coke addicted,
so halstead and all of his first

76
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,190
generation of residents.

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,760
Um,
and then of course from that we got

78
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,740
Lidacain,
Bupivacaine,

79
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,110
all of these things that don't have the
same properties.

80
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,300
But to this day,
cocaine is still used and,

81
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:20,170
and most people don't realize it,
but cocaine's a schedule two drug

82
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,240
meaning it actually has a medical
application.

83
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,790
I'm like heroin,
which has scheduled one and the dea and

84
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,200
marijuana.
That's right.

85
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,550
Today both you and I have produced
cancer cells in all buddy.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,840
What prevents those kinds of cells from
becoming the disease that we call cancer

87
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,870
is impart these natural killer cells and
after one night of four as of sleep,

88
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,620
that is a remarkable state of immune
deficiency and that's one of the reasons

89
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,450
why insufficient sleep predicts cancer.
Wow.

90
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,160
I could also speak about your
cardiovascular system and all it takes

91
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:55,870
is one hour because there is a global
experiment that's performed on 1.6

92
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,470
billion people across 70 countries twice
a year,

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
and it's called daylight savings time.

94
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,750
Now in the spring when we lose an hour
of sleep,

95
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,350
we see a subsequent 24% increase in
heart attacks.

96
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,550
What in the fall and the autumn,
when we gain an hour sleep,

97
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:16,750
there's a 21% decrease in heart attacks.
So it's bi-directional.

98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,880
That's how fragile and vulnerable your
body is to even just the smallest

99
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,870
perturbation of sleep.
One hour is all it takes.

100
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,070
Yeah.
Wow.

101
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,280
That is,
you're blowing my fucking mind.

102
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,330
It's frightening.
I mean,

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,350
you can go even further by the way,
you know?

104
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,460
Wow.
Insufficient sleep will even erode the

105
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,510
very fabric of biological life itself,
your DNA code.

106
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,820
So in one study they took a group of
healthy adults and they limited them to

107
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:50,821
six hours of sleep for one week and they
compared the profile of gene activity

108
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,210
relative to when those same people were
getting eight hours of sleep and there

109
00:04:55,211 --> 00:05:00,211
were two critical results.
The first was that a sizable 711 genes

110
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:05,470
were distorted in their activity caused
by one week of six hours of sleep,

111
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,350
which is highly relevant by the way,
because we know that many people are

112
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,750
trying to survive on six hours of sleep
during the week.

113
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,300
Wow.
The second,

114
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,351
sorry.
No,

115
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,570
please go.
I was going to say the second sort of

116
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,230
perhaps more interesting result was that
about half of those genes were actually

117
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,010
increasing their activity.
The other half were actually suppressed.

118
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,360
Those genes that were switched off by
six hours of sleep for one week with

119
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,330
genes related to your immune response,
many of them,

120
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,010
so you become immune deficient.
Those genes that were increased or what

121
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:41,360
we call overexpressed were genes that
were related to the promotion of tumors,

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,340
genes that were related to longterm
chronic inflammation within the body and

123
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:49,700
genes that were associated with stress.
And as a consequence,

124
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,080
cardiovascular disease,

125
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,250
I would say the most efficient hundred
miler I've done is,

126
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,420
uh,
when I,

127
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,260
I ran 11 hours and 40 minutes,
55 seconds at a race in 2015 called Holy

128
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,890
Shit.
You Ran,

129
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,130
you ran a hundred miles in 11 hours.
Yeah,

130
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,180
that was,
that was on a trip.

131
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,280
That was one on the track in the SPEC of
a fuck.

132
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,110
That's crazy.
Ran 11 hours.

133
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,880
You were at a hundred miles.
Yeah.

134
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,600
So I think the thing that,
how long does it take to drive a hundred

135
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,520
miles?
Okay.

136
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,341
Takes it.
I mean,

137
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:23,330
if you go a hundred miles an hour,
it takes an hour or longer to get to the

138
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,670
airport.
If the traffic on the phone,

139
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,740
how's Zach that are broke?
The US 100 mile record.

140
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,310
You averaged seven fucking minutes per
mile for almost 12 hours.

141
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,060
Dude,
that is insane.

142
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,120
That is fucking insane.
Bert Kreischer.

143
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,170
He brags when he runs seven minute miles
for like three miles.

144
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,070
What is burdened up running that the La
Marathon in six and a half,

145
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,940
six and a half.

146
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,700
I think it was shorter than that.
I think it was five,

147
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,380
five or something.
Yeah.

148
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,770
No,
no,

149
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,700
no.
Ours Dad.

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,180
Yeah,
he's fucking JV triggers.

151
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,490
Well,
I'll say,

152
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,720
I'll say,
I'll say this here,

153
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,710
bird,
if you're listening,

154
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,930
contact me.
I'll get you to four and a half in six

155
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:12,260
months.
You write up your challenge.

156
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,420
Zach fucking man,
if he tells you can do it too.

157
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,230
That is,
that is an incredible number that you

158
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:23,231
broke the u s 100 mile record by running
seven fucking minutes per mile.

159
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,950
It's,
it's,

160
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,430
it's crazy.
I talk about something and I don't type

161
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,480
it in.
I don't write a message.

162
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,040
I don't write an email and I'll see an
ad.

163
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,710
So it's fine on us all the time.
That doesn't happen to you.

164
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,090
I,
it hasn't happened to me,

165
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,070
but it's happened to enough people that
I believe you.

166
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,820
It's insane.

167
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,653
Well,
I believe you know what?

168
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,060
No matter what,
but really crazy.

169
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:42,170
I've talked to so many people that have
had that happen.

170
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Somebody sent me a tweet yesterday that
said they were listening to a podcast

171
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,660
that we were doing.
We were talking about something and then

172
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,960
that's something appeared in their
Google ads and he's like,

173
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,940
I never looked up this.
And oh no.

174
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,190
It wasn't a google ad.
It was a youtube search.

175
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,840
It was a youtube suggested.
He's like my fucking computers

176
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,880
listening.
Yep.

177
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,100
Cuter.
And what APP is doing this?

178
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:05,750
I mean,
I'm about to just go to a flip phone

179
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,950
because I don't want to,
it's,

180
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,590
it's bullshit.
We know that youtube audio is being

181
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,010
listened to because they're mining it to
for ad ad stuff already.

182
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,860
It's not even real.
It's not a spy thing that's just out

183
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,940
there.
That's how they do it.

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,030
Right,
but is that if you're playing things?

185
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,950
Yeah,
so when we're playing,

186
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,840
so if he's playing a podcasts on
Youtube,

187
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,640
youtube,
listening to that and that's how they

188
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,550
suggest it's just happening in their
ads.

189
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,610
What I think might be happening with
people are noticing now is not just that

190
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,090
it's happening within the software.
It's that your actual device,

191
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,350
the microphone is on and the laptop
camera on.

192
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,880
Some people block the camera with tape.
They're not blocking the microphone.

193
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,160
Exactly.
How the hell do you block the

194
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,570
microphone?
You don't even know where it is.

195
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,520
How do I,
how can we have like some sort of

196
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:51,080
tutorial about like how we can prevent
all of our shit from being collected?

197
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,700
Like that whole,
the facebook,

198
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,770
Cambridge analytica thing.
I feel like everyone missed the boat of

199
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,100
what that

200
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,430
story was.
You heard about that right?

201
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:59,490
At the Cambridge Analytica.
They're data mining all your shit.

202
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,000
It's like,
yeah,

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,280
if you're on facebook,
everything's being taken in data mind

204
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,430
that's very obvious,
but what wasn't really investigated,

205
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,880
I think channel four did this crazy
investigation where they pretended like

206
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,090
they were a patron trying to hire
Cambridge Analytica,

207
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:15,300
some billionaire dude and they put them
on camera.

208
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,670
It's all recorded.
The guys are basically like,

209
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,970
it's basically like a private
intelligence from almost like a black

210
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:24,810
water where you can hire mercenaries to
set up honeypots with prostitutes,

211
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,000
take down politicians,
spy on them.

212
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,390
They set up shell companies with mis
six,

213
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,580
um,
massaad um,

214
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,300
it's all just untraceable shit.
They just go stout.

215
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,210
They said they can ghost in out of
countries.

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,180
They literally said that they stage the
entire Kenyan election.

217
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,410
They were like,
we staged the whole thing.

218
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,570
We wrote all the speeches.
Yeah.

219
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,370
Ken,
this,

220
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,220
yeah.
This is,

221
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,320
this is backed by a billionaire.
Robert Mercer,

222
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:50,220
the same guy who can behind channel four
did a crazy investigation about it.

223
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,720
[inaudible].
