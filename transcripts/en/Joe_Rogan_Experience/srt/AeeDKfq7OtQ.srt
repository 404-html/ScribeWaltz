1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,520
Good.
Oh Shit,

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:03,780
we're live.
Hey fellow.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,310
What's going on dude?
What's up?

4
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:06,730
And thanks for doing this man.
I appreciate it.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,080
We both came in here.
We had a meal together unprepared.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,630
We both were.
We both were a little bit late.

7
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:14,730
We both had food.
I had a little food,

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,380
talked a little shit,
relaxed,

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,930
settled in a little nervous like I was 
in.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,470
I was in the right area for the podcast,
but when I rolled up I was like,

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,930
this doesn't look anything like a 
podcast.

12
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:26,040
And I was nervous that you're gonna.
Be like,

13
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,600
what the fuck are you?
But we will.

14
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:32,601
The next place.
I guess it's going to be even less like 

15
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:32,601
this place.
It's gonna.

16
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:32,601
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

17
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,960
Try to make it as discreet as possible.
Cool.

18
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,360
I'm going to hide it.
I'm going to,

19
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,670
I'm going to pretend to preschool.

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,380
I'm going to put like a preschool sign 
on the outside.

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,840
So that just starts like young single 
dudes.

22
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,950
Just avoid preschools at all costs.
That's the way it keeps dockers away.

23
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,930
Um,
push this sucker right up to your face 

24
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:52,930
and okay,
so learning a little bit.

25
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,140
So Dude,
you're talking about a guy who's done a 

26
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,121
lot of fucking cool shit.
You were on one of my favorite shows 

27
00:00:59,121 --> 00:00:59,490
last up until the end.
I got to be honest.

28
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,750
Yes,
at the end it was.

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,020
We can talk about fucking Jack your 
phone or then that guy just driving me 

30
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,480
crazy standard around that fucking pawn 
that brings people back to life.

31
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:13,810
Like he's waiting for his line to come 
up and then you know you,

32
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,510
you were part of the Lord of the rings 
man.

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,340
I mean fuck dude.
You don't know.

34
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,040
Those are two amazing historical things 
that you're a part of when you,

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,330
when you do it as an actor,
as a jobbing actor,

36
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,830
when you do it,
you stoked.

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,390
I mean,
I was super stoked to do those shows.

38
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:32,391
You don't realize at the time the real 
gravity of what you do and until years 

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,650
later,
but we,

40
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,630
me and Orlando and Elijah and billy went
out for dinner a couple of weeks ago and

41
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:40,830
we've sat around saying the further away
we get from Lord of the rings,

42
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:44,370
the more important it feels in our life.
So when my grandfathers and stuff,

43
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,630
I'm sure it would be like,
yeah,

44
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:47,910
we were involved in a piece of movie 
history,

45
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:52,110
but at the time you just like great job 
having fun and that was kind of the same

46
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,970
at last.
Although to be fair we'd lost,

47
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,760
cause we were isolated on an island in 
the show,

48
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:57,780
but also in person,
you know,

49
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,720
we're all on together.
We wouldn't suddenly,

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,780
I wasn't as exposed to the size of the 
show as much as when I went on hiatus 

51
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:11,400
and then people will follow me around 
and causing hassle and stuff.

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,070
But when you're in Hawaii there's like 
three restaurants to go to.

53
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,170
I avoid those three restaurants.
If anyone follows me,

54
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:18,450
I'll go to the library and then sit 
there for a couple of hours.

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,620
So I wasn't really aware that it became 
this pop culture phenomenon,

56
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,180
you know.
And then the end,

57
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,710
the end is like,
you know,

58
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:30,711
I'm on twitter and stuff and a lot of 
people on twitter ask me how'd you feel 

59
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:31,770
about the end?
And in all honesty,

60
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:33,750
I didn't watch it and I've not watched 
it.

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,430
You know,
I left at the end of season three,

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,280
came back in,
peppered in season four,

63
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:42,450
five and six,
but it wasn't in the show when it ended.

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,130
I mean I was in the finale,
but you know,

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,940
at that point I had injected myself from
that world and I was doing a movie in,

66
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,700
in New York,
in the lower east side,

67
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,290
playing a completely different 
character,

68
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:57,291
grave robber that was working at night.
I didn't want to expose myself to this 

69
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,711
charlie character who I played because I
felt like I was to bring the Charlie 

70
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:00,711
character

71
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:04,360
onto set the next day.
So people are always very,

72
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,800
very jazzed to talk to him about the 
ending.

73
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,600
How did you feel about it?
How did it make you feel?

74
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,950
Were you disappointed?
Did you love it?

75
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,670
And I'm always.
I always really fucking piss people off 

76
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,670
by going,
yeah,

77
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,670
I didn't see it.
You didn't see,

78
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,870
you know,
I just didn't see it because it felt 

79
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:19,870
like I was getting fucked towards the 
end.

80
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,470
I was like,
I'm not doing this.

81
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,220
And I walked away and I actually had an 
argument about my wife.

82
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,690
She's like,
you gotta watch the last episode.

83
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,650
I'm like,
I'm not watching it.

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,610
Not.
I'm not watching it.

85
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,690
I'm done.
I'm done.

86
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,580
I don't feel connected.
Same thing with Dexter.

87
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:35,581
I walked away with Dex.
I was completely committed in the 

88
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:35,581
beginning.
But you,

89
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:39,841
you walked away or your,
your character died during the golden 

90
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:39,940
time of the show.

91
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,920
The show was flawless at that time.
It was so god damn good.

92
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,340
It was so good.
Yeah.

93
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:50,341
I like to end the season three,
which I really felt like it was kind of 

94
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:53,810
peaking at that point was it was the 
show that every late night talk show 

95
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,950
hosts was talking about or daytime and 
it was in magazines and you know,

96
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,510
buzzfeed loved it and all that kind of 
stuff.

97
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,420
And then it Kinda felt like it was 
cresting,

98
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,450
you know?
And then I think the real bonus for the 

99
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,050
fens was the,
for the six years that it was on tv,

100
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,750
the creators that said,
it's not what you think it is,

101
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,410
it's something else.
Ultimately it kind of was.

102
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,600
Well,
a lot of people thought,

103
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,250
well,
they,

104
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,260
I think they say that they don't know 
what the fuck they're doing when they 

105
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,621
have a giant storyboard and they're 
moving pieces around and they did a 

106
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:25,621
phenomenal job though.

107
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:29,200
I mean given the constraints,
first of all of network television,

108
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,470
of knowing that you're going to have 
commercial breaks and knowing that you 

109
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,230
can have certain language and certain 
things,

110
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:38,350
you're not going to be able to show.
They did a fantastic job.

111
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:40,960
I mean it's just one of the all time 
great shows for sure.

112
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,850
Totally a great show.
Loved it,

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
loved being involved in it.
I think it will be,

114
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:49,721
you know,
something that people will talk about 

115
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:49,721
with me for the rest of my life.
A lot of times.

116
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:53,911
I'm sure you experienced this as well.
Sometimes the things that you up 

117
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:57,910
personally close to that you're working 
in is a huge part of your life.

118
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,030
It takes on a different aspect than just
these simple look from a fan's point of 

119
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,640
view.
Like for me last was,

120
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,470
it was Hawaii.
It was surfing,

121
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,400
it was being in love.

122
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,040
It was chameleons.
It was having a shitty day at work.

123
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,500
It was having a great day at work.
It was being hung over.

124
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,450
It was making new friends.
It was everything.

125
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,500
It was my life,
you know,

126
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,210
for a lot of fans.
It's like,

127
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,330
oh,
that's the TV show that I watched 

128
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:24,330
Wednesday night at eight.
And it was always my friend,

129
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,210
but lost for me was sometimes not my 
friends.

130
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,580
Sometimes my enemy sometimes he was 
incredible sometimes,

131
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,590
you know.
So when people come up to me and say,

132
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,160
what do you think about the show?
How do I make sense that it's,

133
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,760
it's so much of me.
Do you know what I mean?

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Your,
your point of view is completely 

135
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:42,680
singular.
I mean,

136
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,780
no one is going to have that point of 
view other than the actors on the show 

137
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,740
and even their point of view is going to
be kind of different than yours.

138
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Yeah.
People watching and they watched the 

139
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,481
finished product and so their 
association with is totally different 

140
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:54,481
than yours.
Polished,

141
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:56,170
beautiful.
There's no agenda.

142
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,790
They just wanting to be entertained,
you know?

143
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,010
Uh,
you know,

144
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,970
no politics.
There's a lot of politics on.

145
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:02,750
Last,
I mean fuck,

146
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,960
I got in trouble for saying this when 
lost was on tv,

147
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:07,610
but fuck it,
I don't care about that shit.

148
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,110
I watched,
I watched certain cast members go from 

149
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,811
making the pilot,
which was a six week pilot where 

150
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:16,811
everyone was hanging out with each other
real pie in at night.

151
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:17,810
We were all spending time with each 
other.

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,080
I watched her and act as be like,
this is the greatest job I have ever 

153
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,210
done.
I'm in Hawaii.

154
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:25,670
Is a tropical island getting paid?
Well,

155
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:30,671
the Castro amazing.
We're going on this journey together to 

156
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:34,420
shoot in like episode three or four of 
the first season and hearing people 

157
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,531
saying,
I can't believe I'm not unless 

158
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:38,531
Letterman,
why am I not on Letterman?

159
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,620
You're like,
two months ago it was the greatest thing

160
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,900
you've ever done and now you're like,
why can't fly to New York?

161
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,690
Why can't I be on a 12:00
flight to New York?

162
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:46,490
Why do I have to be on a 9:00
AM flight to New York?

163
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,730
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're missing it.

164
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,500
You're missing it.
You know?

165
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,080
That's so common though.
That's very common with actors.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,970
Actors are strange breed.
When I was on news radio,

167
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,790
we once had this discussion about 
Thursday night,

168
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,400
Thursday night lineup on NBC was where 
you wanted to be.

169
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,170
That was Seinfeld,
that was friends.

170
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,910
That was the spot and it was fucking sex
in the city and the single guy.

171
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:12,740
And he's what?
Paul Simms,

172
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,010
the creator of a news radio called the 
shit sandwich spot.

173
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,550
So like you have your two good shows and
in between your show you would put dog 

174
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,790
shit and um,
everybody was complaining,

175
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,810
why can't we be on Thursday?

176
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,530
And I'm like,
guys,

177
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:29,531
last time I checked we're on television,
like we're on a sitcom on actual 

178
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,970
television.
And it's funny,

179
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,240
like these are the golden years,
like we're going to look back when we're

180
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,970
old and we're going to say fuck,
we were so lucky.

181
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,770
But while it's happening and everybody's
like,

182
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:43,400
why am I not in the Hollywood reporter?
Why am I not getting a development deal?

183
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,520
Why can't I start my own movie?
And what,

184
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,850
you know,
why did he get it?

185
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,290
And I did that in my teens and early 
twenties.

186
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,740
But how come he's got it?
And my agent knew,

187
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,140
um,
the,

188
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,580
my English agent knew I'm not with 
anymore.

189
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,010
At one point,
you know,

190
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,760
we lived in and he sent me down.
He was like,

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
the reason why he's getting it and 
you'll know it's because you are not 

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,310
him.
He has a completely different journey in

193
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:05,630
his life.

194
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,460
He looks different,
yanks different.

195
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,710
You're not the same.
He won't get the roles that you're going

196
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:14,711
to get.
He won't get the opportunities that 

197
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,340
you'll get and you won't get his book 
quit that bullshit because that's not to

198
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,020
get you anywhere.
A great perspective.

199
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,840
So true.
It's hard to find someone to lay it down

200
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,650
like that.
My agent was not only.

201
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,080
That's great.
You had a good guy.

202
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,190
He was,
he was really good.

203
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,380
And then you have to absorb it,
right?

204
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,470
You have to take it in and you have to 
separate it from your ego and all your 

205
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,370
preconceived notions and assumptions and
actually absorb it.

206
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,610
Right?
And also swallow that very bitter pill 

207
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,790
of regardless health of however unfair 
you think it is and how it should change

208
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:45,560
and be justified in one day it will be 
okay,

209
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,660
maybe it won't.
And that's really,

210
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,390
I mean we're talking about one very 
specific endeavor,

211
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:55,391
but it's analogous to life itself 
because people will look at people that 

212
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:56,040
are doing other things life and there'll
be

213
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
upset that they're not doing those 
things even though they've taken very 

214
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,790
little or no effort to try to do any of 
those things.

215
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,660
Right.
It's just,

216
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,540
they,
they become haters know.

217
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,610
And it's crazy that even a successful 
person like honestly a huge show like 

218
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,150
loss can become a hater.

219
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,050
Oh yeah,
yeah.

220
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,610
Totally adorable.
I mean,

221
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,350
it's kind of funny.
I mean,

222
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,390
it's a human characteristic,
right?

223
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,400
We're always going to compare ourselves 
to other people.

224
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,470
I went for a walk yesterday around 
Griffith Park and I was talking with my 

225
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,280
friend about the whole comparison thing 
and I was saying like,

226
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,480
you know that Bill Gates gets up some 
days and he's like,

227
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,240
what the fuck?
No,

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,070
Jesus Christ,
I can't fucking catch a break,

229
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,390
you know?
Just having a shit day,

230
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,380
all your problems or relative,
you know,

231
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,620
and it's okay to have them,
we're all going to have them.

232
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:48,621
It's just you got to navigate your way 
through them with a little bit of grace 

233
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:48,621
and it seems like those

234
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,230
pitfalls in life or just a part of being
a human being in this weird world 

235
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,170
because this world is not like any world
that was ever that ever existed.

236
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,380
There was never a million different 
people that you could compare yourself 

237
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,790
to that were on television or singing 
songs or on the internet or like there's

238
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:09,791
all these different people that you can 
look at and then you look at yourself 

239
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,461
and make these comparisons.
It used to just be the people that were 

240
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,651
around you and that's what it used to be
for the entire history of the human 

241
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:19,181
race.
It was only the people you could see 

242
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:19,181
with your eyes and come in contact with 
other that you didn't have.

243
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:24,011
This weird perspective and I think it's 
part of what a human being is.

244
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,390
We we're constantly striving to improve.
It's a why we stay alive.

245
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,210
It's why we build homes.
It's why we try to get good at a career.

246
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:38,870
It's like this,
this desire to get better at things also

247
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:43,871
leads you to compare your own progress 
against the progress of others and 

248
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:44,390
that's where the pitfall comes in.

249
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,050
Right?
And obviously a lot of people in in this

250
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,640
new society that we've created with 
social media and instant information,

251
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,670
a lot of those people that have become 
successful and famous are in those 

252
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,880
places because they are the fucking 
elite.

253
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,980
So now we're comparing ourselves to the 
elite.

254
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,450
Like you could be a great basketball 
player.

255
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,430
I have an amazing game.
Come home,

256
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,280
stop watching youtube feeds of Dwayne 
Wade,

257
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,750
you know Lebron,
and you're like,

258
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,620
oh,
I'm fucking terrible.

259
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:09,490
No,
you're not terrible.

260
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,700
These are the exception.
And we're exposing ourselves to the 

261
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,610
exception almost all the time.
Now everyone on twitter is brilliant.

262
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,960
You know,
everyone in that sense,

263
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:21,040
those comparisons are great and 
beneficial because they force you to try

264
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:26,041
to achieve a higher standard.
As long as you can keep yourself from 

265
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:26,041
going mad.
Um,

266
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,850
what about the fact that you'll never 
get there?

267
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:29,050
Like,
I'm never going to slam dunk.

268
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,080
I've never,
I don't have the athletic body ability 

269
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,390
to slam dunk,
so if my whole ambition was like,

270
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,360
I want us London,
I know Boykins can slam dunk.

271
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,200
He smaller than me,
I can't do it,

272
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,820
I just can't do it.
You know I've tried.

273
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:42,840
I'm don't get anywhere near.
I don't have the ability to do is now.

274
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,950
How much have you tried?
You know what I mean?

275
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,320
Like if you went to a strength and 
conditioning coach,

276
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:47,860
he said,
listen,

277
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:49,630
I'm Dominic Monaghan.
I got a lot of fucking money.

278
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,631
Come on bitch.
You're going to get me in fucking top 

279
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:54,631
notch shape.
Going to do dead

280
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:59,040
lifts.
You're going to get me pumped up with 

281
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,040
steroids.
I'm Duncan,

282
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,040
dude.
I'm fucking done.

283
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,680
What is it that the vertical leap leap 
down?

284
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,220
Maybe I'm not trying to the extent that,
you know,

285
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,870
some people have,
but I don't know.

286
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:09,871
I think there's,
I think there's something potentially 

287
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:09,871
harmful.
You know,

288
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:09,871
it's like the whole thing with beautiful
women.

289
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:10,690
You know what I mean?
A lot of people,

290
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:15,460
a lot of ladies and maybe men feel that 
pressure to be that perfect thing,

291
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,800
but that perfect thing isn't necessarily
real well.

292
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:22,801
You know what's really frustrating when 
you meet a girl who doesn't like her 

293
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:26,671
body and you love her body and she's 
comparing herself to stick figures that 

294
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:31,261
are like in models that are wearing 
these weird outfits that way 18 pounds 

295
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:34,060
on your body is a woman's body.
The fat,

296
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:35,770
the stuff that you don't like,
weed like that.

297
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,780
Like a fat ass.
Yeah.

298
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:39,690
I mean it's a part of being sexy.
Yeah.

299
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,420
It's like it's,
it's a,

300
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,630
it's actually attractive to men,
but women are comparing to the way 

301
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,750
fashion models look and the way other 
women perceive.

302
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:52,751
Like there's certain women,
like I know this lady who she doesn't 

303
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,170
think that women look good unless they 
look like sticks.

304
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,210
Right?
Like she has this weird thing in her 

305
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,210
head and like her friends would try to 
talk to her about it.

306
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,320
Like that's not true.
And,

307
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,030
but after awhile you just get tired of 
talking about crazy.

308
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,190
Look,
you look great.

309
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,080
Really Great.
Like don't this,

310
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,120
this ain't about that.
You could be born in Ethiopia with no 

311
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,120
feet,
you know,

312
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,120
you could,
you could have been fucked.

313
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,971
You could have been one of those kids 
that's born in Iraq that has to deal 

314
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,120
with the aftermath of all the fucking 
hazardous waste.

315
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,360
It's in that area that's causing all 
these kids to be born with massive 

316
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,820
deformities.
Like you're lucky shit.

317
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,300
You can't go on about the fact that 
you're not skinny enough.

318
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,980
I mean,
obviously a lot of that is the,

319
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:34,981
is the societal thing may not make a big
distinction between like a girl's body 

320
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:35,920
and a woman's buddy.
You know what I mean?

321
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:38,620
There is a difference.
Most of the fashion lines,

322
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:42,850
one to put that models in the clothes 
when they have a gills buddy,

323
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,340
because there they were calling.
Yeah,

324
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,400
a coat hanger.
That's the way to look at it because 

325
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,400
that's what they really are there.
Clothes hangers,

326
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,271
like your clothes look best when they're
not being stuffed into like Jennifer 

327
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:54,790
Lopez.
His body was fucked.

328
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,970
But to a man like that's what men like 
to see that fucking ass waist.

329
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,080
Jesus fiance.
Yeah,

330
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,150
exactly.
That's a fucking woman,

331
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,500
yes,
but the,

332
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,540
you know,
those women we were talking about this 

333
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:10,990
the other day,
like that didn't used to be hot,

334
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,220
like just a few.

335
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,130
Like if you go back and look at the 
playboys when like the seventies and the

336
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:20,131
eighties,
they didn't even concentrate on assets 

337
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:22,500
like it wasn't for whatever reason.
That wasn't a focus on what happened or 

338
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,120
do we think it's the hip hop community?
Do we think it's.

339
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,040
The wrapper is brilliant.
I mean,

340
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:32,041
I remember being 12 and seeing a cover 
of an ice tea album that had like one 

341
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,970
onesy bikinis with big assets.
Oh Damn,

342
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,990
that's true,
right.

343
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:42,991
That one where ice had a machine gun 
behind his back and the girl was in a 

344
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:43,600
bikini and she had.
Yeah,

345
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:46,260
she had a thong on.
He may have ended up marrying a man.

346
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I think he did.
I think that was his wife for awhile 

347
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,280
before he got rid of her and got the 
cocoa right.

348
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,250
And that was the first time I was 
exposed to that,

349
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,100
you know,
because for me it was like Princess Leia

350
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,290
growing up was my thing,
my jam.

351
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,660
We didn't even know what her body looked
like.

352
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:01,170
We had no idea there it is.
But even then,

353
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,270
harass.
Yeah,

354
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,990
in comparison to today,
it's not quite that,

355
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,670
but at the time that was kind of 
revolutionary.

356
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,860
I'm not hating it.
It's not terrible,

357
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,070
but that's nothing compared to,
you know,

358
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,190
what is her name?
The fucking Nicky Manila to go right 

359
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:17,590
here on power.
Similar just to the right.

360
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:22,530
Then that goes click on that one,
which I bought that.

361
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,840
That's much more wrapper,
but it's what's interesting is it seems 

362
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,580
the attraction to that seems 
fundamental.

363
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,240
So why wasn't it there in the seventies 
and the eighties?

364
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:35,770
It seems genetic,
right?

365
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,320
Was it seemed to be.
I don't know.

366
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,030
Obscene.
Oh God.

367
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,250
This folk hero.

368
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,620
Her ass is retarded.
Nicki Minaj.

369
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,540
Anaconda picture.
Like what is that?

370
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,680
Is that real?
Yeah,

371
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,490
I think so.
Wow.

372
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,550
A little extra brush and.
But yeah,

373
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,380
maybe.
But whatever.

374
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,280
That's insane.
It's phenomenal what genetics,

375
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,580
but again,
like Andale obviously it's a lot of it 

376
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,371
is girls doing squats and girls 
concentrating on that area and 

377
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:04,620
developing their butt,
but I just.

378
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:09,621
It's weird to me that that wasn't a big 
deal in the seventies and the eighties 

379
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:14,271
and whatever,
and then somewhere along the line the 

380
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:16,491
hip hop community sort of ignited what 
seems to be a fundamental attraction 

381
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:17,000
that men have.
Right.

382
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,000
Also like,
you know,

383
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,880
when I started to get interested in 
girls and being able to actually make 

384
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,080
out with girls and spend time with 
girls,

385
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,380
those girls were girls that was,
you know,

386
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,300
11,
12,

387
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:34,301
13 year old.
There was no concept of any of those 

388
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:34,880
girls having a Ba donk,
donk like that.

389
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:38,480
So maybe for me it was the thing that I 
was reaching for.

390
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:41,570
I'm never gonna get them never going to 
get this womanly thing.

391
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,080
I'm going to be with these little 
waifish girls because I was a little kid

392
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,190
at the time.
And then later on,

393
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,360
I don't know,
there's a,

394
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,110
there's a fantasy element to it.
Right?

395
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,630
But why?
Well,

396
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,640
for girls though,
the look of a man being like a big 

397
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,850
muscular,
like the rock or something like that,

398
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,640
that's always existed like Conan the 
barbarian and you know,

399
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:04,580
that's always been around.
You go back to the Robert e Dot Howard,

400
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,350
illustrations that Frank Frazetta did 
like way back in the seventies is 

401
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,850
fucking yolked out,
giant barren.

402
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,880
It's universal Roman Greek gods,
sculptures that have been around 

403
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,910
forever.
They're all cut and ripped and stuff,

404
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,220
but the women back then were all fat and
Rubin ask,

405
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,370
you know,
they didn't have those bodies.

406
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,380
The bodies have today is like a weird 
change and it doesn't exist in the mail.

407
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,100
So it exists in women.
Yeah.

408
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,720
Interesting.

409
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah.
That is interesting.

410
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,870
I mean I,
you know,

411
00:17:31,871 --> 00:17:36,871
I appreciate the lady that kind of takes
care of itself simply because I feel as 

412
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,330
if I need to,
you know,

413
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,880
I,
I'm not the biggest dude in the world,

414
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:47,881
but I go to the gym when I'm free 
because it gets me out of the house and 

415
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:50,640
also I like to try and go to the gym 
Monday to Friday so that my Saturday,

416
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:55,641
Sunday I can do whatever at one and I 
eat relatively correctly so that on the 

417
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,720
weekend if I want to chow down some 
food,

418
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,730
there's a little noise.
It's not going to make a huge difference

419
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,820
if I'm doing that.
I would like to be with someone who has 

420
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,391
the same common sense about the body and
the way that they look like it's a,

421
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,170
it's a bit of,
it's a bit of an issue,

422
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:18,171
but for me because like I love pizza and
I like buffalo wings and I could easily 

423
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:19,500
eat all that stuff and,
and get much bigger,

424
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:21,450
but I'm aware of the fact that it's not 
healthy for you.

425
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,180
You shouldn't necessarily be doing that 
to your body putting you under that much

426
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:29,181
stress,
but also I want to feel and look and 

427
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:32,361
present myself good because I want to 
feel good about myself and the issue 

428
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,850
with people just kind of abuse in 
themselves in that way.

429
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Excuse me.
Says something a little sinister about 

430
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,580
how they personally feel about 
themselves.

431
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,720
Self Abuse,
right?

432
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:47,721
I mean if you,
if you know the food is making you more 

433
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:47,880
unhealthy and you're eating on a daily 
basis,

434
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,430
that is a form of self abuse and I don't
necessarily feel attracted to people who

435
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,630
are abusing themselves on a consistent 
basis.

436
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,150
Yeah,
I mean that's natural,

437
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,180
but it is.
It's also weirdly natural for people to 

438
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,151
abuse themselves to get caught in that 
cycle of overeating and then feeling 

439
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:08,801
shitty because you're overeating and 
that's a very common cycle for people 

440
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:12,760
get trapped in and I really wonder what 
the mechanism of that is like what's 

441
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,841
the,
what's the evolutionary advantage to 

442
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,230
having that in the human species?
Because it's so common.

443
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,250
I mean,
everywhere you look,

444
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:24,251
especially in America,
she just see overweight people 

445
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:24,251
everywhere.
They know.

446
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:26,210
They have to know.
It's not like this is some secret that's

447
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:29,060
locked up in the fucking vaults in 
Qumran.

448
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:32,330
You have to crack the code to find out 
that you shouldn't eat pizza at 3:00

449
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:32,780
in the morning.

450
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,540
Right.
And they don't suddenly wake up and go,

451
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,660
oh my God,
what is this?

452
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,790
This.
They've seen it occur.

453
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,510
I don't.
I don't think that's the evolution of us

454
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:44,380
species.
I think that's those moments where we do

455
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,210
want to abuse herself.
We do want to feel badly.

456
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,400
It doesn't,
it doesn't extend us as a species.

457
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,300
To me it's,
you know,

458
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,940
it's the way that we feel that,
but light you,

459
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,610
you eat relatively healthy,
you work out and stuff.

460
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,280
Like what's your food?
Kryptonite?

461
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,990
What is the thing where you look at.
Oh my God,

462
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,170
I love it.
I gotta have it.

463
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,040
Um,
I do love pizza.

464
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,450
I do love Shitty pastas and pizzas and 
things that I know that I shouldn't eat.

465
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,760
That's pretty much it,
but I'm pretty good because I,

466
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,130
I enjoy healthy food.
Like I had,

467
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:14,340
I was eating Vegan food when he came in 
here because I want to,

468
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,180
you know,
because I just did yoga and I'm like,

469
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,720
uh,
that's a good thing to eat.

470
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,700
So it feels good.

471
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,690
Do you give yourself like a free pass?
You're like every Sunday I can have a 

472
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,290
slice of pizza.
I

473
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,640
don't though.
I do,

474
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:31,330
but I kind of would,
if I was more inclined to eat shitty,

475
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,450
like if I was,
if it was like more of a thing that I 

476
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:36,790
had to separate myself from,
but it's not that hard for me.

477
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,910
I eat relatively clean because I like to
eat relatively clean.

478
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,830
I mean,
I honestly relatively clean,

479
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:46,831
I shouldn't say overwhelmingly clean.
Most of the food I eat is really 

480
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:46,831
healthy.
It's just,

481
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:46,960
I just,
I know too,

482
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,560
you know,
at this point in time I'd be upset at 

483
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,241
myself if I didn't.
I just know too much about the actual 

484
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:56,761
effects.
So the mornings generally in the 

485
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:57,430
mornings I either eat fruit or I eat a 
drink,

486
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:58,370
a Kale shake,
you know,

487
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,720
one of those,
a blended up shakes with Kale and celery

488
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:03,430
and cucumber and garlic,
all that jazz.

489
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,060
Um,
and then in the afternoon it depends.

490
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:08,440
But if I feel like having a 
cheeseburger,

491
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,770
I'll have a fucking cheeseburgers.
Yeah,

492
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,460
yeah.
Well,

493
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,610
you know,
we were talking about this stuff that 

494
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:15,610
like,
I,

495
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,780
excuse me,
I'm lucky enough to travel nine months 

496
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:19,780
of my year pretty intensively,
you know,

497
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,800
a week in a place,
10 days in a place,

498
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,240
a week in a place,
10 days in the place.

499
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,240
Because of that,
lots of long distance flying.

500
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,590
I have no semblance of a schedule in 
terms of food.

501
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,830
So I lose weight based on those factors.
And also the fact that my metabolism 

502
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,630
metabolism is very high running,
I need very little sleep to function if 

503
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,840
this my mommy's tummy,
this all the time.

504
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:46,841
And I was a kid.
If there was something more interesting 

505
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:46,970
for me to do,
I would forego eating.

506
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,590
So she'd be like,
dinner's on the table.

507
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:49,370
I'd be like,
wait,

508
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:50,960
can I just finish this thing?
She was like,

509
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:51,440
okay,
fine.

510
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:55,220
And she said you would just not have 
dinner and then she would have to remind

511
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:55,970
me you didn't eat dinner.

512
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,600
And I'm like,
okay,

513
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,890
let me.
And then I'll go back to that thing.

514
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,660
So you would eat just like NASA,
like a necessity pleasurable thing.

515
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:07,661
I just got to get into your mind,
just get it down because my mom and dad 

516
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:07,661
told me,
I mean I would,

517
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,720
I was obsessed by football,
soccer when I was a kid.

518
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I would get up in the morning,
run out my house when I was going to 

519
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,200
school right at my house before 
breakfast,

520
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,650
no breakfast,
get to school,

521
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,010
play football for an hour before 9:00.
So from eight til nine and play football

522
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:20,810
with my friends.
Break time was 10,

523
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:23,990
15 to 1115.
Most people ate at that point.

524
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:27,530
Most people had a snack chips,
fruit sandwich.

525
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,660
I would play football.
Lunchtime was an ally.

526
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,690
All my friends would eat.
I would play football first thing that I

527
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:35,150
would put in my mouth,
pretty much all.

528
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,400
It's certainly more than average in 
school.

529
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,390
Like I would say 65 percent of the time 
would be candy on the way home.

530
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,810
So I'd walk into the convenience store 
by,

531
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,830
by one lbs.
With a candy.

532
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,060
Must have been starving.
Dude.

533
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:51,650
I was amazed when I was a kid and I was 
burning what I dunno,

534
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,470
10,000
calories a day and just putting sugar in

535
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:54,860
me,
you know,

536
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:59,180
so I was super skinny and that has 
transferred over into my adult life.

537
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:02,180
Where my trainer has always said to me 
is consistency.

538
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,340
Dom,
like you need to be in the gym five days

539
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,120
a week.
So I'm like,

540
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:06,890
Okay Ryan,
I'm here for a month,

541
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,460
let's do five days a week and get it 
poppin.

542
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,160
And he's like,
okay,

543
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,440
cool.
And then like three weeks in,

544
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,150
I'm like,
I'm not like I put on a little bit,

545
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:14,870
but I'm not feeling it.

546
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,680
And he's.
And he says,

547
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,750
let's talk about what you're reading.
I'm like,

548
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,120
couple of mouthfuls of oatmeal,
breakfast,

549
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,120
some pine and pool and some grapes for 
lunch.

550
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:24,530
She's like,
no,

551
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:24,740
no,
no,

552
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:25,910
no.
You need tuna steak.

553
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:27,290
You need salmon,
you need chicken,

554
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,670
you need Tofu,
you need fat.

555
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,530
You need to own the genie,
the Avocados.

556
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,330
And he would show me what I'm supposed 
to be.

557
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:34,670
I'm not connie either.
I can't get it in my system.

558
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,950
I'm going to Puke.
But you know,

559
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:39,490
everyone's got their own thing that 
they're dealing with,

560
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,890
but I'm never going to be as big as you.
Your frame is bigger and you're just,

561
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,810
you're,
you're naturally big guy.

562
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,110
What my train said is like you can get 
caught,

563
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,170
you can get Bruce Lee ish,
but you're never going to get John 

564
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,040
Claude van damage.
But the way to do that is to still eat 

565
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,040
food.

566
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,660
That fire.
Or if you did want to pack weight on,

567
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:02,940
you would have to do these big compound 
exercises like deadlifts.

568
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,400
You'd have to do squats,
you'd have to do things where your body 

569
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,730
literally has to change your body.
Your bone structure has to change.

570
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,710
Your bone structure will change.
I mean,

571
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,850
it will densify it.
You did.

572
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,500
The density of your bone structure 
definitely alters when you do heavy,

573
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:20,070
heavy lifting because your body 
realizes,

574
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,200
hey,
this dumb mother fuckers going to pick 

575
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,200
up big,
heavy shit all day.

576
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,280
We have to get thicker.
So it makes you,

577
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,640
it literally will make your bones 
thicker and denser.

578
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,480
I want the biggest I ever asked.
Can you pull up the.

579
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,720
Can you pull up the,
um,

580
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,590
the poster for the pilot of lost,
like the first ever poster philosophies,

581
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,730
all of us on a beach.
The biggest I ever was,

582
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,910
I was probably like 158 pounds.
Something that,

583
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,800
which is big on me.
I put on like 12,

584
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:47,940
14 pounds of muscle and my fucking 
biceps like this.

585
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,300
And I never got that big ever again.
And at the time,

586
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:53,190
what were you doing a.
no,

587
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,370
it's like a more of an iconic silhouette
on a beach.

588
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,460
Hang on.
Oh Jesus.

589
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,250
Okay.
Uh,

590
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,110
what was I doing?
I was,

591
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,850
I had food delivery and the food and the
food delivery was like,

592
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,160
I'm going to the gym,
give me clean food,

593
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:16,190
give me lots of clean food.
I was in the gym once a day and then I 

594
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,860
did a little bit of running around my 
local area and it was consistency.

595
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,500
Yeah,
that's right.

596
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,380
Consistent.
It's about getting a good groove gone,

597
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:30,410
right?
It's about just getting a good habit 

598
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,511
going or this is what you do.
They say that if you could do something 

599
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:35,451
every day for 90 days,
then it will become like a part of you 

600
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,070
to become like they say that that's one 
of the best ways to quit smoking is if 

601
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,660
you can get addicted to something else 
and get,

602
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,310
get used to doing that every day.

603
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

604
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,540
But there's a slightly high res version.
You can't really see it,

605
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,800
but I am huge death of me.
I mean I don't look cute because I'm not

606
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,690
the biggest guy in the world,
but like you can.

607
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,570
Well I can see at least let my fucking.
I see some muscle now.

608
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,490
My biceps are going off right there.

609
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,340
Was there any hesitation at all being 
sequestered on this island like that and

610
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:03,270
being a part of this crazy show where 
you had to change your whole life?

611
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,320
I mean,
you had to move.

612
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,960
Yeah.
I met Jj Abrams and he just,

613
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,970
he just solved all of those conundrums 
foaming how?

614
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,350
So He's just a brilliant guy,
you know,

615
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:19,351
you meet brilliant guys every so often 
and I think anytime you're around 

616
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:23,011
someone who's brilliant,
you have to sit up and take notes,

617
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,320
you know,
and I just was aware that I was around 

618
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,011
someone with a very fast moving smart 
mind and I went in for a general 

619
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,660
audition and sat down with Jj and his 
partner Brian Burke and we just told 

620
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,530
about English comedy for like 45 
minutes.

621
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:45,090
Talks about Monty Python,
Eddie Izzard and uh,

622
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,540
the goons and the goodies and Derek and 
clive and we did this whole thing.

623
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,830
We,
we're doing impressions for each other,

624
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,250
no audition.
And I left and I called my agent and he 

625
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,250
was like,
how did it go?

626
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,560
And I was like,
it went well,

627
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:56,520
but we didn't talk about the show.

628
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,370
We just talked about comedy and goofed 
around and stuff.

629
00:26:59,371 --> 00:26:59,970
And he was like,
all right,

630
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,190
cool.
Then they got back in,

631
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,570
touch them and said we loved,
um,

632
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,990
they had this character of Charlie who 
at the time was this 55 year old rocker,

633
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,020
like a,
like a Robert Plant guy at the time that

634
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:17,021
had been through all of it and was in 
the tail end of his career and got stuck

635
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,800
on the island and they reworked it.
And when Jj and I sat down,

636
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,810
I was like,
what is more frustrating for the artist 

637
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,800
to have the barest glimpse of fame?
You've got this one hit.

638
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,460
And it all almost worked out his entire 
life.

639
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:37,461
It almost did it for him and it was on 
this fucking island and he can't get 

640
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:38,550
back to the place where he could make it
all happen.

641
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:40,080
You know?
And I think,

642
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,160
you know,
Jj love responded to that kind of 

643
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,160
frustration level.

644
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,760
And I was just aware that it was gonna 
be a big deal.

645
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,830
He directed the pilot.
He Co wrote the pilot,

646
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,070
it felt like something that was gonna 
be,

647
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,370
you know,
big and impressive and I trusted him.

648
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,360
Um,
and there wasn't a huge amount when,

649
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,220
when it's a,
when it's a no brainer job like that,

650
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,470
it doesn't take a huge amount of 
thought.

651
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,250
You're just like,
well yeah,

652
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:10,251
of course I'm going to do it.
There's no living in Hawaii would be a 

653
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:13,950
really tough decision to make because I 
wouldn't mind one day living in Hawaii,

654
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:17,670
but I would have to be really done with 
cities.

655
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,880
I could just done like,
I need something different in my life.

656
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,590
I bought,
I got a job.

657
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,440
They want you to move to Hawaii.
Bill.

658
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,950
Ooh Boy.
I don't know.

659
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,860
It's.
Did you get island fever vault?

660
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,920
You know,
I actually didn't.

661
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,060
A lot of people in the cast did.
I'm into jungles and forests and animals

662
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:38,061
and stuff.
So for me I was kind of buzzed enough 

663
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:39,270
that I had said to them before I moved 
out there because they were putting this

664
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,080
in houses.
I was like,

665
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:45,081
can you put me in the jungle?
Can you put me straight up in the 

666
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:45,081
jungle,
in a house,

667
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,890
the surrounded by trees and animals and 
because they didn't know me,

668
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,800
the producers like,
you don't want to do that.

669
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,810
You're going to be isolated,
you're going to be on your own is going 

670
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:53,810
to be nothing around you.
That's exactly what I wanted to do.

671
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,670
So I ended up moving,
living in Kailua for a little bit.

672
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,780
Then moved to Atlanta guy for a little 
bit with Atlanta.

673
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,310
Kai.
Lenny has this loop.

674
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,610
It's a little half a mile loop,
very exclusive little part of the 

675
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,350
islands,
south east part of the island.

676
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,540
Um,
Michelle pfeiffer has a house there,

677
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:15,660
so I was able to watch her go on a daily
run every day,

678
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:17,810
which is pretty fantastic.
Lives there,

679
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:22,811
Huh?
I think she has like a summary place 

680
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:22,811
around there.
She's still,

681
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:22,980
oh my gosh,
you're so cute.

682
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,760
Some little as well.
She's doing well at the time.

683
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:29,810
She's probably in her mid forties,
mid fifties at least.

684
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,010
Yeah.
Maybe still hot.

685
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,840
So hot.
She'd wear a little,

686
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,320
you know,
cycling shorts and a little like running

687
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,130
thing.
And I was like,

688
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,280
oh.
She say hi to you ever.

689
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,290
No,
I never said hi to read them.

690
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,980
Make sure that I was just watching out 
the window in my binoculars.

691
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,030
Fucking citing scope.
Right.

692
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,630
But Hawaii was,
you know,

693
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,280
it was,
it was cool.

694
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,630
I liked it.
I was,

695
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,900
I learned to surf in New Zealand,
which is a gnarly place to serve very 

696
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,990
cold waves,
relatively dumb p waves.

697
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,540
There's no curl on that wave.
It just picks you up and drops you.

698
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,550
Which if it's the first time you've ever
served it,

699
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,990
you assume all waves of light that you 
have to be in a wetsuit.

700
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,070
Last time you had to be in buoys.
Uh,

701
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,430
there were times where it was so cold 
out.

702
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,460
Come out of the water.
They'd have to use two hands to unlock 

703
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,420
my car door because I couldn't use one 
hand.

704
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:17,590
It would,
it had frozen,

705
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:18,250
you know,
so I'd have to go.

706
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:19,750
Wow.
Meanwhile,

707
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,770
you moved to Hawaii boardshorts after 
wear tee shirts,

708
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,920
water bottles everywhere.
I don't think so.

709
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:31,060
I was big on surfing and in the first 
month or so that I was in Hawaii,

710
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,290
I went to the apple store in Honolulu 
and uh,

711
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,960
I met one of my favorite surfers of all 
time.

712
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,040
I got called Kalani,
rob,

713
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,400
and when I was playing Kelly slater's 
pro surfer game,

714
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,760
I would always pick Kalani because he 
did the most radical moves,

715
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,080
you know,
so I'm in the apple store,

716
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,430
he's there with his boys.

717
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,420
I was like,
shit,

718
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,640
that's Kalani Romp.
And then he comes up to me.

719
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,210
He's like,
Dude,

720
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:53,530
you're that guy in load the rings.
I was like,

721
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:55,660
Oh shit,
it's on now.

722
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,580
So I was like,
you're Kalani,

723
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:58,120
rob.
I was like,

724
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,910
I'm here for like nine months,
can you help me out surfing?

725
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,390
He was like,
yeah,

726
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:03,190
we're going to go to the no show now.
So I came with him,

727
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,430
hung out,
uh,

728
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,360
and we became really tight.
So a huge story for a while.

729
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,970
For me it was getting to know Kalani.
I mean he taught me into waves.

730
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,971
I had no business being involved in.
There's a place called goat island on 

731
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:21,601
the north shore,
which is a heavy wave and you have to 

732
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:24,631
paddle out to an island,
walk across the island because then 

733
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:25,270
you're going to miss the break and then 
paddle out past the break.

734
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,270
There's no concept of you're paddling 
out through the break because it's so 

735
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,690
big.
So as with Kalani and a few of his mates

736
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,490
and we were all getting ready and he 
came over to me,

737
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,600
he was like,
okay,

738
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,060
this is the most hectic wave and ever 
going to take you into.

739
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,280
Stay close to me.
If you need help,

740
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,340
let me know.
Don't fuck around because it can kill 

741
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,470
you.
And don't go left.

742
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,400
Go right.
No,

743
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:46,390
no,
don't go right.

744
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,970
Go left because it's gonna appeal left.
But if you go right,

745
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,190
you're in the braking zone and you're 
fucked.

746
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,860
I was like,
alright,

747
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,910
cool.
So sense of fucking terrible story 

748
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,230
coming out.
So we.

749
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,310
So we paddle out and I'm having fun and 
I'm watching everyone in the lineup on 

750
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,420
about 10 feet away from the drop zone.
So I'm able to like sit down on the wave

751
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:06,700
and watched people like get on the side.

752
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,630
I'm like,
alright cool.

753
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,310
I got this fast,
I'm going to,

754
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,050
I'm going to take it.
So I paddled,

755
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:14,530
I battle a battle with,
picks me up big like Oh shit,

756
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,430
super powerful drops me and I really try
and go left.

757
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:19,870
I like cut the board and then try and go
left.

758
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,871
But it's so powerful because breaking 
here on my left that it spits me to the 

759
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:28,381
right.
I'm fully aware that it sent me to the 

760
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:28,381
right.
So I'm like okay shit,

761
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:31,390
I'm just going to wipe out,
take a big breath and paddle out.

762
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,830
So I wipe out are going to come up.
And as is usually the case with,

763
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,140
if you're surfing anything above 
overhead,

764
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,010
when you come up that wave's coming

765
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,990
for you against what you have to do is 
take a huge breath,

766
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,410
go under and it's the next time you come
up do you can make progress because your

767
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:46,610
out breath,
you disoriented.

768
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,610
I do that and Joe,
I just can't.

769
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,330
I can never catch a break.
So I go under,

770
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,620
thrown around by the washing machine,
come up the thing,

771
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:55,340
okay,
get on your board,

772
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:56,840
start paddling,
look where's right there.

773
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm like,
oh,

774
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,210
go and drink in,
hold my breath,

775
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,240
come up again.
And I'm trying to time it so that I can 

776
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,240
get it.
I just getting pounded,

777
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,370
pounded,
pounded,

778
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:09,371
pounded.
And at one point I see Kalani paddling 

779
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:09,371
over to me.
I'm like,

780
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:09,371
all right,
cool.

781
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:13,391
We're going to be okay.
So Kalani comes up to me and he's like 

782
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,270
mad,
like I've never really heard him you 

783
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,270
metaphor.
He's like,

784
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,270
Dude,
get on your board and go that way.

785
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,970
I'm like,
okay,

786
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,190
that's what I've been trying to do for 
like 10 minutes.

787
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,490
But so now he's behind me.
He's paddling,

788
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,080
I'm paddling,
he's pushing me,

789
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,100
paddling,
pushing me,

790
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:30,101
paddling like fucking superman.
And we eventually get out past the 

791
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:30,101
break.
So he's like,

792
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:30,950
all right,
you going to sit here for 20 minutes and

793
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:33,740
then when I'm done you're going to 
paddle in with me safe.

794
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:34,370
And I was like,
okay,

795
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:35,030
fine.
I got it.

796
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,770
So when we come in,
he's like,

797
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:41,771
the reason why I came in to get it was 
not only were you in the drop zone but 

798
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:44,180
you were like completely lacking of any 
color on your face.

799
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,070
And he was like,
people in the lineup was saying,

800
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,020
dude,
go get your boy because he's in trouble.

801
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,210
And I was like,
I was handling it.

802
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,970
I was definitely out of breath and a 
little fucked up,

803
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,700
but he's a wharton.

804
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,680
Then he was like,
no,

805
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,160
eight more waves on your headlight that 
you wouldn't have had the strength to 

806
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,120
fight past the wave and get up here 
because you get these little gas.

807
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,490
Dude.
It's so heavy and it has a really good 

808
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:06,490
trick.
Colone told me this one.

809
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,391
He's like,
if you're under the water and you're 

810
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:10,391
rolling around and you fucked and you 
need to take a breath,

811
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,610
drink the tiniest amount of seawater.
Tiny sip.

812
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:18,670
Just go like that.
Tricks your body into thinking you took 

813
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,150
a breath and it'll give you an extra 
five seconds.

814
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:22,610
So because you've just taken an in,
well not an inhalation,

815
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:27,611
but you've,
you've put something in your body so 

816
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:27,611
your lungs are like,
okay,

817
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:27,611
we can chill.
The panic goes for a little bit.

818
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:32,970
Yeah.
And I've done that a few times I'd been 

819
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:32,970
under and I'm like think a little 
swollen.

820
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:33,160
Come back up.
Wow.

821
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,140
Oh,
how weird.

822
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,800
Funny you fighting for five second 
increments to.

823
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,460
It's so hectic.
Surfing seems crazy.

824
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:42,110
I mean,
you never done it?

825
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,050
No,
never done it.

826
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Oh,
you look like someone that can handle 

827
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,080
it.
I mean you need a,

828
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,080
you need a big book,
but you're an athlete.

829
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,130
You can handle it.
Yeah.

830
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Seems like a lot of work.
It also seems like something get 

831
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,341
addicted to.
I'm scared of things that you get 

832
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:55,500
addicted to really addicted to work.
Oh yeah,

833
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:57,180
exactly.
I just don't have any more time.

834
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,780
I'm just so afraid of some new thing in 
my life that I get addicted to.

835
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:02,580
And then I just think about it all the 
time.

836
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,270
I go through different sessions and 
stuff with certain things,

837
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,300
but what's so what's

838
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,400
like,
you're doing this thing right now on 

839
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,601
instagram with the rock where he's 
fucking lifting up kettlebells and 

840
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:12,601
you're lifting up kettlebells.
Are you guys tight?

841
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,120
Do you know each other?
Yeah.

842
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,730
No,
I don't ignore them online.

843
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,430
We were pals.
Right,

844
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:16,900
okay.
You know,

845
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,200
and we uh,
we share,

846
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,690
you know,
we have friends and he's going to do the

847
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:24,180
podcast eventually we're working on 
because his company,

848
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:27,120
one of his companies that he,
he's involved with is the roots of fight

849
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,390
this,
a company that does all these old fight 

850
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,660
poster tee shirts.
Really Cool Shit.

851
00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:38,661
Excuse me.
And he's always wearing their stuff and 

852
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:38,661
he's coming in town to do with them.
So

853
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:40,740
you know,
somebody in San Andres and said he was a

854
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:41,630
lovely dude.
Oh,

855
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,770
you're supposed to be the best guy.
Super friendly,

856
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:46,170
knew everyone's name,
really accommodate and well,

857
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:49,050
he's the real deal.
Like he's really does get up at 5:00

858
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:50,760
in the morning and workout before the 
set.

859
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:56,330
He takes all these instagram photos.
He's like the most inspirational guy 

860
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:56,330
when it comes to like getting shit done.
Yeah.

861
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,160
Because he just gets shit done,
you know,

862
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,420
beast as well.
Fucking animal.

863
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,330
He's making it happen.
There is Samoan,

864
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,370
right?
Somebody has some genetic stuff that 

865
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:07,370
he's definitely got some genetics 
though.

866
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,960
He's a giant dude.
He's a fucking animal man,

867
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,540
but he's very motivated.
See that shirt that he's wearing.

868
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,660
That's a route to fight shirt.
That's the tie.

869
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

870
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:20,700
They have a lot of really cool old 
school.

871
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,480
Different like fight posters from like 
Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier.

872
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,280
Thrilla in Manila.
Like Nice Shit.

873
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,390
Like he's,
you know,

874
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,780
if I would see a guy that big on the 
street light that it would be kind of 

875
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,191
freakish,
but for some reason the ruc pulls it 

876
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:37,191
off.
He's very proportionate.

877
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:37,290
Yeah.
He knows what he's doing.

878
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,660
If you scroll down lower,
that's another route to fight shirt.

879
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,420
Scroll down.
Lower that John Fan going.

880
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,010
That's a.
that's a Bruce Lee shirt.

881
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,190
He's got a bunch of these.
I,

882
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,950
he's an animal.
Yeah.

883
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,260
Hey,
I'm cardio.

884
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,810
Fucking animal.
Good for him.

885
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,830
Yeah,
I mean look,

886
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,760
there are people like that,
like Kevin Hart is stand up,

887
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:02,470
he's another one,
very inspirational guys always doing 

888
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,350
something.
He's up 5:00

889
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:04,650

My,

890
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:09,651

he makes these little videos of him 

891
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:11,481
doing anything very good shape.
He works out every fucking day and he 

892
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,750
puts instagram photos of and he's a 
comedian.

893
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,510
He's constantly getting things done.

894
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,830
I don't think they found the right 
vehicle for men.

895
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,730
No,
his standup is the right vehicle for all

896
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:22,640
those other things.
The movies and everything was great.

897
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,130
Just making them more famous and bigger.
But his standup is where it's at.

898
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,210
Yeah,
he's got to find it.

899
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:27,990
I,
uh,

900
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,290
you know,
friends with Kimball,

901
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,460
Kimmel,
Kamal's always impressed me just in 

902
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:34,800
terms of like knowing what his day's 
like,

903
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,640
but also the fact that he'll reply to me
pretty quickly.

904
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:39,120
I'm like,
dude,

905
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,840
on,
you're doing 15 things at the time.

906
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:42,300
He's like,
well,

907
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,110
yeah,
I am by,

908
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,540
you're the 16th thing that I can do.
You know,

909
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,900
I just really impressed by his work 
ethic and it's very often the same,

910
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:55,760
the routine of going into the studio and
go and in the writer's room and breaking

911
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,530
jokes and doing the monologue and only 
because it's the same every day,

912
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:03,531
but he's still of a to do it and he's 
brilliant and he knows what's funny and 

913
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,100
he knows what the joke is and I don't 
know.

914
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,990
Those are the older,
late night tv,

915
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,580
older,
late night talk show hosts that I've had

916
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:13,581
the opportunity to meet.
I've always thought there's something 

917
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:13,581
brilliant about you.
You know,

918
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,680
there's something brilliant about 
working in that medium,

919
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,730
you know,
it's,

920
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,420
it's current and edgy and you know,
what they're doing at times can be a 

921
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:30,381
little risky and dangerous and stuff,
but they're willing to get out the next 

922
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:33,890
day and do it again and get the next day
and not get pounded down in the same way

923
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:36,160
that other people might.
Yeah.

924
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,550
That's their thing.
You know,

925
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:39,760
I mean,
that's what Jimmy Kimmel is best at.

926
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,870
He's,
he's got,

927
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:42,970
obviously,
he's got a fantastic work ethic and he's

928
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:45,660
obviously a brilliant guy,
but that's what he wants to do.

929
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,020
His thing,
you know,

930
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:50,560
like it works for him.
It's a beautiful gig too because you can

931
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,110
never rest on your laurels because it 
doesn't matter.

932
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:55,810
Tomorrow there's another show that show 
has to be good as well.

933
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Like can you need new jokes and you need
new sketches and you need new gags to 

934
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,101
pull off and you have new guest to 
review and to go over what they're 

935
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:05,101
talking about.
Yeah.

936
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:08,340
And he's done a lot of jumping up Jimmy 
in a way that I really respect.

937
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:13,341
Like I did a show a long time ago,
maybe 12 years ago and at that point,

938
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,010
you know it's has different.
It's a little bigger than,

939
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:21,011
oh,
quite gray suits to fit yet the whole 

940
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:21,011
facade of the show,
you know,

941
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:23,550
he was being worked on,
but Jimmy,

942
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,940
I think his drive and maybe the drive of
the people that he surrounds himself 

943
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:28,940
with,
you know,

944
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,331
he,
he jumped up when he did the Matt Damon 

945
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:32,331
thing.
He jumped up when he interviewed Obama.

946
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:33,130
He jumped up when he,
you know,

947
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,160
so it always hair and you know,
kind of dropped a few pounds and so it 

948
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,540
dies.
Suit like he has a drive.

949
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,570
There's no sense of complacency with 
Jimmy and I find that seems to be 

950
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,400
relatively concurrent with talk show 
hosts,

951
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Conan's like that.
He's always reaching to know what I 

952
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:52,640
mean.
He's never like,

953
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:52,640
okay,
we're done this the show.

954
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,430
Let's just,
let's just dial in reaching.

955
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,550
I appreciate watching people reach.
It's why I'm a huge fan of athletes in 

956
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,550
general,
you know?

957
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,400
I always feel like athletes are always 
trying for that next thing.

958
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,090
Yeah.
It's,

959
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,640
it's finding comfort and happiness in 
that struggle,

960
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,560
enjoying the process that's very 
difficult for people and for some people

961
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:16,561
that the monotony of showing up and 
doing it all over again that wears on 

962
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:20,431
them.
It's really just about finding whatever 

963
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:22,531
the fuck it is for you.
For some people it's not that for some 

964
00:40:22,531 --> 00:40:25,621
people it's they kind of go to an 
Anthony Bourdain is an interesting cat 

965
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:26,260
and he had him on the show.
Yeah,

966
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,280
yeah,
a while ago,

967
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:32,281
but I've talked to him a gang of times 
that UFC is a huge UFC as a firearm 

968
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,330
while his wife trains.
I don't think she's,

969
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,720
she's competed in Jujitsu tournaments,
but um,

970
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,430
she's a mad man,
mad woman rather.

971
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,610
And he's doing it now as well.
He's doing Jujitsu now,

972
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,210
but the point being that he's a guy that
doesn't feel like he,

973
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,760
if he's home for a week or two,
he's like,

974
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:49,660
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

975
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,020
He's just constantly wants to go to 
Libya or Africa or China just want,

976
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,170
he just wants to experience it at all.
And his work is going to places and 

977
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,210
experiencing these completely different 
worlds.

978
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,760
That's where it's where it's at for him.
So He's,

979
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:11,761
he got a totally,
he's got a totally unique way of being 

980
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,631
ambitious.
Very different than like a talk show 

981
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:18,511
host would show up and the same writers 
room and drink the coffee and bang up 

982
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:22,951
the jokes and he's just as ambitious.
But his ambition is to go to Moscow to 

983
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,840
try their food and talk to their people.

984
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,370
Yeah.
And he also,

985
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,410
I don't know him at all,
I think it's fantastic.

986
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I read kitchen confidential years ago 
when it first came out and I thought,

987
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:32,640
wow,
this guy's insane.

988
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:33,980
And then obviously you blow up on TV.

989
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,970
He also has a through line of an addict 
in his work.

990
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:43,510
He was an ex addict.
He holds his hands up and says that I 

991
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,380
think when you meet a lot of ex addicts 
or even addicts,

992
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,470
they have that thing that they're doing 
which completely takes hold of their 

993
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:54,371
life,
which is stopping them from doing the 

994
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:54,371
drug that they're addicted to and they 
can't.

995
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:59,830
If they chill and relaxed then that,
that Damon's going to come in and hang 

996
00:41:59,830 --> 00:41:59,830
out with them.
So I think baudins light,

997
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,560
well if I spend 10 days at home,
maybe that month is going to come out.

998
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:04,950
So he has to keep me,
you know,

999
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,240
I don't know him well enough to know if 
that's true or not,

1000
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:12,560
but I know enough addicts that say I 
have to be on the new thing.

1001
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:14,030
I have to be moving to the new place.

1002
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,860
Your character was an addict,
right?

1003
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,760
Did you have to do a lot of research 
about that?

1004
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,730
They didn't ask me to,
but I mean I've had my own,

1005
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,470
you know,
fun,

1006
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,990
positive,
great Jenny with drugs in my life,

1007
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:32,050
you know,
it's like that Gray Bill Hicks joke 

1008
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,360
where he's like,
I had a great time on drugs.

1009
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:33,720
Like,
um,

1010
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,100
not,
not to tell people to do drugs.

1011
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,840
I think it's a very,
very personal thing.

1012
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:44,230
I was lucky enough to come from a family
background that was very consistent and 

1013
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,050
there,
you know,

1014
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,490
my parents have been married for 42 
years.

1015
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:55,310
I always came back to a household where 
dinner was on the table regardless with 

1016
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:55,580
that eight or not,
um,

1017
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,180
you know,
a foundation of something that I think 

1018
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,930
made me feel secure.
Uh,

1019
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,300
got interested,
was always interested in music,

1020
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:07,850
got interested in the Beatles when I was
about 12,

1021
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,410
13.

1022
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,410
I started reading up about them and read
the rubber sole and sergeant peppers and

1023
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:18,080
the white album were very much 
influenced by drugs and thought,

1024
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,440
oh,
that's interesting because I feel 

1025
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,181
autistic and I'd like to see if I can 
make that artistic flower bloom a little

1026
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,530
bit.
And at that point,

1027
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,560
me and three other bills,
fans at my school site side started to 

1028
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:35,510
seek out marijuana,
which we ended up getting hold of.

1029
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:38,690
And he did that,
a typical thing when your kids were,

1030
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,740
you know,
you will smoke a joint in two and half 

1031
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,741
minutes and everyone feels lightheaded 
and one of them puked and then you get 

1032
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:50,441
nervous and paranoid and you run off and
you think you're never going to do it 

1033
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:50,441
again.
And uh,

1034
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:50,960
and then you do it again.
And then he'd do it again.

1035
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,410
And then at one point you're like,
oh,

1036
00:43:52,411 --> 00:43:53,780
it hit,
you know.

1037
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,480
And um,
I.

1038
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,220
So I did that.
I mean,

1039
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,340
fuck,
I remember as I'm a very dedicated 

1040
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:03,340
worker,
I,

1041
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,511
you know,
obviously I never do drugs when I'm 

1042
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:11,051
working,
but in my downtime on my weekends I 

1043
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:12,050
might do that.
And I flew my brother out to New Zealand

1044
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:15,620
to come check us all out making Lord of 
the rings.

1045
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,320
And at the time I was heavily into 
marijuana,

1046
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,350
probably the most.
I was into it in my life and I would 

1047
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,740
roll like 20 joints and put them in a 
cigarette box.

1048
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:26,530
I never smoked cigarettes,
put them in a cigarette box that someone

1049
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,790
had given to me and I would just walk 
around the house,

1050
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:33,791
just smoking joints,
like I'm smoking cigarettes and my 

1051
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:33,791
brother who is only 16 months older than
me,

1052
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:35,340
he sat me down at one point in that 
shape and he was like,

1053
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I've never seen anyone smoke as much 
weed as you and how are you functioning 

1054
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,890
and maybe you should consider not doing 
it.

1055
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,900
And I was a highly functioning stone.
I was like,

1056
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:43,800
fine,
come on,

1057
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:45,300
let's go.
And that's,

1058
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:50,330
you know,
that's gone in different journeys in my 

1059
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:50,610
life.
So I think when I met Jj,

1060
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:56,570
I'd spent,
I'd spent 18 months in la having not 

1061
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,510
worked,
exposing myself to La for the first time

1062
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,740
and not necessarily on the biggest part 
you've seen,

1063
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,650
but certainly on a bit of a party scene,
hanging out with the wrong people,

1064
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:15,651
the wrong women.
And I think Jay Jay's perceptive enough 

1065
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:16,770
to probably see when I came into a 
meeting,

1066
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,400
like I was a bit rough around the edges.
He didn't shave.

1067
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,930
He knows what it means to have a 
hangover.

1068
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,070
He's,
you know,

1069
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,140
he knows what it means when we say 
certain buzzwords,

1070
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:28,470
so he could have danced in these arenas,
you know?

1071
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,450
Um,
so yeah,

1072
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:36,290
it's a cautionary tale.
I think drugs and I'm really careful 

1073
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:36,290
about it.

1074
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:36,960
Like I,
you know,

1075
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,450
I'm aware that there are young people 
who might follow me on twitter or follow

1076
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:45,600
me on instagram that,
that would think,

1077
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,470
oh,
well if he's done it,

1078
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:47,760
it's okay.
And I don't,

1079
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,940
I don't subscribe to that.
So I think you have to have your own 

1080
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:52,940
journey and you have to have your own 
experiences.

1081
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,150
But the abuse of drugs has never been 
something that's been in my life.

1082
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,320
The usage of drugs has been something 
that I've done more often than not.

1083
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,910
If I'm partaking in some sort of drug,
I have a notebook and a pen close enough

1084
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:10,911
by me.
So if I feel like I'm inventing the 

1085
00:46:10,911 --> 00:46:10,911
future,
I can write it down and then the morning

1086
00:46:10,911 --> 00:46:11,370
when I wake up I can be like,
oh,

1087
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:14,610
there's a positive element of that thing
I took,

1088
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,300
you know,
I'm like searching for stuff.

1089
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,980
And I think searching for stuff in that 
world can be quite significant.

1090
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:28,330
Well,
that's a very honest interpretation or 

1091
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,420
very honest expression of what drugs 
are.

1092
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:34,421
Some drugs can be.
And I think one of the problems with 

1093
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:37,190
someone seeing you on social media or 
some young kid saying,

1094
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,270
well,
if he takes him,

1095
00:46:38,271 --> 00:46:39,470
I,
I could take them there.

1096
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:44,471
Okay.
And the only reason why they would have 

1097
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:44,600
that thought at all is because they've 
been lied to so much.

1098
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:49,601
There's so much bullshit on TV.
There's so much nancy grace and 

1099
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:53,021
nonsense.
And marijuana is more dangerous today 

1100
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,010
than at anytime in the past.
Still Marijuana.

1101
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,210
The end of the day.
It's just pot.

1102
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,250
He has nobody's dying.
Nothing happens.

1103
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,960
You get paranoid,
you wake up,

1104
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:01,450
you're fine.
No hangover.

1105
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,890
Your bones don't ache.
You're really okay.

1106
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,590
No one died on an overdose of marijuana 
and history of the planet.

1107
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,800
You're saying that you will use to abuse
it.

1108
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:11,870
It's like even your abuse.
Look,

1109
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,290
you're functioning.
You're not throwing up in your own bed.

1110
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,510
And No,
you know,

1111
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,810
I've had,
I've had,

1112
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:23,130
uh,
several moments in my life where I've 

1113
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:24,790
said,
okay,

1114
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,040
go flush that.
Like you did it last night,

1115
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,050
you don't need to do it tonight.
You don't need to do it tomorrow.

1116
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,090
Yeah,
yeah.

1117
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,800
It's Thursday night in moving into 
Friday night.

1118
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:34,180
You're not doing anything tonight.
You know,

1119
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,790
that little monster is going to be in 
that drawer,

1120
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,560
flush it.
But it's only been pot.

1121
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,380
No,
no.

1122
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,270
Been everything that's been everything.
I was like,

1123
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,340
that's a weird one to taught,
you know,

1124
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,370
because it doesn't usually taunt people.
I mean,

1125
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:50,220
I find the friends that I have that I,
I believe,

1126
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:55,310
you know,
I would classify as addicted to 

1127
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:55,310
marijuana.
They,

1128
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,580
they do it because that's what they 
think they do.

1129
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,710
They get up and they do it because it's,
it's almost like,

1130
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:04,100
it certainly can be an escape,
but it's also a comfort and a lot of 

1131
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,820
ways.
It's like that thing that you do,

1132
00:48:05,821 --> 00:48:08,250
like coffee.
I have friends that can't get coffee,

1133
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:09,060
you know,
they're like,

1134
00:48:09,061 --> 00:48:10,140
fuck,
I get up in the morning,

1135
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:13,560
I need that cup of coffee.
It's like a ritualistic,

1136
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,690
comforting sort of a thing that they do.

1137
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,100
I mean another way to describe it would 
be a crutch.

1138
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:20,050
Right?
And that is a negative connotation.

1139
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:22,240
You don't necessarily want something in 
your life that as a crutch,

1140
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:27,241
whether that is marijuana or cocaine,
or having to call your mom every day or 

1141
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,230
needing to have the new Levi's,
whatever that is.

1142
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:31,360
If it's a crutch,
it's not good the best.

1143
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,480
If we're just talking about wheat,
the best times for me on we'd have been 

1144
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,750
ingesting it.
I don't tend to smoke anymore.

1145
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,751
I put it in brownies.
Ingesting it in a way that makes the 

1146
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,690
next experience that I'm going to have 
much more colorful.

1147
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,180
Surfing on.
Weed is a beautiful experience.

1148
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:47,980
You're in that flow,
you're in that rhythm,

1149
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:50,140
you know,
watching a movie that you really like.

1150
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:51,820
Listening to a new album.
I mean dude,

1151
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,970
like I was still am in love with the 
band cigarettes,

1152
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,180
cigarettes,
no Icelandic band that kind of referred 

1153
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,180
to as the Icelandic radiohead.

1154
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:05,330
S I s I g u a r o s separate word.
Yeah.

1155
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,830
Cigarettes Way Sig you.
Uh,

1156
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,900
and then a separate word r o s.
So it's Sigur Ros,

1157
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,550
you a separate word.
R O s,

1158
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,420
that first album has an alien fetus on 
the front cover.

1159
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,640
Standard Shit.
Yeah,

1160
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,590
I'm an eighth.
I'm an atheist and uh,

1161
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,660
I've always,
you know,

1162
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:30,580
explored and struggled with the idea of 
God concepts.

1163
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:35,730
But I've always thought if there is a 
heaven that playing Sigur Ros is the 

1164
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:40,741
most,
is the most truly like captivate in bw.

1165
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,070
There you go.
That's the album you want know.

1166
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,190
Wow.
Okay.

1167
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,380
So cool.
I'll listen to on the way home.

1168
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:48,340
So.
Right.

1169
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,520
I just love that I could do that.
I can just order that shit up on my 

1170
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:53,520
phone and listen to it on the way home 
or not.

1171
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,300
I don't even have to do it now and 
download it.

1172
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,810
I could sit in my car,
look at it on the itunes,

1173
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,850
plugging into the dash and then it'll 
start playing.

1174
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,060
Yeah.

1175
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,110
That's very cool to society that we live
in.

1176
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,320
So wonderful.
But I have an issue with the cloud.

1177
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,600
I don't like this clown

1178
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,650
thing is a lot of weirdness is 
definitely out of weirdness in the whole

1179
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:14,740
idea of the cloud.
You know that from happening,

1180
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,800
that happened and all these poor folks 
that had their porn up there got 

1181
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,680
exposed.
I think that's a,

1182
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,710
that's a tiny tremor that will lead to 
the ultimate earthquake that evades or a

1183
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:27,980
privacy rather.

1184
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,340
It killed.
It killed the cloud in a lot of 

1185
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:33,340
different ways.
That happening thing.

1186
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,120
But also like not for the dudes who 
jerked off like wild monkeys.

1187
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,190
It was awesome.
Yeah,

1188
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:39,930
that's true.
At Jamie,

1189
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,390
Jamie's got fat,
hard drive filled with fat burning 

1190
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,941
content.
But like if I really liked the film and 

1191
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:53,201
I watch it,
if it's streaming from watching it on 

1192
00:50:53,201 --> 00:50:55,240
Netflix,
if I really found guaranteed I'm going 

1193
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,461
to buy it,
go buy it on DVD because I want the 

1194
00:50:57,461 --> 00:50:59,501
actual article wanting in my house.
And the same with music.

1195
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,750
If I like an album,
I'm going to go buy that CD and I don't 

1196
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:04,750
want that medium to die,
you know,

1197
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,650
I don't think it's going to die.
Um,

1198
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,680
I was at the bookstore the other day 
with my mother in law and she was 

1199
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,260
talking about a Zepplin how so the holy 
was there and they,

1200
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:19,261
they're selling these new vinyl versions
of houses of the holy and like Barnes 

1201
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:21,740
and noble in thousand oaks.

1202
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,430
They filed these fucking,
these albums and it's wild.

1203
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:30,431
Like these are 19 sixties,
19 seventies albums and people are 

1204
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,440
buying records and turntables and 
they're getting into the actual physical

1205
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:37,490
medium again,
opening it up and it's cool.

1206
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,520
Yeah,
I mean I think the vinyl culture is 

1207
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,291
really fantastic and that is great that 
the vinyl thing Kinda came back around 

1208
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,831
again.
I do think that those select artists 

1209
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:49,550
that make their way onto vinyl,
you,

1210
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:51,740
Jimi Hendrix is your,
Elvis's you'd led Zeppelin's,

1211
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,970
you'd deals,
they'll always be around,

1212
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:55,310
but the smaller ones they're going to be
like,

1213
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,960
well,
he's not big enough to go on vinyl,

1214
00:51:56,961 --> 00:51:58,970
so let's just put them on digital.
Someone's going to want him.

1215
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:03,971
We'll put him on digital in this.
It makes me sad that there are albums 

1216
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:04,820
that I own.
If I break that CD,

1217
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,380
it's going to be very difficult for me 
to get it unless I pay $69 99 on Ebay in

1218
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:09,730
the night.

1219
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,660
Get a copy of that's been previously 
used.

1220
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Yeah,
some comic Belper released a Carnegie 

1221
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,810
Hall special that he did on the album as
a vinyl thing where I think that's Kinda

1222
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,320
cool.
So when I was a kid that was a big thing

1223
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:26,321
was listening to like cheech and Chong 
and bill cosby unfortunately arrested 

1224
00:52:26,321 --> 00:52:30,720
piece,
still friendly recipes because they're 

1225
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:30,720
the real bill cosby's dead.
Sure.

1226
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,990
It's still funny though.
It's still fun.

1227
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,170
Yeah.
He was very funny.

1228
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:37,640
I mean that to me is one of the most 
fascinating.

1229
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,640
I,
I say you could say scandals.

1230
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:43,940
Tragedies are horrific crimes,
whatever it is,

1231
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,890
whatever you want to call it,
but that,

1232
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:49,790
that guy turned out to be a rapist and a
not just a,

1233
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:54,970
a just a rapist,
but a guy who drug people and fuck them 

1234
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,690
while they're unconscious.
Like that guy was that right?

1235
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,760
That's still bends my brain,
man.

1236
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,340
It's,
it's a profound fall from grace.

1237
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,680
It's not just a fall from grace,
it's just,

1238
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,110
it's horrific.
It's,

1239
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,870
it's,
it's,

1240
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,440
it's,
it like twists the world.

1241
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,120
The world's not the same world anymore.
Bill cosby's a rapist.

1242
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,480
Right,
right,

1243
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:19,030
right.
That's not the world's not the same 

1244
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,030
anymore.
I was the fucking.

1245
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,240
The huxtable dad.
He was,

1246
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,330
he was this guy that was telling 
everybody to not swear.

1247
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:24,050
Right,
right.

1248
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,850
He was the Jello pudding guy.

1249
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:31,430
Family Guy.
He's the guy that you want to pick you 

1250
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,430
up and sit on your knee and give you a 
life lesson.

1251
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:35,750
Now.
You don't want him to sit on his knee 

1252
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,750
when I was here or if you do,
you fucking don't drink anything.

1253
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,200
You.
When I was a kid,

1254
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,190
we used to listen to that album where he
would talk about Noah and the Ark.

1255
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,450
Noah having that conversation with God 
where God was.

1256
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,340
No,
uh,

1257
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,540
it's God,
right?

1258
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,260
You know,
like,

1259
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,670
it was a great bit,
man.

1260
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:55,671
It was a great bit with no and not 
believing that God really wanted him to 

1261
00:53:55,671 --> 00:53:56,490
go out and build this ark.
It's just,

1262
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:57,600
um,
that was,

1263
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,780
that was how we listened to comedy.
We would all sit around and we'd put the

1264
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:04,650
headphones on and we would all sit 
around and listen to this,

1265
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,120
you know,
whether it's cheech and Chong or we got 

1266
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,410
a hold of some oral old George Carlin 
Jack.

1267
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,590
Then so dangerous,
so edgy,

1268
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,260
so brave guy and wasn't in the 
beginning,

1269
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:21,290
you know.
And then there's an interesting lesson 

1270
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:21,290
if you go see George Carlin's,
the early,

1271
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:21,290
early,
early stuff,

1272
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,780
it was like straight up tonight.
Show TV friendly comedy.

1273
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,800
Yeah.
And somewhere along the line he just 

1274
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:29,800
cut,
kinda twisted.

1275
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,660
Well,
I never knew him,

1276
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:35,661
never met him.
I get the feeling that he got angry 

1277
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:37,600
about something and stop giving a shit.
And that's what his real voice came from

1278
00:54:37,601 --> 00:54:38,190
him.
He was just like,

1279
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,710
fuck this man.
I'm not going to get famous.

1280
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,090
I'm looking at my own late night talk 
show.

1281
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:43,110
Let's do it.
He's,

1282
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,260
I don't know if that's what his goal was
or who knows,

1283
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:48,180
whatever it was like Bill Hicks was 
living like that,

1284
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:48,690
right?
I mean,

1285
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,150
he was great.
His material was fantastic,

1286
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,130
but there was a point where he was like,
fuck this.

1287
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,740
Like I see the fucking rip in the 
universe,

1288
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,320
I see it and now I'm going to pull it 
out to all you guys.

1289
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:02,090
He didn't have a chance unfortunately.
I met.

1290
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,100
I met him a couple of high like,
but never like hung out and talked to 

1291
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,160
him.
Same with Carla and I met him like I had

1292
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,140
the store passing by.
He was very friendly.

1293
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:10,950
Hello?
Hello.

1294
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:13,860
Hello.
Carla is so epic.

1295
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,520
I got to see Hicks live when I was an 
open mic or which was a great,

1296
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:22,790
great,
great chance to see like one of the all 

1297
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,850
time greats is a beginning.
A beginning of my career.

1298
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:28,970
I got to see him bomb.
Oh well I got see bomb and not give a 

1299
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,301
fuck was me and Greg Fitzsimmons and a 
few other comics in the back of the 

1300
00:55:32,301 --> 00:55:33,480
room.
There was maybe 200 5,300

1301
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:34,620
people in the room when he started.

1302
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:39,330
By the time he was done there was 50 and
we were all screaming in the mood.

1303
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,580
Um,
he was bombing,

1304
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,830
you know,
it'd been,

1305
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:45,870
wasn't going,
but the comics were laughing hard.

1306
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,850
We were laughing hard and a few people 
were laughing hard,

1307
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:53,870
right.
And then there's a few people in the 

1308
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,191
audience that was trying to figure out 
what everybody was laughing at that 

1309
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:55,530
stuck around and try to save like,
am I missing out on something cool here?

1310
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,190
Like,
yes you are.

1311
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:57,240
Yeah,
it was,

1312
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,360
it was.
He went on after a guy who was like 

1313
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:02,360
really hacky.
The guy went on before was like,

1314
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,520
he was doing impressions of cartoon 
characters if they smoke marijuana,

1315
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,710
you know,
it was a real standard,

1316
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:09,420
like I mean like straight across the 
board,

1317
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:13,410
like cop donut jokes and that kind of 
flown on an airplane and they,

1318
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:18,411
the audience was fairly dimwitted and 
they were enjoying this really stupid 

1319
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:23,130
comedy and then Hicks came out and just 
did all this really radical,

1320
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,220
crazy shit

1321
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,220
that just,
they just weren't hearing it and they 

1322
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:29,220
just got up and sometimes it's difficult
to be in the presence of genius.

1323
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,230
Right?
I mean it tends to be standup.

1324
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,890
I think of his genius is absolutely 
phenomenal.

1325
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,280
Rolling Stone interview with a John 
Lennon with the guy who invented 

1326
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,440
rollingstone yen went to.
It's like,

1327
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:44,160
well,
he had the edited versions about 40 

1328
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,961
minutes,
I've got about three hours of it and 

1329
00:56:45,961 --> 00:56:48,661
landon gets angry about the fact that 
he's a genius and he's having to perform

1330
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,820
like a clown in front of these fucking 
retards that don't get it,

1331
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:56,821
and he resents like,
I resent the fact that they're not 

1332
00:56:56,821 --> 00:56:58,150
receiving it and they're also telling me
that Maya is x,

1333
00:56:58,151 --> 00:56:58,750
y,
and zed.

1334
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,730
You don't get to fucking tell me what my
art is.

1335
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,970
I'm the iced.
You just sit there and fucking listen to

1336
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:04,780
it.
Right.

1337
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,440
Yeah.

1338
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,000
I appreciate that.
You're never going to get it.

1339
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,410
You know,
I think the Hicks thing,

1340
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:11,860
what was going on was that he hadn't 
found those people yet.

1341
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,830
This was all pre internet,
so no one had.

1342
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,860
No one knew what he was doing,
so they were going to go see a guy who 

1343
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:23,431
was a funny comedian and they had seen 
him on the Rodney dangerfield comic 

1344
00:57:23,431 --> 00:57:28,141
special on Hbo and he only did like 
seven minutes on that or whatever the 

1345
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:28,141
hell it was.
Whatever they do.

1346
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:29,980
It was a very small,
short,

1347
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:31,720
funny set,
but it was funny,

1348
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:36,721
a bunch of jokes and so people went to 
see him a lot based on that and they 

1349
00:57:36,721 --> 00:57:37,180
went to see him.
They're like,

1350
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:39,300
what the fuck is all this anger?
Dude,

1351
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,430
he hadn't really found that audience 
yet.

1352
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,480
Right.
And then he died huge biggest standup 

1353
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,110
comedian in England for probably four 
years earlier when he wouldn't a ward,

1354
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,340
which is at the Edinburgh fringe 
festival.

1355
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,110
And he was huge.
He was,

1356
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:58,111
by the time he died,
he was the Jim Morrison of standup 

1357
00:57:58,111 --> 00:57:58,111
comedy for us.
Well,

1358
00:57:58,111 --> 00:58:00,670
he did relentless.
He filmed it live in England,

1359
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,340
you know,
and you wrote a very risky thing to do.

1360
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:06,790
It wasn't his best special.
He was very tight and one of the reasons

1361
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:09,910
is because it was all one take was one 
show,

1362
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:13,180
one take and you know,
it's an hbo special,

1363
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:16,300
so it's a.
But again,

1364
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:19,000
he was a guy that if he found his 
audience,

1365
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,580
if they knew where to go,
you know,

1366
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,230
like today,
if he was alive today,

1367
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:28,410
my God,
who would have been so fucking monster 

1368
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:28,690
following be the king,
the king or one of the Kings,

1369
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:33,040
you know what I mean?
So it's just a finding.

1370
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,880
Then we'd find out that he's drugging 
jerks.

1371
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1372
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,400
No,
probably not.

1373
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:41,560
But I mean,
I love what Louis Ck is doing right now.

1374
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,080
I mean,
he,

1375
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,100
he's an exceptional right age.
Very.

1376
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,860
He's very artistic.
He's very,

1377
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:49,960
he's very.
I'm on the edge.

1378
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:54,961
You know what I mean?
He comes up with the joke and then he 

1379
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:54,961
retires it and that's it.
You know what I mean?

1380
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:56,350
He's coming up with new stuff,
I think.

1381
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:01,710
I think he's fantastic.
And the fact that he edits and writes 

1382
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:01,710
and directs and producing stars in his 
show,

1383
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,280
brilliant.
He's obviously a phenomenal.

1384
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,720
I'm,
I'm okay with darkness and I know what 

1385
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,290
the darkness is for me.
There is.

1386
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,240
There are moments when I'm watching a 
show or I'm like,

1387
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,590
oh,
just two.

1388
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,030
Oh,
his TV show.

1389
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,700
Yeah.
So it's two dogs.

1390
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,580
Yeah.
The TV show,

1391
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:20,920
I'm not a big fan of like depressing 
shit.

1392
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,980
I'm not.
I don't

1393
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,850
want to watch.
So you've got kinda.

1394
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:28,930
Yeah,
like he's getting frustrated is fixing 

1395
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,670
his kid's doll and I was like,
oh no,

1396
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,240
no,
no.

1397
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,740
The overlying themes of like,
you'll.

1398
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,470
This is never going to get any bad.
You're fucked.

1399
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,300
You're never going to find someone who 
loves you again.

1400
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,710
I don't buy another bad father.
It's duct heavy.

1401
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,510
Yeah.
But he,

1402
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,820
he minds that you know and comes up with
great,

1403
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:48,800
hilarious shit from that.
It's just,

1404
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,170
it's one of those things like 
everybody's got their own little fucking

1405
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,820
thing.
Have you ever seen Joey Diaz?

1406
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,500
No,
but I heard him on your show.

1407
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,090
Yeah,
he's funny as hell.

1408
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,700
You got to see that guy.
Like what's his vibe standup wise?

1409
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,640
He's a monster.
He's the funniest guy that's ever lived.

1410
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:04,340
I heard you say that on the show.
Like never seen anybody funnier.

1411
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,380
I've never seen anybody who kills so 
hard.

1412
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,210
So what's his.
I mean he was an animal.

1413
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:11,660
He said it's $300 story.
He's got great jokes,

1414
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,280
great stories.
He's just,

1415
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,590
he's just a wild fucker.
Who's been through everything?

1416
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:20,591
He's been to jail for.
Armed kidnapping was a cocaine addict 

1417
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:23,330
for most of his life.
He's just a fucking bonafide gangster.

1418
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:28,390
Do you think that he was friendly?
He doesn't mean it doesn't give any 

1419
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,390
fucks.
He has zero fucks in his tank.

1420
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:29,950
I mean for real.
Like,

1421
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:34,951
look,
there's a lot of people tell you they 

1422
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:34,951
don't give a fuck,
but they do.

1423
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:34,951
He really doesn't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?

1424
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:38,540
Who gives a fuck about his friends and 
his family and you know what he's doing.

1425
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:42,680
But he's free now cause he's got his own
podcast.

1426
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,470
He sells out everywhere he goes doing 
stand up and he doesn't give a fuck.

1427
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:50,471
He doesn't want to do anything other 
than that because that's just what he 

1428
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:50,471
does.

1429
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:52,730
But before he goes,
before he leaves this earth,

1430
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,120
you've got to see him.
You have to show la all the time.

1431
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,350
I'll let you know.
I'll,

1432
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,930
I'll find out what it's going to be 
around you.

1433
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,650
GotTa.
Come see him.

1434
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,030
I love standup.
I mean,

1435
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:02,990
you know,
I love,

1436
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,080
I just love that medium.
I think it's really,

1437
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,900
it's super brave and I think a lot of 
people don't necessarily know the 

1438
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:17,771
mechanics of hail.
A comedian found himself being onstage 

1439
01:01:17,771 --> 01:01:22,390
with a microphone and if anyone did know
that people will shut the fuck up and 

1440
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:26,270
laugh or just politely leave because 
like the disrespect shown by hecklers to

1441
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:27,530
standup Comedians,
were you like,

1442
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:32,531
do you have any idea how ballsy is to 
get up on stage and show your ass like 

1443
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:33,230
that all the time,
but you know what that is,

1444
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,070
man.
That's just.

1445
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,300
It's the same thing.

1446
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,910
It's like people that are haters on 
twitter or facebook,

1447
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:41,150
it's just too easy to do so.
It's too easy to speak up.

1448
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:46,151
It's too easy to take.
It's too easy to just have an opinion 

1449
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:49,040
that's not nuanced and not objective.
It's to easy shit.

1450
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah,
exactly.

1451
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:53,270
It's so easy to do that.
It's so easy to be that dummy,

1452
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:53,830
you know?
I mean,

1453
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,840
there was that guy the other day at the 
comedy store where there those fucking 

1454
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,200
guys were drunk in the back of the 
parking lot and give everybody a hard 

1455
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:02,200
time.
There's just so many of them and they're

1456
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,461
just dim witted dumb people that they 
shouldn't have that ability to speak to 

1457
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:08,240
you,
but they do.

1458
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,690
So they are just,
they are not smart.

1459
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,030
They're not sensitive.
They're not thinking,

1460
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,900
but they look forward.
How do you deal with hecklers?

1461
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,340
I mean like your little imposing.

1462
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,100
So I would imagine people heckle you had
called you a little less cold.

1463
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,820
Got To all the time.
Everybody gets tackled.

1464
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,510
People get drunk.
They're not thinking straight.

1465
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,120
They're not thinking like maybe this guy
could kill me,

1466
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,080
maybe I should shut the fuck up.
So I don't think like that.

1467
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:33,460
Do you call them out?
Do you have fun?

1468
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,560
Them?
Depends.

1469
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,020
It's like there's no,
like,

1470
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:39,090
some heckling is funny,
you know,

1471
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,540
like there was like sometime one time I 
was on stage in New York and uh,

1472
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:48,620
and I said,
do you know what the most famous woman 

1473
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,211
in the world is?
It was a bit about Kim Kardashian 

1474
01:02:50,211 --> 01:02:52,260
meeting the aliens and they're like,
if aliens came down and they met Kim 

1475
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,490
Kardashian and they had to,
they had to explain like Kim Kardashians

1476
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:58,820
existence in her fame.
Like why is this girl famous?

1477
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,560
If anybody had to explain it with the 
how the islands would fail,

1478
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,170
and I said,
do you think about who's the most famous

1479
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:04,830
woman in the world?

1480
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:09,860
And some guy goes,
your mom and I just started laughing 

1481
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:09,860
because it was fun.
It was in that moment.

1482
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:14,810
It was a ridiculous,
smart ass funny thing to say and it 

1483
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:14,810
wasn't a guy who was heckling.
The whole show was just like,

1484
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:19,071
he said that one thing and then I 
started laughing and everybody else was 

1485
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:19,071
laughing.
I'm like,

1486
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:19,590
we'll just let that slide.
That was very funny.

1487
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,290
Sometimes it's funny,
you get to be.

1488
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,340
No,
I don't encourage it.

1489
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:27,240
You shouldn't do it,
but occasionally it works and that's not

1490
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:28,780
a mean spirited thing.
No,

1491
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:33,420
it's like sometimes people,
they just want to be a part of it.

1492
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:38,421
They want to get a little drunk,
they want to say something and it's all 

1493
01:03:38,421 --> 01:03:39,490
different and then sometimes you just 
get more on.

1494
01:03:39,491 --> 01:03:44,040
So sometimes you could just get people 
that just really don't.

1495
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,230
They don't deserve to be there,
they just,

1496
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:47,760
they can't handle the experience.

1497
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:52,810
I've seen that as an audience member,
I've seen that where people are yelling 

1498
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:53,550
out and you just want to grab them and 
drag them out of there.

1499
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:54,840
Like that guy on stage.
You just,

1500
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:58,320
you should not be talking to your 
fucking it up for the other 300,

1501
01:03:58,321 --> 01:04:00,460
99 people in this fucking room.
Right.

1502
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:05,540
You're so egocentric that you're 
concentrating on yourself and your own 

1503
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,270
what you like and don't like.
They had a couple too many drinks at the

1504
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:11,271
restaurant.
They got talked into coming to the 

1505
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:11,271
comedy club.
They didn't.

1506
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:11,710
They don't know what it is and they're 
like,

1507
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,120
shit,
dark room,

1508
01:04:13,121 --> 01:04:15,030
but I'm supposed to show up.
I was in the middle of token.

1509
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:20,031
It didn't.
I'm going to keep talking this that 

1510
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:20,031
there's alcohol which really fucks with 
judgment and this also.

1511
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:24,980
A lot of people have this really bizarre
and titled Thing where they're entitled 

1512
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,571
to their opinions and they feel like 
this is something that they're allowed 

1513
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:29,571
to.

1514
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:34,160
You know,
they're allowed to voice their 

1515
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,021
disapproval about and you should stop.
I had to give a woman yell out next 

1516
01:04:36,021 --> 01:04:38,130
subject wants to me,
which is hilarious.

1517
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:43,150
No,
I'm holding the microphone where there 

1518
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:43,150
was this bit I was doing for awhile 
about a,

1519
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:45,300
there was a thing called the second 
coming project was before,

1520
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,100
um,
genetics,

1521
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:47,730
when,
when,

1522
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:50,100
when they first starting mapping out the
human genome,

1523
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:55,130
there's just people that wanted to get,
they wanted to get DNA from the shroud 

1524
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,570
of Turin and they wanted to try to clone
Jesus and he thought that if they cloned

1525
01:04:57,571 --> 01:05:02,460
Jesus would bring him back and that,
that would be how Jesus Return.

1526
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:06,580
And uh,
so my,

1527
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,330
my take on it was like,
what have they brought Jesus back and he

1528
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:11,100
was retarded.
Like what if it goes you,

1529
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,280
Connie doesn't work,
like you have to do it a lot of times in

1530
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:15,570
order to find an effective clung.

1531
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,310
So the first one that you do,
like,

1532
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,850
what if it comes out wacky,
like would have,

1533
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:19,960
he has down syndrome.
Do you,

1534
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:24,220
do you kill him?
And she's like next subject,

1535
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:29,370
next.
And she was sitting in the front row 

1536
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:29,370
looking at like,
is it,

1537
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,951
that's it.
Like you're just going to say that and 

1538
01:05:31,951 --> 01:05:31,951
that just ends.
No.

1539
01:05:31,951 --> 01:05:32,290
Now you're this objects.
You don't know.

1540
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,670
I'm of magical fictional Jewish Zombie.
Can't come back retarded.

1541
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:38,560
Is that what you're saying?
Fuck off.

1542
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:41,560
She's in the God squad she couldn't 
handle it allows people in the God squad

1543
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:44,530
cut in and all that stuff,
so it might not even be the God squad.

1544
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:49,531
It might just be in her very narrow view
of the world down syndrome.

1545
01:05:50,201 --> 01:05:52,470
Is that unacceptable subject or 
religious?

1546
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,520
Anything religion.
Like I've had people say,

1547
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,300
well,
hey man,

1548
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,460
as long as you don't talk about politics
or religion,

1549
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,990
like,
well that's ridiculous.

1550
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:03,990
Those are two things you should 
absolutely fucking talk about it every 

1551
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,990
chance you get because the one of the 
reasons why both of those dumb,

1552
01:06:04,991 --> 01:06:09,991
retarded fucking things are still around
and the same state they've always been 

1553
01:06:09,991 --> 01:06:13,381
around is because dummies like you don't
talk about it because you've locked it 

1554
01:06:13,381 --> 01:06:17,101
in this ideology box and tucked it away 
somewhere where you just talk about the 

1555
01:06:17,101 --> 01:06:19,390
Lakers and the fucking lawn and how long
you think this drought's going to last.

1556
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:24,900
You don't want to talk about the fact 
that you're getting fucked and then 

1557
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,480
you're being surrounded by children who 
believe in magic.

1558
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:27,730
Yeah.
Surface stuff,

1559
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:29,980
I mean people are,
people are a little scared about that.

1560
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,310
I mean,
I feel like in comedy,

1561
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:34,540
nothing's off the table.
Nothing's off the table.

1562
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,820
It's only,
might not be right.

1563
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,820
It might not be funny,
but even like patrice o'neal,

1564
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:44,850
the late great patrice o'neil had a 
really good point once where he was 

1565
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,871
like,
if someone goes on stage and offends 

1566
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:47,871
you,
they say something to offend you.

1567
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:50,410
Or if someone goes on stage and and 
makes you laugh.

1568
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,200
Both of those things come from the same 
place.

1569
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:57,100
They're both trying to make you laugh,
but it doesn't always work.

1570
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:02,430
You know,
like the ideas that eventually become 

1571
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:03,490
great bits.
There's been nights I had,

1572
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:07,720
I had some bits that they eventually 
became like closing bits,

1573
01:07:07,721 --> 01:07:09,760
like bits that I had to close on because
I couldn't follow them.

1574
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,530
They were just too good for me.
They were like,

1575
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,080
all my other bits weren't as strong as 
them,

1576
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:19,320
but at one point in time they would bomb
and that like when they were first 

1577
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,461
developing almost like,
how the fuck am I going to get this to 

1578
01:07:23,461 --> 01:07:23,461
work?
It's just too weird.

1579
01:07:23,461 --> 01:07:25,270
It's too fucked up.
It's too controversial.

1580
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:25,900
It's too.
It doesn't.

1581
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:29,800
It's not connecting with people.
Whatever the reason was and almost every

1582
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:33,220
bit sort of starts out in an embryonic 
stage.

1583
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:37,010
What it eventually becomes when it's a 
finished product and if that is an.

1584
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,870
If it's a bit that's controversial and 
it starts out in its embryonic stage,

1585
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:41,310
you're like,
nick,

1586
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:46,311
sap jacked stop dog.
Like you're missing the whole entire 

1587
01:07:46,311 --> 01:07:48,910
point of stand up and you can't be here 
because you're a part.

1588
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:52,280
As an audience member,
every audience member is not just there.

1589
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,490
You're not just seeing a show.
When you stand up,

1590
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:59,670
you're in part of the creative process 
because the bits come alive in front of 

1591
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:04,021
the crowd.
They evolve and change in front of the 

1592
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:06,241
crowd and that's how they become 
something that eventually gets on 

1593
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:09,040
television becomes a special until that,
until it happens,

1594
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,080
you're in as much as the comic is,
you're,

1595
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:13,660
you're in on it.
We need you.

1596
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,100
I give it.
If it for the audience,

1597
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,110
no jokes would ever come out,
right.

1598
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,440
They just.
You wouldn't really exactly know the 

1599
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:23,870
best way to do any of them.
You have to do them in front of people.

1600
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,710
Yeah.
How do you feel that Seinfeld,

1601
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,890
Jerry Seinfeld's up.

1602
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,070
He's a very funny standup.
I mean he's a very good comic.

1603
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,560
He's not,
he's not my kind of stand up,

1604
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,040
you know?
I prefer standups.

1605
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:40,580
We don't have any restrictions.
I don't like standups that only.

1606
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,000
You don't use any swear words and don't 
talk about sex.

1607
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:48,710
They don't talk about anything profound.
Everything is like real simple.

1608
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,740
Straight across like losing socks in the
dryer type shit.

1609
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:57,130
I think he's a brilliant.
It just not how I prefer like a bill 

1610
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,450
burr or a Louis ck or jody is like,
that's my.

1611
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,170
Because I go see Joey Diaz.
I'd see it.

1612
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,150
There's nothing that's off the table.
I'm seeing chaos,

1613
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:10,470
you know?
And at the end of this show you're 

1614
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,470
fucking holding your body laughing and 
you're like,

1615
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:14,171
I can't believe he doing.
He does his bit about eating and girls 

1616
01:09:14,171 --> 01:09:16,340
eating the girl's pussy from behind a 
sticking your nose in her ass.

1617
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,790
Like a pigeon.
Like who?

1618
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:21,100
Like you got to do the pigeon and he 
does this.

1619
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:25,520
Like I'm not doing it any justice.
I'm totally fucking up though.

1620
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:26,660
You're like,
that's not even funny.

1621
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:28,790
This is the funniest guy ever.
Got to see it,

1622
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,080
but you need his body and with his 
voice,

1623
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,140
everything and it has to do with,
you know,

1624
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,490
what was set up before that and where 
we're got to.

1625
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:42,660
He has this bit about the fucking 
Liberace Hbo movie with Matt Damon and 

1626
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:47,990
I'm Kirk Douglas.
Michael Douglas is one of the funniest 

1627
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:52,091
bits I've ever seen in my life to a 
point where I'm holding my body to keep 

1628
01:09:52,091 --> 01:09:54,020
everything from breaking from laughing 
too hard.

1629
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,720
I like so.
I mean,

1630
01:09:55,721 --> 01:10:00,400
I like old strains of standup.
The thing I totally hear you in terms of

1631
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:02,620
the limitations that that Seinfeld gives
himself.

1632
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:07,621
There's no profanity.
A doesn't necessarily tell you a huge 

1633
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:08,710
amount about himself.
It's kind of abstract stuff.

1634
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,830
I love words.
I'm a huge fan of words.

1635
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:13,930
I love etymology.
I like studying woods,

1636
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:15,220
the origin of words,
all that kind of stuff.

1637
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,750
He is a fantastic wordsmith and also 
he's very,

1638
01:10:19,751 --> 01:10:22,210
very specific.
Like he will,

1639
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:27,570
he will omit the wood,
the if he doesn't need it because he 

1640
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:30,670
examines the entire sentence.
I love the dedication to that.

1641
01:10:30,671 --> 01:10:32,980
I also love the free form element of,
you know,

1642
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,100
what he was doing,
just anger coming at you or Eddie Izzard

1643
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:38,830
is very kind of like just school of 
thought went all over the place.

1644
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:44,190
The thing that I love about Seinfeld 
might be the limitations that he gives 

1645
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:47,731
himself,
but also that idea of the choices that 

1646
01:10:47,891 --> 01:10:52,891
I'm making.
I've made specifically for this joke to 

1647
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:55,390
work as correctly as I think.
And he's a,

1648
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,010
he's a professor of comedy,
right?

1649
01:10:57,011 --> 01:10:58,390
I mean,
he knows comedy,

1650
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,980
knows the history of comedy.
Who knows what's funny.

1651
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:04,981
He knows what's not funny and uh,
there is something very safe about him 

1652
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,500
and I could bring my parents to see him 
and he is old school.

1653
01:11:08,501 --> 01:11:13,501
But for me,
the fact that Seinfeld lives in this 

1654
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:13,700
world of Joey Diaz is and

1655
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,960
bill burrs and Louis ck makes him almost
like the last of a dying breed,

1656
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:20,580
you know,
and I do have a lot of respect.

1657
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,740
Well,
gap again is very clean,

1658
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:24,820
although he's not the kind of wordsmith 
that does.

1659
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,840
Seinfeld is A.
Brian Regan is also very clean and very,

1660
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,390
very funny,
you know,

1661
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:38,690
but I hear you.
I mean he's a master at economy of 

1662
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:38,690
words,
that's for sure.

1663
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:38,880
He,
there's,

1664
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:43,160
there's definitely a rhythm to learning,
like when you know,

1665
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,830
when to leave words in,
when to add more words,

1666
01:11:45,831 --> 01:11:49,470
when to have a pause,
when to have no pause and there's an art

1667
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:54,471
to that sort of creation of the bits.
He's definitely a master at that moment 

1668
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:55,590
as well.
She,

1669
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,800
she knows woods too short.
It's very specific words and you know,

1670
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:01,980
she can be a little,
a little frisky it a little noisy,

1671
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:06,981
but obviously that's very disarming when
you know you're kind of an attractive 

1672
01:12:06,981 --> 01:12:06,981
lady to get up and do that stuff.

1673
01:12:06,981 --> 01:12:11,690
I think she's.
I think she's brilliant and 

1674
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:13,791
unfortunately it is a very male as a 
society is a very male dominated job in 

1675
01:12:16,381 --> 01:12:20,490
the sense that I feel like if Sarah was 
a guy,

1676
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,620
there's a chance she could be a little 
bigger than most.

1677
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,830
She is nailed.
Some would argue the opposite.

1678
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:30,910
Some would argue that female comics are 
judged on a curve and that the best 

1679
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:34,611
comics,
if you look at like the best female 

1680
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:37,941
comics that are alive today and compare 
them just bit for bit for the best male 

1681
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:42,321
comics,
you wouldn't really have them in the 

1682
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:44,561
same category.
You think she can throw down with Louis 

1683
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:44,561
Ck?
I feel like Sarah Sarah was brilliant.

1684
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:45,180
She.
Well,

1685
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,090
I mean I,
it's weird like I don't like seeing,

1686
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,940
you know,
even though I said Joey Diaz is the best

1687
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
in the world because I think he just 
makes me laugh the hardest because 

1688
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
that's like my style of comedy.

1689
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,460
I love that crazy chaotic style,
but I don't take he out of the equation.

1690
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:02,070
I don't think there's a best.
But I've seen Sarah.

1691
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:06,630
Sarah was at the store two weeks ago and
she was fucking fantastic.

1692
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:10,020
Just smashing,
just fantastic.

1693
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,520
But I've seen,
I've seen birds without.

1694
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:14,070
Do you know Duncan Trussell?
Yep.

1695
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:19,160
Duncan drops.
Even Duncan trussell just stand up and 

1696
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:19,740
doug stanhope destroyed.
It's all about,

1697
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:21,690
you know,
if they're in their groove,

1698
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:22,400
if there,
you know,

1699
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:26,370
and there were always recycling material
so you catch them two years from now,

1700
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,080
it's going to be a totally different 
set,

1701
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:30,690
a totally different point of view,
totally different place in their life.

1702
01:13:30,691 --> 01:13:32,730
Totally different perspective.
And I think,

1703
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:34,980
you know,
as far as personal taste,

1704
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:39,981
it kind of ebbs and flows depending on 
where that person is at any point in 

1705
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:39,981
their life.
Yeah.

1706
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:41,350
Yeah.
I saw doug stanhope well and so the,

1707
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:43,140
the cody stood,
I was fucking bent over.

1708
01:13:43,141 --> 01:13:48,141
Double laughing so hard.
I him and then there's a guy I've only 

1709
01:13:48,141 --> 01:13:51,531
seen once.
I didn't even know if he's on the silk 

1710
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:51,531
anymore.
He's called Dove Davidoff.

1711
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:51,531
Yeah,
definitely.

1712
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:53,870
With office around still.
That guy killed me one night and he's,

1713
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:56,820
he's just cool as fuck man.
Fucked up leather jacket,

1714
01:13:56,821 --> 01:14:01,821
shaved his head,
look Kinda like a little bit of a g and 

1715
01:14:01,821 --> 01:14:02,020
his material was just excellent.
You know,

1716
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,980
it's light status on any given night,
you know,

1717
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,980
I think also coming from England and 
having,

1718
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:11,830
excuse me,
having that backdrop of Monte python and

1719
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:12,070
Derek

1720
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:17,070
and clive and stuff,
the playfulness of words is something 

1721
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:21,271
that I appreciate.
Like do you know money pythen came out 

1722
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:23,080
with a vinyl record as a double groove 
in it for the stones.

1723
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,000
So you put on,
let's say side B,

1724
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:29,980
but it hits on the second groove,
so you hit the exact same record,

1725
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,030
but then the last sketch is different.
So then you're like,

1726
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:34,990
fuck,
I love that sketch.

1727
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:39,991
Not heard that before.
I must have been too stoned or too 

1728
01:14:39,991 --> 01:14:39,991
fucked up.
You put it on again,

1729
01:14:39,991 --> 01:14:40,870
but it doesn't hit the second group.
It hits the first group.

1730
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:43,000
So you get to the end of the record,
the sketch has gone.

1731
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:44,670
You're like,
wait a minute,

1732
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,370
if I smoke then you put it on again,
but it's back.

1733
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:53,260
And monty python put that in for the 19 
sixties audience.

1734
01:14:53,261 --> 01:14:56,190
They're listening like that Shit I love,
you know,

1735
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,760
love that stuff.

1736
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,110
Yeah.
Monty Python,

1737
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:01,190
they were definitely groundbreaking.
Insane,

1738
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,550
insane.
They did some pretty,

1739
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,350
pretty incredible shit.
Yeah.

1740
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:08,080
And it's still,
a lot of it still holds up,

1741
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:08,860
you know.
Totally.

1742
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:09,640
I mean,
you know,

1743
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,860
everyone talks about the parrot sketch 
periscope just fine.

1744
01:15:11,861 --> 01:15:13,840
But for me,
like the argument sketches,

1745
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:16,330
one of my favorites,
there's one called travel agent,

1746
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:17,620
which is insane.
There's,

1747
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,360
you know,
the fish dance,

1748
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:20,160
you know,
the fish tanks.

1749
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,230
No to people.
I think it's definitely Michael Pailin.

1750
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:28,270
Could be Graham Chapman stood on the end
of a pretty high canal.

1751
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,900
One guy has one guy has two little fish,
like kinda big sardines are about that 

1752
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:37,330
big.
And he skips over to the,

1753
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,100
uh,
skips over to Michael Pailin,

1754
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,960
slaps me in the face a couple times,
skips back,

1755
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:46,290
skips over to Michael Baden and slaps me
in the face a couple times with these 

1756
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,511
fish.
It's skips back and then the other guy 

1757
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:48,511
and then he finished and he stands stale
near the guy,

1758
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:52,381
pulls out a fucking huge trout and just 
takes them out and throws him in the 

1759
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:52,381
canal.

1760
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,430
It's like completely silenced.
Done to music.

1761
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:58,690
I've seen that.
I've seen so a Naca can stupid,

1762
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:03,691
you know.
How long have you been living in 

1763
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:03,691
America?
Uh,

1764
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:06,860
I moved to La in 2003,
so a while,

1765
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:13,450
uh,
first moved to the back of my managers,

1766
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:15,310
God.
And she had like a granny flat,

1767
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,450
not were there any more.
So there was no toilet in,

1768
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,870
there was no TV,
there was no toilet,

1769
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:24,430
no toilets.
Where did you go to the toilet?

1770
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,160
So what she would do.
So she worked over at her house,

1771
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:30,970
which was also her office.
She would leave the back door open,

1772
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,700
but she would lock the bathroom from the
inside.

1773
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,000
So at nighttime I could go open the back
door,

1774
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:42,270
go use the bathroom,
but I couldn't enter the house because 

1775
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:42,460
it'd been locked from the inside.
Uh,

1776
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:45,400
I had no phone and no.
Oh,

1777
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:49,180
so the first 18 months in La was just a 
fucking joke to we just trapped.

1778
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:54,410
Yeah.
And she would come and knock on my door 

1779
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:54,410
and go,
hey,

1780
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:54,410
I have an audition at 1115 and it'd be 
like 10.

1781
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:54,410
And I go,
okay,

1782
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,200
someone gave me a ride to go,
no.

1783
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:56,770
I go,
okay,

1784
01:16:56,771 --> 01:17:01,771
we're going to have to cancel that 
because I don't have a car and I 

1785
01:17:01,771 --> 01:17:04,771
couldn't get to Santa Monica.
And that went on for awhile and then 

1786
01:17:04,771 --> 01:17:07,270
eventually she was like,
maybe buy a car and I get a phone.

1787
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:07,930
I was like,
yeah,

1788
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:08,620
okay,
I'll do that.

1789
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:11,300
And then it started to kind of shift 
around a little bit.

1790
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:14,690
So when you came over,
you were just known as an actor?

1791
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:20,020
Yeah,
I had done a couple of TV shows in 

1792
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:20,810
England,
a little bit of theater in England,

1793
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:25,811
started to do some English films and was
doing a TV show in France for England.

1794
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:32,480
When I got the role on load the rings 
when it did load the rings.

1795
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:38,170
Uh,
and as we're coming towards the end of 

1796
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:38,170
principal photography,
which is almost two years,

1797
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:44,210
the onset publicist is medical Claire 
Raskin think she's married now,

1798
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:46,280
so she has a different name.
She said to me,

1799
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:48,980
what you gonna do after this we're going
to do when we wrap in December.

1800
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:50,960
It was like,
oh no,

1801
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:54,050
go back to Manchester,
wait for it to come out a year later.

1802
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,020
And she said if I was you,
I'd go to La,

1803
01:17:57,390 --> 01:18:00,200
get jumped on this.
Like go take some means,

1804
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:02,930
get a manager,
get an agent like,

1805
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:04,010
okay,
cool.

1806
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,300
Good advice.
Went back to Manchester for low,

1807
01:18:06,301 --> 01:18:09,380
but Manchester had amazing.
Say Manchester's,

1808
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:12,020
you know,
if la is London,

1809
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:14,840
Manchester is New York,
it's industrial.

1810
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:18,170
It's a bit rough or been.
Most Times people say,

1811
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:23,210
oh,
I can throw big football town foreign 

1812
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:23,210
place to do stand up.
Yeah.

1813
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:27,100
That rockers.
And they drink and they like to fight 

1814
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:27,100
you a lot of fights.

1815
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,400
I saw a lot of fights there.
I'm got to have your shit together,

1816
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:29,570
you know.
So.

1817
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:35,500
So went back to Manchester was bored.
I mean Manchester has a lot of great 

1818
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,040
elements to it.
There's not a huge amount of work for an

1819
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:42,041
act today.
You can do some soap opera is like 

1820
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:42,041
coronation street or something.
Shit.

1821
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:43,910
What's coronations true?
Incarnates street is the longest running

1822
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:48,940
soap opera in England.
I think it's been running for four 

1823
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,690
years.
Oh yeah.

1824
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,680
Uh,
is there any original cast members?

1825
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:57,410
Is a guy called Bill Roche who was in 
the first ever episode and he's been in 

1826
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:01,421
it for edges.
It's called Barlow in the show and it's 

1827
01:19:01,421 --> 01:19:02,120
a very boring,
very pedestrian,

1828
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:06,110
a slice of northern life and the way 
that you,

1829
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:09,130
the way that they combat that in England
is to have a show called east enders,

1830
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:14,290
which is about London life and 
eastenders is like drugs and crack 

1831
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:19,511
confide in markets and you know,
everyone gets their hands dirty and 

1832
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:24,700
yeah,
like snatch serialized snatch and then 

1833
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,820
carnation street is about,
you know,

1834
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:29,790
obviously we brought Ge have lost me,
brought you or what's a budget,

1835
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:32,560
like a budgerigar,
like a canary or you know,

1836
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,970
the casket,
open tray and can't get a cat down.

1837
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,080
And then they call the fire brigade and 
the fire brigade turned up.

1838
01:19:37,081 --> 01:19:38,900
I'm one of the people who's in the fire 
brigade,

1839
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:43,901
happens to be the ex lover of the person
who's got the cat and they get together 

1840
01:19:43,901 --> 01:19:45,170
and they go have a pint together and 
it's very just like a low hum.

1841
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:47,300
Very northern,
but it's a little,

1842
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:52,390
I think derogatory towards London people
because it paints them to be two 

1843
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,730
dimensional,
you know,

1844
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:55,310
they all were flat caps and all of 
football.

1845
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:57,570
Me and bit simple and you know,
I don't really know.

1846
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,610
I'm talking about all of that.
Newspaper was a bit scary or what news,

1847
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:06,700
you know,
so I was always a little offended by a 

1848
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:06,700
carnation street.
Uh,

1849
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:07,560
but that was the option when you,
Manchester,

1850
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:08,190
if you're an actor,

1851
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,200
be incarnations to you.
It wasn't really my vibe.

1852
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:15,860
So I came to La and uh,
was still am really good friends with 

1853
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:20,451
larger would so hung out with logic for 
probably a month or so just hanging out 

1854
01:20:20,451 --> 01:20:21,780
and go to Disneyland and Magic Mountain 
and do nothing.

1855
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,300
Mann's Chinese theater.
Huge deal for me.

1856
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:27,000
Huge.
Like when I was growing up the whole put

1857
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:31,020
your hands in the Clark Gable hand thing
or see how small bay gribbles feet where

1858
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:32,370
the,
that's a huge deal for me.

1859
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:37,390
That's old school Hollywood.
So I did all that and then moved to my 

1860
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:37,550
manager's place,
uh,

1861
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,740
and you know,
just kind of fucked up for a year and 

1862
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:48,291
then got my shit together and start 
going to the gym and started feeling a 

1863
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:51,610
bit better about stuff and had a couple 
of auditions that I got clothes on and 

1864
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:51,810
then ended up getting an audition for 
last and then,

1865
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,700
you know,
kind of that's all she wrote.

1866
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:59,320
Yeah,
I think you kind of have to think about 

1867
01:20:59,320 --> 01:20:59,320
the,
the,

1868
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,230
the enormity of rings was like,
it was such a big job to do and coming 

1869
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:07,680
down the other side of it,
you have to have a little bit of time to

1870
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:12,770
kind of take a breath.
And I think that was different for a 

1871
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:12,770
love of the people.
You know,

1872
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,840
Vigo went off and rode horses for a year
and you know,

1873
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:17,850
Orlando stayed working very quickly and 
billy got enrolled.

1874
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,560
The rode horses,
like no acting,

1875
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:21,500
just rode horses.
I think for the light.

1876
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:22,670
The first year after law,
the rings,

1877
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,530
he was very much into just being on his 
own riding horses.

1878
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,470
He's like one of those Daniel Day Lewis 
characters isn't a totally.

1879
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,730
He was so good in the fucking the 
apocalypse movie.

1880
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:33,770
What does that movie,
the road?

1881
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,280
The road.
I couldn't even watch it.

1882
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:40,330
Oh,
I got to the point where he's teaching 

1883
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:40,330
his son how to shoot himself in the 
mouth.

1884
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:40,330
I was like that.
We're good.

1885
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:44,450
Yeah.
It's active and have you seen and 

1886
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:44,450
promises,
but he plays the Russian guy with 10:11.

1887
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,450
Fantastic.
Has the naked fight in the steam room.

1888
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:50,630
He's ballsy.
He's a very ballsy act and he's a great 

1889
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:52,821
guy.
Did you guys live in New Zealand when 

1890
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:52,821
you were doing that?
Yeah,

1891
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:52,821
two years.
For two years.

1892
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:54,120
Just under two years.
What does that,

1893
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:56,220
what is that like New Zealand?
I,

1894
01:21:56,221 --> 01:22:01,221
you know,
I was dumb enough to assume that New 

1895
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:03,320
Zealand would have the weather the 
Australia has because it's close to it 

1896
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,231
on the map,
but it's actually not close to a 

1897
01:22:06,231 --> 01:22:07,721
geographically.
It's a long way away and certainly much 

1898
01:22:07,721 --> 01:22:07,721
more southern geographically then 
Australia,

1899
01:22:07,721 --> 01:22:10,290
so he kind of has an English weather 
sunny days,

1900
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,390
but generally,
you know,

1901
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,860
showers and when they call it Windy 
Wellington,

1902
01:22:13,861 --> 01:22:14,570
because,
you know,

1903
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:17,310
every year some old woman will get blown
down on the street and you know,

1904
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:18,900
it'd be a huge issue there.

1905
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:22,590
It's a very safe country in terms of 
going out and doing your thing.

1906
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,230
They have a great respect for our,
you know,

1907
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,790
everyone's,
everyone's inked,

1908
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,060
everyone's called.
It ain't.

1909
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:30,240
I've never seen so many tattoos on young
people in my life,

1910
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:33,210
which they go over that more of a tribal
thing,

1911
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:36,930
but certainly it's a rite of passage.
When you reach 18 or 20 or 21,

1912
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,530
you'll get a tattoo.
They love our.

1913
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,360
Everyone's,
everyone's a sculptor.

1914
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,300
Big Surfing community goes acute.
Um,

1915
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:50,330
they like to drink like English people,
which didn't necessarily do me any 

1916
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:52,040
favors.
We had countryside is so beautiful.

1917
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,700
Beautiful.
That's why they filmed it there,

1918
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:54,300
right?
Yeah.

1919
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,570
PDX also also Kiwi.
So he's from,

1920
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,930
he's from there.
So he wants to keep all of his movies on

1921
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:03,690
the island of New Zealand.
On the islands of New Zealand,

1922
01:23:03,691 --> 01:23:08,691
because it brings a lot industry in the.
I don't think he would've done it if he 

1923
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:09,370
knew it was outside of his wheel house,
but you can.

1924
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,530
There's nowhere else to make the Lord of
the rings.

1925
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,970
Fucking sceneries so spectacular.
The shy exists.

1926
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:19,030
You can go to the shy green rolling 
hills sheep everywhere.

1927
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,270
Cows.
Beautiful.

1928
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,380
Yeah.
It's a strange place New Zealand because

1929
01:23:22,381 --> 01:23:27,381
it's covered with all these animals to.
There's so many wild animals that were 

1930
01:23:27,381 --> 01:23:29,040
brought in there.
Like apparently there was no mammals.

1931
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:34,041
They're like in the 16 hundreds or 
whatever the fuck it was when people 

1932
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:34,041
started arriving.

1933
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:34,910
Yeah.
And they have a huge issue with that.

1934
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,220
They have a huge issue with,
uh,

1935
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:41,280
you know,
animals being brought into the very 

1936
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:41,280
strict and customs also,
you know,

1937
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,920
millions of years ago you had birds 
flying over New Zealand going,

1938
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:44,390
wow,
that place looks rad.

1939
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:45,980
Locust trees everywhere and there's no 
humans.

1940
01:23:45,981 --> 01:23:47,450
I'm going to land.
Which they did.

1941
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:52,770
And then over the course of a few more 
million years and they then lost the 

1942
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:55,511
ability to fly because they didn't need 
it because no natural predators to hold 

1943
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:57,410
these flightless birds walking around 
doing their thing.

1944
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:00,980
Then they accidentally bring in things 
like possums and rats and stuff and cats

1945
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:02,570
and these animals can't believe their 
luck.

1946
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:03,830
But like there's all these flightless 
bird,

1947
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:07,600
the carbon climate tree and one of these
birds Kakapo's Kias,

1948
01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:10,460
Kiwis,
there'll flightless they'll.

1949
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:13,460
I mean the Kakapo is a parrot,
one of the largest parents in the world.

1950
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:18,820
The mail.
We'll build a little depression in a u 

1951
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,360
shaped valley.
So he'll build 11 amplify,

1952
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:22,670
which will be a u shape valley in that 
valley.

1953
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:26,270
He'll build a depression and he'll sit 
in that depression and make a deep,

1954
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:31,360
guttural base like noise for his female 
to hear him and the female will walk 

1955
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:36,941
over.
But it takes place over the course of a 

1956
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:39,250
few days and any animal can hear that.
So the rats and the caps and the possums

1957
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,380
would just follow the sound and the male
won't move.

1958
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,910
It'll just sit there and they just kill 
them.

1959
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:48,970
They just kill them and eat,
so then now being present now being 

1960
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:50,550
protected in certain parts of New 
Zealand because these polar animals have

1961
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,550
been fucked over by with one

1962
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:57,740
Australia's had similar issues and one 
of the things that Australians had an 

1963
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,950
issue with was the proliferation of 
rabbits.

1964
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:05,290
Rabbits had gotten to Australia and they
just bread like a motherfucker and 

1965
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:08,580
spread across the entire country and 
along the way they had to figure out how

1966
01:25:08,581 --> 01:25:11,640
to mitigate the issue of these rabbits 
and the overpopulation.

1967
01:25:11,641 --> 01:25:16,350
So they brought in foxes and then the 
Fox has got out of control and then they

1968
01:25:16,351 --> 01:25:19,680
brought in feral cats.
Feral cats and foxes are like one of the

1969
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:24,681
biggest issues in all of Australia.
They just have an overwhelming amount of

1970
01:25:24,961 --> 01:25:27,840
them and they still haven't put a dent 
in the rabbit population.

1971
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:28,270
No,
no.

1972
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:33,330
I mean anytime human beings try and get 
involved with the nature of things,

1973
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,290
they make a huge mess of it.
I mean there's A.

1974
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:39,580
There's a classic story in Hawaii where 
I can't remember what the animal was.

1975
01:25:39,581 --> 01:25:44,581
I used to know,
but they brill in an animal to bring 

1976
01:25:44,581 --> 01:25:47,740
down the populations of another animal,
but the animal is Diane.

1977
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:50,260
All the other animals nocturnal.
So they never meet each other.

1978
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,700
They just smell each other.
Like I know he's a rat.

1979
01:25:52,701 --> 01:25:54,760
Is Subway is borrow,
you know.

1980
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:56,800
So that's hilarious.
It's scary.

1981
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:57,610
I mean,
you know,

1982
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:01,210
I think humans,
well,

1983
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,950
I don't think humans are easily my least
favorite animal on the planet.

1984
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:07,760
I don't have a huge amount of hope for 
them as a species.

1985
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:12,020
I'm pretty ashamed to retailers and Oh 
kimmy would dong dude.

1986
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:17,290
But you're nice.
I'm nice when we're talking about the 

1987
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:18,440
individual that's tangential,
I mean as a species,

1988
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,480
but you know,
we,

1989
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:22,070
we,
uh,

1990
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:27,250
a mess and we're breeding out of control
and for some reason we,

1991
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:32,320
we place a huge amount of importance on 
human life because our brains are 

1992
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,460
developed to the point where we think 
that we're special.

1993
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:39,461
But if you were to take humans off this 
planet and have a look at it in 200 

1994
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:43,241
years,
it would be a vibrantly green blue 

1995
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:45,050
planet living in balance with itself.
If you had to take right,

1996
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:47,120
but you wouldn't want to live there.
Well yeah.

1997
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:52,300
He wouldn't be able to tell anybody.
That'd be no restaurants and they know 

1998
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:52,300
movies.
Whatever.

1999
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:52,300
Get Mad.

2000
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,990
You would have never worked.
Never worked,

2001
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:56,660
but I know computers.
I would live in the plains live,

2002
01:26:56,850 --> 01:27:01,850
get you get it and you'd eaten within an
hour they'd find you and they'd fucking 

2003
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:03,590
cut you down,
but you still live in.

2004
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,110
But you live in balance with that,
with that will,

2005
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:10,070
you know if you'd state worms or an all 
spiders,

2006
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,340
old Beatles off the planet,
we would be dead in a hundred years.

2007
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:18,341
You know,
I'm lucky enough to do this show and 

2008
01:27:18,341 --> 01:27:19,700
every so often we find ourselves in the 
real wilderness way.

2009
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:24,701
You've taken a car to a river and a 
river to a boat and then walk to someone

2010
01:27:24,981 --> 01:27:29,981
else and then taking another boat for 
three hours down river and you're 

2011
01:27:29,981 --> 01:27:32,591
heading to this forest jungle light 
location and I'll see humans on the 

2012
01:27:33,411 --> 01:27:37,160
river's edge fishing or playing kids,
little six,

2013
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:38,060
seven,
eight year old kids.

2014
01:27:38,061 --> 01:27:42,050
And I think those fuckers know so much 
that we'll never know.

2015
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:45,050
They know when the rains come in,
they know when the Predator is nearby.

2016
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:50,260
They have incredible night vision.
They have hearing that we can only 

2017
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:50,330
imagine they have the ability to climb a
tree,

2018
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:53,780
like we can't all heal themselves with a
fruit or with a plan.

2019
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:57,570
And I,
I admire that much more than whoever the

2020
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,490
whatever the fuck Kanye does.
Anyone like not just county.

2021
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:03,410
I'm not picking on county,
but like I know the bronze.

2022
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:05,030
Incredible.
He's an incredible athlete.

2023
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:10,031
I have a lot of respect for him and 
Steph curry isn't an amazing basketball 

2024
01:28:10,031 --> 01:28:11,030
player.
They can't contend with the ability that

2025
01:28:11,031 --> 01:28:13,430
these children have these light indigo 
child.

2026
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:18,431
Right.
But much like your agent told you back 

2027
01:28:18,431 --> 01:28:18,440
in the day,
they lived different lives.

2028
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:24,000
You can't compare Lebron to them and if 
you put coby Brian on that island making

2029
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:26,540
some snap,
easy put coby Brian on that island,

2030
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:27,530
he would probably starve to death.

2031
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:30,770
He put them on the court with them.
They wouldn't score a single point.

2032
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,780
Oh yes.
It's like we're.

2033
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:33,590
We're all in these different paths.
Yes.

2034
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,850
Hosts for courses,
but my,

2035
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:37,520
my retort to that would be,
you know,

2036
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:42,640
the the correct way to live on this 
planet would be the way that they're 

2037
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,370
doing it and all the way coby is doing 
it.

2038
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:45,920
Who knows how coby lives his life.
He is an extraordinary athlete,

2039
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,850
but in terms of excess and unpolished,
in terms of the excess of,

2040
01:28:49,851 --> 01:28:52,400
let's say Los Angeles,
the waste,

2041
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,950
the portion size,
the pollution,

2042
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,560
the traffic,
we're not getting it right.

2043
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:58,760
We've,
we've got it wrong.

2044
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:01,710
We don't seem inclined necessarily to it

2045
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,800
in the western world because we're like,
well,

2046
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:06,120
yeah,
but we can all eat.

2047
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:08,190
We live in warm houses.
We get DIRECTV.

2048
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:13,280
Like I'm just chilling.
Like intuit really hits the fan and the 

2049
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:13,380
tsunami comes in.
We're good.

2050
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,390
The other people,
those Africans,

2051
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:17,910
they've kind of fucked it up and the 
people in Southeast Asia,

2052
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:19,470
they fucked it up in South America is a 
mess.

2053
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:21,930
But in la you like,
same way we did it.

2054
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:27,050
We succeeded or not succeeded,
but not living in balance with our 

2055
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:27,150
planet.
We are killing our planet.

2056
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:32,490
It is on its way and it might not happen
in our lifetime and I know certain 

2057
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:36,501
people have said this for generations.
You have all these scientists saying it 

2058
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:39,411
might not happen in my lifetime,
but it was certainly happened in the 

2059
01:29:39,411 --> 01:29:41,421
next and I'm part of that was that those
people representing that comment as 

2060
01:29:41,421 --> 01:29:45,141
well,
but I do believe that we're at that 

2061
01:29:45,141 --> 01:29:45,450
tipping point of like,
what are we?

2062
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:46,930
What are we doing?
Why are we here?

2063
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:50,540
We're not here to make cash.
We can't be because I mean it's.

2064
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:55,630
It's about moving from being a human 
species that made some mistakes and 

2065
01:29:56,851 --> 01:30:01,851
realize the limitations of our planet to
living as a human species that has the 

2066
01:30:01,851 --> 01:30:04,740
potential to go forward into our future.
At the moment,

2067
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:07,110
there is no future for human beings.
It's a.

2068
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,440
it's a ticking clock.
We need to take that clock out of the 

2069
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,800
scenario to be a successful species 
because Andy did it.

2070
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,840
These did it,
wounds did it,

2071
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:18,240
and which are my favorite animal by the 
way,

2072
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:22,560
live in extremely condensed societies.
There's no murder,

2073
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,420
there's no rape.
They look after their kids.

2074
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,600
They made their forest healthier.
They leave no carbon footprint.

2075
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,120
They make the planet bear.
I can't talk.

2076
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,560
They don't make movies.
Music is bullshit.

2077
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:34,480
They may make me have a conversation 
with them.

2078
01:30:34,481 --> 01:30:36,070
You want to beat your head up against a 
rock.

2079
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,560
If you wanted to fuck one,
you'd be something wrong with you.

2080
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:44,250
People are way better than ads.
I think that what we're doing is 

2081
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:47,581
definitely tragic.
If you look at the consequences that 

2082
01:30:47,581 --> 01:30:47,920
human society has on the environment 
itself,

2083
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:53,130
but if you look at the potential that 
human minds and human creativity and 

2084
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:57,151
ingenuity half and you look at what 
we've been able to accomplish with raw 

2085
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,980
materials and what we've been able to 
build in this incredible world.

2086
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:03,550
Just the ability to do this kind of a 
show where you're broadcasting something

2087
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:08,790
right now,
it's flying through the air into 

2088
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:10,930
people's phones because people in their 
car that are listening to this in real 

2089
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:14,491
time.
I just think that what we need to do is 

2090
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:18,721
put some of that ingenuity on figuring 
out how to be more renewable and figure 

2091
01:31:19,001 --> 01:31:24,001
out how to way to be more sustainable,
but I don't think that's outside of the 

2092
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:24,250
realm of possibility by any stretch of 
the imagination.

2093
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:29,490
I just think it's hard because people 
live in the moment and they don't feel 

2094
01:31:29,771 --> 01:31:34,771
the consequences of their actions until 
they're too late and I think that's an 

2095
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:38,521
issue that people have to recognize the 
consequences globally of the human race 

2096
01:31:39,221 --> 01:31:42,940
and what this,
this thirst for innovation and expansion

2097
01:31:42,941 --> 01:31:45,730
and overpopulation,
what what is the impact on it.

2098
01:31:45,731 --> 01:31:50,731
But there's been a lot of talk and a lot
of a lot of thought and a lot of 

2099
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:56,020
planning and preparing for an eventual 
world where we don't have waste.

2100
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:00,190
I think just even the concept of waste 
is just about not

2101
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:05,190
thinking things all the way through and 
that a lot of what is waste is really 

2102
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:10,021
just an alternate source of energy that 
needs to figure out how to be used or we

2103
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:13,990
need to figure out how to use it.
But I'm a huge fan of people.

2104
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:18,991
They're my favorite animal.
Unless you at least favorite animal on 

2105
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:22,231
the planet,
you're allowed to have your opinion and 

2106
01:32:22,231 --> 01:32:22,870
then you have seen people totally 
entitled to that.

2107
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,880
People are all my favorite people.
Yes.

2108
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:26,120
Uh,
you know,

2109
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:29,380
there are some very,
very smart minds out there and obviously

2110
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:34,381
the most impressive thing would you 
rather hang out with them or a panda I 

2111
01:32:34,381 --> 01:32:37,870
would rather go with can really the 
hottest chick in the world who's super 

2112
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:37,870
smart.
Would you rather hang out with her?

2113
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:38,980
A squirrel.
I mean,

2114
01:32:38,981 --> 01:32:40,960
I've hung out with hot chicks before.
I feel like I've got.

2115
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:46,230
You've got it down,
but you don't know the squirrel and you 

2116
01:32:46,230 --> 01:32:48,531
only need to get to know that I've got 
feed him and nut and figure out what is 

2117
01:32:48,531 --> 01:32:48,531
it?
Do you shit.

2118
01:32:48,531 --> 01:32:50,140
You eat nuts.
What else do you ponder the universe?

2119
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:52,630
Do you realize they were alone and 
infinity?

2120
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:55,010
There is a mystery about those animals 
that I don't,

2121
01:32:55,011 --> 01:32:55,210
I don't

2122
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,610
field of mystery as much with human 
beings.

2123
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:58,560
Yeah.
And,

2124
01:32:59,060 --> 01:32:59,950
and,
and you know,

2125
01:32:59,951 --> 01:33:02,230
there are,
there have been some incredibly profound

2126
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:07,231
leaps in technology with some very,
very smart people on this planet and we 

2127
01:33:07,231 --> 01:33:11,371
are doing the best that we can do.
I would argue that all of those 

2128
01:33:11,371 --> 01:33:15,000
technological breakthroughs and all of 
those concepts that we have and all of 

2129
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,241
those ways that we can talk about being 
impressive as a species because we 

2130
01:33:18,241 --> 01:33:21,430
cannot avoid.
It comes from a very human angle.

2131
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:25,060
We're looking at it in a human conundrum
because we're in our brain was saying,

2132
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:26,650
well that's fine.
You know,

2133
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,990
humans can be Dicks,
but think about what we've done.

2134
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,980
We went to the fucking moon and you 
know,

2135
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:36,030
we know what the dark side of Mars looks
like and we put robots on Mars and we 

2136
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:40,270
can create music that was made in an 
orchestra based on scratches in a record

2137
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:42,850
group like that.
That shit is insane.

2138
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:44,970
It doesn't matter.
None of that stuff match.

2139
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:50,130
It's not why we're here and it doesn't,
it doesn't do anything for the larger 

2140
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:54,370
concept of this universe and this 
planet.

2141
01:33:54,371 --> 01:33:57,370
It does something for us as a species.
Selfishly,

2142
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,520
we're amazing what we did.
We created this thing and you know we 

2143
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,520
went to the moon ends.
Don't care that you went to the moon.

2144
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,330
Well,
the universe doesn't care of ants exist.

2145
01:34:06,331 --> 01:34:09,390
I mean,
if the universe doesn't have any feeling

2146
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:11,700
for this planet,
this planet will disappear.

2147
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:14,460
This,
this star will eventually run out of gas

2148
01:34:14,461 --> 01:34:19,461
and burn out and Supernova and all the 
planets in orbit will be unsustainable 

2149
01:34:19,461 --> 01:34:22,290
for any kind of life that we understand 
and the universe won't give a fuck.

2150
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:27,291
You know why?
Because it's infinite and somewhere out 

2151
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:29,601
there there's a billion fucking earths 
in a billion solar systems that are 

2152
01:34:29,601 --> 01:34:33,660
absolutely exactly the same as ours and 
it doesn't care,

2153
01:34:33,661 --> 01:34:35,700
so it doesn't matter whether you're an 
aunt or a person,

2154
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:41,030
but to say that it doesn't matter that 
there's someone put those grooves after 

2155
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:42,890
spending all this time talking about how
great monty Python r that's,

2156
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,470
but it's not just for you.
It's for all the people that experienced

2157
01:34:46,471 --> 01:34:51,471
that and the what.
What humans can do that these animals 

2158
01:34:51,471 --> 01:34:51,960
can't do is spread these experiences as 
art.

2159
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,890
Whether it's Louis Ck standup or Sarah 
Silvermans,

2160
01:34:54,891 --> 01:34:58,100
standup or Monty Python's jokes or Janis
music,

2161
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:03,460
what he can't say that that's nothing 
because what that has done is elevate 

2162
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:07,870
the emotions of every single human being
that's experienced that and you could 

2163
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:11,621
say that human beings aren't important,
but then in that case and nothing is 

2164
01:35:11,621 --> 01:35:11,621
important,
life is not important.

2165
01:35:11,621 --> 01:35:16,601
The ocean is not important.
Not really in a greater spectrum of the 

2166
01:35:16,601 --> 01:35:17,660
universe.
This infinite thing that we exist in,

2167
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:23,320
none of that is statistically important,
but to us for an entity that is 

2168
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,710
experiences that you're way more 
important to me than a squirrel.

2169
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:30,800
I'll just tell you right now,
way more than aunt.

2170
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:33,110
If I had an anime and if I crushed that 
aunt,

2171
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,780
if I could get a giggle out of you at 
smash that animal,

2172
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:36,680
you weren't getting gigs.

2173
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,870
Cry For the would cry for an aunt.
Well,

2174
01:35:40,871 --> 01:35:45,871
I wouldn't necessarily cry,
but if you had an end on you and you 

2175
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:45,871
were like,
I'm going to crush this.

2176
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:46,090
How do you feel about it?
I would go into,

2177
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,280
go into a long chicken.
You were eating chicken.

2178
01:35:49,281 --> 01:35:50,290
He.
I was eating chicken.

2179
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:51,940
I mean,
it happens,

2180
01:35:51,941 --> 01:35:52,720
you know,
it doesn't happen.

2181
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:54,220
I go out,
it doesn't happen.

2182
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:56,440
I killed them.
That's true.

2183
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:01,920
I go out my way to try and live in 
balance and be nice to the university as

2184
01:36:02,771 --> 01:36:06,250
best as I can because it makes me feel 
bad.

2185
01:36:06,251 --> 01:36:08,420
It makes me feel that my life is in more
balance.

2186
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:10,030
If I,
if I do that,

2187
01:36:10,031 --> 01:36:15,031
you know,
I'm actually working in flow with the 

2188
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:18,811
universe and I agree.
I don't necessarily think that the 

2189
01:36:18,811 --> 01:36:18,811
universe has a bias one way or the 
other.

2190
01:36:18,811 --> 01:36:23,070
If we were to play around with the idea 
of the universe sitting down with a pad 

2191
01:36:23,891 --> 01:36:27,500
and a piece of paper and they drew a 
line in it and they went in on one side,

2192
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:28,880
humans on the other side and they.

2193
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:32,110
They weighed up the pros and cons and 
it's with every time they win,

2194
01:36:32,111 --> 01:36:32,770
every time.
Joe,

2195
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,470
what do you mean by the pros and cons to
that too?

2196
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:40,500
You know,
the universe is having a conversation 

2197
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:40,900
with Jimmy Hendrix and Jimmy Hendrix 
says,

2198
01:36:40,901 --> 01:36:42,850
okay,
you tell me,

2199
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:45,910
which is the most impressive animal to 
you.

2200
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:51,030
If you were to compare humans with ants,
I believe that the universe of say 

2201
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:54,880
there's no contest.
These animals live in complete balance 

2202
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,950
with the planet and they do all the 
right things.

2203
01:36:56,951 --> 01:37:01,951
They take care of their kids.
They don't fuck with other animals 

2204
01:37:01,951 --> 01:37:02,200
unless they need to.
The the right amount of food,

2205
01:37:02,201 --> 01:37:03,640
they create almost no waste.
Meanwhile,

2206
01:37:03,641 --> 01:37:07,420
you've got this,
blow it over intelligent.

2207
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:11,530
Eight days running around going,
we invented the world.

2208
01:37:11,531 --> 01:37:16,531
We can do whatever we want with it were 
abusive towards the planet that we live 

2209
01:37:16,531 --> 01:37:16,531
on.
I don't think the universe would slap

2210
01:37:16,531 --> 01:37:17,910
around a little bit.
I don't know.

2211
01:37:17,911 --> 01:37:22,911
I mean ultimately I don't know if the 
universe is an entity that really 

2212
01:37:22,911 --> 01:37:23,670
contemplates these issues,
but if it was,

2213
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:28,690
I mean if you really were examining the 
life of human beings in comparison to 

2214
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:30,120
the life of everything else on this 
planet,

2215
01:37:30,121 --> 01:37:35,121
you would have to assume first of all,
that there's just so much inspiring 

2216
01:37:35,281 --> 01:37:40,281
potential for creativity that comes out 
of this one weird monkey that makes 

2217
01:37:40,281 --> 01:37:43,820
mouth noises and expresses itself 
through facial expressions and and,

2218
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:47,130
and written language.
There's is a very,

2219
01:37:47,131 --> 01:37:50,310
very bizarre creature that human beings 
are,

2220
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:55,580
and I would say if I was completely 
objective and had no connection 

2221
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:59,451
whatsoever to human beings,
I would say that fucking thing is way 

2222
01:37:59,451 --> 01:38:01,020
more impressive than ants.
That thing is flying through the air and

2223
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:04,680
metal tubes on a daily basis all across 
the world.

2224
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:09,750
That thing is sending video through the 
sky into a fucking phone that slips into

2225
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:10,620
his pockets.

2226
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:15,950
That thing is driving on this hard 
surface that it's laid out all over the 

2227
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:20,661
world.
These internal combustion engines are 

2228
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:23,631
powering these metal boxes.
They pulled the metal out of the ground 

2229
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:24,900
and forged it into the form of metal 
boxes.

2230
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:29,340
Then they've covered these wheels with 
rubber and a fucking explosion,

2231
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:34,460
a controlled explosion inside this iron 
cast iron block is forcing this car 

2232
01:38:35,881 --> 01:38:40,881
around.
They stop in these places where they 

2233
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:43,180
pull out this fueled that they've taken 
fossil fuel from around the world and 

2234
01:38:44,071 --> 01:38:47,040
tankers and pipelines and they've,
they've,

2235
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:52,110
they've processed it.
It is gasoline that they can then pump 

2236
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:53,700
into this car.
They paid for it with a credit card.

2237
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:56,910
Money is numbers that are on a computer 
somewhere.

2238
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:58,980
They have paper that represents this 
money.

2239
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,190
No one understands.
It's a fucking insanely complex world.

2240
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:04,410
Insanely complex.
If you.

2241
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:07,190
If you're looking at the universe,
it turned me.

2242
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,530
If the universe is looking,
you know,

2243
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:12,210
at at life on earth in terms of what's 
more impressive,

2244
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:13,920
Jesus fucking Christ.

2245
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:19,240
There's nothing more impressive than 
people that disagree and also that also 

2246
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:22,520
that fueled by the ways is killing the 
planet and the universe.

2247
01:39:22,521 --> 01:39:23,170
Potentially.
It might.

2248
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:28,210
My concept of the university universe,
how's the gas having to cough up some of

2249
01:39:28,251 --> 01:39:29,870
that shit that is being created on 
earth.

2250
01:39:29,871 --> 01:39:30,560
Right?
Oh,

2251
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:33,080
don't get too close to that.
You know?

2252
01:39:33,081 --> 01:39:36,260
I mean it's not good for us and it 
eventually,

2253
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:41,261
but I think if you look at it in 
perspective of like how long human 

2254
01:39:41,261 --> 01:39:41,261
beings have been here.
Yeah,

2255
01:39:41,261 --> 01:39:43,130
we've met a massive things like really 
quickly,

2256
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:48,400
but also the amount of innovation that 
has occurred in our lifetimes in the 

2257
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:52,730
industrialized world lifetime over the 
course of x amount of hundreds of years.

2258
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:56,360
It's fucking staggering.
It's no wonder they haven't caught up to

2259
01:39:56,420 --> 01:40:01,420
what they're doing and figured out how 
to mitigate all the issues that they've 

2260
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:03,860
created by making internal combustion 
engines and airplanes and pollution.

2261
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:09,160
Well,
airplanes can only create so much 

2262
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:09,160
pollution and that's the real

2263
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:12,290
global warming is fucking airplanes and 
the world actually is it changes the 

2264
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:15,330
temperature of the earth.
When when September 11th rolled around,

2265
01:40:15,331 --> 01:40:16,950
they stopped flying over the United 
States.

2266
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:22,130
It altered the temperature of the earth 
in a significant statistically 

2267
01:40:22,130 --> 01:40:22,130
measurable.

2268
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:26,300
I mean cows farting causes a huge house 
gases,

2269
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:31,320
but in my mind as an atheist,
my idea of the universe is probably a 

2270
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,341
little closer to a little a statute that
we have something living in complete 

2271
01:40:35,341 --> 01:40:38,440
balance with the universe,
which I think the universe would respect

2272
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:41,470
a little bit more in an end than they 
would in a human,

2273
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,240
but if you tell him about something 
impressive,

2274
01:40:43,241 --> 01:40:48,241
which all those things are impressive,
that's certainly comes from a human 

2275
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:48,820
bias.
How do we equate things that impresses,

2276
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:53,850
oh,
the fact that we can drive cars that is 

2277
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:55,381
impressive for humans.
Elephants watches go by and they think 

2278
01:40:55,381 --> 01:40:55,381
that's impressive.
A Jaguar,

2279
01:40:55,381 --> 01:40:59,970
let's say,
can hunt completely silently in the 

2280
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:03,961
dark,
make not one noise and catch the 

2281
01:41:03,961 --> 01:41:07,861
creature that is looking for with 
complete and utter economy and sit down,

2282
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,360
eat that creature and then sleep for two
or three days.

2283
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:15,540
That for me is more impressive than 
hawkings mind or then some theory that 

2284
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:20,431
Einstein came up with their living in 
balance and flow with the universe and 

2285
01:41:20,431 --> 01:41:22,210
the doing it in such a way that this 
creature right here,

2286
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:25,090
the is also about balancing flow goes.
You're fucking radical.

2287
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:30,620
Oh,
I don't know if Buddha says you're 

2288
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,311
fucking radical to a Jaguar,
but I think Jaguars are obviously 

2289
01:41:32,311 --> 01:41:35,050
incredibly impressive and spectacular 
and I'm not arguing against Jaguars,

2290
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:40,350
but someone was arguing against vision.
Goggle can lead some food out for that 

2291
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:44,131
stupid Jaguar and shoot it in the head 
and turn it into a jockstrap if they 

2292
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:44,860
wanted to live in flow with that planet.
Well,

2293
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:48,280
what's in flow with this poor little 
antelope getting killed by this Jaguar,

2294
01:41:48,281 --> 01:41:50,890
which jumps around it well,
so you decide.

2295
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,980
So you decide.
Decide to some.

2296
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:58,020
Some gallon of Jaguar Thong.
I now she's sitting out there on her 

2297
01:41:58,190 --> 01:42:03,190
pores where their headphones on so she 
doesn't blow her here off while she 

2298
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,990
shoots at 300 win mag a Jaguar was going
after a piece of meat.

2299
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,940
It bums me out so hard when you see 
these beautiful women on twitter,

2300
01:42:07,941 --> 01:42:11,170
the opposing with deadlines and dead 
rhinos and elephants just like,

2301
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:13,480
well,
you doing this is a very weird thing.

2302
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:18,870
It's a very weird thing that people want
to fly over and shoot like giraffes and 

2303
01:42:19,481 --> 01:42:24,481
all these different things,
but then when you get into the 

2304
01:42:24,481 --> 01:42:24,760
conservation aspect of it,
it gets very cloudy.

2305
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:27,820
It's not as simple as,
you know,

2306
01:42:27,821 --> 01:42:31,060
people are doing cruel things and 
killing these animals.

2307
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:36,061
Then posing them and taking pictures.
The amount of money that's generated by 

2308
01:42:36,061 --> 01:42:39,031
these people doing that is substantially
more than any other conservation effort 

2309
01:42:39,031 --> 01:42:43,770
that's out there.
It gets real weird because like this 

2310
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:46,381
rhino thing,
I had the guy on Corey Knowlton that 

2311
01:42:46,381 --> 01:42:47,590
killed that black rhino and you know,
I wanted to find out like what?

2312
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:48,760
Why did he do it?
Where?

2313
01:42:48,761 --> 01:42:49,680
Where's his head at?

2314
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,400
You know what?
First of all,

2315
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:52,910
that Rhino Fed,
you know,

2316
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,880
who knows how many villagers,
I mean they,

2317
01:42:54,881 --> 01:42:59,881
they,
they had all the images of them cutting 

2318
01:42:59,881 --> 01:42:59,881
up that Ryan on feeding all these 
villagers that Rhino was also,

2319
01:42:59,881 --> 01:43:04,860
they needed to kill that rhino because 
the population is very small of the 

2320
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:05,980
rhinos.
Net Rhino is killing other male rhinos.

2321
01:43:05,981 --> 01:43:09,880
It was a non breeding older male and it 
was a very aggressive and killed females

2322
01:43:09,881 --> 01:43:12,400
killed males and in order to keep the 
population healthy,

2323
01:43:12,401 --> 01:43:14,680
they had to eliminate that rhino.
They were trying to figure out how to do

2324
01:43:14,681 --> 01:43:19,681
it and this guy paying all that money to
fly over there and kill that Rhino is 

2325
01:43:19,681 --> 01:43:24,001
actually better counterintuitively 
better for the overall population of 

2326
01:43:24,161 --> 01:43:25,240
those rhinos.
Also,

2327
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,940
the $350,000
pays for Rangers.

2328
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,050
It stops poaching.
You know,

2329
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:35,070
one of the interesting things they're 
doing now to stop poaching is they've 

2330
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:35,410
come out with three d printing of rhino 
horns.

2331
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:39,850
They're going to make artificial rhino 
horns and flood the market and Asia.

2332
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,990
Apparently these are virtually 
indistinguishable from wild rhino horns.

2333
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:48,991
They actually share Rhino Dna.
They make them a Keratin and they're 

2334
01:43:48,991 --> 01:43:51,980
going to three d print these rhino horns
and just follow the in Asia.

2335
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:53,870
It is brilliant,
but it's.

2336
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,070
It's crazy that they need to do this 
mate.

2337
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:02,140
Poaching is way more of an issue for 
Rhino death and in in any of these 

2338
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:05,480
exotic animals than hunting is a lot of 
places that we go.

2339
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:10,560
They discolor the whole,
which doesn't cause any grief to the 

2340
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,411
rhino itself.
They'll color the on orange or red or 

2341
01:44:14,411 --> 01:44:17,330
yellow so that it loses the value ground
for the medicinal market.

2342
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:22,331
Like you said,
it's made a character is the same 

2343
01:44:22,331 --> 01:44:22,331
material that makes up fingers,
fingernails,

2344
01:44:22,331 --> 01:44:22,400
and heres the thing.
Bite your fingernails.

2345
01:44:22,401 --> 01:44:23,450
If you think you're going to kill 
cancer,

2346
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:24,020
bite your fingers.

2347
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:29,290
You're speaking logically about things 
that are just totally based in 

2348
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:29,290
superstitious.
I mean,

2349
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:29,960
they get Viagra.
You Fuck,

2350
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:31,970
you don't have to eat a Rhino Horn to 
get your dick hard.

2351
01:44:31,971 --> 01:44:34,010
This is nonsense.
It doesn't work either.

2352
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,800
That doesn't mean it's not like you eat 
red meat.

2353
01:44:35,801 --> 01:44:40,801
It's crazy that these things are going 
extinct because if it would be one 

2354
01:44:40,801 --> 01:44:41,240
thing,
if you ate rhino horns and it really did

2355
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:44,450
make your Dick hard as a rock and then 
you could fuck all night for days,

2356
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:46,010
but it doesn't,
right?

2357
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:51,040
It doesn't even work,
but yet people are still killing them 

2358
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,920
for that very reason and I've had this 
conversation with people a lot where 

2359
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:53,920
where I say,
let's say like let you were just saying,

2360
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,360
let's say for the sake of argument,
it does work.

2361
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
It does work.
That does not give us the right to kill 

2362
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:02,000
the animal,
to the point of extinction,

2363
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:02,000
not.

2364
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,690
Well.
It doesn't make any sense because 

2365
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:06,690
there's other things that it does.
It's one thing that if you.

2366
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:09,380
If Rhino Horns made people super 
geniuses and cured cancer,

2367
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:10,850
then you'd be like,
okay,

2368
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:16,150
we have to figure it out.
We'd have to figure out a way to breed 

2369
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:19,031
more rhinos.
We don't want to make rhinos going 

2370
01:45:19,031 --> 01:45:19,670
extinct because they're essentially the 
fountain of of of Wisdom.

2371
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:25,900
If you kill them off,
then you lose this one opportunity to 

2372
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:28,820
figure out how this one animal developed
as property that is so greatly aids.

2373
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,590
It'd be pretty ironic if if rhino horns 
made people the ultimate human being,

2374
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,800
but yet we're killing them off to try to
become the ultimate human being and 

2375
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:39,530
robbing ourselves of this one source.
But again,

2376
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,270
you know that's a.
that's a very,

2377
01:45:41,271 --> 01:45:43,810
very strong human angle.
You know the,

2378
01:45:43,811 --> 01:45:47,330
the Rhino Ollie animals that exist on 
our planet,

2379
01:45:47,410 --> 01:45:51,560
a fair game to be explored and had to 
look at to see how they benefit us,

2380
01:45:51,561 --> 01:45:53,000
but how about how they benefit the 
world?

2381
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,000
You know what I mean?
The The majesty of an elephant's hole 

2382
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,601
and is based around the fact that an 
elephant's Tusk is based on the fact 

2383
01:46:00,601 --> 01:46:01,610
that it's attached to an elephant,
not the fact that you can cut it off and

2384
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:06,611
put it on your mental peace rosal value.
Then we look at things from this human 

2385
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:09,980
angle as opposed to this planetary 
universe type angle,

2386
01:46:09,981 --> 01:46:12,230
which some of us do,
but again,

2387
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:17,231
with the rhino thing,
the conservationists that are trying to 

2388
01:46:17,231 --> 01:46:17,990
protect the rhinos,
they all agree that you have to kill the

2389
01:46:17,991 --> 01:46:21,620
aggressive non breeding older males in 
order to keep the population healthy.

2390
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:26,680
Yes.
So like this guy going over there and 

2391
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:26,680
killing this rhino,
it's very.

2392
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,040
The whole thing is very cloudy because 
it's very counterintuitive.

2393
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:33,110
Right.
Have you seen Louis Thoreau's 

2394
01:46:33,110 --> 01:46:33,110
documentary on African Safaris?
Yeah.

2395
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:36,680
Fascinating.
Because all of these animals that he.

2396
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:39,170
When he went to those South African 
hunting camps,

2397
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:44,500
all those animals were on the verge of 
extinction just 20 years ago and now 

2398
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:47,141
they're flourishing,
but they're flourishing and these camps 

2399
01:46:47,141 --> 01:46:47,141
where you can hunt them.
Right.

2400
01:46:47,141 --> 01:46:49,100
Ken Hunting,
it's so weird.

2401
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:54,110
It's.
There's a lot of places that he's not 

2402
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:55,971
allowed to go because of that,
because of a few things that louise 

2403
01:46:55,971 --> 01:46:55,971
done,
like he's,

2404
01:46:55,971 --> 01:46:55,971
he,
you know,

2405
01:46:55,971 --> 01:46:58,860
he's obviously quite a controversial 
documentary and it shouldn't be.

2406
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:00,180
He's up.
He's amazing.

2407
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:02,670
He's fantastic.
Nothing controversial about what he does

2408
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:05,380
in my opinion.
He's just honest and thorough and,

2409
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:06,690
and brilliant.
I mean,

2410
01:47:06,691 --> 01:47:08,850
I think what he did with that hunting 
camp,

2411
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,150
it really exposed how bizarre that whole
world is.

2412
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:15,030
This show called the bizarro world or 
something.

2413
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,980
Louis Ck is bizarre adventure.
So bizarre.

2414
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:19,650
It's not lucy,
Kate's luther,

2415
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,060
luther,
um,

2416
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:22,690
I forgot what it's called,
what the name of.

2417
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:27,690
I don't think he can go to South Africa 
at the moment because of upsetting some 

2418
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:30,240
people in South Africa about something,
you know?

2419
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:32,100
Was it because of that or were there 
different,

2420
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,910
different thing?
Super.

2421
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:39,790
Well,
I know a scientology is doing a 

2422
01:47:39,790 --> 01:47:39,900
documentary on him.
Oh,

2423
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:44,901
well yeah,
because he's doing a documentary on 

2424
01:47:44,901 --> 01:47:47,121
them.
So they decided to do a documentary on 

2425
01:47:47,121 --> 01:47:47,121
him and he said,
watch.

2426
01:47:47,121 --> 01:47:50,980
Yeah,
well I want to watch both of them 

2427
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:52,380
actually want to watch what kind of 
crazy shit they have to say about him.

2428
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:55,020
Like what they do nutty thing.
Have they concocted,

2429
01:47:55,021 --> 01:48:00,021
they do free.
I think it's free brunch or free lunch 

2430
01:48:00,021 --> 01:48:04,160
on a Saturday near where I live and you 
see people going in there full,

2431
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:06,630
you know,
from a personality test.

2432
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,120
Eleven 30 to 1:00
and people would come up and be like,

2433
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:10,560
are you enjoying the chicken?

2434
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,560
Yeah,
you want to come into this little tiny 

2435
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:15,560
room with me and answer a few questions 
like,

2436
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:18,951
fuck,
I hope all the homeless people go and 

2437
01:48:18,951 --> 01:48:20,160
get free food often,
but shit like that gives me the willies.

2438
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:22,530
Organized religion in general gives me 
the willies.

2439
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:27,890
Well,
they're one of the most bizarre ones 

2440
01:48:27,890 --> 01:48:29,841
because they were founded by the most 
prolific science fiction author the 

2441
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:31,200
world has ever known.
You know the idea that,

2442
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:36,230
well,
he lied and made up a bunch of shit 

2443
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:36,230
except this.
This is all trip.

2444
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:36,600
Well,
he's the statements where you said,

2445
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:41,601
my next,
my next mission was to try and come up 

2446
01:48:41,601 --> 01:48:41,601
with a religion to do.
And he did it.

2447
01:48:41,601 --> 01:48:41,970
Oh yeah.
I mean,

2448
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
not just statement.
His ex wife spoke in great detail about 

2449
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,900
his plans in order to create some sort 
of religion,

2450
01:48:48,901 --> 01:48:50,520
really profit off of it.
I mean,

2451
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:53,460
he spent a good deal of his life living 
in a boat,

2452
01:48:53,461 --> 01:48:55,860
hiding from the irs,
you know,

2453
01:48:55,890 --> 01:49:00,890
because before they were tax exempt or 
tax free status before they had that 

2454
01:49:01,651 --> 01:49:02,520
status,
they were,

2455
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:03,210
you know,
he was,

2456
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:03,600
he was.

2457
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:08,930
He owed money because they were a cult.
Then they were taking money from their 

2458
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:09,000
members and thought,
oh,

2459
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:10,320
thanks fucking madness.
Yeah,

2460
01:49:10,321 --> 01:49:13,890
it is crazy.
But the Louis Theroux thing is a.

2461
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:19,160
for anybody who has like a hard line 
stance on this whole African hunting 

2462
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:23,631
thing,
just take a look at that and you'll 

2463
01:49:23,631 --> 01:49:23,631
probably not going to change your 
opinion,

2464
01:49:23,631 --> 01:49:26,210
but it'll give you an idea of the 
complexities and the,

2465
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:26,750
the,
the,

2466
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,180
the weirdness involved in this whole 
thing of these animals.

2467
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:35,510
Literally we're on the verge of 
extinction with the one you've seen the 

2468
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:38,541
documentary.
The old guy at the end when louise like 

2469
01:49:38,541 --> 01:49:38,640
badgering him,
he gets asked him and he goes,

2470
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,310
you don't understand.
Africa is fucked.

2471
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:46,490
It's fucked.
The only way these fucking animals are 

2472
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:46,490
going to survive is if you've got to 
give them value.

2473
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:48,010
You've got to make them more.
That's

2474
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:53,010
bizarre.
I gave them a monetary value to protect 

2475
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:53,010
them.
Yeah.

2476
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:53,620
It's very strange.
Your show.

2477
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:57,070
I'm a is wild things,
wild things with Dominic Monaghan.

2478
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:58,510
What do,
what do you do in the show?

2479
01:49:58,511 --> 01:50:01,350
There's a BBC show and it was at BBC 
America for a while.

2480
01:50:01,351 --> 01:50:04,120
It's now travel channel.
I go around the world,

2481
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:09,220
try to change people's ideas about 
animals that most people are scared of 

2482
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:12,390
and try and evoke a little bit of 
curiosity and kill fear in whether we'll

2483
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:17,340
ever scares you.
Whether you scared of little.

2484
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:22,740
Yeah.
All we had food you've never eaten or 

2485
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:26,640
animals or people of different color or 
people of different ideas about life.

2486
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:28,090
I,
uh,

2487
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:31,720
I get a lot of travel and I love 
animals.

2488
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:36,900
So what had happened with me was 
whenever I had like two or three weeks 

2489
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:37,610
off,
uh,

2490
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:42,690
I would always take a trip on my own 
unless it was hanging out with my girl 

2491
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:47,070
and the trip on my own would usually be 
pick an animal around the world and go 

2492
01:50:47,351 --> 01:50:48,130
and find the animal.

2493
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:51,430
But to make the two or three weeks 
spread out a little bit,

2494
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:56,640
instead of going directly to the source,
I would land in the capital city and 

2495
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,430
spend two or three days in the capital 
c,

2496
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:59,110
go into restaurants,
hanging out,

2497
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:02,980
hanging out in human communities and 
just asking them like,

2498
01:51:02,981 --> 01:51:04,570
hey,
where would I go and see a weld shop?

2499
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:06,220
Do you guys know about the wheelchair?
I've seen it around here,

2500
01:51:06,221 --> 01:51:08,080
where would it go?
How would I take transport,

2501
01:51:08,081 --> 01:51:09,280
do I take a train?
All that kind of stuff.

2502
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:11,950
And then gradually made my way down.
Then for the last week,

2503
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:16,980
try and do that thing.
So my agents knew about this and they 

2504
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:20,780
were,
they were constantly seen photos of my 

2505
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:20,780
adventures and stuff.
And My um,

2506
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:22,900
non acting agent kind of said to me,
you know,

2507
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:24,760
this is a show dom,
like,

2508
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:28,180
this is a show what you do,
no one does that thing that you do,

2509
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:29,890
like,
you should meet some producers.

2510
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:30,790
So I was like,
alright,

2511
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,150
I'll meet some producers.
So I sat down with different people,

2512
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:36,550
ended up sitting down with a guy from 
Canada,

2513
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:39,520
runs a production company called cream 
and he said,

2514
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:44,521
what's the show?
And I pitched him a trip that I took to 

2515
01:51:44,521 --> 01:51:47,161
find orangutans,
that trip that I took to find the whale 

2516
01:51:47,161 --> 01:51:47,161
shark trip that I took to find the King 
Cobra.

2517
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,010
And he was like,
cool,

2518
01:51:48,011 --> 01:51:49,870
do you have a ideas?
And I was like,

2519
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:52,280
I have 808 ideas.
And he went,

2520
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:57,300
all right,
come up with eight ideas and we'll come 

2521
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:57,300
back in two weeks time and write the 
show.

2522
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,400
And came down first episodes about ants 
because it's my favorite animal.

2523
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:06,510
And we went to Ecuador to find the army.
And my plan was to lie down in a carpet 

2524
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:07,430
of Armenians and what they call it,
uh,

2525
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,940
uh,
drove varmints and,

2526
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:11,110
and know what it feels like to have 
this,

2527
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:16,510
you know,
$20 million ends walking around on top 

2528
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:16,510
of you.

2529
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:20,070
And will they,
will they go into your ears and your 

2530
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:23,011
eyes and your mouth and your nostrils 
and canicula grown human being and all 

2531
01:52:23,011 --> 01:52:23,011
that they can.
And they can be.

2532
01:52:23,011 --> 01:52:24,750
You'd have to be tempted.
You'd have to be tethered you as a,

2533
01:52:24,751 --> 01:52:26,490
as an able bodied human being.
No,

2534
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,640
you just run away.
Well,

2535
01:52:27,641 --> 01:52:30,850
it depends on the type of and not really
dance can kill you.

2536
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:34,550
Now know you get a bunch of them.
I'm the authority and NS.

2537
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,940
You'd have a bunch of them climb on top 
of you.

2538
01:52:36,941 --> 01:52:38,380
You wouldn't get killed.
Well,

2539
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:41,950
you're talking about hundred of them are
very difficult.

2540
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:45,010
Bullet answer.
Extremely taut bulletins.

2541
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:48,830
Have the highest pain threshold of any 
insect sting in the world.

2542
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:50,840
Uh,
it's right at number six.

2543
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:55,841
Number one is go to sweat bee,
which is the equivalent of a tasting 

2544
01:52:55,841 --> 01:53:00,491
white wine vinegar.
The bulletin is described as walking on 

2545
01:53:00,491 --> 01:53:01,940
hot coals with a nail in your foot,
so it's extremely painful.

2546
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:06,040
Blends living relatively small 
communities for since maybe 24.

2547
01:53:06,041 --> 01:53:08,090
Ebola ends in a,
in a huge group.

2548
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:11,090
If you were to piss off a community of 
bulletins,

2549
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:13,940
the most amount that would be on you 
would probably be,

2550
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:19,510
let's say for the sake of argument 50,
which is outside the realms of 

2551
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:19,510
possibility,
but let's say 50,

2552
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:22,040
51 and kill you physically.
It would be painful,

2553
01:53:22,041 --> 01:53:25,550
but it's not like debilitatingly 
painful.

2554
01:53:25,551 --> 01:53:30,551
You would probably want to go to 
hospital to have them give you morphine 

2555
01:53:30,551 --> 01:53:31,580
so that you could go over the next three
days,

2556
01:53:31,581 --> 01:53:34,040
but it's not like 50 rattlesnakes.
Buyer's not going to kill you.

2557
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:35,540
It's not an acute.
So,

2558
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:37,130
so we did the,
we did the,

2559
01:53:37,131 --> 01:53:39,410
an episode in Ecuador.
Um,

2560
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:44,530
they ended up not allowing me to lie 
down in a carpet events because they 

2561
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:45,850
said it was too dangerous,
but I ended up putting my naked handouts

2562
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:47,090
too dangerous.
How so?

2563
01:53:47,091 --> 01:53:47,870
Well,
they just said,

2564
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:53,380
yeah,
how are we going to get them all off 

2565
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:54,671
here?
How are we going to get home with the 

2566
01:53:54,671 --> 01:53:54,671
rest of the day?
You're going to have 300,000

2567
01:53:54,671 --> 01:53:58,121
ants on your light.
We're never going to be able to get the 

2568
01:53:58,121 --> 01:53:58,121
stings out of you for you to be on TV.

2569
01:53:58,121 --> 01:54:01,170
My friend Brian Cowen,
he stayed in Bolivia for awhile.

2570
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:06,180
He was going to be some sort of a bug 
scientist.

2571
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:09,760
Whatever the fuck you would call that.
What's the entomologist entomologists?

2572
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:15,180
And um,
he was studying for it and was staying 

2573
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:15,180
in these,
uh,

2574
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:18,340
they had these huts where they were 
elevated off the floor of the jungle and

2575
01:54:18,341 --> 01:54:23,341
they would put Turpentine on the posts 
of the huts to keep the ants from 

2576
01:54:23,341 --> 01:54:25,210
crawling up into your.
Because once they find you,

2577
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,810
once they decide that you're a target,
like you're fucked.

2578
01:54:27,811 --> 01:54:28,310
Yeah.

2579
01:54:28,710 --> 01:54:29,440
Especially if you're,
you.

2580
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:30,630
If you can't move.
Like I said,

2581
01:54:30,631 --> 01:54:32,130
if you,
if you had two broken legs,

2582
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:34,610
you're in trouble with bullet.
The great thing about blends,

2583
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:35,880
and you'll see this in these 
communities,

2584
01:54:36,510 --> 01:54:41,510
in the local indigenous communities.
When the aunts moved through that 

2585
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:44,391
village,
they'll just go off for a day and they 

2586
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:44,391
just let the ants clear out all the 
scorpions.

2587
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:47,760
Oldest bide his oldest son and bs,
all the bullshit spring,

2588
01:54:47,761 --> 01:54:49,340
clean my house,
follow me on Yoga.

2589
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:50,580
Ah,
that's interesting.

2590
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,360
So that's a balance.
Yeah,

2591
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:54,600
it's a beautiful thing.
That is pretty fascinating.

2592
01:54:54,630 --> 01:54:57,330
So I'm kind of interested in the concept
of fear,

2593
01:54:57,770 --> 01:54:59,670
you know,
just as a rule,

2594
01:54:59,671 --> 01:55:04,671
I think that word is divisive and 
negative potentially and it doesn't do 

2595
01:55:04,831 --> 01:55:07,050
us any favors.
It doesn't move us forward as a,

2596
01:55:07,051 --> 01:55:10,770
as an animal.
And I kind of reject it as a concept.

2597
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:13,680
I think things are dangerous,
but the idea of fear makes you clumsy.

2598
01:55:13,681 --> 01:55:16,380
May she made the wrong decisions,
makes you do things incorrectly.

2599
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,830
So what are some of the more archetypal 
fares on the planet?

2600
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:24,860
Our heights and snakes and spiders and 
planes and we try to show people those 

2601
01:55:26,731 --> 01:55:31,731
things in a slightly more positive light
so that you can sit comfortably at home 

2602
01:55:31,731 --> 01:55:35,610
and start to change the way your brain 
chemistry works with those animals.

2603
01:55:35,611 --> 01:55:37,590
I mean,
obviously you know that like,

2604
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,980
let's say for the sake of argument,
you are scared of spiders,

2605
01:55:40,981 --> 01:55:45,981
if you hear the word spider,
spider will take you to negative things 

2606
01:55:45,981 --> 01:55:45,981
that happened in your life associated 
with spiders,

2607
01:55:45,981 --> 01:55:49,440
inner circle that you can go off and 
it's feeding that negativity.

2608
01:55:49,441 --> 01:55:54,441
But if you now put a positive story in 
there where you saw a spider with a 

2609
01:55:54,441 --> 01:55:58,701
friend that you were in love with and 
then you went off and had food that you 

2610
01:55:58,701 --> 01:55:58,800
really liked,
your starting to change that pathway.

2611
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:01,740
And if you just replace the negative 
with the positive,

2612
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:06,950
you will then feel differently about 
spiders and that's what I'm attempting 

2613
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:09,561
to do with the show.
So your motivation is not to celebrate 

2614
01:56:09,561 --> 01:56:09,561
these animals.
It's rather than mitigate fear.

2615
01:56:09,561 --> 01:56:10,650
But it's a bit of both.
I mean,

2616
01:56:10,651 --> 01:56:15,090
obviously we show the animals in,
in the light that I like to show them,

2617
01:56:15,091 --> 01:56:16,980
which is positive,
beautiful,

2618
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,740
uh,
fascinated and profoundly.

2619
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:21,420
Yeah.
Fascinating.

2620
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:24,220
What's the word I was looking for?
Um,

2621
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:28,120
where they're able to.
I'll find the witness I can,

2622
01:56:28,121 --> 01:56:33,121
but I feel like I feel like certain 
animals are able to actually move out of

2623
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:36,000
a,
a description.

2624
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:41,090
You can't define them there,
the other worldly that magical in some 

2625
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:41,700
way.
Uh,

2626
01:56:41,701 --> 01:56:44,520
so we do do that.
But uh,

2627
01:56:44,610 --> 01:56:49,610
you know,
I like to show people that at first a 

2628
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:49,610
wild animal,
the first thing of wild animals going to

2629
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:50,970
do is going to try and get away from you
and then not initially going bite you.

2630
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:53,340
The vast majority of wild animals out 
there.

2631
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:58,341
As soon as they a human bounce.
So then you or I have to then juggle the

2632
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:01,860
idea of a wild animal saying,
I'm not into this.

2633
01:57:01,861 --> 01:57:04,620
I'm going to get away.
And me trying to impose on them,

2634
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:09,890
if you hang out for a little bit,
not going to hurt you and I'm going to 

2635
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:09,890
do anything.
Just give me two minutes of your time.

2636
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:15,290
I can achieve what I want to achieve.
You can be on your way and you can see 

2637
01:57:15,290 --> 01:57:19,170
that palpably with a change in the 
animal's body language.

2638
01:57:19,171 --> 01:57:21,900
You can see,
I can see when a spider is okay with it.

2639
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:25,530
I can see when his sculpins okay with 
this snake any animal down with.

2640
01:57:25,531 --> 01:57:26,010
I'm like,
oh,

2641
01:57:26,011 --> 01:57:26,520
it's okay.
No,

2642
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:28,020
you can come closer.
You can sit down.

2643
01:57:28,021 --> 01:57:29,910
You can chill because it's animal gets 
it now,

2644
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,220
but at first the wild animals like,
I'm wild.

2645
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:33,660
I'm going to kill him.
What are you saying?

2646
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:38,661
Like a wild animal gets it.
When they see they say work out the day 

2647
01:57:38,661 --> 01:57:39,420
they pick up on its energy,
right?

2648
01:57:39,421 --> 01:57:44,421
They pick up on the change in energy.
Let's say we just did an episode in Sri 

2649
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,420
Lanka with the Indian Cobra,
Monica called Cobra.

2650
01:57:47,421 --> 01:57:52,421
What are the most iconic cobras or if no
snakes in the world with those two 

2651
01:57:52,421 --> 01:57:55,581
little glasses on the back of his head,
the one that the snake charmers work 

2652
01:57:55,581 --> 01:57:59,421
with.
So I pull like a six foot Indian Cobra,

2653
01:57:59,521 --> 01:58:02,970
have a stack of wood in the back of 
someone's house and the first thing that

2654
01:58:02,971 --> 01:58:07,971
God wants to do is get away.
So I'm holding onto it by its tail and 

2655
01:58:07,971 --> 01:58:10,761
it's trying to get wet and it's trying 
to get away and is trying to get away 

2656
01:58:10,761 --> 01:58:10,761
and intellectualize is in its snaky 
brain.

2657
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:11,610
Oh,
I can't get away.

2658
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:13,890
Why can't I get away?
So it turns around and looks at my hand.

2659
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:15,810
Other reason why I can't get ways this 
guy's hand,

2660
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,170
so now I'm going to deal with his hands 
so it tries to bite me,

2661
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:19,290
tries to bite me,
tries to bite me,

2662
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:23,290
bite me because I know how to hold onto 
his neck and low.

2663
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:26,190
Let it bite me.
If I ride out that storm,

2664
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:28,530
which usually takes about two to three 
minutes,

2665
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:33,860
the snake again and it snaky brain 
thinks this isn't working or the normal 

2666
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:35,670
ways that this works for me and animals 
got hold of me.

2667
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:36,780
I try and buy it.
Let's go.

2668
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,520
I'm free.
That's not working,

2669
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:41,500
and now I'm getting exhausted because 
I'm buying a nugget and anything for it.

2670
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:44,470
Maybe I'll just relax.
As soon as the animal relaxes,

2671
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:49,940
I then chill.
I then release a little bit of tension 

2672
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:50,410
on his tail,
move a little closer to sit down with it

2673
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:52,600
again and it snaky brain is like,
oh,

2674
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,340
I'm being fed something positive.

2675
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:56,200
Now,
if there's no tension on my tail,

2676
01:58:56,470 --> 01:59:00,490
I can move a little freer and there's an
exchange of energy with a snake now.

2677
01:59:00,491 --> 01:59:01,120
Thanks.
All right.

2678
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:03,610
I'm not going to be aggressive because 
that's not working for me.

2679
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:06,430
All this animal that's in front of me,
we chill for a little bit and talk about

2680
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:11,431
how beautiful it is.
Talked about all the amazing things 

2681
01:59:11,431 --> 01:59:11,860
about it and then let it go and the 
snake won't remember that.

2682
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:14,830
The snakes not going to name.
Then see a human a few days later and go

2683
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:17,380
positive experience.
This is cool because their brain doesn't

2684
01:59:17,381 --> 01:59:19,810
work like that.
Just doesn't benefit snake to have those

2685
01:59:19,811 --> 01:59:23,050
memories to hang onto because they don't
generally run into humans.

2686
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:25,900
Our member and maybe the audience will 
remember it.

2687
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:27,330
Maybe they'll feel differently about 
animals.

2688
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:32,720
So this show really kind of came out of 
[inaudible] came about and sort of an 

2689
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:36,120
organic manner like this is something 
that you were doing anyway for no reason

2690
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:41,210
other than.
Because you enjoy being around these 

2691
01:59:41,210 --> 01:59:43,251
animals and you have the freedom to 
travel and see things that intrigued 

2692
01:59:43,251 --> 01:59:43,251
you.
Right?

2693
01:59:43,251 --> 01:59:44,220
That's pretty fucking cool.

2694
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,520
Yeah.
I'm,

2695
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:46,720
you know,
I'm obsessed.

2696
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:48,880
It could have been a show about a few 
different things.

2697
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:50,740
I'm obsessed by a bunch of different 
things.

2698
01:59:50,741 --> 01:59:55,741
I love Manchester United.
This could have very easily been a show 

2699
01:59:55,741 --> 01:59:57,970
about me going around the world watching
major soccer rivalries around the world,

2700
01:59:57,971 --> 02:00:01,240
Andy in street food and meeting people 
and every so often seen animals.

2701
02:00:01,241 --> 02:00:03,100
I could have done that.
It could have been about street food.

2702
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:05,830
I Love Street food.
We could have done a whole episode about

2703
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:07,870
street food with a little bit of 
football and a little bit of animals.

2704
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:11,290
It just so happens that you know with,
if you create a TV show,

2705
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:14,350
the backdrop of animals,
it's an evergreen show,

2706
02:00:14,351 --> 02:00:14,950
right?
I mean,

2707
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:18,970
people want to watch shows about animals
in 10 years time this,

2708
02:00:18,971 --> 02:00:21,250
they're gonna want to watch an episode 
about Vietnam.

2709
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:24,400
Those animals are still gonna exist and 
they're still going to be like,

2710
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:25,690
oh,
well I'll watch this.

2711
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:30,750
It's 10 years old,
but he's still doing all the universal 

2712
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:30,750
things that were do and he's interested 
in the world.

2713
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:33,360
He's interested in Vietnam.
He goes to see the capital city,

2714
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:38,400
hangs out with animals,
so it was the easiest sale to build it 

2715
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,130
around animals.
But ultimately it's,

2716
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:40,810
I mean,
you know,

2717
02:00:40,811 --> 02:00:42,280
I'm getting paid to go on holiday.
Really.

2718
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:43,760
That sounds amazing.
It's cool,

2719
02:00:43,761 --> 02:00:44,650
man.
It's really cool.

2720
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:49,810
You love animals.
You obviously have this deep affection 

2721
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:49,810
for them,
but yet you eat them.

2722
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:55,350
I do eat some.
I've been vegetarian for the most part 

2723
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:55,350
this,
this year.

2724
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:59,370
Um,
and every so often I'll eat a piece of 

2725
02:00:59,370 --> 02:01:01,531
fish and when I was in South Africa I 
felt kind of weak with needing proteins.

2726
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:06,671
So a steak.
I ate this big hunk chicken today 

2727
02:01:06,671 --> 02:01:10,300
because I felt like I was kinda low on 
energy and they want to come in here and

2728
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:11,010
be like,
Hey,

2729
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:16,080
what's happening?
So I ate something to give me a little 

2730
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:16,080
bit of fuel.
But um,

2731
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:17,760
I would say,
uh,

2732
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:23,190
I don't know.
I probably meet once every two or three 

2733
02:01:23,190 --> 02:01:26,581
months,
something like I'm not the biggest dude 

2734
02:01:26,581 --> 02:01:26,581
in the world.
So for me to,

2735
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:31,650
for me to get,
for me to feel full on vegetables and 

2736
02:01:31,650 --> 02:01:35,020
fruit is fine for the most part,
but every so often my system is like,

2737
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:37,990
I need flesh and today I was like,
I need flush,

2738
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:40,040
but you like animals as much if

2739
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,590
not more than you liked people 
undoubtedly.

2740
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:45,230
But imagine if you talk to someone and 
they say,

2741
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:47,420
well I only kill people like once every 
couple weeks,

2742
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:50,390
every couple of weeks I feel like I need
to murder.

2743
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:51,800
No,
I hear you.

2744
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:52,920
That's a valid point.
And um,

2745
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:58,060
I am working on it.
I made a new year's resolution at the 

2746
02:01:58,060 --> 02:01:59,240
end of last year where I said to my 
family,

2747
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:01,070
like,
I think I'm going to go vegetarian.

2748
02:02:01,071 --> 02:02:02,540
And they all laughed at me because they 
were like,

2749
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:07,570
you eat meat and fish and you like duck 
and you eat goose and all this kind of 

2750
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:08,840
stuff.
And I was like,

2751
02:02:08,841 --> 02:02:10,370
oh,
I think I'll be okay.

2752
02:02:10,371 --> 02:02:15,371
And I've struggled a little bad times 
this year with not eating meat because I

2753
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:21,191
need the energy.
And the show that I do is very sapping 

2754
02:02:21,191 --> 02:02:23,741
of your energy.
You're in very hot countries were up at 

2755
02:02:23,741 --> 02:02:23,741
sunrise.

2756
02:02:23,741 --> 02:02:24,200
We finished at sunset,
chasing after animals,

2757
02:02:24,201 --> 02:02:26,480
putting myself in harm's way with 
dangerous animals,

2758
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:31,930
and just every so often I'm like,
I gotta I feel it to feel like I need 

2759
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:33,140
some vegetarians will call bullshit on 
that,

2760
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:33,950
you know,
they'll say like,

2761
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:38,960
that's ridiculous.
We're just not doing a good job of 

2762
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:38,960
monitoring the amount of protein that 
you,

2763
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,470
your diet takes in Keenwah,
hemp seeds,

2764
02:02:42,471 --> 02:02:45,380
whatever you need.
I mean,

2765
02:02:45,381 --> 02:02:47,870
I believe is Tofu is tricky because it's
processed,

2766
02:02:48,210 --> 02:02:48,900
you know,
pro.

2767
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:53,980
Were you dealing with Tofu?
You're dealing with very much a human 

2768
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:53,980
created thing,
right?

2769
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:54,620
I mean,
I believe as animals,

2770
02:02:54,621 --> 02:02:55,550
we're omnivores,
right?

2771
02:02:55,551 --> 02:02:57,800
What grazes certain things.
So,

2772
02:02:57,870 --> 02:03:02,870
um,
I think there's times where your body 

2773
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,870
might need a little bit,
but I'm,

2774
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:07,820
I'm open to the idea of someone saying I
can organize you a diet that has no meat

2775
02:03:08,181 --> 02:03:09,230
and you can maintain your weight.

2776
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:10,490
We were talking about this before we 
started the show.

2777
02:03:10,491 --> 02:03:13,430
Like I use,
I usually coast around about 1:50.

2778
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:18,150
If I drop five pounds,
I look like I'm.

2779
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:23,350
I'm suffering from some disease where 
you have very unique darter 

2780
02:03:23,350 --> 02:03:23,960
requirements.
It seems like because of your metabolism

2781
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:24,860
scenes.
Her Nana's.

2782
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:29,920
Yeah.
I need to know your history of doing 

2783
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:29,920
this from time you were a child or just 
you know what the warrior diet is.

2784
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,470
You ever heard of that?
Yeah,

2785
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:34,630
it's a the idea that you have one huge 
meal a day because that's how you know,

2786
02:03:34,710 --> 02:03:39,710
people ate a long time ago.
They would try to find food that would 

2787
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:43,601
get it and then when they would feast at
night and so there's a lot of people 

2788
02:03:43,601 --> 02:03:44,960
that believe that that's a really good 
way to manage your weight,

2789
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:48,080
to not eat anything at all during the 
day and then you eat at night.

2790
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:50,810
I tried it for a little while just to 
see.

2791
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:52,560
I mean I didn't try because I was 
serious about it.

2792
02:03:52,570 --> 02:03:57,570
Just like what is that?
Even something that makes sense and you 

2793
02:03:57,570 --> 02:03:58,400
can get used to it.
You can get used to not eating all day,

2794
02:03:58,401 --> 02:04:01,190
but I don't think you have the same 
amount of energy you have it,

2795
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:06,610
but that was the other thing they used 
to say that breakfast is the most 

2796
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:06,890
important meal.
They've totally abandoned that.

2797
02:04:07,190 --> 02:04:09,560
What is the most important?
There is no meals,

2798
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:11,900
you know,
there's no most important meal.

2799
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:14,590
The idea was that if you don't have a 
healthy breakfast,

2800
02:04:14,591 --> 02:04:15,460
he won't,
you know,

2801
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:19,260
you won't feel good throughout the day.
But I oftentimes don't have breakfast.

2802
02:04:19,261 --> 02:04:20,960
So I oftentimes do what I,
I,

2803
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:25,130
I call earning my breakfast while I 
don't eat until I work out and then,

2804
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:30,150
you know,
it's also because I like to put my body 

2805
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:30,150
in situations where it has to work hard 
where it doesn't,

2806
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:31,480
doesn't want to,
you know,

2807
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:33,680
like if I,
if I don't have food in my body,

2808
02:04:33,681 --> 02:04:34,430
like you're like,
you don't,

2809
02:04:34,431 --> 02:04:37,230
you can't,
it's harder to push as much energy out.

2810
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:38,070
It's harder to,

2811
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:39,420
to have the,
the amount of.

2812
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:42,450
But then you have to focus more and then
you have to force yourself into it.

2813
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:44,390
You know?
So I put myself in,

2814
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:47,640
I put myself in weird situations like 
that just to make my body function.

2815
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:49,980
You liked that battle a little bit.
I lost that battle too.

2816
02:04:49,981 --> 02:04:54,981
I think it is.
Why is why every year or so I stopped 

2817
02:04:54,981 --> 02:04:57,861
myself from having certain things.
My New Year's resolution is usually 

2818
02:04:57,861 --> 02:04:57,861
stopped.
It never stopped.

2819
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:00,300
You kind of have added sugar.
You can have that.

2820
02:05:00,301 --> 02:05:02,220
It's so you can have bread,
you can have alcohol,

2821
02:05:02,221 --> 02:05:03,590
you can have meat.
This year though,

2822
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:05,070
I've been cheating.
Um,

2823
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,840
but I mean,
you,

2824
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:09,230
you obviously don't suffer from the same
thing that I saw from my.

2825
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:11,970
My thing is putting on muscle,
you know,

2826
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:15,870
like I'll go to the gym and train as 
hard as I can for,

2827
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:18,250
you know,
the size down that uh,

2828
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,800
and then,
you know,

2829
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:25,850
I don't get as big as I would like 
unless I'm pounding food and that's 

2830
02:05:26,281 --> 02:05:28,860
just,
it's pretty stressful on my system,

2831
02:05:28,861 --> 02:05:29,190
you know?

2832
02:05:29,330 --> 02:05:30,250
Yeah.
It sounds you're,

2833
02:05:30,251 --> 02:05:32,450
you're a very unique situation when it 
comes to that.

2834
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:37,840
But you know,
you could have eggs and eggs if you get 

2835
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:38,960
them free range from healthy chickens,
there's no negative impact.

2836
02:05:38,961 --> 02:05:42,320
They make an egg every day.
I have 22 chickens at home,

2837
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:46,250
so I eat a lot of eggs are shit and my 
chickens are like my pets.

2838
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:49,490
So like I'm having food that's created 
by pets,

2839
02:05:49,580 --> 02:05:54,580
you know,
and I feed them healthy food and the 

2840
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:57,191
eggs are dark orange and they're filled 
with coleen and all sorts of healthy 

2841
02:05:57,591 --> 02:06:00,080
protein and they're really good for you.
You know,

2842
02:06:00,081 --> 02:06:02,900
you can get around killing an animal to 
eat them.

2843
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:07,980
Right?
But the thing about being a vegetarian 

2844
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,760
or being a Vegan is animals don't play 
by that rule themselves.

2845
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,700
They're constantly killing each other.
Like you were talking about the,

2846
02:06:13,701 --> 02:06:16,940
uh,
the Jaguar killing the antelope and that

2847
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:17,810
that's natural.

2848
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:22,960
Well,
the reason why human beings are here is 

2849
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:22,960
100 percent because of hunting.
If we weren't,

2850
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:27,070
if we'd never figured out hunting,
we've never figured out killing how to 

2851
02:06:27,070 --> 02:06:27,070
eat animals.
We,

2852
02:06:27,070 --> 02:06:30,710
we probably doubled our brain size of 
never doubled over a period of 2 million

2853
02:06:30,711 --> 02:06:33,350
years.
We've never figured out agriculture,

2854
02:06:33,351 --> 02:06:38,351
we would never figured it out 
civilizations and we wouldn't just 

2855
02:06:38,351 --> 02:06:40,250
wouldn't be in this position to debate 
veganism if it wasn't for hunting in the

2856
02:06:40,251 --> 02:06:42,420
first place.
So one of the more ironic things,

2857
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:47,690
I mean we are omnivores,
we do eat meat and we always have a 

2858
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:50,951
meeting.
They did say it's a beautiful moral 

2859
02:06:50,951 --> 02:06:53,231
choice to try to leave the smallest 
carbon footprint to try to leave the 

2860
02:06:53,231 --> 02:06:54,900
smallest footprint as far as animal 
suffering and.

2861
02:06:55,510 --> 02:07:00,510
But the reality is the wild itself is 
just fucking vicious and mean.

2862
02:07:01,251 --> 02:07:03,770
And they,
they don't give a fuck about each other.

2863
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:08,830
No.
It is fascinating that we are so hell 

2864
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:10,730
bent on saving animals that don't save 
each other.

2865
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:11,640
Sure.
I mean,

2866
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:12,110
I,
you know,

2867
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:17,150
I'm lucky enough to go into the jungle a
lot and a lot of people that I tell it 

2868
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:17,150
to is like,
Oh man,

2869
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:18,220
you go into the jungle.
That must be incredible.

2870
02:07:18,221 --> 02:07:21,330
It's so blossoming with,
with life and all these,

2871
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:23,690
all these new things in eggs and you 
know,

2872
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:24,960
creatures everywhere.
And I'm like,

2873
02:07:24,961 --> 02:07:27,000
well there is an element of that to the 
jungle.

2874
02:07:27,001 --> 02:07:28,950
But ultimately the jungle is a place of 
death,

2875
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:33,060
so it was a place of dark s,
a swollen water,

2876
02:07:33,061 --> 02:07:34,560
sudden death.
Well,

2877
02:07:34,561 --> 02:07:35,740
it's a cycle,
right?

2878
02:07:35,741 --> 02:07:36,010
It's a,

2879
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,100
it's a.
it's a constant continuing.

2880
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:44,610
Continuing reviving cycle is like things
or reading things which are eating 

2881
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:48,550
things which are getting eaten by things
and it's just constant swirling.

2882
02:07:48,551 --> 02:07:53,551
And one of my favorite documentaries is 
documentary on the Harpy Eagle and it's 

2883
02:07:53,551 --> 02:07:54,370
sees heartbeat eagles.
Oh,

2884
02:07:54,371 --> 02:07:59,371
they're fantastic.
These fucking flying dinosaurs that are 

2885
02:07:59,371 --> 02:08:01,180
swooping sloss and monkeys off of these 
trees.

2886
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:06,220
It's just an amazing,
amazing documentary and I'm just the 

2887
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:11,011
idea that different things in different 
parts of the world have evolved to find 

2888
02:08:11,201 --> 02:08:16,201
their niche.
They have evolved to find the way that 

2889
02:08:16,201 --> 02:08:18,991
they survive the best.
And this giant crazy flying raptor that 

2890
02:08:19,141 --> 02:08:24,141
just swoops in.
I believe it's the biggest ego in the 

2891
02:08:24,141 --> 02:08:26,671
world is yeah,
they swooped down and just snatch 

2892
02:08:26,671 --> 02:08:28,030
monkeys at a trees and kill them and eat
them.

2893
02:08:28,031 --> 02:08:33,031
And just what a bizarre niche.
Like what a bizarre specialty those 

2894
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:36,700
monkey communities think about ego and 
getting the kids to get in that light.

2895
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:41,700
Right.
There is a monster that lives in this 

2896
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:43,981
guy and this thing will end use if you 
see something like a big shadow that 

2897
02:08:43,981 --> 02:08:44,890
comes to log,
that is the dragon,

2898
02:08:44,891 --> 02:08:47,860
that is the gateway to don't have that 
as much in our world.

2899
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:51,850
I mean we watch game of thrones so we 
think that dragons exist and stuff.

2900
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:54,550
But in a,
in the other animal communities,

2901
02:08:54,551 --> 02:08:59,551
like the insect world,
insects and my favorite animal that is 

2902
02:08:59,551 --> 02:09:02,101
fucking brutal.
Gladiatorial daily life with these 

2903
02:09:02,101 --> 02:09:04,570
creatures really fucking heavy.
Um,

2904
02:09:04,810 --> 02:09:07,870
yeah.
The life of the wild is very heavy.

2905
02:09:08,170 --> 02:09:13,170
It's very strange.
I was a moose hunting in British 

2906
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:17,131
Columbia this last fall and when we're 
up there we came across a calf that had 

2907
02:09:17,131 --> 02:09:21,631
been recently killed by wolves,
took some pictures of it and put it on 

2908
02:09:21,631 --> 02:09:25,411
my instagram feed.
And it was a because it was just 

2909
02:09:25,411 --> 02:09:25,411
stripped down to the bump,
but it was,

2910
02:09:25,411 --> 02:09:25,940
was bizarre.

2911
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:29,530
Was like if you have never seen 
something like that before,

2912
02:09:29,830 --> 02:09:33,400
it's like being there like,
well what this just happened.

2913
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:38,430
Like this happened two hours ago.
Like there was blood and there was hair 

2914
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:42,451
everywhere.
And most of the main had been eaten and 

2915
02:09:42,451 --> 02:09:44,080
were like this,
this is the real world that these things

2916
02:09:44,081 --> 02:09:45,730
live in.
This is it's baby.

2917
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:51,000
The Moose that were out there hunting,
some of it's babies got captured by a 

2918
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,540
pack of wolves and they tore it apart 
and we're,

2919
02:09:53,610 --> 02:09:54,930
we're,
it's,

2920
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:00,160
it's contradictory that you would find 
something appalling and beautiful at the

2921
02:10:00,161 --> 02:10:01,390
same time.
But it is both.

2922
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:02,800
It's both of those things.
Sure.

2923
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:07,960
Because we're so conditioned by streets 
and phones and electricity and houses 

2924
02:10:10,361 --> 02:10:15,361
and buildings that when you were exposed
to this totally different lifestyle,

2925
02:10:15,550 --> 02:10:18,100
this totally different environment,
like the wild,

2926
02:10:18,101 --> 02:10:21,640
the actual real wild.
It's this jolt of,

2927
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:24,550
Oh yeah,
this jolt of wow.

2928
02:10:24,551 --> 02:10:26,370
There's like,
there's just a toe.

2929
02:10:26,410 --> 02:10:31,410
This is a completely different variable 
series of variables that you're dealing 

2930
02:10:31,871 --> 02:10:33,350
with.
So simplistically,

2931
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:34,080
beautiful night.

2932
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:39,280
I was in Kenya probably eight or nine 
years ago and I saw as Zebra Fall Cbre 

2933
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,810
Fall,
uh,

2934
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:46,940
that was being hounded by two 
hygienists.

2935
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,870
The mum had gone and they saw it like it
was,

2936
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:53,030
it was,
it was trying to navigate his way around

2937
02:10:53,031 --> 02:10:58,031
a big tree.
While these hyenas would just fucking 

2938
02:10:58,031 --> 02:11:00,761
minute and they had broken or it had 
broken one of his back legs compound 

2939
02:11:00,761 --> 02:11:05,351
fracture like this,
so it was hopping around on three legs 

2940
02:11:05,351 --> 02:11:08,590
and there was two heinous,
so it would go to the left Hyena,

2941
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:09,890
Hyena,
and the hyenas,

2942
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,680
which knew at some point that we're 
going to chow down on this thing.

2943
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:17,920
We're really just fucking me.
That it would come over and they would 

2944
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:17,920
buy it.
It would fall over,

2945
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:18,350
it would get up again.
That chase it.

2946
02:11:18,351 --> 02:11:20,900
They'd hit it so the leg,
they try and bite the broken leg off.

2947
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:24,230
They will like fucking with it.
They weren't trying to eat it for a good

2948
02:11:24,231 --> 02:11:26,080
half an hour or so,
and I was really.

2949
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:31,220
I was in mixed company and I was taking 
a lot of pitches to this thing thinking 

2950
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:31,220
this is fucked up.
This is how,

2951
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:36,161
in fact,
the last few moments of this creature's 

2952
02:11:36,161 --> 02:11:36,161
life is going to be the car that I was 
in.

2953
02:11:36,161 --> 02:11:36,320
The people were like,
okay,

2954
02:11:36,321 --> 02:11:38,630
can we go now?
Like we don't want to see that.

2955
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:41,960
And we left and I was talking that night
with the people that,

2956
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:44,270
that I was with and they were like,
oh,

2957
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:46,400
that's disgusting that we,
that we see this.

2958
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:48,410
And I was like,
this is what's real.

2959
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:51,410
This is nature.
This is life.

2960
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,220
You know,
I,

2961
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:57,360
a few weeks ago,
me and my friends in the middle of the 

2962
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:00,430
night when we're walking around Griffith
Park and we've seen fucking owl.

2963
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:02,600
And we saw some coyotes run along the 
track and stuff.

2964
02:12:02,601 --> 02:12:07,601
And then I went home and I have a few 
snakes at home and I started passing 

2965
02:12:07,601 --> 02:12:07,601
around snakes.
When people check this,

2966
02:12:07,890 --> 02:12:09,960
check this one out,
I've got my scoping out and torrential,

2967
02:12:09,961 --> 02:12:11,300
uh,
one of my friends was like,

2968
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:13,730
oh,
this is a normal Saturday night with say

2969
02:12:13,731 --> 02:12:16,880
with old dms creatures and stuff.
And I stopped her and I was like,

2970
02:12:16,881 --> 02:12:19,310
fleur,
this is actually normal.

2971
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:24,370
This shit that we were doing earlier on 
where we're all showing each other 

2972
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:27,200
photos on our iphone and watching TV and
put in a DVD on and playing fee for an a

2973
02:12:27,220 --> 02:12:30,080
playstation.
That's a construct that has been created

2974
02:12:30,081 --> 02:12:35,081
to make us feel okay about life and keep
a stupid so that the bosses can do what 

2975
02:12:35,081 --> 02:12:35,540
they want.
This is real.

2976
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:40,600
We're supposed to know the name of every
snake was supposedly in the name of 

2977
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:40,600
every tree in the forest.

2978
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:43,040
We've lost that ability and that's what 
I'm trying to get back to.

2979
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:44,540
Is it normal?
I mean,

2980
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:48,230
I think that playstations or about as 
normal as beehives.

2981
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:53,650
It's something really procreate.
People create things and they create 

2982
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:54,440
things.
Construction,

2983
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:55,550
buildings,
cars.

2984
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:59,300
They create things all over the world.
I think all behaviors natural.

2985
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:01,580
I really do.
And I think even the most bizarre fucked

2986
02:13:01,581 --> 02:13:04,670
up human behavior is natural.
We are as we're natural.

2987
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:05,090
Well,
yeah,

2988
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:07,610
we of course were natural.
We're part of the animal kingdom.

2989
02:13:07,611 --> 02:13:10,210
We are as a,
as a creature and natural create,

2990
02:13:10,211 --> 02:13:15,211
uh,
the natural thing created by bees would 

2991
02:13:15,211 --> 02:13:15,950
be a wild hive.
And honey,

2992
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:19,280
the natural thing created by humans 
would be a child.

2993
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:23,240
A painting is a slightly abstract 
version of creation style creation,

2994
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:27,110
but it's much more abstract than awhile.
Beehive and a baby.

2995
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:29,360
So there's nothing natural about 
buildings,

2996
02:13:29,361 --> 02:13:32,010
but yet human beings construct

2997
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:37,010
them without any interaction with each 
other all over the world and they'd be 

2998
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:38,640
like a,
a shelter to keep the rain off,

2999
02:13:38,650 --> 02:13:41,250
use natural,
but like that's where it starts to trade

3000
02:13:41,251 --> 02:13:46,251
center and then they figured out solar 
power and then they figured out 

3001
02:13:46,251 --> 02:13:46,251
electricity and then they figured out 
Wifi.

3002
02:13:46,251 --> 02:13:48,240
Then they figured out that it seems 
natural to me.

3003
02:13:48,590 --> 02:13:53,590
It doesn't seem like it should be 
because it's not wild because 

3004
02:13:53,590 --> 02:13:54,360
independent of human beings,
it doesn't exist,

3005
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:57,300
but independent of bees.
Bee Hives don't exist.

3006
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:02,100
I think he is as bizarre as our antics 
and our creations are.

3007
02:14:02,101 --> 02:14:04,110
I think ultimately everything that 
happens is,

3008
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:06,060
is natural.
Yes.

3009
02:14:06,150 --> 02:14:11,150
I would agree with differences in being 
that we can debate whether or not we 

3010
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:14,091
should be doing it or whether in the 
consequences are worth the effort that 

3011
02:14:14,091 --> 02:14:14,340
the toxifying,
the oceans,

3012
02:14:14,341 --> 02:14:18,090
the sky's the pollution.
That picture that I showed you of Mexico

3013
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:18,900
City have fucked up.

3014
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:23,900
The pollution is in Mexico.
There are creatures out there that 

3015
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:23,900
debate.
Yeah,

3016
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:24,660
there are.
We just.

3017
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:29,550
We're not tuned into that vibration.
There are creatures that as far as we're

3018
02:14:29,551 --> 02:14:34,551
concerned,
when we watch them silently communicate 

3019
02:14:34,551 --> 02:14:34,551
with each other,
it's not silent for them.

3020
02:14:34,551 --> 02:14:39,200
There is something,
whether it's old double or something 

3021
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:41,871
that they sent,
so something that they understand that 

3022
02:14:41,871 --> 02:14:41,970
they do,
we're just not in tune with the idea,

3023
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:47,060
you know,
and and these things that we create 

3024
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:47,060
naturally,
let's say for the sake of argument,

3025
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:50,130
a skyscraper or a jumbo jet.
Yes,

3026
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:55,250
I agree.
That is natural because we exist and we 

3027
02:14:55,250 --> 02:14:55,250
create it.
That's a.

3028
02:14:55,250 --> 02:14:57,750
that's a natural process,
but those things that we're now creating

3029
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:02,610
a large,
expanded huge versions of boys natural.

3030
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:07,640
The trade senate isn't a natural 
building and natural building might 

3031
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:08,150
house 10 people.
I don't know how many people housed,

3032
02:15:08,490 --> 02:15:10,350
lived in,
worked in the trade center.

3033
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:12,210
Thousands,
right to enough thousand.

3034
02:15:12,211 --> 02:15:13,150
3,000
people were.

3035
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:15,600
Yeah.
That to me feels slightly unnatural.

3036
02:15:15,601 --> 02:15:20,601
A jumbo jet that can take 500 people 
from one place to the other feels a 

3037
02:15:20,601 --> 02:15:23,250
little unnatural.
Maybe a plane that can take eight people

3038
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:26,270
feels a little bit more natural agent.
I mean,

3039
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:27,780
I don't know,
swollen.

3040
02:15:27,781 --> 02:15:29,820
We've everything,
but that's natural.

3041
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,020
That's what people do.
I mean,

3042
02:15:31,021 --> 02:15:34,860
there's a reason why Mexico City exists 
is the same time that Los Angeles exists

3043
02:15:34,861 --> 02:15:39,861
at the same time that New York City 
exists is because if you leave people 

3044
02:15:39,861 --> 02:15:39,861
alone,
you don't kill them off.

3045
02:15:39,861 --> 02:15:40,320
You don't kill them off with disease or 
war.

3046
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:44,790
They overpopulate and they develop these
nationally intrusive cities.

3047
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:46,320
Yes,
it's natural for us.

3048
02:15:46,321 --> 02:15:48,600
It's natural for us as a species to look
around and go,

3049
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:51,960
yes,
deli is completely swollen with people,

3050
02:15:51,961 --> 02:15:53,820
but that's the natural,
uh,

3051
02:15:53,821 --> 02:15:55,460
you know,
journey that the,

3052
02:15:55,710 --> 02:15:57,930
that the country of India is going to go
on and create this.

3053
02:15:57,930 --> 02:16:02,930
See,
I don't necessarily think if you take 

3054
02:16:02,930 --> 02:16:04,200
out this human bias that,
that is natural for a species to,

3055
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:07,290
that we're not supposed to read 
rampantly out of control.

3056
02:16:07,291 --> 02:16:12,291
We're supposed to take care of the air 
and the planet and the food and do that 

3057
02:16:12,301 --> 02:16:14,760
in balance and naturally with a species.
Well,

3058
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:18,420
the reason why human beings are 
overpopulating is because we figured out

3059
02:16:18,421 --> 02:16:21,510
how to get the fuck away from predators.
No reason why we wanted to fuck and make

3060
02:16:21,511 --> 02:16:26,511
as many people as possible as.
Because naturally we got eaten mean the 

3061
02:16:26,511 --> 02:16:30,861
Jaguar.
The key kills the antelope also kills 

3062
02:16:30,861 --> 02:16:30,861
people.
True

3063
02:16:30,861 --> 02:16:33,790
that that was a big part of the problem 
in a grass hut.

3064
02:16:33,791 --> 02:16:35,380
It's really hard to fight those fuckers 
off.

3065
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,450
Absolutely it was.
It's the reason why we left the forest.

3066
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:39,660
We're not in that window in that 
scenario anymore,

3067
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:44,840
so we're developing this new style of 
living and we have to figure out a way 

3068
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:49,351
to deal with the consequences of all 
this waste that we produce and also deal

3069
02:16:49,541 --> 02:16:54,541
with the fact that people have this very
bizarre diffusion of responsibility 

3070
02:16:54,541 --> 02:16:56,650
thing going on when there's a thousand 
people that are doing something and that

3071
02:16:56,651 --> 02:16:59,710
something is fucking everything up.
It feels different than if one person is

3072
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:01,750
doing something and something is fucking
things up,

3073
02:17:01,930 --> 02:17:06,930
then you feel responsible.
But if you're a part of a city that's 

3074
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:07,840
polluting the world,
it doesn't seem like it's your fault.

3075
02:17:07,841 --> 02:17:09,300
It seems like somebody else out there

3076
02:17:09,570 --> 02:17:10,660
be fixing it.
Yeah,

3077
02:17:10,670 --> 02:17:11,600
I know.
So the very.

3078
02:17:11,870 --> 02:17:16,870
I mean,
I think empathy's one of the most 

3079
02:17:16,870 --> 02:17:17,430
dangerous words on the planet,
they very apathetic idea of,

3080
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:22,780
well,
what difference can I make a plastic 

3081
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:22,780
bowl and just forget about it.
You're like,

3082
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:27,141
well,
obviously if everyone flood that way it 

3083
02:17:27,141 --> 02:17:27,141
would be a major issue.

3084
02:17:27,141 --> 02:17:29,430
Well,
I have a lot of friends who smoke 

3085
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:29,430
unfortunately because I know a lot of 
comedians and I cigarettes.

3086
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:34,050
Yeah.
And I see them throw them on the ground 

3087
02:17:34,050 --> 02:17:34,050
all the time.
They throw them in the ground,

3088
02:17:34,050 --> 02:17:34,210
step on him.
My two,

3089
02:17:34,270 --> 02:17:35,670
two of my friends the other day did it 
and I,

3090
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,630
you know,
I don't want to just be that guy,

3091
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:40,750
correct people every time that happened.
So I just avoid it.

3092
02:17:40,810 --> 02:17:45,810
But fuck,
it's so depressing the fact that people 

3093
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:46,120
are just so comfortable with throwing a 
cigarette on the ground,

3094
02:17:46,121 --> 02:17:48,070
stepping on it,
and then it's out of their mind.

3095
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:53,100
Yeah.
I'm going to step away from the mic for 

3096
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:53,100
a second.
That's trash.

3097
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:53,100
It's trash.

3098
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:53,960
Like that's what I want to say when that
happens,

3099
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:57,290
there's a complete disconnect and I 
think it comes.

3100
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:59,210
And this is another,
you know,

3101
02:17:59,270 --> 02:18:00,720
pull,
um,

3102
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:05,950
comment on cigarette smokers.
I think it comes from the fat that they 

3103
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:05,950
smoke,
they smoke,

3104
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:10,260
smell,
they get to the end of it and they're 

3105
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:10,260
like,
fuck,

3106
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:10,260
that's a day habits.
It's fucking disgusting.

3107
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:11,960
They throw it down.
They had done with it.

3108
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:13,090
So it's not that problem.

3109
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:15,180
ISO,
they're abusing their own bodies so they

3110
02:18:15,181 --> 02:18:17,550
don't mind abusing the environment.

3111
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:18,250
Right.
I know.

3112
02:18:18,251 --> 02:18:22,180
So you say a lot of times people driving
on roads or freeways and the idea behind

3113
02:18:22,181 --> 02:18:24,160
that is,
I know this is bad for me.

3114
02:18:24,161 --> 02:18:26,530
I know it's dirty.
I don't want to step it out and leave it

3115
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:31,531
in my car.
I'm just going to throw it into the 

3116
02:18:31,531 --> 02:18:31,531
planet.
Dude,

3117
02:18:31,531 --> 02:18:31,531
I've seen

3118
02:18:31,531 --> 02:18:34,910
different Prius's throw cigarettes out 
the window of my favorite things.

3119
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:37,910
Trying to keep up,
keep a running tab of Prius's,

3120
02:18:37,911 --> 02:18:39,100
throwing cigarettes out the window.

3121
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:40,790
Anything it feels,
do anything.

3122
02:18:40,830 --> 02:18:43,240
It looks bizarre now when people smoked 
cigarettes,

3123
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:48,270
like I was born in [inaudible] 76 until 
the probably early two thousands.

3124
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:52,510
Seeing people smoking cigarettes didn't 
really matter to me.

3125
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:54,700
I'd been so exposed to it that I was 
just.

3126
02:18:54,730 --> 02:18:56,140
I didn't even have a comment about.
I was just like,

3127
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:57,240
oh,
there it is now,

3128
02:18:57,241 --> 02:18:59,510
and I see someone pull out a box,
pull out a cigarette,

3129
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:01,380
put it in the mouth in light.
I like watching like,

3130
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:03,430
what are you doing?
What's going on?

3131
02:19:03,431 --> 02:19:08,431
Do you not know what's happening with 
this thing that you're just about to 

3132
02:19:08,431 --> 02:19:08,431
inhale it?

3133
02:19:08,431 --> 02:19:11,510
This is going to slowly poison you,
but the thrill of it or the fun of it or

3134
02:19:11,511 --> 02:19:14,070
the James Dean thing where they just 
want to be cool.

3135
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,430
Yeah.
The danger of.

3136
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:17,890
I mean I,
I grew up thinking about all that stuff.

3137
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:22,891
It looks cool for James Deane to smoke 
it and the Beatles grew up smoking and 

3138
02:19:22,891 --> 02:19:27,211
then in the Second World War they gave 
them out as part of your rations so you 

3139
02:19:27,211 --> 02:19:30,211
can understand how soldiers came back 
being addicted to cigarettes because 

3140
02:19:30,211 --> 02:19:31,550
they're scared of death that are around 
death that bought out their mind.

3141
02:19:31,970 --> 02:19:34,400
They get 10 cigarettes a week.
They're all gonna smoke cigarettes,

3142
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:36,170
but I mean,
you know,

3143
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:40,970
the level of education certainly in most
of western Europe and in this country is

3144
02:19:40,971 --> 02:19:43,250
to such an extent that when I see a 
smoke I'm just like,

3145
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:44,470
what are you doing?
Well,

3146
02:19:44,710 --> 02:19:47,840
it's one of those weird contradictions.
So I know,

3147
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:49,820
I know very intelligent people smoke 
too,

3148
02:19:49,821 --> 02:19:54,821
which is very shocking.
Like when you know someone and they're 

3149
02:19:54,821 --> 02:19:55,220
brilliant and then they,
they can't stop smoking cigarettes.

3150
02:19:55,220 --> 02:20:00,220
So like wow,
have you could figure out a way to 

3151
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:02,831
balance this whole thing out better.
You'd be so much healthier but they 

3152
02:20:02,831 --> 02:20:06,170
don't self self abuse.
He knows the self abuse things.

3153
02:20:06,171 --> 02:20:11,171
An interesting thing,
but I mean everyone's on their own 

3154
02:20:11,171 --> 02:20:11,171
journey.
So you just kinda gotta let them.

3155
02:20:11,171 --> 02:20:12,320
Yes,
and I think everyone has advice,

3156
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,060
but sometimes you just say that to 
someone,

3157
02:20:14,061 --> 02:20:15,800
just let them know how you feel about 
it.

3158
02:20:15,801 --> 02:20:20,801
It'll maybe shift their perspective and 
they'll have this new found way of 

3159
02:20:20,801 --> 02:20:20,801
living whole.
Yeah,

3160
02:20:20,801 --> 02:20:21,790
Dom's right.
You know,

3161
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:24,230
I think it was fucking weird.
Like I just do it.

3162
02:20:24,231 --> 02:20:25,940
I don't think about doing it.
Yeah,

3163
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:28,460
I was,
I was a lot more fucking,

3164
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:31,000
you know,
opinion a,

3165
02:20:31,001 --> 02:20:32,780
it's not that I don't have strong 
opinions now,

3166
02:20:32,781 --> 02:20:34,430
but I,
I kind of keep them a little bit more to

3167
02:20:34,431 --> 02:20:39,431
myself in my twenties I thought that it 
was just a human thing to be able to 

3168
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:43,700
kind of spit venom at people when you 
felt like doing that.

3169
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:45,260
Now I kind of like grown up a little 
bit.

3170
02:20:45,261 --> 02:20:50,261
I don't do as much,
but unless I was dating someone who I 

3171
02:20:50,261 --> 02:20:50,750
was in love with and they were smoking,
which I would never do,

3172
02:20:50,751 --> 02:20:53,810
I found that really attractive.
Then I feel like I'm in a position or my

3173
02:20:53,811 --> 02:20:55,370
family,
but like a friend,

3174
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:57,290
I just feel like they'd be like,
well,

3175
02:20:57,291 --> 02:20:58,600
fuck you down.
Yeah,

3176
02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:01,550
well I don't have Akila go fuck 
yourself.

3177
02:21:01,551 --> 02:21:02,660
Who are you?
You know God.

3178
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:04,610
It's true,
but you don't.

3179
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:08,030
To kill all day every day and think 
about those cigarette smokers is man,

3180
02:21:08,031 --> 02:21:10,520
they wake up in the morning,
it's a cup of coffee and a cigarette.

3181
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:12,620
They liked that fucker and that's how 
everything gets started.

3182
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:16,700
That eight hours of downtime with no 
cigarette is fucking with them when they

3183
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:17,830
wake up in the morning.
Yeah.

3184
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:20,430
Which is a whole system throughout the 
night going,

3185
02:21:20,431 --> 02:21:22,090
okay,
let's get this toxin out.

3186
02:21:22,090 --> 02:21:27,090
Let's send all these messages to the 
brain that this is bad and we'll deal 

3187
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:27,090
with it,
and then they wake up in the morning.

3188
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:27,090
They're like,
oh,

3189
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:27,500
I feel so bad.
I need a cigarette.

3190
02:21:27,501 --> 02:21:29,160
To me.
I read this booklet,

3191
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:34,180
said the craving for a cigarette is not 
necessarily the craving for a cigarette.

3192
02:21:34,641 --> 02:21:39,641
It's the craving to stop the bad feeling
of the cigarette by replacing it with 

3193
02:21:41,151 --> 02:21:46,151
the adrenaline that your body creates by
putting the poison inside you again so 

3194
02:21:46,151 --> 02:21:48,950
you feel shitty because you smoked the 
cigarette and what you need to make that

3195
02:21:48,951 --> 02:21:52,790
shitty feeling go away is to expose 
yourself to another jolt of the poison.

3196
02:21:52,791 --> 02:21:53,930
So your system goes,
okay,

3197
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:57,290
let's deal with this adrenaline.
Throw all those painkillers in there and

3198
02:21:57,291 --> 02:22:02,291
then 20 minutes later you get it again 
and then 20 minutes later did you read 

3199
02:22:02,291 --> 02:22:05,600
that book called something like how to 
quit smoking or five steps to quit 

3200
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:05,600
smoking.

3201
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:09,320
My trainer played around with smoking 
cigarettes while and I was like,

3202
02:22:09,321 --> 02:22:10,890
dude,
you might train econ smoke,

3203
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:13,460
and he called him.
I had him.

3204
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:16,580
I didn't change his,
his language as to how we refer to them.

3205
02:22:16,581 --> 02:22:19,070
He called them smoky treats.
I was like,

3206
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:23,800
Yukon call cigarette smells.
Sounds like something you give a dog and

3207
02:22:23,810 --> 02:22:24,770
you know he's,
he's,

3208
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:27,500
he's little positive affirmation.
I'm just gonna.

3209
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:29,510
Have a little smoky treat and to give 
myself a smoker tree.

3210
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:30,000
I was like,
no,

3211
02:22:30,001 --> 02:22:35,001
you're killing yourself.
And then he read this book and it was 

3212
02:22:35,001 --> 02:22:35,001
the reason why he quit and I was like,
let me read it.

3213
02:22:35,001 --> 02:22:39,561
I don't smoke but I want to read it,
and that was the thing that I took home 

3214
02:22:39,561 --> 02:22:42,070
me.
It was this idea that it's not the fact 

3215
02:22:42,070 --> 02:22:44,691
that the cigarette makes you feel good 
or you love the feeling or it's five 

3216
02:22:44,691 --> 02:22:48,411
minutes of downtime.
It's the fact that that concentrated 

3217
02:22:48,411 --> 02:22:52,050
inhalation of poison is taking away from
the shit you feeling that you're getting

3218
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:53,960
from the longterm effects of that 
poison.

3219
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:59,040
I don't know about all that man.
I don't know exactly the way it's been 

3220
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:01,540
explained to me by addiction experts are
that when you have an addiction,

3221
02:23:01,970 --> 02:23:06,970
like everyone talks about the cigarettes
calmed them down and the way it was 

3222
02:23:06,970 --> 02:23:06,970
explained to me,
he was like,

3223
02:23:06,970 --> 02:23:09,880
cigarettes don't calm you down.
What they do is they feed your addiction

3224
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:13,000
so you have this addiction.
You're stressed out because your body is

3225
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:15,340
craving this thing that it's attached 
to.

3226
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:17,740
You have some sort of at a molecular 
level,

3227
02:23:17,741 --> 02:23:22,741
you have this bizarre attachment to this
substance that you've been pumping into 

3228
02:23:22,741 --> 02:23:24,490
your body so that your anxiety ramps up,
your body needs it,

3229
02:23:24,491 --> 02:23:26,800
and then when you get it,
oh see,

3230
02:23:26,830 --> 02:23:28,530
like cigarettes relaxed,
but no,

3231
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:28,810
no,
no,

3232
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:30,640
no.
You're addicted to cigarettes.

3233
02:23:30,641 --> 02:23:35,000
And that feeding,
that addiction calms the craving.

3234
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:38,710
Calms the screaming of the addiction for
a brief amount of time,

3235
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:42,400
and then it asks for it again.
So the idea that cigarettes calm,

3236
02:23:42,401 --> 02:23:43,840
you know,
they don't really,

3237
02:23:43,870 --> 02:23:48,870
you know,
you're your extra amped up because of 

3238
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:48,870
the fact that you're addicted to 
cigarettes.

3239
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:49,590
Yeah.
I was very lucky.

3240
02:23:49,591 --> 02:23:51,540
I grew up with a with a mom who's a 
nurse,

3241
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:55,110
so my mom,
my mom exposed me to two things which,

3242
02:23:55,170 --> 02:23:57,510
which stopped me from smoking 
cigarettes.

3243
02:23:57,511 --> 02:23:59,550
I mean,
that's not to say that when I was 17,

3244
02:23:59,551 --> 02:24:01,920
18 and one of my best friends walked 
outside to smoke a cigarette,

3245
02:24:01,921 --> 02:24:02,400
I didn't go,
oh,

3246
02:24:02,401 --> 02:24:05,010
let me try it and cut it up.
And was like,

3247
02:24:05,070 --> 02:24:05,550
Eh,
yeah,

3248
02:24:05,551 --> 02:24:06,540
that's okay.
You know,

3249
02:24:06,541 --> 02:24:09,690
I've danced with that devil,
but my mum did two things for me.

3250
02:24:09,691 --> 02:24:14,691
The first one was she told me about 
people in the hospitals that she was 

3251
02:24:14,691 --> 02:24:16,560
working out there had to have legs 
amputated,

3252
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:19,470
hands amputated,
arms amputated due to complications with

3253
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:20,700
smoking cigarettes.
So I was like,

3254
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,260
okay,
that's fucking heavy.

3255
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:27,680
And then the other one was,
she printed out a list of which we've 

3256
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:31,170
all seen by now the ingredients of a 
process of cigarette,

3257
02:24:31,171 --> 02:24:32,060
which is like,
you know,

3258
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:37,100
fucking cyanide and whole foods and 
like,

3259
02:24:37,950 --> 02:24:40,100
Holy Shit,
you know?

3260
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:40,830
Yeah.
Like you said,

3261
02:24:40,831 --> 02:24:45,831
hundreds if not thousands of things that
are a direct fight against health and 

3262
02:24:45,961 --> 02:24:47,040
your system.
And I was like,

3263
02:24:47,070 --> 02:24:48,200
I don't,
I don't want to do this.

3264
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:48,500
Did you see

3265
02:24:48,610 --> 02:24:51,150
either Russell Crowe movie the insider?
Oh yeah.

3266
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:56,540
The one that was all about the 
scientists that worked with the tobacco 

3267
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:57,600
companies to make cigarettes more toxic 
or more addictive rather.

3268
02:24:57,630 --> 02:24:58,950
Fascinating.
Fascinating.

3269
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:00,870
Apparently based on reality too,
right?

3270
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:01,670
Yeah.

3271
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,230
I watched a inside out over the weekend,
you know,

3272
02:25:04,231 --> 02:25:06,840
this new great watch it with my kids.
Watch it yesterday.

3273
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:10,560
So I did a review.
I do this thing on twitter called at the

3274
02:25:10,561 --> 02:25:11,760
flicks,
which is like if I,

3275
02:25:11,761 --> 02:25:14,730
if I watch a film that has had an effect
on me,

3276
02:25:14,731 --> 02:25:17,390
I do a little blurb about,
about what I like about it on a,

3277
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:22,430
on a word press word press account.
And I thought it was a really interested

3278
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:28,670
in movie for a lot of different reasons.
One of the major ones is that the way 

3279
02:25:28,670 --> 02:25:33,181
that it's being touted and sold in La is
to deal with these very cartoony light 

3280
02:25:35,171 --> 02:25:36,970
characters that live in this girl's 
brain.

3281
02:25:36,971 --> 02:25:37,840
You know,
Lewis Black,

3282
02:25:37,841 --> 02:25:39,270
his anger,
and he's all red.

3283
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:42,970
And then amy poehler is joy and she's 
sweet.

3284
02:25:42,971 --> 02:25:46,000
And then sadness.
Who's like overweight and has,

3285
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:48,550
you know,
blue heron needs her adenoids taken out,

3286
02:25:49,270 --> 02:25:54,270
but it's from,
from where I was saying it is a common 

3287
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:59,040
on the first time a human being has 
exposed themselves to depression and 

3288
02:25:59,471 --> 02:26:04,471
what it can do at a molecular level to 
that person and the journey you have to 

3289
02:26:04,471 --> 02:26:04,471
go on.

3290
02:26:04,471 --> 02:26:09,450
So like the beast or all their little 
relationships with these emotions and 

3291
02:26:09,450 --> 02:26:14,011
stuff.
But the a story was this really dark 

3292
02:26:14,011 --> 02:26:15,940
story of a girl moving from where she 
moved from Minnesota,

3293
02:26:15,941 --> 02:26:18,910
Minnesota to San Francisco.
She lost a friend.

3294
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:23,920
She wasn't in the hockey team anymore.
She had a slightly different 

3295
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:27,031
relationship with their parents.
School wasn't going where she ended up 

3296
02:26:27,031 --> 02:26:29,941
trying to be a runaway and I thought,
I thought it was brilliant at first and 

3297
02:26:29,941 --> 02:26:31,990
foremost,
but if it did not feel like a kids movie

3298
02:26:31,991 --> 02:26:36,991
to me and if it was,
it was a bitter pill to swallow because 

3299
02:26:36,991 --> 02:26:39,310
when I was a kid up until the age of.
I went to the edge of 15.

3300
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:43,390
I really had no concept of depression.
I didn't know I existed.

3301
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:47,800
I was just a happy go lucky kid.
That was sad when I got less sweets than

3302
02:26:47,801 --> 02:26:52,801
my brother,
but happier when I did and for the most 

3303
02:26:52,801 --> 02:26:52,801
part I was just coasting on the second

3304
02:26:52,801 --> 02:26:56,490
till you started dating church.
Someone just slamming a lot of what 

3305
02:26:56,490 --> 02:26:57,760
happened?
What do you mean you want a kiss?

3306
02:26:57,761 --> 02:26:59,770
My best mate.
Fuck.

3307
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:02,710
I was like,
Holy Shit.

3308
02:27:02,711 --> 02:27:07,150
I didn't realize it could wear it like a
cloak,

3309
02:27:07,270 --> 02:27:09,340
you know?
My whole thing was sadness was just like

3310
02:27:09,341 --> 02:27:10,240
that.
I felt the stairs.

3311
02:27:10,241 --> 02:27:11,350
I scraped my knee.
I'm sad.

3312
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:12,160
Oh,
I feel bad.

3313
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:13,960
I'm going to bed,
wake up in the morning.

3314
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:16,990
My default setting was happiness and 
then girls and stuff.

3315
02:27:16,991 --> 02:27:18,130
It became like,
oh man.

3316
02:27:18,131 --> 02:27:23,131
I'm like,
I've been sad for a week and it was 

3317
02:27:23,131 --> 02:27:23,620
depression and that thing in that inside
out movie.

3318
02:27:24,230 --> 02:27:29,230
I mean I cried like a fucking baby.
Do you remember the short film before 

3319
02:27:29,230 --> 02:27:33,961
it?
Lava with the two volcanoes was in bits 

3320
02:27:33,961 --> 02:27:33,961
where you really.
I was crying.

3321
02:27:33,961 --> 02:27:34,660
I went on a date.
I was on a day.

3322
02:27:34,661 --> 02:27:35,950
Oh,
so embarrassed.

3323
02:27:36,130 --> 02:27:38,710
You're crying on Jesus Christ and she 
didn't.

3324
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:40,040
She didn't really know.
I mean she's.

3325
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:40,780
Yeah,
she didn't know.

3326
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:42,790
She knew your crying.
I wasn't weeping.

3327
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:46,060
How long had you been dating her living?
Dating for a few weeks.

3328
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:51,300
So it's pretty recent.
Like she's facing probably ready to 

3329
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:51,300
bail.

3330
02:27:51,610 --> 02:27:53,260
She was crying and she's a girl.
That's fine.

3331
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:56,050
She was crying at the lava thing too.
You're both broken,

3332
02:27:57,430 --> 02:28:01,420
broken and fucked up and like.
What did you think?

3333
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:06,780
Did you see was great.
Did your kids respond to the stuff in 

3334
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:07,840
her head and did they respond to the 
other stuff?

3335
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:09,580
Oh yeah.
They respond to the whole thing.

3336
02:28:10,330 --> 02:28:11,280
They loved it.
We are.

3337
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:16,300
We even went to the bookstore afterwards
and we bought some books on it because 

3338
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:20,581
there was a,
they have books inside out books or 

3339
02:28:20,581 --> 02:28:22,580
they're kind of like into depth about 
all the different things and the impacts

3340
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:27,580
of emotions,
how you need the sadness and how the 

3341
02:28:27,580 --> 02:28:28,340
sadness can help you change your mind 
and make decisions.

3342
02:28:28,380 --> 02:28:29,420
Yes,
there was.

3343
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:34,980
There was one thing which they changed 
the very less that they put into the 

3344
02:28:34,980 --> 02:28:35,370
script.
Not put into the Strip that last minute,

3345
02:28:35,371 --> 02:28:37,590
but but involved in the story.
The last minute that I was,

3346
02:28:37,710 --> 02:28:42,710
I was gonna write a scathing review 
about that particular thing because you 

3347
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:43,230
know the whole thing about coal 
memories.

3348
02:28:43,710 --> 02:28:48,710
All the core memories were happy.
My thing was going to be not all your 

3349
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:49,430
coal memories happy some of your 
memories,

3350
02:28:49,550 --> 02:28:53,820
a dark and heavy and they define who you
are as a person to the positive,

3351
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:59,120
but they did that at the end cause 
sadness Takota those coal Mary's and 

3352
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,270
they kind of found the balance of like,
some are good,

3353
02:29:00,330 --> 02:29:05,330
some are bad.
One of the only things that I wasn't 

3354
02:29:05,330 --> 02:29:05,330
crazy about and I thought it was 
potentially a little darkness,

3355
02:29:05,370 --> 02:29:10,370
a little dark,
was that when the emotions were 

3356
02:29:10,370 --> 02:29:11,130
navigating their way back to the kind of
brain area,

3357
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:16,460
they walked through the subconscious and
the subconscious was scary and dark and 

3358
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:19,410
mysterious and black and potentially 
things would jump out at you.

3359
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:24,920
And my subconscious isn't all like that.
Some of my subconscious is a tiger's 

3360
02:29:24,991 --> 02:29:29,991
drinking cups of tea with sources and 
asking me how I am and I'm in different 

3361
02:29:29,991 --> 02:29:31,320
galaxies.
Spinning around having fun,

3362
02:29:31,321 --> 02:29:33,780
so I do have doc elements to my 
subconscious,

3363
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:39,080
but I thought it was a little dangerous 
to tell little kids anything that lives 

3364
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:42,660
in the catechumens of your mind is 
potentially dangerous.

3365
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:43,290
It was like,
well,

3366
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:45,360
some of that could be a poem that's 
amazing.

3367
02:29:45,361 --> 02:29:48,060
Or a song that you wrote or painting,
which is beautiful.

3368
02:29:48,061 --> 02:29:49,620
Like that was my only issue.

3369
02:29:49,890 --> 02:29:52,890
Right?
I thought the three d abstract thing was

3370
02:29:52,891 --> 02:29:54,360
fantastic.
Fuck.

3371
02:29:54,361 --> 02:29:56,860
When they there,
they sort of lost their shape.

3372
02:29:57,610 --> 02:30:00,590
That was really bizarre.
They just ended up becoming shapes.

3373
02:30:00,591 --> 02:30:02,420
One was like a big star rolling around

3374
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:07,860
so well done.
Such a well done movie and really like 

3375
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:10,591
you said,
a movie that even though it was a 

3376
02:30:10,591 --> 02:30:10,780
child's movie,
it really adults could appreciate it.

3377
02:30:10,870 --> 02:30:15,870
I felt like it was more.
I felt like it will work on a love adult

3378
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:21,380
levels that I wrote in this review.
I was like say thank you for the fact 

3379
02:30:22,231 --> 02:30:27,231
that your kids under the age of 10 might
not necessarily pick up on some of the 

3380
02:30:27,231 --> 02:30:30,951
heavier themes of this movie.
You will at some point reach a point in 

3381
02:30:30,951 --> 02:30:34,221
your life,
wet sadness will smack you in the mouth 

3382
02:30:34,221 --> 02:30:34,500
and you have to deal with it like maybe 
a 10 year old isn't ready for that yet,

3383
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:39,680
but your 12 year old might be okay with 
it because they're going through some 

3384
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:39,680
changes too.
I thought it was brilliant.

3385
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:44,420
I've spent a lot of time wondering what 
those things are there for like is there

3386
02:30:44,761 --> 02:30:49,761
a reason why depression exists?
Is there a reason why sadness or joy 

3387
02:30:49,761 --> 02:30:54,471
euphoria,
do they serve some sort of evolutionary 

3388
02:30:55,340 --> 02:30:56,430
re?
There's.

3389
02:30:56,440 --> 02:31:00,570
Is there some.
Is there a reason why they exist that we

3390
02:31:00,571 --> 02:31:05,571
just have to sort of manage,
but I mean is it really the reason why 

3391
02:31:05,571 --> 02:31:07,860
people have gotten so far because we're 
not just totally content with everything

3392
02:31:07,861 --> 02:31:11,430
the way it is and there's always going 
to be jealousy.

3393
02:31:11,431 --> 02:31:16,431
There's always going to be like we were 
talking about the actors looking at 

3394
02:31:16,431 --> 02:31:16,431
other people going,
why is this?

3395
02:31:16,431 --> 02:31:20,300
Because they've reached some point of 
success and it's never enough and 

3396
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:23,390
there's some new thing that eludes them.
Some new thing that they wish they could

3397
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:28,400
have that then thing would be better and
by his thing fucked up and I don't do 

3398
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:28,400
them.

3399
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:33,080
What's wrong?
It's almost like these are motivating 

3400
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:33,360
energies.
These are motivating elements.

3401
02:31:33,630 --> 02:31:36,810
Motivated.
I mean and the depression thing when you

3402
02:31:36,811 --> 02:31:38,280
get.
When you first start dating,

3403
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:42,870
it's like it's almost like burning your 
hand on a hot stove,

3404
02:31:42,871 --> 02:31:47,871
like letting you know like you're 
dealing with something really fucking 

3405
02:31:47,871 --> 02:31:50,481
powerful here and this horrible feeling 
that you have right now when it's not 

3406
02:31:50,481 --> 02:31:54,381
working out.
Understand this and understand the 

3407
02:31:54,381 --> 02:31:56,871
consequences of getting involved in a 
relationship now because it's not so 

3408
02:31:56,871 --> 02:32:01,041
easy to just jumping in with someone.
It's not so easy and you learn so much 

3409
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:03,170
from those fucking early relationships 
because it was the pain.

3410
02:32:03,390 --> 02:32:05,190
Like I had a manipulative girlfriend in 
high school.

3411
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:07,200
Not Her fault.
She's a nice girl.

3412
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:08,100
Yeah,
she is lovely.

3413
02:32:08,101 --> 02:32:09,570
Actually.
She was very nice girl,

3414
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:14,600
but she had a single single parent or 
mom was quite large and didn't like men 

3415
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:19,790
and there was a lot of lot of education 
going on that was probably not so 

3416
02:32:19,790 --> 02:32:21,330
beneficial in trying to get into 
pennies.

3417
02:32:21,330 --> 02:32:22,320
So she didn't live there.
Yeah,

3418
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:26,020
I got in there,
but she got in mind to girls.

3419
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:31,500
She's dirty little girl.
But point being was that that 

3420
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,810
manipulation that I experienced from her
very on very early on,

3421
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:36,870
it made me realize like,
oh,

3422
02:32:36,871 --> 02:32:41,871
okay,
this can happen to like shit that 

3423
02:32:41,871 --> 02:32:44,211
doesn't happen with my friends can 
happen with a girl and then all of a 

3424
02:32:44,211 --> 02:32:48,381
sudden we'll take your.
So I had developed this intense zero 

3425
02:32:48,381 --> 02:32:50,850
bullshit policy.
So when I got older and I became a man,

3426
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:55,900
when,
when a woman would try to manipulate me 

3427
02:32:55,900 --> 02:32:55,900
in any way,
I would start laughing.

3428
02:32:55,900 --> 02:32:55,900
I'd go,
that's adorable.

3429
02:32:56,190 --> 02:32:59,760
But that's not going to have.
Fortunately I have other options and so,

3430
02:32:59,761 --> 02:33:01,080
uh,
this is not going to work out anymore.

3431
02:33:01,081 --> 02:33:03,720
So take care of.
But if I hadn't gone through that,

3432
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:08,721
I mean I have friends that are fucking 
perpetual victims and they get 

3433
02:33:08,721 --> 02:33:12,620
manipulated by women over and over and 
over again because they're weak and I 

3434
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:16,971
think there's a certain amount of women,
whether they appreciate it or whether 

3435
02:33:16,971 --> 02:33:20,361
they rather,
whether they honest about or not almost 

3436
02:33:20,361 --> 02:33:21,420
can't help manipulating men who are easy
to manipulate.

3437
02:33:21,730 --> 02:33:24,120
It's like you,
you can play them like,

3438
02:33:24,121 --> 02:33:25,320
fucking let me play up.
Ding,

3439
02:33:25,321 --> 02:33:25,950
Ding,
Ding.

3440
02:33:26,210 --> 02:33:27,650
You just want to hit the tunes.
It's,

3441
02:33:27,670 --> 02:33:29,460
it's.
And I think there's something,

3442
02:33:29,610 --> 02:33:31,920
there's something natural in that.
There's a,

3443
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:36,270
a natural predatory response to weakness
in certain ways.

3444
02:33:36,271 --> 02:33:39,690
And I kind of feel like that's all mine,
all that Shit's in place like that.

3445
02:33:39,691 --> 02:33:42,900
It's,
it's almost like to ensure momentum,

3446
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:47,130
to ensure entropy,
to ensure that energy keeps moving.

3447
02:33:47,131 --> 02:33:50,280
And there's no stagnant,
mean if you stay stagnant,

3448
02:33:50,281 --> 02:33:51,570
you will get depressed.
If you,

3449
02:33:51,810 --> 02:33:55,380
if you don't evolve and don't succeed,
you will feel like shit.

3450
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:57,330
If you know,
if you get dumped,

3451
02:33:57,570 --> 02:34:02,570
you know you're going to feel horrible,
you better figure out how to not get 

3452
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:02,570
dumped,
you know?

3453
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:03,240
Just just handle it.
I mean,

3454
02:34:03,241 --> 02:34:06,270
if it goes,
grown up with a mom who she admires,

3455
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:11,300
who is also manipulative to her dad,
she also then she may potentially fall 

3456
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:14,950
into that pit bull trap of doing that to
other guys.

3457
02:34:14,951 --> 02:34:15,670
I mean,
you know,

3458
02:34:15,810 --> 02:34:16,710
as,
as a creature,

3459
02:34:16,711 --> 02:34:18,250
as a by allegedly,

3460
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:23,670
like you said earlier on,
we have taken ourselves out of the 

3461
02:34:23,670 --> 02:34:24,850
equation of how do we solve the 
conundrum of staying warm at night,

3462
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:27,160
being protected from predators where we 
get our food from.

3463
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:32,190
We've sold all that as a creature.
So our brain is now giving yourself the 

3464
02:34:32,190 --> 02:34:32,740
opportunity to expand mold than the 
physical.

3465
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:37,920
You know,
most people don't necessarily go to the 

3466
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:37,920
gym and hit the ways.
A lot of people,

3467
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:38,680
you know,
read and get an education stuff.

3468
02:34:38,681 --> 02:34:43,681
So from an evolutionary point of view,
the thing that is expanding more than 

3469
02:34:43,681 --> 02:34:46,510
anything else is our brain.
Now that's positive and to a detriment I

3470
02:34:46,511 --> 02:34:50,380
feel because we do overthink things and 
we do guys have into a situation,

3471
02:34:50,381 --> 02:34:51,850
is this right?
Should this be happening?

3472
02:34:51,851 --> 02:34:54,820
To me?
I think that in this you have to look at

3473
02:34:54,821 --> 02:34:58,540
it as the same coin.
Just flipped over in a different way.

3474
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:03,600
If you have a great birthday and you get
all the gifts that you want and you got 

3475
02:35:03,831 --> 02:35:06,100
a great piece of birthday cake and all 
your friends showed up,

3476
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:11,670
that's beautiful and you experienced it 
and you loved it and you told her your 

3477
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:15,181
friends about it and you relive it with 
your friends and it was one of those 

3478
02:35:15,181 --> 02:35:15,181
days that you always think about when 
you go to sleep at night because it will

3479
02:35:15,181 --> 02:35:18,670
help you go to sleep.
You need to understand that the day when

3480
02:35:18,671 --> 02:35:23,671
none of your friends showed up for your 
birthday pie and you and your parents 

3481
02:35:23,671 --> 02:35:23,671
go,
your gift that you didn't really want.

3482
02:35:23,671 --> 02:35:28,350
It's the same thing.
You're just viewing it in a different 

3483
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:29,080
way.
You're viewing that thing is like,

3484
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:30,520
oh,
this thing is bad.

3485
02:35:30,550 --> 02:35:32,410
This thing is good.
It's just your life.

3486
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:33,940
There's those things just happen.
You know,

3487
02:35:34,090 --> 02:35:36,310
and you have to have the balance of 
those two things.

3488
02:35:36,310 --> 02:35:39,040
So what I tried to do when I was 
younger,

3489
02:35:39,041 --> 02:35:42,370
I would suffer from her lot and I,
I am prone to depression.

3490
02:35:42,371 --> 02:35:45,980
So I try and keep myself in a positive 
headspace,

3491
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:51,000
but a great way for me to attack 
depression when I see it comment is to 

3492
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:51,490
say,
this is natural,

3493
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:56,520
this is normal peaks and troughs are a 
way for you to understand the journey 

3494
02:35:56,520 --> 02:36:00,571
that you're in and you can't if you're.
If you're getting overly high about 

3495
02:36:00,761 --> 02:36:03,610
something that's as dangerous as getting
overly low about something,

3496
02:36:03,611 --> 02:36:06,130
it's the bit in the middle.
There is the balance.

3497
02:36:06,131 --> 02:36:07,240
That makes sense.

3498
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:12,380
So if you get overly high,
there's a price to pay at the end of 

3499
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:12,380
this ride.
That has to be.

3500
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:14,100
If you get too drunk,
you're gonna get hangover,

3501
02:36:14,150 --> 02:36:14,870
right?
Right.

3502
02:36:14,940 --> 02:36:19,940
That hung over.
It's almost worth it to experience the 

3503
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:20,280
great buzz.
Those great moments.

3504
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:23,190
It's like those great moments that you 
have when you're drunk.

3505
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:28,220
Boy,
you fucking pay for him for a couple of 

3506
02:36:28,220 --> 02:36:28,220
days,
but they're almost worth it.

3507
02:36:28,220 --> 02:36:29,100
That is almost at the time,
is

3508
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:33,270
the balance I've been in.
I've been in situations in my life where

3509
02:36:33,271 --> 02:36:36,780
I've thought I've.
I've sat around on my own and thought,

3510
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:42,590
I think the worst is going to happen in 
this situation that I'm in with this 

3511
02:36:42,590 --> 02:36:47,181
girl or this business scenario or this 
day that I'm going to have tomorrow.

3512
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:52,940
I think the worst is going to happen.
My ultimate nightmare that I can 

3513
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:56,721
envisage is going to happen and it's 
happened and I have to be okay with the 

3514
02:36:57,661 --> 02:37:02,661
fact that it's happened and it's never 
quite as crushingly bad as you make it 

3515
02:37:03,060 --> 02:37:04,080
in your mind.
You know,

3516
02:37:04,081 --> 02:37:05,640
I've been in like,
I've been in a city,

3517
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:07,410
I've been in situations where to go 
where I'm like,

3518
02:37:07,470 --> 02:37:12,470
I know we'll break it up.
I just don't want it to fuck that guy 

3519
02:37:12,470 --> 02:37:12,990
and she fucks that guy.
And I'm like,

3520
02:37:13,530 --> 02:37:15,120
okay,
it happened

3521
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:18,080
and you survive it.
You know?

3522
02:37:18,090 --> 02:37:18,850
And that's,
that's the,

3523
02:37:18,910 --> 02:37:20,720
that's one of the lessons is like you'll
get through it.

3524
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:24,050
Well that's a real problem for people 
who don't ever get through that and they

3525
02:37:24,051 --> 02:37:26,150
don't realize that it's not gonna be the
end of the world.

3526
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:29,750
I got lucky.
I'm not the girl that I talked about,

3527
02:37:29,751 --> 02:37:32,000
but another girl that I did in high 
school who was,

3528
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:36,110
I don't like to say slut,
but there's no other word for.

3529
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:38,410
She would fuck anybody.
She just,

3530
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:40,980
she was a maniac.
She was just poor girl.

3531
02:37:40,981 --> 02:37:42,710
She went to Catholic school.
They made her,

3532
02:37:43,370 --> 02:37:45,410
they fucked her head up.
They fucked her head up.

3533
02:37:45,411 --> 02:37:46,370
They made,
they made her,

3534
02:37:46,810 --> 02:37:49,370
you know,
just the forbidden fruit.

3535
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:49,720
Right,
right,

3536
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:50,330
right.
Well,

3537
02:37:50,331 --> 02:37:52,490
and also I think she was hormonally very
advanced.

3538
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:53,780
She,
uh,

3539
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:57,050
she was very woman,
like at the age of like 17.

3540
02:37:57,170 --> 02:38:02,000
Everybody was like cheezits mess,
but she fucked everybody I knew.

3541
02:38:02,030 --> 02:38:04,220
So like when I was in love with her at 
one point in time,

3542
02:38:04,221 --> 02:38:05,810
I'm sure whatever you would call in love
with.

3543
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:10,610
So I got used to that at an early age.
He used to disappointing disappointment.

3544
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,470
It's brutal.
Yeah,

3545
02:38:12,471 --> 02:38:17,471
it can be.
But it's fascinating to me that you say 

3546
02:38:17,471 --> 02:38:17,600
that you didn't experience any 
depression at all into your 15,

3547
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:22,430
but then you say that depression is 
something that you're prone to.

3548
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:23,590
Yeah.
Um,

3549
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:26,360
I think,
I think I am prone to it.

3550
02:38:26,361 --> 02:38:31,361
I think,
but you never experienced it until you 

3551
02:38:31,361 --> 02:38:31,490
hit your till you started dating,
didn't know what it was.

3552
02:38:31,550 --> 02:38:33,830
It didn't really know the concept of it.
Like I said,

3553
02:38:33,831 --> 02:38:38,831
sadness.
For me it was like scraping my and then 

3554
02:38:38,831 --> 02:38:38,831
I got,
but it was very temporary.

3555
02:38:38,831 --> 02:38:42,011
So it's not like you had this sort of 
existential angst that was dragging you 

3556
02:38:42,011 --> 02:38:42,320
down.

3557
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:43,850
What is the point?
You know?

3558
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:49,090
I think,
I think because I didn't know that 

3559
02:38:49,090 --> 02:38:50,180
existed when it hit me for the first 
time,

3560
02:38:50,181 --> 02:38:53,480
I had absolutely no defense against it 
because I never.

3561
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:56,010
I'd never seen it before.
I suddenly walked around call corner and

3562
02:38:56,190 --> 02:38:57,800
there's a saber tooth tiger in front of 
me.

3563
02:38:57,820 --> 02:38:59,150
I was like,
Holy Shit,

3564
02:38:59,151 --> 02:39:04,151
that's terrifying.
And it just enveloped me and then my 

3565
02:39:04,151 --> 02:39:07,991
defenses had not been built through.
My formative child is to go through 

3566
02:39:07,991 --> 02:39:09,380
elements of sadness.
Like I said,

3567
02:39:09,381 --> 02:39:11,330
my foundation and my family,
my parents were together.

3568
02:39:11,331 --> 02:39:12,740
They never fought.
They got on well.

3569
02:39:12,741 --> 02:39:14,360
I had a good relationship with my 
brother.

3570
02:39:14,361 --> 02:39:16,070
I was.
I did okay at school.

3571
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:21,340
I never had those real major challenges 
apart from the fact that I knew I was 

3572
02:39:21,340 --> 02:39:22,670
enacted and I was like,
what the fuck am I doing in trying to be

3573
02:39:22,671 --> 02:39:23,020
an actuary?

3574
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:25,280
Manchester is never going to happen.
I'm never going to be an actor.

3575
02:39:25,281 --> 02:39:30,281
I had banks but it wasn't like a painful
physical mental and so it was just 

3576
02:39:30,281 --> 02:39:34,091
something that I was dealing with.
So I don't think I had the full issued 

3577
02:39:34,091 --> 02:39:37,090
to deal with it the first time and I'm a
huge fan of women and I also probably 

3578
02:39:38,721 --> 02:39:43,721
punched a little bit above my weight 
when I was younger because I was the 

3579
02:39:43,721 --> 02:39:47,441
smallest kid at school about super 
mouthy and no one could ever tell me to 

3580
02:39:47,441 --> 02:39:50,921
shut up.
So I was always trying to go for the 

3581
02:39:50,921 --> 02:39:51,950
ultimate girl and every so often the 
ultimate bill gill to be like,

3582
02:39:52,210 --> 02:39:53,990
all right,
I'll entertain you for a week.

3583
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,310
And I'd be like,
I found it.

3584
02:39:55,311 --> 02:39:56,180
And then she'd be like,
fuck you.

3585
02:39:56,181 --> 02:39:57,740
I'm going to jog.
Like,

3586
02:39:57,830 --> 02:39:59,600
ah fuck.
I can't even compete with the joke,

3587
02:39:59,601 --> 02:39:59,840
you know?

3588
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:04,840
So I think I didn't get myself pitfalls 
until the point where my parents had 

3589
02:40:06,131 --> 02:40:07,790
kind of said,
it's all,

3590
02:40:07,791 --> 02:40:08,660
you now,
you know,

3591
02:40:08,661 --> 02:40:09,490
15,
16.

3592
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:10,280
They were like,
okay,

3593
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:12,500
go,
go find out who you're going to be.

3594
02:40:12,501 --> 02:40:15,180
And at that point I,
I got a little,

3595
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,700
you know,
exposed to some sadness and stuff.

3596
02:40:17,701 --> 02:40:18,420
But,
um,

3597
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:20,790
I also,
I just think it's part of life,

3598
02:40:20,791 --> 02:40:21,450
you know,
I have this,

3599
02:40:21,470 --> 02:40:22,230
you know,
on twitter,

3600
02:40:22,231 --> 02:40:23,910
I'm constantly,
not constantly,

3601
02:40:23,911 --> 02:40:25,350
but if anyone ever says to me,
hey,

3602
02:40:25,351 --> 02:40:30,351
you know,
I've been struggling with this or you 

3603
02:40:30,351 --> 02:40:30,351
know,
this is getting me down,

3604
02:40:30,351 --> 02:40:30,730
or I had a rough day or I've had a rough
week.

3605
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:31,470
I just,
you know,

3606
02:40:31,471 --> 02:40:32,790
I'm,
I'm sick with this or whatever.

3607
02:40:33,060 --> 02:40:38,060
And the way that I respond,
the way that I always respond to it is 

3608
02:40:38,060 --> 02:40:38,060
like,
you know,

3609
02:40:38,060 --> 02:40:39,690
this,
this will improve.

3610
02:40:39,870 --> 02:40:42,810
And you will get to a point where you're
able to look back and say,

3611
02:40:43,050 --> 02:40:44,700
oh,
that was a dark period in my life.

3612
02:40:44,730 --> 02:40:48,420
Otherwise it's gonna all be dark and 
then you're going to die.

3613
02:40:48,421 --> 02:40:50,940
Which is a horrible way to live your 
life.

3614
02:40:51,640 --> 02:40:54,030
And sometimes it does happen,
but you got to be hopeful about it.

3615
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:56,100
Um,
but uh,

3616
02:40:56,370 --> 02:40:57,120
you know,
the,

3617
02:40:57,180 --> 02:41:00,960
the way that you make sense,
like I said earlier on of your life,

3618
02:41:01,050 --> 02:41:01,950
is to know,
oh,

3619
02:41:01,951 --> 02:41:04,800
here's a dark place is a light place.
Here's a dark place,

3620
02:41:04,801 --> 02:41:07,740
here's a light place.
And the sweet spot is in the middle.

3621
02:41:07,860 --> 02:41:08,970
You know,
it's,

3622
02:41:09,790 --> 02:41:11,940
there's a great line in the office that 
Ricky Gervais' show.

3623
02:41:11,941 --> 02:41:16,941
I think he ends the entire show by 
saying life is a series of peaks and 

3624
02:41:16,941 --> 02:41:21,831
troughs and you don't know you're in it.
You don't know you're in a trough until 

3625
02:41:21,831 --> 02:41:24,321
you had enough to a peak and you don't 
know any peak until you're coming down 

3626
02:41:24,321 --> 02:41:24,321
the hill.
And that is true of life,

3627
02:41:24,321 --> 02:41:24,321
right?

3628
02:41:24,321 --> 02:41:29,240
Like,
I don't want my life to be incredibly 

3629
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:30,720
hectically happy all the time.
I think I would burn out.

3630
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:36,140
And obviously you don't want your life 
to be incredibly darkly heavily sad 

3631
02:41:36,511 --> 02:41:40,620
because that's going to kill you too.
I want it to just be cruising.

3632
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:44,580
I just want to cruise with balance.
Balance is a huge word for me.

3633
02:41:44,790 --> 02:41:49,790
I don't usually appreciate it.
I don't usually appreciate the sun 

3634
02:41:49,790 --> 02:41:53,781
because I'm used to it.
I don't usually appreciate civilization 

3635
02:41:53,781 --> 02:41:54,990
traffic because I'm used to it because 
it's become what it is,

3636
02:41:55,410 --> 02:42:00,150
but I spent a week on Prince of Wales 
Island in Alaska and it rained every day

3637
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:05,180
constantly all day and we're camping.
So we were in these tents and we're 

3638
02:42:05,180 --> 02:42:05,940
soaking wet and it was.
So we had these,

3639
02:42:05,941 --> 02:42:07,860
uh,
helmets or a brother.

3640
02:42:07,861 --> 02:42:09,520
I'm a headlights on,
you know,

3641
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:14,540
there's a strap on,
you turn the light on so you can walk 

3642
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:14,540
around at night and not fall.

3643
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:16,620
And I turned it on inside my tent and 
there was this,

3644
02:42:17,050 --> 02:42:17,930
it was,
it was like,

3645
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:20,490
it was raining inside the tent because 
it was just missed.

3646
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:22,500
It was water mist everywhere.
It was just,

3647
02:42:22,860 --> 02:42:25,170
it was so wet and just,
just weird.

3648
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:27,330
You're just constantly drenched.
I had a great time.

3649
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:32,450
It wasn't a terrible thing,
but my point is when I came back to La 

3650
02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:35,400
and it was sunny and it was just 
beautiful and just driving around,

3651
02:42:35,401 --> 02:42:36,600
I called my friend and I go,
dude,

3652
02:42:36,601 --> 02:42:40,590
I fucking feel fantastic.
And it was nothing unusual going on.

3653
02:42:40,591 --> 02:42:42,120
It was,
I mean it was great stuff.

3654
02:42:42,121 --> 02:42:44,430
I was doing a podcast,
we're going to do standup at night.

3655
02:42:44,431 --> 02:42:49,431
Everything was normal,
but the contrast to being in that 

3656
02:42:49,431 --> 02:42:52,140
miserable fucking rain soaked island for
five days,

3657
02:42:52,550 --> 02:42:55,140
like all of a sudden now I appreciated 
it and I was like,

3658
02:42:55,170 --> 02:42:56,130
oh,
I needed that.

3659
02:42:56,131 --> 02:43:01,131
I needed that balance.
Like sometimes you need to camp to 

3660
02:43:01,131 --> 02:43:01,860
appreciate a house,
show the perspective of the whole thing.

3661
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:04,660
I have my own issues with that light.
I mean festivals way.

3662
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:07,980
Hoffman is way too hot.
I mean born in Germany,

3663
02:43:08,010 --> 02:43:11,950
brought up in Manchester until I was 18.
A hot sunny day

3664
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:16,400
in either one of those countries is 
probably a e three e four,

3665
02:43:16,410 --> 02:43:17,830
so a big one.
Oh dude,

3666
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:22,831
that's it.
That's a day when like people take days 

3667
02:43:22,831 --> 02:43:22,831
off work and they go by and get drunk in
England.

3668
02:43:22,831 --> 02:43:23,610
You know what I mean?
That's a day of work.

3669
02:43:23,810 --> 02:43:26,320
Was January here,
but like you know,

3670
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:28,870
91,
92 degrees.

3671
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:30,850
I can't analyze it now.
Like oh that's nothing.

3672
02:43:30,851 --> 02:43:32,710
That's 100 right now.
I'm sure at least,

3673
02:43:32,711 --> 02:43:35,470
right.
It's probably 100 to 110 on a bad day.

3674
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:37,510
Yeah,
so that's nothing compared to Vegas.

3675
02:43:38,650 --> 02:43:40,330
Vegas is brutal,
so there's that.

3676
02:43:40,331 --> 02:43:42,940
But also the the major issue that I have
in la,

3677
02:43:43,690 --> 02:43:48,690
which is something that I'm constantly 
exploring with my friends is 

3678
02:43:48,690 --> 02:43:52,140
unfortunately the culture for the most 
part is a little jaded.

3679
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:57,960
You know,
a lot of people come into La Tech as 

3680
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:00,601
much money as they can out of it and 
then leave and it's been depleted 

3681
02:44:00,601 --> 02:44:01,060
spiritually and of its soul.

3682
02:44:01,090 --> 02:44:02,140
You know,
if it's community,

3683
02:44:02,141 --> 02:44:07,141
you go to places like Barcelona or or 
Berlin or Wellington or Sydney where 

3684
02:44:07,141 --> 02:44:07,780
people are feeding that.
See,

3685
02:44:07,781 --> 02:44:09,670
I get the impression that La for the 
most part,

3686
02:44:09,671 --> 02:44:14,671
has things been ripped out of it,
taken out of it like the foundations 

3687
02:44:14,671 --> 02:44:16,300
have been taken out of it because of the
perspective issue though,

3688
02:44:16,301 --> 02:44:18,460
but the way you're viewing it,
it could very well be,

3689
02:44:18,580 --> 02:44:23,580
but I also think that one of the 
archetypes or characters of La,

3690
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:29,220
the the social walking down sunset 
boulevard or the cool guy that wears a 

3691
02:44:29,591 --> 02:44:34,591
white dress shoe,
a white dress shirt and a cowboy hat on 

3692
02:44:34,591 --> 02:44:36,340
a Friday night.
Their reaction to see as that archetype.

3693
02:44:36,450 --> 02:44:37,960
I know the guys that are in the 
standard,

3694
02:44:37,961 --> 02:44:42,961
you know the guys in the rooftop bars 
and standard.

3695
02:44:43,880 --> 02:44:46,380
We go there after the company.
Source of great.

3696
02:44:46,510 --> 02:44:47,480
Damn it.
Yeah.

3697
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:50,050
It's good food and I like the people in 
the tanks and stuff.

3698
02:44:50,050 --> 02:44:55,050
That's where kids are.
You have the standard explain that and 

3699
02:44:55,050 --> 02:44:55,930
you go to check in at the reservations 
or the desk.

3700
02:44:56,290 --> 02:45:01,290
There's a woman that is in her underwear
that is in like a fish tank,

3701
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:06,860
an aquarium that's essentially.
She's reading a book and she's not 

3702
02:45:06,860 --> 02:45:07,180
allowed to interact with you so she 
doesn't look at you.

3703
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:12,360
She just lives around this aquarium and 
like reads your book and is in her 

3704
02:45:12,360 --> 02:45:15,370
underwear and it's so fucking variably,
aesthetically beautiful.

3705
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:18,370
Invariably teaching the people,
checking into the hotel.

3706
02:45:18,371 --> 02:45:21,250
Something very weird about hotel,
but anyway,

3707
02:45:21,660 --> 02:45:23,320
so,
so those archetypes,

3708
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:27,160
their reaction to seeing something 
genuinely impressive,

3709
02:45:27,490 --> 02:45:32,490
let's say for the sake of argument,
it's an animal that we've never seen 

3710
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:36,841
before,
a crossing sunset boulevard and when it 

3711
02:45:36,841 --> 02:45:40,531
gets to the junction of traffic going 
one way and traffic going in another 

3712
02:45:40,531 --> 02:45:43,201
way,
it sits in a yoga position and creates 

3713
02:45:43,201 --> 02:45:44,110
this fucking eclipse of bright hot 
sunlight.

3714
02:45:44,530 --> 02:45:49,530
Their reaction to that,
if you're doing the cool la thing is to 

3715
02:45:49,530 --> 02:45:51,160
go cool.
Not to be like,

3716
02:45:51,460 --> 02:45:53,440
holy fucking shit.
My life just ended.

3717
02:45:53,441 --> 02:45:55,240
That is the most awesome thing I've seen
in my life.

3718
02:45:55,570 --> 02:45:59,420
The required reaction in La is to go 
awesome.

3719
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:02,830
Those people that are trying to fit in.
Honestly,

3720
02:46:02,831 --> 02:46:07,831
I think that La has so many people and 
so many people that are trying to it and

3721
02:46:09,531 --> 02:46:10,040
that's a part

3722
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:15,040
of the problem is it's so many people 
are not doing what they want to do here 

3723
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:16,970
and they're trying to and they in there,
so there's a,

3724
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:22,140
a giant population of trying,
you know,

3725
02:46:22,690 --> 02:46:24,920
but there's also a lot of great artists 
here.

3726
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:28,550
There's a lot of great painters here.
There's a lot of great musicians here.

3727
02:46:28,551 --> 02:46:31,580
There's a lot of great comics here.
I think as far as standup comedy goes,

3728
02:46:31,581 --> 02:46:33,260
is the greatest spot on the planet 
earth.

3729
02:46:33,560 --> 02:46:34,940
I don't think there's anything even 
close.

3730
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:38,210
New York is probably second place,
but man,

3731
02:46:38,211 --> 02:46:43,211
it's tough to fuck with La and I think 
like as far as architecture and as far 

3732
02:46:44,331 --> 02:46:49,331
as our,
like there's a lot of contribution of 

3733
02:46:49,331 --> 02:46:51,610
restaurants.
There's a lot of great shit in the 

3734
02:46:51,610 --> 02:46:53,890
street in downtown and there's so many 
people that want to be one of those 

3735
02:46:53,901 --> 02:46:58,901
musicians that want to be one of those 
artists that want to be one of those 

3736
02:46:58,901 --> 02:46:58,901
comedians.

3737
02:46:58,901 --> 02:46:59,120
I want to be one of those actors that 
want to be one of those,

3738
02:46:59,390 --> 02:47:04,390
anything that's important and so they're
trying to be that person and you're 

3739
02:47:04,390 --> 02:47:05,600
around them all the time.
They're the ones who are going to go.

3740
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:06,820
Cool.
Yeah.

3741
02:47:06,830 --> 02:47:11,830
There's the fakers yeah,
there's a lot of fakers you also move 

3742
02:47:11,830 --> 02:47:12,170
into in what I would assume to be for 
you,

3743
02:47:12,171 --> 02:47:15,920
at least quite a healthy community of 
comics that will know each other to have

3744
02:47:15,921 --> 02:47:20,921
known each other for 20 years that hang 
out on illness clubs on sunset and you 

3745
02:47:20,921 --> 02:47:24,881
have a nice little perculating community
of people traveling in Java now.

3746
02:47:25,071 --> 02:47:26,780
Everyone says hello.
I don't have that.

3747
02:47:26,781 --> 02:47:27,890
I'm the recluse,
you know,

3748
02:47:27,900 --> 02:47:32,900
so I don't hang out with actors buddy.
I don't have any active friends.

3749
02:47:33,470 --> 02:47:38,470
Well that's.
I mean I'm like I'm friends with people 

3750
02:47:38,470 --> 02:47:40,601
that I've worked with full,
but in terms of hanging out like Elijah 

3751
02:47:40,601 --> 02:47:40,601
and I are super tight.

3752
02:47:40,601 --> 02:47:41,690
I don't necessarily hang out with him 
that much apart from little gnomes,

3753
02:47:41,900 --> 02:47:43,550
Orlando and had to say in the United 
States,

3754
02:47:43,790 --> 02:47:48,790
but they have that kind of recluse too 
and it's me going out on sunset and 

3755
02:47:48,981 --> 02:47:53,981
certainly certainly me going out on the 
sunset with Elijah or Orlando Old Bailey

3756
02:47:54,350 --> 02:47:55,810
is a fucking.
Who's billy?

3757
02:47:56,030 --> 02:47:57,560
Billy Boyd who I was in load the rings 
with.

3758
02:47:57,970 --> 02:47:59,920
Played the other hub at the Scottish.
Right.

3759
02:47:59,950 --> 02:48:00,630
Okay.
Yeah.

3760
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:05,860
That is a fucking zoo.
I have no interest in is why those guys 

3761
02:48:05,860 --> 02:48:09,020
are reclusive because when you get to an
Elijah Wood's status in life,

3762
02:48:09,050 --> 02:48:11,390
it's.
It's impossible to be normal.

3763
02:48:11,391 --> 02:48:16,391
It's very hard to go to a restaurant 
without being this side show everywhere 

3764
02:48:16,391 --> 02:48:16,730
he goes,
people must stare at them,

3765
02:48:17,090 --> 02:48:20,720
so that's why I got like that becomes a 
recluse in the animal in the zoo.

3766
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:24,230
And what I love about being a home for 
me is I can control the music.

3767
02:48:24,230 --> 02:48:25,730
I don't have to listen to shit music.
I can.

3768
02:48:25,890 --> 02:48:28,130
I don't have to pay for the alcohol upon
the thing that I bought into,

3769
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:30,200
like start off to upscale the payment of
the alcohol.

3770
02:48:30,570 --> 02:48:32,090
I can watch any movie that I want,
I can.

3771
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:35,150
I can bring in anyone that I won't,
but when I'm in a boss scenario,

3772
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:37,580
as I'm sure you've experienced over 
years,

3773
02:48:38,570 --> 02:48:43,570
people feel like they can come up to you
a little bit and then you add alcohol 

3774
02:48:43,570 --> 02:48:43,610
into that equation.
I mean,

3775
02:48:43,611 --> 02:48:46,130
I've had people in Bob's.
When I'm with my buds,

3776
02:48:46,250 --> 02:48:48,470
someone will come over with a shot of 
whatever.

3777
02:48:48,530 --> 02:48:50,810
Let's say a shot of Jack Daniels.
I'll come over and be like,

3778
02:48:50,811 --> 02:48:52,930
dude,
and they'll play on me.

3779
02:48:53,140 --> 02:48:54,010
No,
no,

3780
02:48:54,070 --> 02:48:55,210
no.
I got your shop.

3781
02:48:55,430 --> 02:48:55,910
I'm like,
oh,

3782
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:57,410
okay.
I'm drinking vodka.

3783
02:48:57,470 --> 02:48:58,190
Oh,
I'm drinking Tequila.

3784
02:48:58,191 --> 02:48:59,680
I don't want it,
dude.

3785
02:48:59,690 --> 02:49:01,910
I got your shot.
You're going to a shot.

3786
02:49:02,100 --> 02:49:03,560
Yeah.
I don't drink Jack Daniels.

3787
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:04,770
If you want to give me a shot,
Tequila,

3788
02:49:04,780 --> 02:49:05,810
I'll drink that.
Well,

3789
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:07,830
maybe I'm just not gonna drink.
Anyway.

3790
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:08,040
I'm

3791
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,420
with my friends.
I'm just gonna do my thing.

3792
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:12,870
They'll get pissy and Moni because I'm 
not drinking their shop.

3793
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:18,020
First of all,
I didn't ask you to come off to me 

3794
02:49:18,020 --> 02:49:18,020
second and you to buy me a drink.
Thirdly,

3795
02:49:18,020 --> 02:49:21,560
you're interrupting friends who all know
each other and you're a complete 

3796
02:49:21,560 --> 02:49:21,970
stranger.
I've had people put their hands on me in

3797
02:49:21,971 --> 02:49:26,971
boss,
like put their arms around me and try 

3798
02:49:26,971 --> 02:49:28,470
and walk me over to their friends 
without asking my permission to get your

3799
02:49:28,471 --> 02:49:29,970
fucking hands off me.
I'm not.

3800
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,120
I don't come from where you go.

3801
02:49:31,190 --> 02:49:35,060
People that know you from television or 
know you from the movies.

3802
02:49:35,061 --> 02:49:40,061
They think they know and so they also 
think in some weird way that you owe 

3803
02:49:40,061 --> 02:49:41,440
them something.
You're Charlie from last?

3804
02:49:41,570 --> 02:49:42,320
No,
come on.

3805
02:49:42,321 --> 02:49:44,210
Come on over a table.
I want my friends to meet you.

3806
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:45,650
I loved your show.
Okay,

3807
02:49:45,651 --> 02:49:48,430
that's great.
I was in Vegas once and I had a mouthful

3808
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:53,440
of food.
I'm cutting this steak and I'm putting 

3809
02:49:53,440 --> 02:49:53,440
it in my mouth and this woman goes,
I'm from Canada.

3810
02:49:53,450 --> 02:49:58,450
Come over to our table.
We have friends from Canada that wants 

3811
02:49:58,450 --> 02:49:58,450
to meet you.
I go,

3812
02:49:58,450 --> 02:50:02,231
you fucking crazy bitch.
You do want to see me eating with 20 

3813
02:50:02,231 --> 02:50:05,531
other people.
I'm just going to come over to your 

3814
02:50:05,531 --> 02:50:05,531
group of fucking friends and put on a 
clown hair,

3815
02:50:05,531 --> 02:50:10,170
give you jasmine,
and then when I said I'm eating right 

3816
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:10,170
now,
I said,

3817
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:10,850
when I'm leaving,
if I leave and I've run into you guys,

3818
02:50:10,851 --> 02:50:12,350
I'd be happy to say hi,
but right now I'm,

3819
02:50:12,410 --> 02:50:17,410
I'm eating dinner with some friends and 
she looked at me like I was the biggest 

3820
02:50:17,410 --> 02:50:17,410
piece of shit.

3821
02:50:17,410 --> 02:50:18,650
I wasn't mean to her.
It wasn't,

3822
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:24,100
but it's that same thing,
but I've also had great experiences in 

3823
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:27,050
bars where I've run into great people 
and I feel like when you put yourself in

3824
02:50:27,051 --> 02:50:32,051
those positions where you could be 
uncomfortable sometimes those 

3825
02:50:32,051 --> 02:50:35,590
uncomfortable positions,
I'll have fantastic conversations with 

3826
02:50:35,590 --> 02:50:37,010
some random dude who makes cabinets or 
some shit like that or some,

3827
02:50:37,190 --> 02:50:38,390
some guy who,
you know,

3828
02:50:38,460 --> 02:50:40,130
whatever.
I'm making my own vodka,

3829
02:50:40,131 --> 02:50:40,970
you know,
want to try it.

3830
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:41,420
Oh,
okay.

3831
02:50:41,421 --> 02:50:46,421
How'd you get into that?
And then you have these conversations 

3832
02:50:46,421 --> 02:50:46,421
with people.
As long as the people are cool,

3833
02:50:46,421 --> 02:50:48,830
but it's like you can't get cleared off 
of people.

3834
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:50,360
Here it goes again with that fucking 
statement.

3835
02:50:50,750 --> 02:50:52,520
I keep saying,
I don't know where I got that from,

3836
02:50:52,521 --> 02:50:57,521
but it pop it in my head.
It doesn't have anything to do with 

3837
02:50:57,521 --> 02:50:57,521
homosexual studies in general,
and please don't hate to get angry.

3838
02:50:57,590 --> 02:50:59,870
It's more the exact definition of the 
word,

3839
02:50:59,871 --> 02:51:04,871
which means Kuli Kuli enough when you 
get people put you off like that,

3840
02:51:05,121 --> 02:51:10,121
you can get put off to people,
but I don't want to be that guy so I 

3841
02:51:10,121 --> 02:51:12,720
don't hide a go out.
I go to bars and I will occasionally run

3842
02:51:12,721 --> 02:51:15,890
into drunk retards,
but for the most part I feel like if you

3843
02:51:15,891 --> 02:51:19,070
put that out there that you're just a 
normal person.

3844
02:51:19,071 --> 02:51:21,680
Just how you might know who I am,
but I'm fucking.

3845
02:51:21,950 --> 02:51:26,950
I swear to God I'm normal.
Most of the time you run into people 

3846
02:51:26,950 --> 02:51:30,161
kind of accept that vibe.
Like you were talking about the Cobra 

3847
02:51:30,161 --> 02:51:32,000
kind of recognizing exactly what you are
and figuring it out after awhile.

3848
02:51:32,390 --> 02:51:35,510
If you put out that vibe like you can't 
be fucked with or you know,

3849
02:51:35,511 --> 02:51:38,270
everybody's annoying to you,
then people find you and,

3850
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:39,140
and you know,

3851
02:51:39,330 --> 02:51:40,000
and I don't,
I don't,

3852
02:51:40,020 --> 02:51:40,650
you know,
look,

3853
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:45,920
for me it's just the Boston area walking
around on the streets and stuff and not 

3854
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:49,370
90,
I would say 90 percent of the 

3855
02:51:49,370 --> 02:51:51,321
interactions that they have,
maybe even 95 percent of the 

3856
02:51:51,321 --> 02:51:52,050
interactions that I have a positive in a
bar because it adds alcohol,

3857
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:53,940
that a completely different scenario and
I,

3858
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,040
I don't,
I don't come into bonds with my,

3859
02:51:56,070 --> 02:51:58,110
with my backup.
I'm usually having fun with my friends.

3860
02:51:58,530 --> 02:52:03,530
One of the phrases that I use a lot in 
terms of animals and humans is comment 

3861
02:52:03,530 --> 02:52:08,271
me correctly.
You have to come at me correctly if 

3862
02:52:08,271 --> 02:52:08,271
you're coming

3863
02:52:08,271 --> 02:52:08,271
at me aggressively,
dude,

3864
02:52:08,271 --> 02:52:09,370
I bought your Tequila.
It's go dude.

3865
02:52:09,660 --> 02:52:12,040
And it'd be like to go away,
you're going to run into that.

3866
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:17,080
I just happens all the time.
You must get insulated because you know 

3867
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:19,680
you're associated with cage fighting and
you're a big deal sometimes the opposite

3868
02:52:20,050 --> 02:52:20,890
people.
And because of that,

3869
02:52:20,891 --> 02:52:24,220
people want to fuck with me or people 
want to talk to me weird or the,

3870
02:52:24,221 --> 02:52:26,150
you know,
they want to hold onto me.

3871
02:52:26,151 --> 02:52:29,500
They don't want to feel my body around 
my neck that grabbed my shoulder.

3872
02:52:29,510 --> 02:52:31,360
If you're a big dude,
you're a big dude.

3873
02:52:31,361 --> 02:52:36,361
People get weird.
There's just a certain amount of weird 

3874
02:52:36,361 --> 02:52:39,241
people you're going to run into and they
probably don't even know why they're 

3875
02:52:39,241 --> 02:52:39,241
acting the way they're acting.
When they do,

3876
02:52:39,241 --> 02:52:40,890
they're probably feel like,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

3877
02:52:42,460 --> 02:52:43,480
Yeah,
exactly.

3878
02:52:43,481 --> 02:52:44,830
It was almost like an out of body 
experience.

3879
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:49,880
Floopy around you.
Charlie shrink my boobs.

3880
02:52:50,270 --> 02:52:51,370
And they would,
they would,

3881
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:54,340
they would do.
Let's say they met there and randomly.

3882
02:52:54,341 --> 02:52:56,650
Oh their uncle randomly on the street,
they would do stuff that would,

3883
02:52:56,680 --> 02:53:01,540
they would never do it.
I've had people scream and the Annapolis

3884
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:04,540
Shit fucking,
you would never do that.

3885
02:53:04,541 --> 02:53:07,900
It'd be like you'd go over and say hello
to him.

3886
02:53:07,901 --> 02:53:09,130
Yes,
it's true.

3887
02:53:09,820 --> 02:53:11,290
But you find that with fires,
obviously.

3888
02:53:11,291 --> 02:53:16,291
I mean,
I don't know how many fires you know 

3889
02:53:16,291 --> 02:53:16,660
fucked with.
Oh yeah,

3890
02:53:16,661 --> 02:53:17,650
I've seen it.
Yeah,

3891
02:53:17,651 --> 02:53:19,810
I've seen them get fucked with,
it's ridiculous,

3892
02:53:19,811 --> 02:53:22,630
you know,
just some people are just drunk and they

3893
02:53:22,631 --> 02:53:27,631
also,
they don't like the idea that they feel 

3894
02:53:27,631 --> 02:53:30,331
intimidated by this guy being around 
them and they want to like put that guy 

3895
02:53:30,331 --> 02:53:30,331
in his place,
you know,

3896
02:53:30,331 --> 02:53:34,791
I don't want to.
And there's also people that are just 

3897
02:53:34,791 --> 02:53:34,791
completely delusional.

3898
02:53:34,791 --> 02:53:38,430
Like I've run into so many guys who want
to tell me how if they fought in the 

3899
02:53:38,430 --> 02:53:38,720
UFC,
they would kill everybody.

3900
02:53:38,721 --> 02:53:43,721
Right.
But they can't do it right now because 

3901
02:53:43,721 --> 02:53:44,950
they're busy with some other shit.
I could take so many fucking people tell

3902
02:53:44,951 --> 02:53:46,720
me that bro.
My mentality,

3903
02:53:46,721 --> 02:53:46,990
they,
they,

3904
02:53:47,010 --> 02:53:48,370
uh,
they all have the same thing.

3905
02:53:48,371 --> 02:53:50,950
Like I don't quit man.
He'd have to kill me.

3906
02:53:51,300 --> 02:53:54,940
And you're not gonna you know,
like it's so many dummies out there.

3907
02:53:55,210 --> 02:54:00,210
It's just there's a certain amount of 
people out there that have nine volt 

3908
02:54:00,210 --> 02:54:00,320
brains and there's not a goddamn thing 
done.

3909
02:54:00,330 --> 02:54:01,300
No,
not in the books.

3910
02:54:01,301 --> 02:54:03,490
They can read.
Not enough life experiences.

3911
02:54:03,491 --> 02:54:05,160
They just have shit genetics.
Yeah.

3912
02:54:05,350 --> 02:54:06,130
And that,
that,

3913
02:54:06,340 --> 02:54:07,540
that,
that's real.

3914
02:54:07,750 --> 02:54:12,750
We've been taught that everyone is born 
on an even playing field and it's about 

3915
02:54:12,750 --> 02:54:16,891
you to find yourself.
Know there's some people that are ditch 

3916
02:54:16,891 --> 02:54:17,860
diggers and there's not a goddamn thing 
you can do about it and it sucks.

3917
02:54:18,130 --> 02:54:20,440
It sucks if you're one of them.
Survival of the fittest.

3918
02:54:20,790 --> 02:54:24,930
Sometimes ditch diggers have smart kids,
but sometimes they don't know.

3919
02:54:25,150 --> 02:54:27,580
My best friend who's a smart guy,
he's a firefighter in Manchester.

3920
02:54:27,581 --> 02:54:32,581
He and I went backwards and forwards for
a long time on the fact that he thought 

3921
02:54:32,581 --> 02:54:36,420
that he could take Rhonda Rousey.
She will break both big.

3922
02:54:36,490 --> 02:54:37,450
Is He?
Oh,

3923
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:37,950
he's like,
Yo.

3924
02:54:37,951 --> 02:54:42,951
Size because he know how to fight.
He was a tough guy at school and like 

3925
02:54:42,951 --> 02:54:44,080
those dickheads that you see in the 
street,

3926
02:54:44,110 --> 02:54:44,560
he's like,
yeah,

3927
02:54:44,561 --> 02:54:46,670
but I'm gonna let gill punched me in the
face and it's old.

3928
02:54:46,671 --> 02:54:47,080
I'm like,
no,

3929
02:54:47,081 --> 02:54:48,490
run around.
He's not going to punch you in the face.

3930
02:54:48,491 --> 02:54:53,491
She's going to put you in a choke hold 
or she's going to put you into 

3931
02:54:53,491 --> 02:54:53,560
submission where she breaks both in 
rounds and then she stands on her face.

3932
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:56,710
She can tap grown men who are 
professional fighters.

3933
02:54:56,711 --> 02:54:57,720
I've seen it.
Yeah.

3934
02:54:58,000 --> 02:54:59,470
You know,
if you just eat,

3935
02:54:59,480 --> 02:55:04,480
you just don't know.
There's a level of talent and ability 

3936
02:55:04,480 --> 02:55:08,170
that some people have that it sort of 
supersedes the sexual.

3937
02:55:08,990 --> 02:55:09,980
Totally.
The,

3938
02:55:10,050 --> 02:55:11,570
the,
the ideas that we have,

3939
02:55:11,571 --> 02:55:13,220
the classifications of,
you know,

3940
02:55:13,221 --> 02:55:15,800
man can't beat up a woman or a woman.
Can't be the man rather.

3941
02:55:16,010 --> 02:55:17,240
Yeah.
They know they can.

3942
02:55:17,270 --> 02:55:19,460
There's just as other girls,
cris Cyborg.

3943
02:55:19,490 --> 02:55:21,280
She,
she'd beat the fuck out of most man,

3944
02:55:21,340 --> 02:55:21,960
you know,
and,

3945
02:55:21,961 --> 02:55:23,990
and do it in a,
in a very manly way.

3946
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:26,740
And,
and Rousey's technique is so strong that

3947
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:31,760
you can't fuck her judo spectacular.
And her arm bars are amongst the best 

3948
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:33,110
I've ever seen in any weight class with 
men,

3949
02:55:33,111 --> 02:55:34,040
women,
anybody.

3950
02:55:34,290 --> 02:55:35,270
She has.
She's phenomenal.

3951
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:40,340
One of the scariest dudes for me,
I think he's been injured for a little 

3952
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:40,340
bit,
but I saw him.

3953
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:41,480
You,
you come and tell you on this fight,

3954
02:55:41,481 --> 02:55:45,710
and it was truly terrifying to watch was
Rory Macdonald.

3955
02:55:46,220 --> 02:55:46,700
Oh,
rory.

3956
02:55:47,270 --> 02:55:52,270
Rory Macdonald owned some English guy 
where he broke his cheek and broke his 

3957
02:55:52,270 --> 02:55:54,070
nose.
And I mills.

3958
02:55:54,250 --> 02:55:55,520
Yeah,
I watched it,

3959
02:55:55,910 --> 02:56:00,910
I couldn't believe what I was saying and
I rewound it and the reason why he went 

3960
02:56:00,910 --> 02:56:03,230
off like that is he got cool.
Roman Donald got caught by something and

3961
02:56:03,231 --> 02:56:04,040
you said it,
you were like,

3962
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:04,720
well,
we got caught.

3963
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:07,150
He got caught.
He tied the guy out,

3964
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:12,190
put it on the floor and was like,
fuck this nonsense and destroyed his 

3965
02:56:12,190 --> 02:56:14,350
face and he's got like a terminator vibe
going on with man.

3966
02:56:14,510 --> 02:56:15,800
He's just like calling.
He knows.

3967
02:56:15,801 --> 02:56:16,910
Yeah,
he goes dead.

3968
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:19,340
You're dead because you want to judge 
CNPS boys.

3969
02:56:19,430 --> 02:56:20,210
Yes.
Yeah,

3970
02:56:20,211 --> 02:56:22,610
he's trained on there for us,
a hobby and Montreal.

3971
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:24,020
He was phenomenal.
He.

3972
02:56:24,020 --> 02:56:24,740
Is he injured?
Is that.

3973
02:56:24,850 --> 02:56:26,180
No,
he's fighting for the title.

3974
02:56:26,580 --> 02:56:28,550
July 11th.
Good Fan in Vegas.

3975
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:33,560
Woohoo.
That's the undercard of the Joseph 

3976
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:34,250
Connor Mcgregor fight.
He's fighting Robbie lawler.

3977
02:56:34,400 --> 02:56:39,400
Who's the champion right now.
It's a wild fight and good luck to him 

3978
02:56:39,400 --> 02:56:39,400
and it's great fun.
What about jsps?

3979
02:56:39,430 --> 02:56:41,640
He done hopefully,
uh,

3980
02:56:42,250 --> 02:56:47,250
you know me,
I have a different stance and the rest 

3981
02:56:47,250 --> 02:56:50,081
of the UFC,
I think they'd want them to come back 

3982
02:56:50,081 --> 02:56:50,081
because he's worth a lot of money.
I think he's had enough,

3983
02:56:50,081 --> 02:56:52,700
yeah,
I think he's in his thirties and he took

3984
02:56:52,701 --> 02:56:57,701
a tremendous amount of punishment and 
his career and did the greatest thing 

3985
02:56:57,701 --> 02:56:57,710
you could ever do.
He won the title,

3986
02:56:57,711 --> 02:57:00,950
defended it a bunch of times,
in my opinion,

3987
02:57:00,970 --> 02:57:05,970
is the greatest welterweight and history
and it's not going to get any better 

3988
02:57:05,970 --> 02:57:05,970
from here.
You know,

3989
02:57:05,970 --> 02:57:09,170
he's taken over 800 shots to the head in
competition in the UFC.

3990
02:57:09,650 --> 02:57:14,650
I think it was like 880 something that 
counted as one and that's just in 

3991
02:57:14,650 --> 02:57:15,470
training.
I mean that's just in fighting,

3992
02:57:15,471 --> 02:57:16,350
not training.
Yeah.

3993
02:57:16,550 --> 02:57:21,550
I mean one of the saddest things I've 
ever seen in UFC is when you spoke to I 

3994
02:57:22,511 --> 02:57:25,840
think after his fight and he was like a 
little rattled and he was like,

3995
02:57:25,850 --> 02:57:27,290
I'm going to take a break for a little 
bit.

3996
02:57:27,291 --> 02:57:28,460
And you were like,
are you retiring?

3997
02:57:28,461 --> 02:57:29,360
And he was like,
I don't know,

3998
02:57:29,361 --> 02:57:33,220
I need to step back.
And I looked at this guy that was caught

3999
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:37,040
like a Greek God and I thought he's 
about to cry right there,

4000
02:57:37,041 --> 02:57:40,820
like he's done.
And the pressure on him to come back,

4001
02:57:40,821 --> 02:57:45,821
I think he's really unfair because like 
the most precious thing for him to hang 

4002
02:57:46,041 --> 02:57:47,910
onto now is his mind.
And he was like,

4003
02:57:47,920 --> 02:57:49,880
he was just about to lose it.
Well,

4004
02:57:49,940 --> 02:57:51,950
you know,
he's had some memory issues.

4005
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:52,360
You know,
we,

4006
02:57:52,430 --> 02:57:56,240
I had him on the podcast he was talking 
about he didn't know whether or not he's

4007
02:57:56,241 --> 02:58:01,241
been.
It had been abducted by aliens because 

4008
02:58:01,241 --> 02:58:02,040
he would have these moments in his life 
where all of a sudden

4009
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:04,350
he was at home and he didn't know how he
got there.

4010
02:58:04,410 --> 02:58:05,250
And I was like,
Whoa,

4011
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:07,830
that's not aliens.
Like these are,

4012
02:58:07,860 --> 02:58:11,430
these are probably issues that you're 
developing from trauma.

4013
02:58:12,960 --> 02:58:16,080
But in his mind there,
it's almost alien.

4014
02:58:16,081 --> 02:58:20,520
It's like something's wrong.
And you know that when you start talking

4015
02:58:20,521 --> 02:58:22,440
like that and you.
I mean,

4016
02:58:22,441 --> 02:58:27,441
it's not like he's talking like that and
he has no history whatsoever of being 

4017
02:58:27,441 --> 02:58:29,700
hit and no history whatsoever of any 
sort of brain injury.

4018
02:58:30,290 --> 02:58:35,290
You know,
you're talking about a guy who's just 

4019
02:58:35,290 --> 02:58:35,290
fucking job is to break people's brains,
you know,

4020
02:58:35,290 --> 02:58:39,850
and he's training with other trained 
killers and they're hitting each other 

4021
02:58:39,850 --> 02:58:40,080
on a regular basis.
You can't,

4022
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:45,110
there's a point of no return,
no return in fighting and you got to 

4023
02:58:45,110 --> 02:58:46,710
realize where that point is and it's 
very hard for fighters to recognize that

4024
02:58:46,711 --> 02:58:49,020
they need someone to help them and talk 
to them about it.

4025
02:58:49,021 --> 02:58:54,021
But George is one of the rare few that 
did it on his own terms while he was on 

4026
02:58:54,121 --> 02:58:57,780
top as a champion retired.
I applaud him for that.

4027
02:58:57,781 --> 02:58:58,590
I think he's amazing.

4028
02:58:58,620 --> 02:59:03,620
Yeah,
I think he's fantastic and he seems to 

4029
02:59:03,620 --> 02:59:05,361
have come from a foundation of supple 
and obviously it doesn't come from this 

4030
02:59:05,361 --> 02:59:07,170
country and it feels like he has a nice 
kind of backbone.

4031
02:59:07,171 --> 02:59:07,410
But yes,

4032
02:59:07,430 --> 02:59:09,310
plenty of money to.
He made a lot.

4033
02:59:09,311 --> 02:59:12,100
I made millions and millions of dollars.
He made more money than anybody,

4034
02:59:12,101 --> 02:59:13,930
so hopefully he'll be fine.

4035
02:59:14,010 --> 02:59:19,010
You know,
one of the things that happens in the 

4036
02:59:19,010 --> 02:59:21,470
football community in the soccer 
community in England is that these very 

4037
02:59:21,470 --> 02:59:26,061
talented,
very elite sports stars that have no 

4038
02:59:26,061 --> 02:59:28,590
idea how to do their own washing or do 
their own groceries or write a check,

4039
02:59:29,010 --> 02:59:34,010
get taken care of for probably 15 years 
and get spout the other side when 

4040
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:38,601
they're 35,
huge amount of depression in retired 

4041
02:59:38,601 --> 02:59:42,111
football players because they,
now they're in the scrappy at 35 and 

4042
02:59:42,111 --> 02:59:46,011
they look around and go,
I have this incredible talent which is 

4043
02:59:46,011 --> 02:59:48,951
now no longer needed and I couldn't 
functioning society in a way that most 

4044
02:59:49,501 --> 02:59:51,780
people do.
So they're in no man's land and node.

4045
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:52,830
Do you find that with.

4046
02:59:53,390 --> 02:59:58,390
Oh yeah,
it's even worse because they're brain 

4047
02:59:58,390 --> 02:59:58,390
damaged.
A lot of them.

4048
02:59:58,390 --> 03:00:02,010
I mean there's a certain amount of brain
damage almost every fighter has by the 

4049
03:00:02,010 --> 03:00:02,560
time they reach 35.
And uh,

4050
03:00:02,561 --> 03:00:07,561
I mean we get,
we experienced that with all sorts of 

4051
03:00:07,561 --> 03:00:07,561
athletes in America with its football 
players,

4052
03:00:07,561 --> 03:00:09,950
basketball players.
It's a crazy thing because most people,

4053
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:12,380
they have the highest earning potential 
when they're older.

4054
03:00:12,530 --> 03:00:13,520
You know,
as they get older,

4055
03:00:13,521 --> 03:00:18,521
they make more and more money to become 
more and more successful and then they 

4056
03:00:18,521 --> 03:00:21,221
retire with athletes.
It's the make the bulk of your money 

4057
03:00:21,221 --> 03:00:24,221
when you're young and wild and 
irresponsible and impulsive and then 

4058
03:00:24,221 --> 03:00:25,970
you're supposed to try to hold on to 
that gold dust as you get older.

4059
03:00:26,210 --> 03:00:28,700
I think we're at a new show on HBO is 
about this.

4060
03:00:28,720 --> 03:00:29,500
Yeah,
yeah.

4061
03:00:29,540 --> 03:00:31,070
Yeah.
Little funny,

4062
03:00:31,071 --> 03:00:33,950
but we just ran out of time.
Just hit hit the three hour mark.

4063
03:00:33,951 --> 03:00:35,450
I love it.
Thank you dot.

4064
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:36,410
That was awesome man.
I really,

4065
03:00:36,411 --> 03:00:38,300
really appreciate.
It was a really fun conversation.

4066
03:00:38,301 --> 03:00:39,680
You just do this more often.
You're around here,

4067
03:00:39,681 --> 03:00:40,550
right?
All right.

4068
03:00:40,551 --> 03:00:41,130
Let's do it.
Alright.

4069
03:00:41,330 --> 03:00:42,350
Alright.
