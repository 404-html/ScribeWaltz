We're ready to get the party started.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,500
[inaudible]

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,450
and go. No, Brenda Wa

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,630
Yes. It's on Ustream

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,450
you got your own camera over the
jail? Yes. There's a camera for you.

12
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:49,210
It was a camera can say if you want some
come. Thanks. I'm getting piece of this.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,030
We've got to go crazy.
If I get behind the every now and then,

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,810
come on over a little. The
door's always open. Well,

15
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,410
we used to do it on the couch where used
to get a big view of all three of us at

16
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:01,940
once.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,510
I saw that with Stan hope, I think,
or I saw it with somebody and it was,

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,670
it seemed seemed odd at Beth.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,560
The couch is wicked. I'm comfortable. Just
wasn't good. It wasn't good for talking.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,650
You think that accounts should be like
really comfortable with but nothing can

21
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:18,130
fuck with a good office chair. Yeah. I
think they got office chairs figured out.

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,090
You know you can get in this sucker and
you know it's, it supports your back.

23
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:23,980
Your arms have a good comfy place to rest.

24
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:26,290
It's way better to sit in
office chairs and couches.

25
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:29,700
Chairs now sponsored the show, correct
it. Should I wait a flashlight?

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,121
I think.

27
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:33,420
I think movie theaters or fee figuring
it out too now because they used to have

28
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,630
like really good comfortable chairs
where that you could have like the thing

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,380
that goes up when you put your drink
in then you can make it a couch.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,100
The other day I went to a theater and
they had torn out all those chairs and

31
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:48,120
went back to the old style where you
can't move the, the, the armrest anymore.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,030
And I was like wondering why and then
you think about it was a lot more

33
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,980
comfortable though.
Like the actual chair part.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,030
So now I'm thinking they're just designing
what theater was that. My numbers.

35
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:01,730
So universal citywalk uh, they,
yeah, they're nice. That's probably,

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,800
they're dealing with too many douchebags
doing stupid things to those cup

37
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,410
holders.
And I think by douchebags you mean Mexico.

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,170
I was gonna say Mexicans,

39
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:13,160
but I'm glad you didn't stood
there is no more if you want,

40
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,770
if you're from out of town,
you'll like gear from Illinois and no,

41
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:17,900
we don't have a lot of
Mexicans out in Joliet.

42
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,230
This is what you need to do just
for a fucking goof. Take a trip,

43
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:21,891
come to Hollywood.

44
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,980
And the first thing I need you to do
is go to a movie at city walk on like a

45
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:27,740
Friday night. Yeah. And
there's two things going on.

46
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,010
There's the movie and then there's a
show where the young Mexican kids are

47
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:35,240
yelling out at the stage trying to make
each other laugh. Yeah. Which is funny.

48
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,420
It's ongoing. I mean, again, you're
prepared for it. Yeah. If you've,

49
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,500
I've heard people yell funny shit out.
I was with a girl once and she yelled out.

50
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,940
I've heard of people
yell funny shit out too,

51
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:47,900
but I was with a girl once and she yelled
out at these guys that were talking

52
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,350
while the movie was going on and she
didn't tell me she was going to do it

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,670
either. She just turned and, and this
was when I first moved to Hollywood too,

54
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,560
right?
I was fucking ultra paranoid.

55
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:00,130
I'd heard all these crazy things like
when you're driving down the street,

56
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,600
if you guys will drive with
their headlights off and
when you flash them to let

57
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,230
them know that there are headlights are
on. Well it's a gang initiation thing.

58
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,390
They have to find you and kill you.
That's cause I was out here then 93 yeah.

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,200
That's like where get like Nwa and
all that shit was hot and it was,

60
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,700
it was scary. It was, I mean, I don't
know if it was all all paranoia,

61
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,120
but it was like, it felt
different. There's a lot of posers,

62
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,780
there's a lot of people that were really
legit gangsters. Like I've read up,

63
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,590
there's a great book about the crips and
the bloods and history of gang banging

64
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:35,540
and La. It's a fascinating book.
I'm sorry, I forgot the title of it.

65
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,630
There was an HBO documentary too.
That was really good.

66
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,140
What it's means it's been going on since
forever, you know, I mean it's just,

67
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:41,890
it is the way it is.

68
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,420
But when rap music and Gangsta
rap got really popular,

69
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,840
that was when like the whole country
started to be aware of this and then as

70
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,830
people started acting like them,
you know, so anyway, the point is,

71
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,620
I'm in this movie theater, so I'm
with this girl, she's a nice girl.

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,790
She just misguided, you know,
excuse me, would you please shut up?

73
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,770
We're trying to watch this
movie. And I'm like, Oh fuck.

74
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:07,330
Was she got it for saying that or
for going out with any of that? Both.

75
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,650
Both clearly but clearly for going and
going into his hand and immediately.

76
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:16,600
Yeah, yeah. And then that automatically
you're responsible. Yeah. And I'm like,

77
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,030
I'm going to die. She had done a
couple of things like this before.

78
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:21,520
She would have like cut off
people and traffic and shit.

79
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,730
Like if someone got in front of her,
she would like speed up,

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,420
go into the oncoming lane
and cut them off. Yeah,

81
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:32,580
she was fucking crazy. And maybe it's
Chicago thing. She was from Chicago.

82
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,340
I like a year. Nice girl.
She was a nice girl.

83
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,520
Other than that it was weird cause most
of the time she was super friendly but

84
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,320
when she felt like anybody
was fucking with her,

85
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,610
she would get like really angry
and like go to a 10 like you said,

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,610
like right away, you know, and I
think they need at movie theaters, uh,

87
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,320
going back to that is that they needed,

88
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,170
I know that you're supposed to turn off
your cell phones during movies and stuff

89
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:53,650
like that,

90
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,880
but instead of if you see some guy
running the movie that the worst thing is

91
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,710
actually having to go out and find him.

92
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,700
Imagine being able to like text it or
going to text a projection is, hey,

93
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,830
just so you know,
it's fucking quiet in here.

94
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,820
Or we were encouraging texting and
complaining. I completely agree.

95
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,550
But it should be like only for
emergencies, you know, like, Nah,

96
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,550
you can't ensure that people
go to emergency, you know,

97
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,550
do use it only during emergencies.
When you give people the option to text,

98
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,920
I mean look,
look at fucking youtube comments.

99
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,770
That's what you're going to get in your
text. You got to get those same retards.

100
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,960
They're just
finally getting to the theater.

101
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,620
I have a, I don't care. People text
during the movie really don't care.

102
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,060
I care if they're near me.
Man.

103
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,860
It's like the blue light care of
him doing standup and cemetery.

104
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,610
It's like as long as they're not,
as long as it's not,

105
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,300
I'd way rather than texts
than talk. Yes, I agree.

106
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,690
Because I love to text so I get,
you know what I mean?

107
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,410
Like I enjoy it and I don't want to, I
certainly don't want an iPhone. Yeah,

108
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm rocking and iPhone. Okay.
You don't fuck with droids
I fuck with a droid. Yeah.

109
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,040
I fuck with the

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,890
HTC evo four g.
How'd you log it?

111
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,960
They should be ashamed of themselves for
releasing a telephone with that crappy

112
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,330
battery ashamed of themselves.

113
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,900
It's like the fact that it
even went to market yet,

114
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:14,090
this iPhone is the best
anything I've ever had.

115
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,340
That's a problem with all
the four g's and androids.

116
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,720
All the four g's and an android phones
all have usually have the worst battery

117
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:21,800
life must because of the screen.

118
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,060
I would spend most of the day
managing the better. Yeah.

119
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,110
I had a droid for a day,

120
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,860
the droid to at the slide out keyboard
for one day and I brought it back to them.

121
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,140
I was like, you gotta be fucking
kidding me. It's a battery.

122
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,510
I've played with it for 20 minutes
for the full battery and it had half a

123
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:40,130
battery life and yeah, 20 minutes.
That's ridiculous. And they're like, oh,

124
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:44,350
you need to download. You
know man, come on man.

125
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,230
Fuck I do you guys need to
get your shit together. Yeah.

126
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,920
Why can't they figure
that shit out at all?

127
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,810
But outside of that figure out how to
shut people the fuck up and movies.

128
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,880
I mean, look, we can boot man now,

129
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,110
but try to get Mexicans is telling,
yelling out funny shit.

130
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,550
Keep Mexicans out of city.

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,290
Does the phone itself though
is pretty good, right? Hmm.

132
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,260
Other than the battery life
phone? No, the HTC evo. It's fine.

133
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,000
I was always nervous about it was like I
worked for the phone like look I got to

134
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:24,890
get, I should look it off cause I don't
want my phone to act crazy like this is,

135
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,680
it was fine. Yeah. I can hear you're
always worried about the battery life.

136
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,700
I'm still a little bit worried
about it and I haven't had too much.

137
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,550
That is a fucking terrible feeling.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,590
Looking down in your shit says 10%
battery life left and like you're out.

139
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,990
Oh yeah.
I'm so [inaudible] right now.

140
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,100
It's going to try midnight and my
phone's going to turn it into a Turkey.

141
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,000
It was going to go with the
back to the future thing.

142
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,260
It's like my hands disappearing.

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,750
Was that when Marty McFly Yan would
disappear when he looked fine? Yeah.

144
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,610
It's like you have that picture when you
time traveling you always have to look

145
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,490
at and make sure you're not like
destroying. So you're an older guy.

146
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:05,090
Cinderella's more of a reference for
you. I have daughters, young guys.

147
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,240
Keep up with the hot movies
like back to the future,

148
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,720
which came out 26 years ago

149
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,850
that God does stand up biff from
back to the future. It does stand up.

150
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,180
I always see him at the comedy
store. Yeah. Real Nice Guy.

151
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,260
I've never seen him at the store see
there. I've seen him four times there.

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,040
What is his name? Uh
Fuck. I don't know. But

153
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,300
yes, there you go. He's real
nice and actually there was,

154
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:35,780
I know how many people hate this
but they had that, this class there,

155
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,140
you know that taught comedy to people
or stuff like that and he actually was

156
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,570
making an appearance to do like a speech
was the last time I saw him there.

157
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,020
Right. You were taking the class?
No, I was just out smoking. I see.

158
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,700
Were teaching the class.
I was just there hanging.

159
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,420
I don't have any problem with classes.

160
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,450
A lot of people do and they say that
the people that are teaching the classes

161
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,010
are losers and that's why the
teaching the, and they have nothing

162
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,160
really to teach. I think anything
that lets people just try it and it,

163
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,450
and some people like some sort of a
structure and that is a structure.

164
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:05,880
The structure of a classroom,
you know, you're curious.

165
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:08,130
You know you have a job you
don't like God man to try open.

166
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,190
Mike night is calling class. I'll just
sign up for that. And that's a step.

167
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,803
I think it

168
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,870
and we'll get hot. Like everyone
that comes out of it's awful. Yeah.

169
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,510
It's not like they're, they're good
comedians that have come out of it. Sure.

170
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,760
I don't, I can't remember
any of them, but like,

171
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,700
here's what I'll say that are the,

172
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,930
have the top 20 comedians of
all time gone to a comedy class?

173
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,830
No. Yeah. It's not necessary. No,
but it's not, you know, it's a start.

174
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,400
It's a start. It's any sort of,
it's any sort of a jumpstart.

175
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,990
There's something about comedy,
man, this is a very daunting,

176
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:41,410
the idea of getting up for the first time
with owning your own words and no one

177
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:44,290
helping you. Some people like, hold my
hand, hold my hand, get me on the stage.

178
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,170
You know, that's all they
need. They need, so it'll help.

179
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,650
Yeah.
So go ahead and anyhow,

180
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,190
that were sponsored by Neil
Brennan and Joe Rogan's comedy.

181
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,270
We're going to start one up
next week. You, you started
comedy later in your life.

182
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,650
Are you,

183
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,270
did you grab onto it quickly or were you
always in this scene and she was always

184
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:07,590
in, that's how I know. I've known a
old man Rogan hair for a ninth, 18,

185
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,750
19 years. Wow. Yeah, he's still work.

186
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,430
I work the door at the Boston
Comedy Club, uh, for Barry Katz.

187
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,200
I made $235 a week. Uh,
which did Barry take a cut?

188
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,320
I'm sorry man.

189
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,330
I don't know what welcome to
show business. That's a good one.

190
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:31,680
That's a really good one. Uh, so, uh,
so yeah, so I was always just around it,

191
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,950
but I was,
I don't think that I,

192
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,970
I was more like shy and retiring
and like, ah, you guys, go ahead.

193
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,340
I kid and I could never,
and I also,

194
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,600
I also judge my own desire
for attention and be like,

195
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:50,560
what a low impulse to want attention
from strangers. And then, you know,

196
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,730
and then at a certain point it was like,
I don't want attention from strangers,

197
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,930
but also I was sick of other parts of
show business telling me that I wasn't

198
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,760
funny when I was positive. I was, um, we,

199
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,490
if I'd write a script and
they'd be like, Eh, okay.

200
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,130
And then you'd go do standup person.

201
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,860
We had this exact same tone
of the conversation with
Brian Post saying yesterday

202
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:17,310
we were talking about writing and the
idea of delivering stuff to people that

203
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,550
aren't funny and they get to judge you
on whether or not it's funny and how hard

204
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,950
it is to make a fucking
TV show. It's, it's,

205
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,780
it's unbelievably hard to get past
all these people that, uh, have a say.

206
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,370
Yeah.
Well Post saying,

207
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:33,390
I thought post saying we both did
two days on the Oscars this year.

208
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,770
Yeah. The Oscar telecast
and uh, cause Jordan Ruben,

209
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,040
who's a funny dude and I've known
him forever, it was like, Hey,

210
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,730
will you come Judd sort of supervising.
So I was like, all right, Judd Apatow.

211
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,740
It was like getting judge good,
greatest due like two days.

212
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,560
We impose saying they,
we pitched stuff,

213
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,830
they use none of it.

214
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,620
And then I saw Judd like a
week later I was like, Hey,

215
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:59,380
are you doing anything with that?
Oscar's saying he's like, I don't know,

216
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,350
they send me shit but I don't know.
So it was like, oh okay. It's just,

217
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:05,350
they use Judd to like
get you in and then you,

218
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,510
and then it ended up being an atrocity.

219
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,450
The funniest part was I was
just shitting on and on Twitter,

220
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,250
just going off on it like and
do like being really funny.

221
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,030
And then it, the telecast ends and it's
like written by Neil Brown. I was like,

222
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,480
oh wait, did I just see Neil Brennan,

223
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:26,200
other guys?
It was a different time.

224
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,630
Did you have to almost a year ago, did
you have to write the fake conversation?

225
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,810
So we just try to come up completely.

226
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,500
Most of them aren't pattern.

227
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,440
Like I'm here, we're here
to like the the, the guy.

228
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,530
Well I should say literally,
I've never watched an award show ever.

229
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,700
I've been in the real man.

230
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,230
I've been in like the spike award
shows a couple of those. Right.

231
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,510
I've never watched one.

232
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,180
That's great.
I uh,

233
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,220
I almost didn't do the Oscar saying
cause I hate award show so much cause I

234
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:00,160
think they're awful. Yeah,
exactly. They're just,

235
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,010
they just make everyone that's
not their feel like shit.

236
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,060
And they encourage losers too.

237
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,570
Like you can dream and you can be here.
No you can't,

238
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,650
unless you have crazy talent,
you can't

239
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,210
be there. I don't have any
problem with that aspect of it.

240
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,710
My problem with it is first of all,

241
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,180
the idea of judging art is ridiculous
because it's so subjective and it's so

242
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:25,010
inside.
And what you get is you get the,

243
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,450
the people that judge it have so much
influence over what gets released.

244
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:31,670
Cause there's people that target
those people with their work. Yes.

245
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,900
Because they know that these type
of movies get this tied bubble.

246
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,060
That's what's funny is happening,
having

247
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,760
cast a movie and, and Ben is, and
it drives me crazy. And I even said,

248
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,920
you know what's crazy?
I see it in podcasts as well.

249
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,110
People will cast who like in movies,

250
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:50,540
they'll caste the person
from the hot TV show.

251
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,590
So if there's a movie they're like, you
know, we should get a guy from the wire.

252
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,070
And it's like, oh, what a
great idea. How do you think,

253
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,800
I remember when I was pitching,
when you pitch to direct a movie,

254
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:03,860
I directed a movie for paramount called
the goods. That pivot was in Calin.

255
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,000
I love it. Thank you very much. It's funny
people didn't see it, but um, and uh,

256
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,620
so I remember I was pitch when
you pitch to direct the movie,

257
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:17,120
you have to go like some casting ideas
and for one of the casting ideas I was

258
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,880
like, you know, it'd be great in this
part is Warren Beatty. And they're like,

259
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:23,120
that's a great idea. How did you
think of that? And it's like,

260
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,450
I watched the movies and I
saw Warren Beatty like that.

261
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,340
But that's an idea. You
know what I mean? It's like,

262
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:35,210
it's a fucking sheet of paper and
it's like he's good, he's not good.

263
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,310
But the idea that they,
they go like,

264
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,980
we got to get the guy from the wire or
we got to get the guy from the office,

265
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:41,630
like everyone from the office.

266
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,740
Then they're the only people
in comedy with value is like,

267
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,340
cause they're the critically
acclaimed show. Uh, that,

268
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,290
and then people can't even see where
they're like, oh, Tina's a great, Tina's.

269
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,850
Tina is really funny.
But they're like,

270
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,230
Tina's amazing all that pail and stuff
that she wrote. She didn't write it.

271
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:05,080
Seth wrote it. Seth Myers wrote it
like, but the idea that you can't, uh,

272
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,370
it just becomes like, did you,
if someone said to me today,

273
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:12,080
did you see what trace at what Tina
said about Tracy? Yeah, it was fine.

274
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,310
Like condemning Tracy,
but these people just get such a markup,

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,410
uh, which you've probably
never gotten. I would get a,

276
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,560
during Chappelle show was like,
what's next?

277
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,290
W what do you mean by a markup? You get
like, you get upgraded automatically.

278
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:31,970
Like everything, my ideas are
better because of, because of that,

279
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,310
just automatically. Yes, I agree with you.

280
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,820
I agree with you about like the office
and every Steve Carell movie has to be

281
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:41,710
brilliant and he's always hilarious.
That's why I like no name actors. Like,

282
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:45,920
remember when we first saw
it, what 300? Like, like all
these actors are like, yeah,

283
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,640
yeah. Like brand new to you. I hate
that dude. No. Yeah, I know, but still,

284
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:52,040
it's the fuck out of me now. I'm sure
he's a great guy. I don't hate them.

285
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:56,330
I'm just saying every time I see him
at some fucking stupid Jennifer Aniston

286
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:00,470
movie he did goofy smack
of is les is his lips.

287
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:05,240
How fucked up here Elliot to from
Super Eight, uh, he's brand new kid.

288
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:06,740
Never been been in a movie already.

289
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:09,710
Can tell that kid is going to be in
movies now and there's like a bunch of

290
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:13,430
actors do man. Well. Yeah,
it's funny like what they,

291
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,500
you do good work or personal
work and then they'll go, um,

292
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,320
like I always used to say to Chappelle
and most def after we do a sketch,

293
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,270
I'd be like, fellas,
it was a great sketch.

294
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,780
Hollywood called and they
want you to play cops. Like,

295
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,040
like Hollywood calls and then you're
fucking upgraded into some shit.

296
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,330
You didn't want the first place,

297
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:37,040
but you're so award shows and shit
like he and entertainment tonight,

298
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,640
it's good for your career. You should
do it, but it, yeah, but it, it,

299
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,080
it trains you to,

300
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:46,580
it brainwashes you into thinking like
that Hollywood is valuable and you just

301
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:50,960
fucking walk like a Zombie toward dollars
and get like, where do I stand here?

302
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,200
We'll then Hollywood pussy. And that's
when, that's when the game changes.

303
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,660
That's when it does become valuable.
You know,

304
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,170
when you go into a club and everybody
goes fucking, you ever seen chocolate,

305
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:03,980
Dell and the club? Yeah. I like kind of
months ago I saw, I've seen chocolate,

306
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,670
Dylan, the club you when you see
that level of fame, you know,

307
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,420
and you'll talk with Delta MMA fighter.

308
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,700
That's what's funny is I
would mean nothing to me.

309
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,260
Like you're not a young horse.
It could be chocolate dough.

310
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,500
Are you tracking with that? Yes.
Uh, do young horse go crazy?

311
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,800
Cause I wouldn't even think
girls would know an MMA guy.

312
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,950
Delirious MMA loop. I
know you're, you're the

313
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,640
exact opposite but I'm not,
I'm not for it against it.

314
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:35,630
I just am out of it.

315
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,640
Huge percentage of girls know who those
guys are. Huge. It's a big percentage.

316
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,240
You're also in that road also and like,

317
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,160
like my girlfriend doesn't know who any
of these people are in either did the

318
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,140
prior or the prior.
Like none of them did.

319
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,040
Like he ha there a point
and those are the girls that

320
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,960
are willing to fuck you. I mean the
level of broad, we're talking about it.

321
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,010
I mean the real trash, there's not
many girls that Lashi and tired. Easy.

322
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,540
The human flashlights. Go ahead.
There's definitely a huge, huge,

323
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,530
a bigger percentage of
male. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

324
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,530
My point is the reason why these guys,

325
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:10,830
once they get into movies and they get
big and then they start going to clubs

326
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:14,910
and it's just fucking calling the winner
circle where it's just like everyone's

327
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,570
during the winter, like
literally you, I it's like, it's,

328
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,720
remember the Eddie Murphy sketch where
they're like silly negro when he dresses

329
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:24,450
up like a white guy and uh,
and he,

330
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,770
he like the world turns around and like
he gets a bank loan and all that, um,

331
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,540
immediately because he's white. Uh,
and, and the banker goes up a black,

332
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,660
he had just turned down a black guy
and he goes, silly Negro. Anyway,

333
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:39,180
how much money you need. We got to any
just starts throwing money at Eddie.

334
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,660
Why Daddy? That's what it's
like to like be successful.

335
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,700
They like the old rules don't apply.

336
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,950
I remember going to shows with
Chappelle and people and they,

337
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,550
and or pin and they, people literally
don't, they don't ask for tickets.

338
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,960
They don't, it's like you do
whatever you want, walk right in.

339
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,600
Do you can't, this is a legit,
it's fine. Yeah, come on.
You're good. You're good. Oh,

340
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,470
you're good. It's fascinating stuff. Uh,
Vegas, it's the craziest, well, yeah,

341
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,290
exactly. I've been to Vegas with him
and a couple of times and, and uh,

342
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,650
it really is like one time the best me
and pivot we were doing when we were

343
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,880
doing the goods.
Uh,

344
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:21,500
we went out for a fight for,
um,

345
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,170
I think it was Ricky Hatton
and a Floyd Mayweather,

346
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:29,780
which is a hilarious fight mostly because
all the Ricky Hatton fans like booed

347
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:33,360
the national anthem. It was like
hilarious. It's like movie funny,

348
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,330
like with like doing, filling this shit
where they're building the national land.

349
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,890
They brought like a kettle drum
and it was awesome. Uh, so we were,

350
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:45,120
we flew private, which is also
great. Um, and when you fly private,

351
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:48,840
you're like in a, it's basically
like going to a rental car place, uh,

352
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,170
where they don't really say like, you have
to line up and you just, they just got,

353
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:55,020
oh, what's your wind number? And
you go, SJ, whatever. They go, yeah,

354
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,940
the planes out there.
So they're like, yeah,

355
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:00,240
the plants out me and pivot or killing
time, just kind of fucking around.

356
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,060
And then we're like, we should go
into the plant. We get on the plane.

357
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,570
Sly Stallone has been waiting for us.
Yeah.

358
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,460
So that's Chalan it's been
waiting for us so that they can,

359
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:14,461
it was like the planet Hollywood jet a
and we ended up going flying to a fight

360
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,750
in Vegas. Hollywood has a jet, uh,

361
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,430
just because they were like
falling apart at one point in time.

362
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,130
This was before they, I don't know. I, and
maybe they just charged out of casinos.

363
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,820
Flies. Jet? Yeah. I don't know. Oh
yeah. No, it was to go to the casino.

364
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,800
So the casino is sending you guys out for
what? For an event or sending? It was,

365
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,180
it was getting sly and then
they were like, and get pivot.

366
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,620
Was there an event or something?
It was the fight. Oh, the fight.

367
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,750
So they were flying you in
for the fight? Uh, yeah.

368
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:48,200
I guess there were
flying sly in and then we

369
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,990
hopped a Rut. So I get upset at you now.
He was. He was, he was real cool about it.

370
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,610
He's a funny dude. I met him once. Very
nice to talk to him. That's funny. Yeah,

371
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,110
he's very good. He, the thing,

372
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,520
the great thing about him is he
understands who he is to people.

373
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,840
He doesn't, I mean he'll go like, hey,
I'm a rocky. Yeah. Instead of like, hey,

374
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:11,500
that was a long time ago and like he
understands like he knows what anecdotes

375
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,800
people want to hear and shit.
Like he seems very genuinely friendly too.

376
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,840
Yes and happy. Yeah. Fun. Yeah.

377
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,460
A really enjoyable guy to look up.

378
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,540
You're going to fly in a private jet
deal with slide 64 and fucking shredded

379
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,300
cocoa butter.
Does he smell like cocoa butter?

380
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,620
It seems like it would smell like
a cocoa butter because Kendra car,

381
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,880
he doesn't not smell like cocoa butter.
All right. I wouldn't rule it out.

382
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,080
The bouquet,

383
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,910
he's what I call our
canary in a coal mine.

384
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,130
We'd never seen a 64 year
old looked like that before.

385
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,710
Yeah. Who knows how like his
face looks like meat art,

386
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,110
like strips of meat,

387
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,570
combine like bacon forehead.
And like,

388
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,750
that's a great way to put it. It really
is like his nose was made of like mutton.

389
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,830
Well,
there's certainly something

390
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,900
then going on with his forehead. There's
been times when it was shiny and mobile,

391
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,220
which always disturbs the fuck out of
me when I see is that guy you think that

392
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:08,050
takes g h a botox?

393
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,630
Right? Okay. Yeah. Uh, surgery and Botox.

394
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,670
What do you into these days?
What's your

395
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,610
okay, my cocktail. Yeah. I go to,
I've described it on the podcast,

396
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:18,600
but so in brevity,

397
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,070
I go to a hormone replacement therapist
and what they do is they look at your

398
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:25,530
hormone levels and they,
first of all,

399
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:29,400
they give you vitamins and adjust
your nutrition. That's the first step.

400
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,720
How often do you go?

401
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,740
Every couple of months I get blood work
done and then go and have all my stuff

402
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:39,030
checked. And once you will, they adjust
it as much as they can with nutrition,

403
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:43,350
which can make a huge difference. Uh,
especially, uh, eating shitty food.

404
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:45,810
You'd be amazed at how much
that lowers your testosterone,

405
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:50,010
lowers your human growth hormone. Yeah.
You shitty died. I'm V incredibly bad.

406
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,350
Are you? Yeah. And then, um,

407
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,070
once he adjusts you enough with nutrients,

408
00:22:56,071 --> 00:23:01,071
then they give you a very small levels
of human growth hormone and testosterone.

409
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,490
Thyroid, I have hypothyroidism. So it was
taking thyroid medication before this.

410
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,350
And all it does is it basically brings
your home levels up to a healthy man of

411
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:13,200
like 25 to 30 years old. And
as you get older, you know,

412
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:17,280
your body just stops producing hormones.
It's a, it's really simple. It's,

413
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,260
and it's preparing you
for death basically.

414
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,450
And you can either choose to accept that
and just let your body slowly kind of

415
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:27,270
deteriorate.
Or you can replace the hormone.

416
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,780
I honestly want to do that. It's
a, sorry, can I see it as like a,

417
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,940
it's, it's a, it's a health move. It
affects so many aspects of your life.

418
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:42,840
Any side of it. I have there been any
side effects? Weakens your bones? No, no,

419
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,940
no.
You were so with what

420
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,820
I heard, he's so good. Was it that or is
it that or lip something with the liver?

421
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:52,700
It's one of the two. No, no, no, no,
no. It was steroids can give you liver,

422
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:54,990
but those are oral down. This
stuff is oral, oral. This,

423
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,220
the deliver stuff is the stuff that
your liver has to process cause you're

424
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:01,880
eating it for the most part. One of
the side effects is having a podcast.

425
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,800
Go ahead. Yes, that's number one. Well
if you, the side effects come from abuse.

426
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,590
The side effects of all performance
enhancing drugs come from abuse.

427
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,820
If steroids and performance enhancing
drugs were as dangerous as they said,

428
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,460
people would be dropping in the
fucking streets. Right. You know,

429
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,190
where are the bodies when you hear
about these pro wrestlers dying,

430
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,310
it's not steroids that are killing them
and these guys were on massive doses of

431
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:26,180
steroids. It's pills for the most part,
unless it's suicide and a lot of them,

432
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,210
they're dealing with concussions and all
sorts of other stuff and a lot of them

433
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:33,560
get very depressed.
But the abuse is what's really dangerous.

434
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:36,770
As long as you're going to a doctor and
as long as you're eating really healthy

435
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,850
and monitoring your nutrients,
you got to,

436
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:42,350
you got to give your body the tools
to repair itself. It's so important.

437
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,160
So many people don't eat any fucking
vegetables. They don't eat shit.

438
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,070
And this is why Brock Lesnar,
who was the UFC heavyweight champion,

439
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,640
he had diverticulitis
because of his bad diet.

440
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,600
He had a diet where he would only eat
meat, he would eat steaks. Diverticulitis.

441
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,220
Diverticulitis is it's,

442
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,610
you have basically a protein gets stuck
in your gut and it starts creating

443
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,450
abscesses and it can, you know, eat
a hole through your fucking stomach.

444
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,980
And with him,

445
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:14,390
it got so bad that he almost
died get hospitalized.

446
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,640
They thought they were going to have
to give him surgery on it and then they

447
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,460
decided that they didn't.
But then because of all his training,

448
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:22,160
when he's training, it starts to flare
up again because once you have it,

449
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,660
apparently it can recur. So they had to
remove 12 inches of his fucking colon,

450
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,620
oof, 12 inches of his colon. This is
all diet related. You know his case,

451
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:32,890
they used it for Stallone's face.

452
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,170
I knew you were going there a call back,

453
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,490
but this guy's diet was so,
it's fucked them up so bad.

454
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,910
And some people are absolutely correct
that it's not always diet related.

455
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:47,390
Doing so when he pointed this out that
you can, it can be a congenital thing,

456
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,270
but it wasn't in his case.
In his case it was,

457
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,620
and he didn't eat any fucking vegetables.
He didn't eat broccoli.

458
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,980
You didn't need any fiber. You've got to
clean your system out. So for me, it's it,

459
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,530
it does, first of all, it
helps your immune system. It
keeps you from getting sick.

460
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,780
It helps you recover from things you know,

461
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:06,410
and when you're doing it correctly and
properly with the right nutrients and

462
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,450
very low levels,
everything has a very low level.

463
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:11,330
You can't get crazy with anything
when you're doing it. It helps you.

464
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:14,510
You feel better, you have more energy,
you feel like you enjoy life more,

465
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,400
you're happier. You know,
it's, it's so simple.

466
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,880
It's like the reason why people are old
and cranky as cause they're tired as

467
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:23,390
fuck. Okay. Their bodies stop
producing hormones and that's not good.

468
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,280
It may hate at all.

469
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:29,960
Ethnic groups is the first thing that
happens. Sure. You get cranky, you can't,

470
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:32,430
you just use that new, but it's
people's dead or something. Know what,

471
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,310
like it just seems mover, right? No,

472
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,160
but there is negative side
effects to it. Right? Well look,

473
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,350
there's not enough people doing it
for them to have real studies. Right.

474
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,160
Are you constantly

475
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,230
monitoring all this?
Because that is pretty hard.

476
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:50,820
Quarterly I would be like on
Twitter every day. Like, look,

477
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,010
people have been substituting
hormones forever.

478
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,850
I mean thyroid medication has been
around forever and people have been doing

479
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:57,300
that forever.

480
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,630
This is not that much difference between
substituting your thyroid hormones are

481
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:02,520
substituting pituitary hormone gland.

482
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,240
You know what I'm doing is that deer
antler spray, you know that that helps.

483
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:11,040
Supposedly spray can put supposedly
pumps up your HGH levels.

484
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,560
Uh, I, and I find that if I just jog or
even a couple of miles, you can get it.

485
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:20,190
You can order it online is,
it was, it tastes light a,
it tastes kind of delicious.

486
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,193
It doesn't taste bad.

487
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,430
It's because there's some
controversy whether or not it works.

488
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:24,570
A lot of football players use it,

489
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,110
but some people do believe that it
does work maybe in small levels.

490
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,310
But that's been actually I just find
like when I exercise they can recover

491
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,620
quicker. Really? Yeah. You really
feel a difference that much.

492
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,800
It's funny cause I stopped doing
it for awhile and then I was like,

493
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,940
why am I sore?
And it was because I,

494
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,830
I mean I at least empirically
that was the, it's you know,

495
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,960
it's right now it's at a stage where it's,

496
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,990
there's a lot of experimental shit going
on with hormone replacement therapy.

497
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:51,750
I mean obviously it wasn't around for
our parents is this generation is the

498
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,390
first generation. It's sort of
experimenting with things like that.

499
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,540
You and I are really at the avant garde
of that. They were on the edge, bro.

500
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,050
Gotti canaries in the room.

501
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,970
I said, what do you,
what do you, how do you,

502
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,640
what does it do to you physically
doing that? You feel much better.

503
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,440
You feel healthy, you
recover better. I mean,

504
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,770
I've always been a guy who exercise
and I've always been in shape,

505
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:17,940
so I never really let myself get to a
position where I ever got frail or got out

506
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:18,600
of shape.

507
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,560
I should have adjusted along the way as
I realized that I was getting older and

508
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:25,320
then I wasn't recovering as fast as
I was starting to get injured more.

509
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,950
Then I started looking into it and
so for the past like five, six years,

510
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,560
I've been doing it. Great,
and you do it. Like I said,

511
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,320
as long as you're doing it with low
levels and you're sitting margins on it.

512
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,430
Yeah. It doesn't sound cheap. Less
expensive. No, not really. No.

513
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,290
As it scales out, it's not. I mean,

514
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,020
you can get some fucking shit
from China that's not as,

515
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,390
I wouldn't fuck around with that shit.
That's what it was.

516
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,700
My point was that what is basically
is this low level genetic engineering.

517
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:55,140
It's just the tip of it and what we're
going to see over the next decade is some

518
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,320
shit that's going to blow this completely
the fuck out of one worst fear with

519
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:02,530
this stuff. With, with taking this look
your worst fear period, his death. Um,

520
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,503
you know,
but yeah,

521
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,770
I believe that if you're taking care
of yourself and you're watching your,

522
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:09,760
your blood levels and you're
reasonably safe, you know,

523
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,110
as long as you're doing it with
a good doctor and you know what,

524
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,830
what the risks are and you know what
the levels that you're taking on and you

525
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,330
don't get crazy,
that's a lot of people get crazy.

526
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,570
And this is some things when you
see like a guy who's a bodybuilder,

527
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:24,000
you see like some big giant
guy was giant muscles.

528
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:27,750
There's only one way to get those fucking
muscles. Okay. I mean, hard work. Yeah.

529
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,700
You've got to take monstrous levels of
shit where you get to put your body into

530
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:37,650
a state that's completely unnatural
and that's when things start firing.

531
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,020
It's like having a computer
and overclocking and hey man,

532
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,100
I got a seller on 301 clock,

533
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,940
this bitch up to four 75. I got these
coolers. Yeah. How long does that last?

534
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:49,480
Those fucking things. They'd
go out, you know, it blows
out. And that's exactly the,

535
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:53,320
like the human body. But if you're a
smart and just keep it within levels,

536
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:56,950
you know, long as you keep
it within healthy levels,
nothing hyper, nothing crazy.

537
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,240
It was a lot of science behind it.

538
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,060
There's a lot of studies behind it
that show and there's a lot of really

539
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:05,200
intelligent doctors that do do it to
themselves and one of them happens to be a

540
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:09,130
very good friend of mine who, uh, has
been in this business for a while and he,

541
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,240
you know,
he's very,

542
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:14,710
very well versed on all the pros and
cons of hormone replacement therapy.

543
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:17,890
And in his point is always the
best. He's like, he's like, okay,

544
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,350
here's what's going to happen. If you
don't take it, you're going to get old.

545
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,050
You're going to die. He goes, you're
probably going to die if you take it too.

546
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,150
But you're going to enjoy that time more.

547
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,910
You're going enjoy that time where
you're gonna enjoy your body more. Yeah.

548
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,040
I enjoy my body too. You really,
I'm really and turn the lights down.

549
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,620
I got a huge kick out
of my own human body.

550
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,560
What's your take on his wiener character
pulling his cock out and taking

551
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,280
pictures. Here it is. Uh, don't,

552
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,420
if you're a guy,
don't take a picture of your cock.

553
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,450
Nobody because a girl doesn't
really want to see it.

554
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,120
Girls want to see like,

555
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,060
maybe they might want
to see your ass like,

556
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,870
but more than anything they want to see
like girls need their aesthetics that

557
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:01,560
they need like lighting and fucking
shadow. You know what girls want to say.

558
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:03,600
They want to see that, that muscle. Sure.

559
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,220
You know the name of the
muscle where it like,

560
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:09,650
it looks like your lower abdominal
area heading in your cock.

561
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,630
The ramp,
the ramp,

562
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,240
the garage door and give him the ramp
abs. Uh, they want abs. I want Rep.

563
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,240
They don't want caulk. All right.
So that I would say, don't do it.

564
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,120
Don't ever just be like, oh, sorry
baby, I got to go to sleep or whatever.

565
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,000
A friend of mine, Jack, go ahead.

566
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:27,571
Sorry.

567
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,360
I have to interrupt because a friend of
mine is married and he's a great guy and

568
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:34,290
he doesn't cheat on his wife.
He's a comic. And, um, uh,

569
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,090
this girl send them an email,
oh, you're so hilarious.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

570
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,950
I will, I would love to take you for
a ride, you know, lol. And so he,

571
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:48,600
uh, emails back like, Hey, um,
uh, that's very nice, but a,

572
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:52,260
I'm married, thanks. And so then
she starts saying, oh, well,

573
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,500
I totally understand and I think that's
really awesome and you're married and

574
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:59,730
you know, and I, I totally,
completely respect that. And then, uh,

575
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,920
well you're hilarious. Anyway, send.

576
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,510
So then an email comes a minute later
and it's her and her lingerie, lol.

577
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,150
I totally fucked up and sent you this.
Oh my God,

578
00:32:09,151 --> 00:32:12,330
I'm so sorry this sending this.

579
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,560
So then he sends it back.
Well, no, no harm done.

580
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,760
Then she sends him pictures of her
fingers, health. So then it's like,

581
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,370
and then she's like, come on, I
want to see your big fat cock.

582
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:27,330
Send me a picture of big fat cock at
this point. I'm like, that's it, dude.

583
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,560
Okay. That's a fucking dude. There's
a dude who's trying to do that.

584
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,240
You're getting trolled.
You just went Boston and a fucking dude

585
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,560
fucking queer.
He's got his cock in his hand.

586
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,000
The probably a bit and the other dude,

587
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,440
I will like you. You Go,
you're getting trolled son.

588
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:47,310
There's a guy who's trying to get a
photo of this comedian's Dick for sure

589
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,290
going on here. That's why 90%
of the time I send fake photos.

590
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,800
That's what I was going to say. I,
I what I, what you do with fellows,

591
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:57,290
if you're really have to take a
picture of go get a play girl,

592
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,790
take a picture of a cock in the playgirl,
send it. And then with the caption,

593
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,860
mine is similar to this.

594
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,450
Send her the blackest one you can
design and say picture one liked this,

595
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,510
but white and maybe not quite as,

596
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,810
not quite as big,
not quite as bad with better credit folks

597
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,970
did. It will be quiet in a movie. My
Cock. We'll be quiet in a movie theater.

598
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,550
So did you,
you didn't enjoy the half movie?

599
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,280
Didn't I did enjoy it. Uh,
not really. Cause you know,
where'd you get this segue?

600
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,550
We, well I wanted to bring that up. It's
one of my favorite movies. He didn't,

601
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:40,970
he didn't even enjoy it. I didn't hear if
you should direct it. What did you know?

602
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:45,350
I didn't Roni and Chappelle, Rhoda
and um, uh, yeah, it was just,

603
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:50,351
we were both like young and we didn't
really understand like we should have

604
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:54,320
rewritten it more. We kind got way
late in term, the whole process.

605
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:56,420
We just got way late.
Like here's who is going to be in it.

606
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,910
Here's your starting
now here's the director.

607
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,740
And we didn't know till we didn't know
what to stand in time move like we didn't

608
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:08,420
know like to say what
fight to fight and uh,

609
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,150
and so it just ended up being,
there's parts of it I like,

610
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:16,151
but for the most part it just sort of
like didn't end up the way I'd hoped her

611
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,410
day. David hoped. I think. And maybe
you might not have got what you wanted,

612
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:25,770
but what you got was awesome.
Oh yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:30,470
I mean people, I mean it got
demolished at the box office,

614
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:33,820
but having said that, we
opened against titanic. Yeah.

615
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,630
We opened against types Hanoch
golden eye and goodwill hunting.

616
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,620
Wow. Holy Shit. Haneke titanic

617
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,510
three asked me this or
quite answered me this.

618
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,610
Who the fuck is still going to see
James Bond movies? Zero more suspense,

619
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:55,611
less boring fucking series of movies
where you have nothing invested in it.

620
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,100
I couldn't give a shit and this
new guy looks pretty bad ass

621
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,460
standard credit guy. You would like
the first or second new one with him?

622
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,780
I don't know. It's pretty bad. Do
you like the Bourne movies? No.

623
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah. One guy kicking everybody's
ass like that. I'm like, shut up.

624
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:12,870
Somebody grabbed that dude.

625
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,860
It's to me it's like someone playing
guitar and a movie and they don't really

626
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:19,080
know how to play guitar. Write.
That shit drives me crazy.

627
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:23,040
I have a very hard time watching a movie
where one guy is doing all this crazy

628
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:27,240
Kung Fu badass shit where I'm
like, stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

629
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,300
Which just drives me nuts. This guy
took on 10 people. No, they would.

630
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,130
They would grab him.
That's not how people fight.

631
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,050
They don't stand around you
like a retard wagon train. Yeah.

632
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,220
He fucking dive on you at once.
Somebody

633
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,031
grabs your legs,

634
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,760
they'd kick you in the fucking head
and then your unconscious and then they

635
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:44,910
raped them and kill you.
That's why you make short films.

636
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,410
You make very short action. Action
films are 15 minutes long. It's a guy,

637
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,890
he thinks he's a bad ass. They break in
the warehouse, they fucking hold him down.

638
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,120
They shoot him in the
face and that's the end.

639
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,440
And that's the end of the bureau credit.

640
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,990
And they just learn you've lost a
lot of money making these minutes.

641
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,090
They're real.
What people want is real.

642
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:06,090
She tell you what you today you'd
deliver them on the Internet.

643
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,720
Very cheap to film with the CGI
that's available on your Imac.

644
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,910
You could pull it off.
You're the Joe Rogan action film.

645
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,570
So I'm fucking serious, man.
Simple. I it was that move.

646
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,780
What does it final cut pro tools and

647
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,640
what you're talking about
is those like those, uh,

648
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,030
the dude who the punch out videos.
What's his name?

649
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:31,900
The black dude who tried
to Kimbo Kimbo videos? No,

650
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,560
not entirely. With maybe a giant.
Yeah. With like a soundtrack,

651
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,860
getting chased by a giant penis.
They Chase Kimbo and then he punched him.

652
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,440
I've never been one for trying to come
up with movie ideas, that very reason.

653
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,980
So that was your first movie.
You did that.

654
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,130
And then I wrote a couple of scripts
in between there that didn't get made,

655
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:54,810
and that was, I sold them,
but they didn't get made.

656
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:57,840
And then that was the period
where I was like, why am I,

657
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,340
it just was making me a little crazy.

658
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:02,460
That's when I started doing
standup a little bit. Um, the,

659
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,850
but I remember when people, if for an
idea of how stupid showbiz this is,

660
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,520
me and a buddy of mine used to,
we're pitching a movie in 99,

661
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,890
2000 and they were like, who do you
want to be in it? And we were like, oh,

662
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,430
Dave Chappelle welfare
on, they were like, uh,

663
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,260
how about Tom Green
and Orlando Jones slow?

664
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,230
And they were dead serious. That's that
like heat game that I was talking about.

665
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:29,010
It's like Rob Greene was hot firm and
as a comedy where you're like, yeah,

666
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:31,320
I think will Ferrel's way funny.
Even Tom Green,

667
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:34,530
like Tom Green's a stunt and they're
like, what are you talking about? Stunt.

668
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,890
They don't even understand what
they're looking at, but they just go,

669
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:42,600
there is a lot of commotion over
here. Right. We got to get it.

670
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,460
But they don't understand like,
yeah,

671
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:48,510
but to be that it takes some
other shit and then obviously, uh,

672
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,580
will and Dave proved to be the, the, um,
in the long, the long money was on them.

673
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,550
Oh, for sure. I think Tom Green,
if he's very misunderstood,

674
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,000
I think if you watch his, uh,
that movie Freddy got fingered.

675
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,250
I think that's a good fucking movie.
I haven't seen a rock.

676
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:05,680
Chris Rock loves that movie. I've
never seen. It's fucking hilarious.

677
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,610
It's hilarious and crazy and that
gross. That's really who he is. I mean,

678
00:38:09,611 --> 00:38:12,490
he's just as Nutty, dude. I mean, I
know he's getting a bit of an anarchist,

679
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,270
so like you look at his show that show
that he did on fucking basic cable and

680
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:18,370
Canada and then look at his
show that he did on MTV.

681
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,690
I think he's fucking hilarious. He's
a, yeah, no, he is absolutely fine.

682
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,230
Not Utilized correctly, which is
why he decided to do his own thing,

683
00:38:26,231 --> 00:38:30,790
that web show. But the web showed to me
sort of became like the tonight show.

684
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:30,941
Yeah.

685
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:35,850
He was trying to make it into something
that was like really like he should just

686
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,660
try not to swear. And you know, at one
point, and he was, he's Carson in. Yeah.

687
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:43,250
It was like, it was going,
it was just a different mode.

688
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,100
Scaling shut down would have been the way
to go. But he, he tried to keep it like,

689
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:51,940
hey, big production. It's like, dude, it's
the tried to do it. Like everybody else,

690
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:55,240
there was a desk in a tie
or a suit rather, you know,

691
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,890
it was like the whole thing was set up
like imitating all these ones that were

692
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:04,810
under the confines of broadcast television
and other people's opinions and input.

693
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,140
And now here you have this thing
where you have no confines.

694
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:10,300
No one's telling you what to do.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

695
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,620
You're just going to imitate whatever
all these old schools Steve Allen guys

696
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:18,880
have done before. You can seem silly
to me. Uh, it seems silly to a lot of,

697
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:22,570
it's not what he is. You know what he
is? That's funny is Freddy got fingered.

698
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:26,260
It's fucking a dead Moose on the
side of the highway. You know?

699
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,380
Remember they got stand up now. I haven't
seen it, but it's pretty good. I heard,

700
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,720
I heard he's doing well. He's
doing well. You know, and it's,

701
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,860
it's always interesting when someone,

702
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,810
so 39 years old or whatever the fuck
they are when we tried to do stand up for

703
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:39,310
the first time.
It's kind of weird when you,

704
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,050
and you're already famous
like Charlie Murphy. I've,

705
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,570
I went on that big maxim tour with
Charlie. Mark did. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

706
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:51,160
We meet him and John Heffron toward the
country. We did like 22 gigs together,

707
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,200
theaters and shit.
And you know,

708
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:58,120
Charlie fucking was 40 something years
old before he ever did standup comedy.

709
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:03,330
And he was famous as fuck before and
offered his hand one of the best up,

710
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:06,840
some hostile of all time. Huge movie
star. I mean his little brother pressure.

711
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,630
Yeah. The pressure on him, his fucking
tremendous. And through the roof.

712
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,160
And all of a sudden this guy goes from
being on this TV show to a year into

713
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:19,180
standup comedy. Not even, I think
nine months. He's headlining,

714
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,500
headlining and doing theaters.
These got to do 50 minutes. Yeah.

715
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,910
It's fucking crazy. Yeah. Yeah.
Ridiculous. Really hard to, it's hard.

716
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,380
It's the worst way to do whatever.

717
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,800
It's like what I always said about Brock
Lesnar fighting in the UFC. You know,

718
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:34,510
when Brooklyn's their first
started fighting the UFC,

719
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:37,750
he went immediately and fought the former
champion and his first fight that he's

720
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:40,840
fighting heath herring. He's fine. He's
fighting nothing but killers right away.

721
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,030
And I'm like, you know,
yeah, he can do that.

722
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,440
But you know what's the best way to do it?

723
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,230
The best way to do it is to come up
through the fucking ranks of the smaller

724
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:51,520
shows. Get less money.
That's what I, when I was,

725
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,830
when I started doing standup again,
like people were like,

726
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,210
you should go out and did it.
And I was like,

727
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,170
I don't have the time and I don't
want to rip people off. Good for you.

728
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,150
Now I've got the time and
you're ready to rip people off.

729
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:07,450
You can really rip some bump people off.
I need money.

730
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:13,030
Yeah, no, I, I need this so bad. So you
weren't doing standup when you were,

731
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,610
uh, one of the, when you were the
producer of the Chappelle show,

732
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:19,420
you weren't doing standup then job's
the creator and Co Creator and writer,

733
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:23,560
whatever you were the grand poobah
of the Chappelle show. Grand Poobah,

734
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,620
the Cro Grand Poobah you weren't
doing comedy at that time? Mm.

735
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,030
A little by little. I mean, you
can when you have a TV show,

736
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,250
because I didn't know of you as a
comic. No, I know one, no one did.

737
00:41:34,251 --> 00:41:38,330
The people are barely
starting to get on board now.

738
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,440
I remember when I did it,

739
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:42,770
the first time I did it was that we
were just walking down the street.

740
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,130
We ran into Dave, he had a
mustache on. He's like, hey Joe,

741
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:49,340
you want to be on my TV show? The
show wasn't even, didn't even exist.

742
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:54,130
And bobcat Goldthwait was with direct.
And then it's like, what am I going to go?

743
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,960
I only have like a half an hour.
He's like, okay, just hold this box.

744
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,080
And we went out and
wandered around and uh,

745
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,640
he gave me boobs. Yeah, we had
this ridiculous fucking donkey.

746
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:08,540
Kong was totally forgot you were in.
And then the second time I did it,

747
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,540
I did it with you was when we did the
fear factor. I was actually at the,

748
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,380
at the bath. The one your
boobs on the bobcat one. Yeah.

749
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,260
I didn't remember seeing you
though. But I remember. But anyway,

750
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:21,260
my point was that I just knew
you as Neil, you know, I didn't,

751
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,620
I didn't really know what your
Gig in life was. You know?

752
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:27,240
I knew that you worked at the
Boston comedy club and yeah,

753
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,370
and I would also like to note that you
are always a really good dude when you

754
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:34,670
didn't,
when I didn't have credits,

755
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,380
you were almost exactly, you are exactly
like you are like, you weren't like,

756
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,210
you're not, you're not one of
these like you come on in. Oh God,

757
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,080
you're not a star fucker.
You're not, uh, uh,

758
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,030
credit fucker unless it's struggle very
hard to be the exact opposite. Well, no,

759
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:51,250
but I,
that's what's,

760
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,150
I think that's where you live is a
testament to that in this shithole.

761
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,800
No law. No. He just lived in the
middle of nowhere. And by the way,

762
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:03,680
I'm too close to people if I
could. I mean, I lived in, uh,

763
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,700
talked about this yesterday.

764
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,940
I lived in the mountains of Colorado
for four months. Did you not swear?

765
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:11,570
I wanted to live last year till my dog
got eaten by a mountain lion and my wife

766
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:14,380
got pregnant and because my wife
was pregnant by the mountain lions,

767
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,220
the altos fee, it was a crazy
week for the mass crimes trees.

768
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,880
I'm in denial. It was Joe's worst
week, the mountain lions, best week I,

769
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,610
but my instinct is
still live in the woods.

770
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,840
I mean that's where I really would like
to live as far away from. So I mean,

771
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:34,700
I'm not much on Hollywood than a,
an opportunity to make money.

772
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,040
Yeah. And I'm sure you liked doing
stand up. I love doing standing. Yeah.

773
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,990
But I love doing standup
because it's not Hollywood man.

774
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,690
When I was in Vancouver this
weekend, that's, I'm in Vancouver,

775
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:46,400
you know what I'm saying?
There's nothing Hollywood about that.

776
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,820
It was just me and a bunch of cool people
in Vancouver and we're having a party

777
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,720
and you know, I'm telling
jokes and everyone's laughing
and it's great time. Oh,

778
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,470
you did a show where you did
the stand up and then I did, uh,

779
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,730
well I did two nights of stand up.
I did one at the vogue tier.

780
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,590
It was fucking awesome.

781
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:02,990
First Time I've ever done it encore
and never did an encore before.

782
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,340
I went back out on stage. And then Ben
is that she's told a lot of jokes to do,

783
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,590
well not stolen claim their mind call
or something I served George Carlin do

784
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,130
once. I don't, I, I let people
know. So I did, I did, uh,

785
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,580
that and then the next
night I did the comedy mix,

786
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:22,580
which was used to be Yuk
yuks which is the shit.

787
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,050
It's Vancouver is a fucking amazing.
I was up there for a while. One time,

788
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:29,990
and I'm going to go back cause I'm
starting to do now that I'm starting to go

789
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:32,160
out and rip people off. Uh, none

790
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,570
of the club, first of all, what
the clubs pay is a slave wage.

791
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,070
Like what comedy clubs pay to have someone
come in for the weekend is like what?

792
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,880
Well, if you haven't been there, this,

793
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:48,200
the only reason is it's what it is, is if
you don't draw, this is the bottom line.

794
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,510
It's if you're just coming
in for the weekend though,

795
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,380
the reality is that most clubs have a
very hard time selling tickets for an

796
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:56,840
unknown comics. So would they have to
do is they have to pay for the room.

797
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,920
So they have to give away.

798
00:44:57,921 --> 00:45:00,620
So they can't afford to give the
comic that much money. No, I get that.

799
00:45:00,621 --> 00:45:03,290
But they could, they can certainly afford
to give them more than they're given.

800
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,830
I don't know. I'm telling you man, it's
hard out there. It's hard out there.

801
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,850
And you know comics need to realize that
look with social networking and Twitter

802
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:12,170
and Facebook and all that shit,

803
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,620
you can eventually build up your
audience where you can ensure that hey,

804
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:17,870
I can ensure you that you're not going
to have to give away any tickets.

805
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:21,110
You're going to sell this place out.
And people have done that without even,

806
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,580
you know,
any television credits at all.

807
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:25,220
There's a bunch of guys who are doing
really well just on the Internet,

808
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:29,090
but you got to work at it. You can't
expect a club to just pick up the tab.

809
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,073
So when

810
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,891
back to anyone but,

811
00:45:30,891 --> 00:45:35,090
but it's first of all there's plenty of
clubs just won't headline me cause cause

812
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:37,490
I haven't done enough TV. I don't
know why. They don't know yet.

813
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,520
They would on a week
night. Yeah. No. So well,

814
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:43,260
what I'm doing is do what
I'm doing like music, venue,

815
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:47,940
shit like that and getting
most of the door. Yeah. And,

816
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,770
and I have like 63,000
followers on Twitter,

817
00:45:51,771 --> 00:45:53,510
which isn't a lot

818
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,170
grants to you. 64 by the end
of the day. How about that? No,

819
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,480
actually you'll learn an in,
you ain't tweeted,

820
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,920
well that's the name of the game is
getting celebrities to tweet you.

821
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,130
And I know a lot of celebrities.
Ooh,

822
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,650
I know what if you retweet me,
that

823
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,310
goes up.
Um,

824
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,450
so I'm hoping that the people
that follow me on Twitter, we'll,

825
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,630
you know,
get into the spirit of like this kind of,

826
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,960
we're doing it off the grid and
which is what I like about this.

827
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:25,040
I think they do too.
And people will do stuff for free,

828
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:29,270
which I think is a really cool,
like people will just, I'll like,

829
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,260
I'll say like, hey, can someone make a
picture of blog of this, of like, oh,

830
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,920
a Barack Obama with like a
teardrop tattoo after the,

831
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,950
after they've been long thing
and someone made it. This girl,

832
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:44,840
Rachel made it like in 20 minutes and a
buddy of mine works in the White House,

833
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:48,290
was writer for Obama who I met at the
correspondence dinner and he goes,

834
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:52,090
I showed it to everyone in the White
House. I go, I go, how high up did again?

835
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,120
And he goes, not as high as you
want it to, but it got a pretty wide

836
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,890
and the show to Obama I
know would appreciate it.
Yeah. Obama's only 47 years.

837
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,370
You don't think you would
have been? Oh Shit. No,

838
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:07,790
he would have thought it was funny. Oh
Shit. Oh, shut up. Let me ask you this.

839
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,640
Do you think that they really killed
those bin been logged and dumped his body

840
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:11,270
in the ocean?

841
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,120
Uh, the dumping, the body
thing, I had a funny,

842
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,470
the way they handled it was like
the classic media manipulation.

843
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:21,380
The thing that got me was the
thing to where they go, you know,

844
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:25,610
he used a woman as a human shield. That
was the first thing that they release.

845
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,320
So everyone goes that mother
fucker because America
didn't know how it going to

846
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:30,070
play her.
And at first

847
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,340
he was saying he was armed, he was
armed and it used a woman as a human.

848
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,680
Then they were like, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Like a carts says Trump.

849
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:38,350
The armed. Yeah, like a cartoon character.

850
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,040
He used a woman as a human shield and
you picture like a whore from Barney

851
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,230
Miller. Well it's apparently it was, it
wasn't him that used a woman as a shield.

852
00:47:45,231 --> 00:47:49,000
There was someone else but, but originally
that's what they said and people,

853
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,310
they know that the first story is a story
people are going to remember. Right,

854
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,860
right. And then they go, oh by the way,
he didn't use a woman as a human scale.

855
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,890
I've been telling people in the audience,
it's like if I said to you like, Hey,

856
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:01,840
I'm going to introduce
you to my buddy Bobby.

857
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,430
He said hate rate took a shit today at
Mcdonald's and you think about that for

858
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:09,820
an hour and a half. And then I got
by the way, he didn't take a shit.

859
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,970
When you meet Bobby, you're still going
to be picturing him taking a shit.

860
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,330
And it's more to me,
I think like people being accused of rape,

861
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:19,700
but there's no way to unexcused
everyone who gets accused of it.

862
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,660
You have a black flag on you forever.
Absolutely.

863
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,490
For because of one person's
decision. But I, so I think, uh,

864
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:32,350
what I think the false part
of bin Laden was just the,

865
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,690
it was a Trump,
he was a trumped up God.

866
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,720
Like he like he was a one hit wonder
nine 11 was his big hit and then the rest

867
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:44,280
of the time it was,
they just used the threat of him as a,

868
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,390
an excuse to just get more
power to the government. Um,

869
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:52,590
there's a video on youtube called the
last word on Osama bin Ladin that is so

870
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:58,321
fucking enlightening as far as like
how intertwined his family was with uh,

871
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,620
oh yeah. With the Bush administration,
they built Mecca and all that. God,

872
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,900
you guys watch the video.

873
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:09,100
It's called the last word on Osama
bin Ladin and it is so fascinating.

874
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:14,101
It's about 15 minutes long and it goes
into depth about there their there,

875
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:19,510
the families were doing business together
forever and this guy gave them visas

876
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:22,260
to leave. They got them
out of the country, out of
the country. Wouldn't mind.

877
00:49:22,261 --> 00:49:26,080
One was like al Qaeda was not the threat.

878
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:30,940
They claimed it was like since nine
11 out Kate is killed, I don't know,

879
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,950
300 civilians.

880
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,010
And my point was more people have
died at like six flags then that,

881
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,340
but yet there's like we got an in and it's
like, dude, they killed the, it's not,

882
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:45,750
there's way bigger risk and that I'm
off for like hunting them and, and,

883
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,060
and law enforcement.
The law enforcement part of it and the,

884
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,690
but the war part is like, it's,
there are a bunch of fucking,

885
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,260
there's more crips than there are
members of Alec. Well not only that,

886
00:49:56,261 --> 00:50:00,460
they're on the other side of the planet
and there's no way of disconnecting them

887
00:50:00,461 --> 00:50:03,460
and their history from the United
States and the CIA. There's not,

888
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:07,030
the mujahideen were being trained by
the United States government to fight

889
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:10,900
against the Soviet Union. I mean, that's
just a fact. The whole Jihad thing,

890
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,500
you know what Jihad used to be with the
original meaning of it in, you know,

891
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:17,950
the holy scriptures was, it was a
war against your own personal vices.

892
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,420
That was like a real jihad. What?
But we turned it into a war,

893
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,110
a holy war.
And we turned the,

894
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,220
the idea of suicide bombing
was introduced by America.

895
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,690
I mean it was our idea that we brought to
them, like you guys really got so much.

896
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,950
But, uh, there's a documentary
again on Youtube, um, called, uh,

897
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,880
the power of nightmares as a BBC thing.
Yeah.

898
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:47,460
A really good and it length like Christian
evangelicals with a extremist Islam

899
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,330
and, and how it was both born in
the 50s and sort of sprung out.

900
00:50:52,331 --> 00:50:54,220
And I'm an eligible Hari who tried to,

901
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:57,700
he was part of the people that
killed Anwar Sadat and he got,

902
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:01,600
they have footage of him in [inaudible]
79 [inaudible] in the leader of

903
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:06,040
[inaudible] and he was in jail
talking to TV. Um, but, uh,

904
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,610
but yeah, I mean, yes. Is it an American?

905
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,760
Uh,

906
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,020
I don't think it's a American backed
issue. I think a lot of it had to do with,

907
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,310
with us just dumping Afghanistan
after the Russians left.

908
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,960
And I think that created a vacuum here.
It comes to talent,

909
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,490
but there's also,
you know,

910
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:28,640
they realize how things really work
once they start dealing with America.

911
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,980
I mean that's the,
the real cold hard situation of it.

912
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,970
What's really fascinating was there was
a recent video that was released from,

913
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:39,890
someone leaked it from a Pentagon hearing
where these guys are sitting around

914
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:40,640
and it's a,

915
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,640
a doctor and a scientist is explaining
about the potential for developing

916
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,250
vaccines to uh,

917
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:53,090
to attack certain areas of the brain
that are Cree or that are related to

918
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:54,260
religious fanaticism.

919
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,920
And they were showing like activity
and different sectors of the brain.

920
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,510
They can come up with this vaccine that
could literally attack those areas and

921
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:06,860
nullify these ridiculous
a religious fanatic ideas.

922
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,890
I believe in my lifetime
there will be a thing,

923
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,920
a part of a brand like you will be able
to set your brain to override negative

924
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:19,940
impulses. I think so. I mean,
like, I don't think it's
the Scientology is about it.

925
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:21,500
Is, is it? Well, yeah,

926
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:25,190
but I'm saying like you'll be able to do
it with a pill or some sort of implant

927
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:29,780
or something where it's like it will
override shitty impulse and then it'll be

928
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:31,340
the decision. Do I want
to override it? Okay,

929
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,230
well then this becomes what is shitty.
You know,

930
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:36,750
it's objective hordes of
barbarian taken over your land.

931
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,620
It's not shitty to hit somebody
in the head with an ax.

932
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,080
You know what it's like what you gotta do.
Yeah.

933
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:41,790
Well you'll have to go
through preferences. The,

934
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,240
my next door neighbor where I used
to live, it was a nice guy. And, uh,

935
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:49,710
he was a scientologist and I
found out about the wolf. No, no,

936
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:53,280
it was sort of a bit full.
No, it was in Calabasas.

937
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,350
It was a nice guy. But, uh,

938
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,770
he was talking to me about this piece
of property that it was looking to buy,

939
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:02,070
but he couldn't because
his wife was going clear.

940
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,690
And so I go with it. What does that,
what does that mean? And he goes, well,

941
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:10,440
we're Scientologists. And then he pauses
and looks at me, I'm like, Oh fuck,

942
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,430
you know? Okay, well I want to
be as accepting as possible.
He's a nice guy. Yeah.

943
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,180
I mean, look, my other neighbor was a
Mormon and they were, they were nice too.

944
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:18,451
I mean,

945
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:21,450
I had no problem with you and your wacky
religious ideas as long as you're a

946
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,210
good neighbor.

947
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,690
And also don't try to proselytize. I
don't do what ever you want, but don't,

948
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,870
absolutely. Don't try to sell me on. And
he never did and neither did the Mormon.

949
00:53:29,871 --> 00:53:32,870
So they were all cool. Mormons are very,
they don't really, they're like Jews.

950
00:53:32,871 --> 00:53:35,270
They don't want you to
join, you know? So, um,

951
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,120
so he starts telling me that his wife's
going to be clear and it's going to cost

952
00:53:38,121 --> 00:53:43,100
$50,000. So I go $50,000. I
go, what does this entail?

953
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:48,050
He goes, well, you know, uh, basically the
work is already done. And what this is,

954
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:50,480
is sort of a confirmation
in the ceremony to, uh,

955
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:55,690
ensure that she is no longer affected
by negative energy and negative

956
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:56,480
influences.

957
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,480
And that what this does becoming clear
protects you from all negative influences

958
00:54:02,361 --> 00:54:02,991
and stimulation.

959
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:07,130
And it's actually been proven that
ceremony and then big events and even the

960
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:09,330
donation of the large sum of money to,
you know,

961
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,890
accentuate some sort of a situation
like this can actually help the results.

962
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,220
So like this guy is weird pseudo
scientific way of looking at this fucking,

963
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,580
there's a really good article.
And then from the New Yorker,

964
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:24,530
like two and a half months ago about
Paul Haggis, who's a film director.

965
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,560
But there was a really long
piece about it cause he left.

966
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,260
They're going on holiday. Yeah.
They're going after him and it's,

967
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,860
it's really personal and it's one of
those New Yorker articles. It's just like,

968
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,300
whew, this is long. But it's so worth it.
And the recommend everyone read it. Yeah.

969
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:43,110
The thing is, it's like, you know, they
become the people to lower level people.

970
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:48,060
They become like soldiers and they act
out in the best interest of the church.

971
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,990
And it's not just about, you know, it's
like a gang. It's not just, I mean,

972
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,390
all churches are man and it's right.

973
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,970
Find that. Yeah. The, uh, any, any,
any group people, Steelers fans,

974
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:02,010
absolutely. They just go like, this
is for Roth Lisberger meanwhile,

975
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,990
Rosberg with what?
I would find that with Chappelle,

976
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:08,380
there'd be all these guys around him
like, Hey Dave, let me take care of this.

977
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,200
It's like he doesn't want it,

978
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:13,960
but if you're the person
who it's being done on the,

979
00:55:13,961 --> 00:55:15,610
in the name of it's flattering.

980
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,420
It is flattering.
But it's also,

981
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,540
it's a weird tribal instinct that
goes back to the time where there was,

982
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:23,720
you know, 50 of us and we had to
stay alive and stay in a group.

983
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,850
We have these weird group
instincts, you know? Yeah, yeah.

984
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:26,350
That's,

985
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,790
I actually wrote a essay that I think
I'm going to post later on today about

986
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,220
please let us know and we'll tweet
it. I would love that. You guys,

987
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:37,090
what'd you do that for me? Um, about, uh,

988
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:42,091
about the thing with
Tracy Morgan saying that,

989
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:42,970
you know,

990
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:47,320
I'm all for like gay groups coming out
against them because it is technically

991
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,320
reprehensible. I got a couple of
thoughts. One of the thoughts is,

992
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:54,940
as Comedians were going to say,
we have to talk a lot,

993
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:59,760
we're going to say fucked up shit from
time to time. The same way Nike or,

994
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:04,000
or Levi's has an outlet
store for irregular shit.

995
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,140
We're going to say some irregular shit
every once in a while. It's not fucking,

996
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,030
it's just gonna.
It's like the Don Imus thing.

997
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,570
He has to talk 25 hours a week.

998
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:17,530
He's nappy headed hoes is the
only time that comes slipping out.

999
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:22,360
So my point with Tracy is, uh, I don't
mind giggers coming out against him.

1000
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:27,280
Everybody else shut the fuck up because
every single person on earth has some

1001
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:32,020
racism, sexism, some homophobia,
some classes have some, uh, uh,

1002
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,330
uh, political, big, you know,
uh, prejudices and, uh, and,

1003
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,620
and they think that by
coming out against Tracy,

1004
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,700
it distanced themselves from them from,

1005
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,320
from their own sort of darker impulses.

1006
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
And it makes them seem like
they're really doing something.

1007
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,730
Meanwhile, you're not doing shit.
It's not. It's like I said, you know,

1008
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,990
all the people that,
uh,

1009
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,290
all the media outlets that came
on came down on Michael Richards.

1010
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,120
Are Black people better off today
because of the fucking hammer?

1011
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:06,430
No, in fact, they're worse off.

1012
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:10,510
So if you want to help black people
build a fucking school or a hospital and

1013
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,560
shut the fuck up,

1014
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,760
I don't think,

1015
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,060
I think the Tracy Morgan
thing is different from the
Michael Richards thing for

1016
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,050
two reasons.
One,

1017
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,440
because I think Michael Richards was
talking to a group of people who are

1018
00:57:20,441 --> 00:57:24,040
heckling him and he was trying to
insult them in the most dehumanizing way

1019
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:24,611
possible.

1020
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:27,690
And he was on coke and he was trying
to be funny when he didn't deserve May.

1021
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,220
Do you think he was not coping?
He's pretty sure. I don't know.

1022
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:35,020
I'll prove me wrong.
Okay. Just prove God. Uh,

1023
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:35,440
you know,

1024
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,220
he was at the comedy store before and
by all accounts he was gacked out of his

1025
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:42,880
mind. I don't know if it's true or not.
Maybe I'm a slandering him or whatever,

1026
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,270
but, uh, I don't think he's going to go
after me for this. I think for this one,

1027
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:46,990
he's going to leave it alone.

1028
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:49,150
You don't think he wants to revisit
this may call you the n word.

1029
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:54,010
At least you know he's willing to go.
That was less offensive. And I think when,

1030
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:57,880
you know, if people want to, uh, get
on him about that fucking magic word,

1031
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:58,691
that's ridiculous.

1032
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:01,000
When black people say to each other
every fucking day of the week,

1033
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,270
I think when I looked at it, I was like,
oh, well he shouldn't have done that.

1034
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:08,000
And that wasn't funny. But my other,
my initial thought was, it's not,

1035
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,070
he doesn't deserve to be on stage.

1036
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:12,130
He shouldn't be on stage on a
fucking Friday night factory.

1037
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,670
Troll yourself to not,
if you're under,

1038
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,010
if there's a chance that
when you're getting heckled,

1039
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:18,600
you're going to yell that out.

1040
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,810
He's not, well, he's a
comedian. Yeah, exactly.

1041
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:25,980
He's a famous guy and he's going to go
on after like Al Madrigal or you know,

1042
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:29,670
someone of that nature who is not a name,
who's going to crush and you know,

1043
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:33,070
Tom Segura and then you're good luck. Good
luck. Fall those guys. Yeah. And you're,

1044
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:36,870
you're some fucking slap sticky guy.
If you ever seen what he does. No,

1045
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,480
he used to go onstage and the
comedy store and he had no material.

1046
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:43,140
He would just fall down. He would go on
stage. It's boy, he don't let fall down.

1047
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,730
I can't believe this was happening to me.

1048
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:49,000
I got a whole separate pair and he would
slip again and fallen. It's back in my,

1049
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,810
this is my kind of comedy.
Go on. Fucking ridiculous.

1050
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:54,810
I mean he would do it for like 1520
minutes, fall down all over the place.

1051
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,730
I don't think what he said is anything.

1052
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,240
I think what he said is just
him being weak. But it would,

1053
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:01,730
Tracy Morgan said was like,
Whoa, like you want to,

1054
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,730
if your son was gay you would stab that
little nigger. But I think that that's,

1055
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:09,450
I think that what he's doing is just
trying to be funny and I think he's

1056
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:13,260
probably ad libbing, which Tracy
does for like most of it's set now.

1057
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,560
If you've ever seen
Tracy Morgan do stand up,

1058
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,820
he'll start talking
about eating pussy man.

1059
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,310
Well it seems that lived. It's generally
not ad Lib, but like I fuck a midget

1060
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:26,690
and the mouth and like all that shit. So
the idea is I'm a bit sad. Yeah, fine.

1061
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,440
Gay stabbing his son Shit was
part of that. First of all,

1062
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:36,070
I'm sure that got a laugh and in the
abs up stabbing your son for any reason.

1063
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,830
Is Bernie Mac called his nephew a faggot.

1064
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,480
Where was the outrage called him a faggot.
Kings of comedy night,

1065
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:49,100
2000 Sag. It didn't mean as much back
then. It has escalated over the last,

1066
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,600
where are people going back and going
like, and you Bernie Mac. It's like, okay.

1067
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:58,640
Again, I don't, if you want
to help gay people, uh,

1068
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:03,290
give money to, to gay charities
and, and, and, and uh,

1069
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,320
glad and going chastising Tracy isn't
helping gay people hardly at all.

1070
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:11,810
It's helping them a little,
but it's the bare minimum,

1071
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,550
absolute bare minimum. What people
think. It's not, people think people go,

1072
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:17,810
it's better than nothing.
It's,

1073
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:21,470
it's almost worse than nothing because
at least nothing knows it's nothing,

1074
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,900
you know? Whereas this, it's like I'm,
I'm look at me, I'm chastising Tracy.

1075
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:31,020
Right. I agree. What you're saying in
that when something like this happens,

1076
01:00:31,021 --> 01:00:35,040
the people that make a big deal about
it and talk about it and make press

1077
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:38,280
conferences, those are all
concerns that that is just a fact.

1078
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,980
That's a fact in almost every situation.
The people that are, you know,

1079
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,090
a lot of comedians on Twitter
were coming out against it.

1080
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:47,250
I never liked her and it was just like
silly few fucking pussies. It's just not,

1081
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,120
it's not a good point.
It's not a well thought out point.

1082
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,920
It seems like you're taking a safe route.
It doesn't take much.

1083
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,890
Like it's not much of a thought exercise
to get where I got where it's like,

1084
01:00:55,891 --> 01:00:58,140
well wouldn't you know,
but to have an opinion about it.

1085
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:00,180
I think it's an interesting
subject of debate.

1086
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,680
I think to have an opinion about it.

1087
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,460
I think there's going to be the non
comics opinion and there's going to be the

1088
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,670
people that are,
you know,

1089
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:10,590
sort of a bit more sympathetic because
you know they'd realize that comics a lot

1090
01:01:10,591 --> 01:01:11,041
of times you'll,

1091
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,500
you don't know what the fuck you're
saying before you're saying it.

1092
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:17,280
You're saying it on an impulse and
what you would say in front of me,

1093
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:18,870
like if we were standing around,

1094
01:01:18,871 --> 01:01:21,210
if we were sitting in my
office and you and I said,

1095
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:23,170
well what about if you had a gay son?
I need to like,

1096
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,460
I'll stab that little nigger.
I would start laughing my fucking ass off.

1097
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,720
Well that's the end of Tracy
Morgan was yes, there's two house.

1098
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,250
And guess what if you said that in
front of a different crowd, you know,

1099
01:01:35,251 --> 01:01:38,550
one crowd would fucking laugh
hilariously, uh, 10 o'clock,

1100
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:42,110
late night show and Cleveland,
you know, and well that only 50th

1101
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:47,290
as comedians were supposed to have a
shorter distance between our impulses and

1102
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:52,700
our words. That's why, that's part of what
comedy is. And then when it goes awry,

1103
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:56,030
when there's an irregular common,
people are like, fuck this guy,

1104
01:01:56,031 --> 01:01:59,600
I'm going to fucking, it's like, Yo
man, you gotta let us be a little,

1105
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:01,460
and I'm not saying I'm,
I'm like,

1106
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:03,710
I'm trying to set myself up
to say something fucked up.

1107
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,200
I just think if you're in the a
aggrieved group, if you're the,

1108
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,890
if you're a, if, first of
all, if you're Tracy's son, I
would, I would boycott Tracy,

1109
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,590
um, or suck a dick and take a picture
of it. Oh yeah. Look at that dad. Yeah.

1110
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:22,840
You look, I've known Tracy, as long
as I've known you and Tracy dear,

1111
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,430
really think Tracy Morgan's can stab
his son under any circumstances.

1112
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,070
First of all,
do you think Tracy knows where his son is?

1113
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:32,330
Actually,

1114
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:37,080
I actually heard a lot of those jokes
were actually jokes that he's Hbo and

1115
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:41,910
nobody gave a fuck. C'Mon. Nannette
Johnny Today on the podcast.

1116
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:44,640
And he said, Oh yeah, I've heard
those jokes before. Really?

1117
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,290
So He's been saying that shit for a while.

1118
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:49,710
And then someone just had to stand
up and complain about it. Yeah. Huh.

1119
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:54,320
That's people being terrible
writing Tracy. I said, uh, well no,

1120
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,260
the thing that I said in my asset,
my unpublished definite is that, uh,

1121
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,480
people think that B,
the,

1122
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:03,660
I said the louder someone says I
don't have a racist bone in my body,

1123
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:08,410
the less likely they are to have a black
or Latin friend cause I have a shit

1124
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:12,210
load of black friends and I'm a racist.
And guess what?

1125
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,370
My black friends have me as a friend and
they're fucking racists and your racist

1126
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:21,240
and you're homophobic and you're sexist
and you're anti, you know what I mean?

1127
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,440
Everybody's everything.

1128
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,680
So one guy said something like
accidentally on a whim and everyone goes,

1129
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:32,430
I am not okay, stop. This is not a
whim. This is, this is his material.

1130
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,100
Okay, fine. This is completely done.

1131
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,730
It's his material and now
what's a different story?
Well, you know, then someone,

1132
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,280
he's talked to him and tell him that
shit's not funny because it's just,

1133
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:45,390
it's just silly. You know, if you're, if
you're saying that every show funny, I've,

1134
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,990
Tracy was saying some shit that wasn't
getting a laugh, he would stop saying it.

1135
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,840
You sure I'm positive?
Sure wouldn't just try to rework positive.

1136
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,210
He might rework it for like three nights.

1137
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:59,010
You can't use the impulse thought
though, you know, if it's his material.

1138
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:02,040
But even if it is material,
if it wasn't working,

1139
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:06,810
he'd stopped doing it and things that
clearly did not work the night he did it.

1140
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,470
So now he's going to set up and
everything I heard that was that he got in

1141
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:14,640
trouble recently in New York for doing
something very similar and like it was

1142
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:17,280
like an a day or so.
No one knew about it anymore,

1143
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:19,130
but this one just happened to come out.
Right.

1144
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,500
This whole act is about being this wild,
crazy fuck yeah,

1145
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:27,360
we don't want you to that crazy but fuck
midgets in the blowhole or whatever the

1146
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:31,650
fuck his job. Like he talks about
fucking a woman in her inner voice box.

1147
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:35,610
It's like, but every, but again,
people are fine with that.

1148
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,680
That's absolutely fine because the
voice box people, ironically enough,

1149
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:44,970
don't have a voice stabbing. No one
people. So, but once you say stab me,

1150
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,050
then it's like, hey, hey,
no, no one, no one there. You
can't talk about that. Yeah,

1151
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,790
you can not,

1152
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,110
you can make a joke about somehow
you can make that funny but,

1153
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,660
but just the idea that that somehow again,

1154
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:00,330
gay groups absolutely should,
should boycott him but,

1155
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,310
but all these other for to
use your word cunts, uh, can,

1156
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,940
can,
can eat a dick because it's like let them,

1157
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,570
you don't,
first of all your rate every,

1158
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:14,850
it's all these fucking white
lightning deal saying that.

1159
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:18,340
Why didn't you say that everyone
is racist and everyone, it's tribal

1160
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:19,820
racism.

1161
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:24,680
I mean are you really racist or do you
just recognize the fact that some people

1162
01:05:24,681 --> 01:05:28,940
and some ethnic groups do fucked up shit
because you're aware of the news that

1163
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:29,774
doesn't make you racist.

1164
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:34,640
Pattern recognize and you make assumptions
based on a parents as human beings.

1165
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,590
That's what you do.
I don't think that's racist,

1166
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,190
which is to say these fucking white,

1167
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:43,880
there's a reason why we
like to say for the record,

1168
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,100
black people think.
I think sometimes,

1169
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:47,810
I don't know if you have
a big black viewership,

1170
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:51,830
but black people think that when they're
not around, white people are like,

1171
01:05:51,831 --> 01:05:53,310
so the niggers and did it,

1172
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:57,950
the amount of times that I've
heard someone give a screed
the way Mel Gibson did,

1173
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,820
I, I've never heard anything
like that. Like I've never,
white people are not like,

1174
01:06:01,821 --> 01:06:05,870
so, all right, they're gone. Now look,
can we talk about these darkies or,

1175
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:09,990
and I've never heard any of
that. I've never have. Uh, so,

1176
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:14,930
so I would like to the presumption he
did interesting Gibson, when he goes off,

1177
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:20,870
it's still going off. Uh, I had, uh,
yeah, but so the idea that somehow,

1178
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,243
uh,
it,

1179
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:27,370
the white liberals would say that it
is racist to be presumptive to make any

1180
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,640
prejudicial, uh, decisions.

1181
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:35,230
Well, you know what, that's,
that's silliness because you
should analyze, you know,

1182
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:35,520
a few,

1183
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,520
if you know that 99% of all Chinese men
stab people and you see a Chinese guy,

1184
01:06:41,351 --> 01:06:42,990
you're like, fuck, ob is a 1% or,

1185
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,430
right. But again, yes, but but
white liberals would say like how,

1186
01:06:46,431 --> 01:06:51,140
what this ridiculous. He asked the guy
and go, hey, you're not a stab, right?

1187
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,280
Oh No, no, no, no. That's not racist. Yes,

1188
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,570
everyone will admit to this,

1189
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:01,370
but you can't say it in any kind of
public forum and I think that there is

1190
01:07:01,371 --> 01:07:04,520
obviously a difference between what
we're talking about and Tracy saying

1191
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,440
stabbing,
stabbing his gay.

1192
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:08,990
What do you potentially gates
on political correctness.

1193
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,600
Why is that shit still here is and why is,

1194
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:15,260
why are the words more important than the
intent still? Well, that's what I said.

1195
01:07:15,261 --> 01:07:17,000
It's like black people wouldn't,

1196
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:21,380
if you built a state of the art hospital
in Harlem or a state of the art school

1197
01:07:21,381 --> 01:07:21,860
in Harlem,

1198
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:26,270
you could call it nigger high and they'd
be fine with it as long as they were

1199
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:31,271
great teachers there and fucking state
of the art equipment and fucking yes,

1200
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:36,050
my son went to nigger high like
they would really be really,

1201
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,200
I promise it does it all right.

1202
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:42,070
I'll say this for political correctness
because I've seen it. It came really to,

1203
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,660
it came to full bloom
in the early nineties.

1204
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:49,760
I think it is good in terms of
it it like calling black people,

1205
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:54,050
African Americans. I
think that it does. Uh,

1206
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:58,970
in some ways it's largely symbolic.
It's almost entirely symbolic,

1207
01:07:58,971 --> 01:08:03,971
but there was a five to 7% a range
in which I think it is an effective,

1208
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,140
it does distinction. Yeah, it does make,

1209
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:13,220
I mean a homosexual is better than
saying it fucking fag. You know,

1210
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:16,010
like there are words that,
but is it better than

1211
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,730
saying gay?
More ennobling than others.

1212
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,340
Sexual better than
saying gay a gay problem.

1213
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:24,650
One is African American
better than saying black.

1214
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,150
I say black cause I don't cause African
American sounds like my friends or

1215
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:32,440
dignitaries, whereas
they're just dudes. Right.

1216
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,760
I always find it is strange. This
is a strange word. African American.

1217
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:40,160
I've been saying, I've been saying nigger
in my act and it's, it's, it's great.

1218
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:45,170
Go for it. You just do it on black
routes. I did chocolate Sunday on Sunday,

1219
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,630
did great and I'm doing
tripping on Tuesdays tonight.

1220
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,620
I'm going to go on and be in the back
of the room with one knee bent and one

1221
01:08:51,621 --> 01:08:53,950
foot in the launching position,
like the starting blocks.

1222
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:57,380
My point isn't to run out of the room,
hang out with black people.

1223
01:08:57,381 --> 01:09:00,760
I get called it all the time.
Right? You get called the time.

1224
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:03,080
So classic store hanging
out with black guys,

1225
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:05,840
they say it back and forth and
you're not supposed to say it.

1226
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:09,560
It's almost like when you're like you're
grounded and your brothers outside

1227
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:13,940
dancing in the yard like woo, you
can't book and be on it. So, so, uh,

1228
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,890
so the bid is about like,
I fucking,

1229
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:19,400
I mean I say I would write it on Chappelle
show. I would, you know what I mean?

1230
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:22,700
Like I wasn't that an issue on the
Chappelle show with comedy central.

1231
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,950
I mean never. I mean that was,
no, I heard that. You guys know.

1232
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:32,510
Yeah. You know where you heard
it from? From Dave's press
junket. So it's not true.

1233
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,520
Well,

1234
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,520
we were the golden geese of comedy central
or a license to print money for them.

1235
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,600
So when Dave was saying that they were
telling him to stop saying, nigger,

1236
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:45,500
that was bullshit. Absolutely. Wow.
Yeah. Holy Shit. I mean, again,

1237
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:49,100
in my experience that was, that was, well,
I'm not going to say, here's the thing,

1238
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:52,310
I say one thing about Dave and he can
go on Oprah and fucking trashed me.

1239
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:57,110
So like I gotta be careful, but, but
that wasn't my experience at all.

1240
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:01,050
Why would he go on Oprah trash shoots
he trashed me. Has, yeah. What happened?

1241
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:05,240
You guys had this, what will he, you
know, we're doing the show popular show.

1242
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:09,340
You'd been on it a few times. It
did wonders for your career. Um,

1243
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,690
and uh,
and then

1244
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:16,530
we were doing great. And then,
uh, we renewed our contracts,

1245
01:10:16,531 --> 01:10:21,480
which was extremely ugly comedy central
play, divide and conquer between us,

1246
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:24,060
which I said they're going to do
this cause they are gonna make,

1247
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:29,280
they're gonna they have to pay you.
They don't want to have to pay me.

1248
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,360
The only way they're going to have to
pay me as if you demand that they pay me.

1249
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:37,020
So what they did is they poisoned,
uh,

1250
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:41,980
me in within Dave's mind and
how they do this with this.

1251
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,510
Ah,

1252
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:46,650
like David said one time at wraparounds
that he couldn't do the show without me

1253
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,060
at, during a taping. He said that, and I
said that to comedy central. I was like,

1254
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:52,920
Hey, just so you know, Dave said
he couldn't do the show without me.

1255
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,540
And so they called him and goes,
you know,

1256
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:58,590
Neil says she can't do the show without
him. And then he's like, motherfucker,

1257
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,320
so just becomes an ego thing.

1258
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:00,921
Well,
wait a minute,

1259
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:03,320
you guys didn't have the kind of
relationship where he would call you up?

1260
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:05,030
We did prior to that,
but

1261
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:09,420
the negotiation started then it became
like a, I can't talk to anybody, you know,

1262
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,510
really?
Yeah.

1263
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,950
It was the w let me,
let me be clear with us.

1264
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,630
It was the worst period of my life.
I can't imagine the worst period.

1265
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:21,980
And it's just because the stakes were
so high. And then he was, became,

1266
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,980
it became an ego thing
and it just became like,

1267
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:29,600
no, I can, I can accomplish as to
what the scene on the set was. A,

1268
01:11:29,601 --> 01:11:32,660
when we did a,
the fear factor spoof and what it was,

1269
01:11:32,661 --> 01:11:37,661
was Neil was running everything and
Dave was in character all day running

1270
01:11:37,671 --> 01:11:41,560
around, you know, uh, you know,
I'm Rick James Bitch, and, and, and

1271
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:45,920
I think that's an exaggeration,
but it was, but you know, I mean,

1272
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:49,320
you had a huge part in that shows
the point coke ran, or the shell,

1273
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,580
like it wasn't, that's the thing is
like, but I think what happened was,

1274
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,170
uh,
you know,

1275
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,440
they made it seem like by
David admitting that I was,

1276
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,670
Lorne Michaels once
said in reference to me,

1277
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:06,810
and Dave Comedians don't like it when,
when people realize they have help.

1278
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,040
And I think in Dave was the one
who would say that I was out.

1279
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,910
Cause it was fair because it was
only fair. He would have to say,

1280
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,670
Neil makes a big contribution to show,
because I did,

1281
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:22,020
it was conversations with calmness, Shit.
We said, whatever. Uh, but again, I,

1282
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:26,670
uh, contributed, I believe I
held up my end of the bargain,

1283
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:31,500
but it just became this thing
of like, they may, I think,
I don't think they made,

1284
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:34,530
I think part of it was in him anyway,

1285
01:12:34,531 --> 01:12:38,850
that he just resented the idea
of being on a team. Really.

1286
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:41,710
Yeah. And where did you
draw this conclusion from?

1287
01:12:41,711 --> 01:12:45,550
The Jews had a conversation with him
about this. This is just, yeah. And what,

1288
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,393
what did he say?

1289
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,430
Uh,
we're not a fucking team.

1290
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:53,510
Whoa. Whoa. That was after
two years of the show.

1291
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,280
And this is

1292
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,820
teams. We were a team when
it, when it wasn't popular.

1293
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:02,710
God Damn, that sucks. Yeah. Pain. I
know. That's the thing is like, look,

1294
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,130
me and Dave are cool now and I don't,

1295
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,530
I think that that's,
uh,

1296
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,550
I'd like to think that this was all
circumstantial. You know what I mean?

1297
01:13:12,551 --> 01:13:15,580
Like in the circumstances, he was
just under a lot of pressure and end.

1298
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:16,483
He felt like,

1299
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:20,180
you know, the, the what you're
saying, you know, the other thing

1300
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:24,860
that I will say is that, is that in
the, when me and Dave wrote half baked,

1301
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:29,930
I knew that people in
comedy would all think,

1302
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:33,590
would think that he wrote all of it and
people in show business would think that

1303
01:13:33,591 --> 01:13:37,610
I wrote all of it because people in show
business are predisposed to think that

1304
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:38,810
the black guys had dummy

1305
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,120
all that shit. Dude. I would
say to people, I swear to God,

1306
01:13:43,121 --> 01:13:46,840
I was in a meeting with a producer
and he, I promise you, he goes,

1307
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:50,380
seriously how much of that script to
Dave, right. I prom and I was like,

1308
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,740
half of it, man. Have
them. And sure enough,

1309
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,290
everyone in comedy thought Dave wrote it.

1310
01:13:56,650 --> 01:14:00,310
Def Jeff Ross referred to me as
Dave Chappelle's typist. Okay.

1311
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,490
Does Jeff Frosto? Well, I mean
he's the roast master general,

1312
01:14:03,491 --> 01:14:05,690
but that's a little bit beyond the Pale.
That wasn't it.

1313
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,490
It wasn't that a row rude. Especially if
the guy doesn't update exact very often

1314
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:15,790
by himself. Um, yeah. Um, uh,

1315
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:19,710
Jeff, if any writers are listening.
When I was younger, I would, uh,

1316
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:23,680
most certainly had a problem with
working with a garden and then having to

1317
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:27,100
reveal the fact that this guy was
writing half of my material again.

1318
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:32,320
But the idea of Hap, it's not, there's
so much work on, on doing a TV show,

1319
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:36,160
it's just, it's a lot. I did a lot
of work. Here's the other thing,

1320
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:41,200
Dave did a fuck load of work too.
And Dave is a hall of fame,

1321
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:44,610
one in a billion comedian. I honestly
do that. Like one of the billion.

1322
01:14:44,611 --> 01:14:49,020
There's like Eddie Murphy, him,
Chris in terms of like, I don't,

1323
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,980
I think he's very different
than any Murphy I think. No, no,

1324
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,600
but I'm saying in terms of the decathlon
of ability, Dave can do stand up,

1325
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:59,920
he can write sketches, he can think of
characters, he can write movies, he can,

1326
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:04,700
he's got a visual sense like
he's got, he's got the full, uh,

1327
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:08,740
a portfolio. So the idea that that, uh,

1328
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,600
you know, he didn't like, I don't want
to come on here and be like, Dave,

1329
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:17,920
Dave Chappelle, you know, doesn't exist.
That's not the truth. The truth is, well,

1330
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:20,560
you're talking about a god that
cracked under pressure. It's all right.

1331
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:25,060
It's not like he sucks. He's still
one of the greatest comics I knew.

1332
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:29,380
So I knew early on in 97 that people
were going to give me too much credit or

1333
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:33,640
him too much credit. So we had a deal.
We don't tell people who wrote what,

1334
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,410
like how to deal sat down
and came up with the deal.

1335
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,700
The idea was that we didn't
hammer it out or anything,

1336
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:44,080
but I can deal with it was my
idea because I knew that if,

1337
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:48,130
if I, if, if he'd heard that I said
I wrote something, he'd be pissed.

1338
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:53,020
And uh, if I heard that, um,

1339
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,830
he wrote like if it just,
it doesn't serve the team.

1340
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:59,870
When people ask who wrote that
joke, they don't, they don't have,

1341
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,010
they don't have your
best interests at hearts.

1342
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,260
They basically saying they're like,
they're going, where's the one of you two?

1343
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:08,590
Can I discount because
this hurts my feelings.

1344
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,560
I think it's a good quality
of this hurts my feelings.

1345
01:16:11,561 --> 01:16:15,670
So they want to find out who I want to
find out who stinks. And he's funny.

1346
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:20,430
That's interesting. Like, and, and so
I recognized that immediately. And so,

1347
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,320
so we, so, but having said
that on true, because you know,

1348
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:26,210
that's the Matt Stone Trey Parker thing.

1349
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,730
Everybody who said Trey
Parker writes everything.

1350
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:30,760
Matt stone just sits from jerks
off many times. You heard that?

1351
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,850
That's why they say that because South
Park's the greatest fucking show that's

1352
01:16:33,851 --> 01:16:37,510
ever existed and it's fully good.
Yeah.

1353
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,770
It hurts people who aren't producing
Matt around cause he hates money.

1354
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:47,830
Gray hates money. He just wants
to give out. It's like, God,

1355
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:51,040
I can't take, oh, I fucking
hate this money. Uh,

1356
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:55,060
so the idea that somehow, uh, he didn't,

1357
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,290
he didn't like the idea of
the implication that, that um,

1358
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,910
uh, the white people would
think that I was doing it.

1359
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:08,260
All people would say shit like we'd be,
we were somewhere and,

1360
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,160
and one of his agents

1361
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,050
came up. It's like the genius behind
the man to me standing next to Dave.

1362
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:19,280
Now I know the agent is just trying to
be a fucking agent and be like schmoozy.

1363
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,740
Right. But it's like, Yo man,

1364
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,700
don't say that shit first of
all because it's not true.

1365
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:30,560
And secondly, because it fucks, it
poisons our relationship, you know?

1366
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:35,600
Hmm. Um, wow. There's a lot of ego
going on here. Uh, there's a, uh,

1367
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,553
yeah,

1368
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:41,650
yeah. A lot of ego get into show business
for, for attention. Like, you know,

1369
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,970
for personal attention.

1370
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:47,120
It's some point though. The idea is
to steer it towards the work, right.

1371
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:50,150
To steer that energy into instead
of it being personal tension.

1372
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:52,700
The real satisfaction is creating
something that's really good.

1373
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:56,510
People love and passionate response and
people still love it. But that's the,

1374
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:01,050
but the thing is if you're surrounded
by people, you know, there was a,

1375
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:05,430
there've been some studies where
they, where they said, what is,

1376
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:09,090
uh, they, they, they put
people in a situation,

1377
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:12,330
a bunch of volunteers in situation, and
they asked another group of volunteers,

1378
01:18:12,331 --> 01:18:15,120
what do you think these people
will do and why? And they,

1379
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:19,140
they said they are going to do the
negative thing because they're all dicks.

1380
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,020
So they,
the people did the thing,

1381
01:18:22,021 --> 01:18:25,380
people devolve this group did the thing
over here and they all did the negative

1382
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:27,240
thing. And these people said, yeah,

1383
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:30,390
cause their dicks and then they put
these people in it and they did the exact

1384
01:18:30,391 --> 01:18:32,400
same thing.
Not because their debts.

1385
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:36,870
It's because as a human being in that
situation, you're going to do the thing.

1386
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,020
People don't know how they're going
to react in certain situations.

1387
01:18:40,021 --> 01:18:43,410
And most of the time it is circumstantial.
It's not characterological.

1388
01:18:43,411 --> 01:18:48,150
And that's the thing with this is I think,
uh,

1389
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,520
if I,
if I had been Dave,

1390
01:18:50,521 --> 01:18:54,690
it's very easy for me to say I would
have treated Neil differently. But again,

1391
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:58,380
you know, or, but I wasn't dating

1392
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:00,420
circumstances,
exposed character though.

1393
01:19:00,421 --> 01:19:02,400
I mean that is the idea of
character in the first place.

1394
01:19:02,401 --> 01:19:04,380
The idea of character is strong,

1395
01:19:04,381 --> 01:19:08,100
character is able to survive under
adversity and that's what it's all about.

1396
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,670
And that's why when someone doesn't have
your back, when the shit hits the fan,

1397
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,740
you lose respect for them
because you're like, well,

1398
01:19:13,741 --> 01:19:16,550
this person has enough character. This
person is not my friend. You know,

1399
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,830
this person is looking out for themselves.
They're weak, they're egotistical,

1400
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:21,240
they're whatever.
They have a flaw.

1401
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,930
Yeah, he'll, he'll bury me for
this by the way. Really? Oh,

1402
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,650
do you know on this conversation?
Absolutely. Really? I
mean, I would bet my bet.

1403
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:31,400
So you're feeling bad right now that
you said anything? I don't feel bad.

1404
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,850
I mean, I, I actually don't feel like I've
said anything bad and I think I've been

1405
01:19:34,851 --> 01:19:36,890
sympathetic. I mean, but no one here.

1406
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:41,120
The thing that was so disgusting about
the whole thing was nobody asked me my

1407
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:41,954
side of things,

1408
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:45,650
60 minutes called and I wouldn't do an
interview in New York Times called I

1409
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:46,420
wouldn't do an interview.

1410
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,760
Well explain to everybody
how it all went south.

1411
01:19:48,761 --> 01:19:51,370
So you guys were in negotiations,
you're about,

1412
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,250
everybody heard the number 50 million.
That's what I keep hearing.

1413
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,730
$50 million are going to make
another season for $50 million deal.

1414
01:19:57,731 --> 01:19:59,230
And then Dave goes to Africa,

1415
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,820
right? What, what, what exactly went
down. But what happened was the,

1416
01:20:02,821 --> 01:20:04,350
there was the negotiation part,

1417
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:08,370
the divide and conquer thing that I
already talked about about them going,

1418
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:11,270
you know Neil. So then he
can do it without them. You
can't do it without them.

1419
01:20:11,271 --> 01:20:15,570
So which would make Chappelle like, Fuck
Neil, you're basically comedy central.

1420
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:19,770
You're deputized to low ball him
even though, I mean he never,

1421
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,630
I don't think that was
ever explicitly said.

1422
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:24,480
But if they say like they came to him
at one point and like could you do the

1423
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:25,800
show without Neil?
And He,

1424
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:30,540
and they had poisoned me to him so
much by that point that he was like,

1425
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,280
yeah,
but it would take three people.

1426
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:37,280
Could you have decided to get together
and form a partnership in the form of

1427
01:20:37,281 --> 01:20:41,420
some sort of a corporation and say this
corporation is what you are contracting

1428
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:45,590
to do this television show and the fee
for the corporation will be X. Right.

1429
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,980
But there was all guys,
Ben and some sort of illegal things,

1430
01:20:48,981 --> 01:20:50,660
so you don't have to worry
about this ever again.

1431
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:55,460
I couldn't have been done that could have
been done ahead of time, but I'm not,

1432
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:58,310
we're not a fucking team. Keeps
that shit from happening. Yeah.

1433
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:03,130
Um, so, so, so yeah. So at that point,

1434
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,700
uh, they was the divide
and conquer thing and, and,

1435
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:11,140
and so, all right. Yeah. So that,

1436
01:21:11,141 --> 01:21:14,020
so our relationship was pretty
much once my deal was closed,

1437
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:18,410
you couldn't call him and go, Yo dude,
this is, eventually I did. And eventually,

1438
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:20,100
literally were on the both on the phone.

1439
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:25,020
I'm crying and I think he may
get out of my house right now.

1440
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,480
Joe, this is how Whiz,
what a bitch I am. Uh,

1441
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:33,040
it's Tracy Morgan would
stab me right now. Um, uh,

1442
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:37,200
so a cook a steak for you after
this is over and Ah, no, I'm crying.

1443
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,510
Chappelle may have been crying.

1444
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:42,430
He was definitely tearing up
because on the phone. Yeah.

1445
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:45,860
How'd he know he's tearing up on the
phone. You can visit hope vocally.

1446
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,470
You guys on Skype.
We were on a I chat.

1447
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:54,110
Um, and uh, and it was basically like,

1448
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:59,210
dude, like what are you doing? Like,
and then, and then, so finally it was,

1449
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:02,620
I basically said like, why are
you doing this? Like, what did I,

1450
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:07,790
you do your deals closed. But they made
basically his deal was closed, right.

1451
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:12,110
Bunch of money. Uh, and
then my deal was open,

1452
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:15,050
but they made it somehow seem to,
Dave,

1453
01:22:15,051 --> 01:22:17,900
like any point for me
was a point against him.

1454
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:20,930
And it wasn't the case,
but I think,

1455
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:24,130
and so they were letting him know
there's only a certain amount of money.

1456
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,660
They knew they weren't,
they never said like,

1457
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:30,250
you're going to get less money if
Neil gets more. Dave Steele was close.

1458
01:22:30,251 --> 01:22:33,000
It was just the idea that
like they didn't want,

1459
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:37,740
it was like they planted in Dave's
sort of psyche that he didn't,

1460
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,480
or maybe it was already in there,

1461
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:43,950
he didn't want me to get in too
close in terms of compensation.

1462
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,500
They made it about an
ego thing. Like, well,

1463
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:51,250
how much does Neil [inaudible]
Neil worth? You know? Uh,

1464
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:54,720
so they were basically
deputized to low ball me.

1465
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:57,210
Well, typically show
runners get, you know,

1466
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:59,670
almost as much money as
the stars of shows. I mean,

1467
01:22:59,671 --> 01:23:03,390
you look in terms of like this
fucking guy with this chuck Lorre Guy,

1468
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:04,980
Charlie Sheen,
you know,

1469
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:08,050
everybody's talking about Charlie Sheen
making $2 million an episode. Guess what?

1470
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:10,840
That chuck Lorre guy probably makes
more secular, would kill himself.

1471
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:12,100
He was making 2 million and up.
Yeah.

1472
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:13,790
Uh,
Chuck Lorre,

1473
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:18,020
he's done a lot of big shows and it
wasn't cast contingent and all that.

1474
01:23:18,021 --> 01:23:22,970
Like Dave brought me on. Right. You know,
so I couldn't really go like, fuck you.

1475
01:23:22,971 --> 01:23:26,240
And the other thing is I can't
just go do the show with like,

1476
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:30,070
I'm going to get fucking Orlando
Jones and do that. It's not, and I,

1477
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,280
nor did I want it.

1478
01:23:31,281 --> 01:23:35,210
That was the thing is the thing that about
me and Dave was like, I love the dude.

1479
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:39,500
You know what I mean? Like I like a
door. The dude, I love writing with them.

1480
01:23:39,501 --> 01:23:44,230
I love writing. I love, like, I would
work like fucking a crazy, I worked,

1481
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,420
I told my brother this the other day
because I'd forgotten. I worked one day,

1482
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:51,110
there was a,
there was a period where I worked for 12,

1483
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,990
at least 12 hours a day for
35 straight days to try to,

1484
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:58,880
just to get the show done, to
get the show on the air. Um,

1485
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:02,910
he was working his ass off too, but
it was just the idea that somehow, uh,

1486
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,790
they just made it about
like pitting us against.

1487
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:10,660
Okay.
So for those nation go crazy.

1488
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:14,590
They pitted you against him.
You guys wound up fighting.

1489
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,280
How did you never resolve it?
How did you never talked to him?

1490
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,610
We've resolved it,
but it was still this thing of like,

1491
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:24,480
when push comes to shove,
you don't want to be in a fucking team.

1492
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,990
Uh,
you don't think I'm,

1493
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:32,670
you think I'm fractionally
worthwhile of the show? Uh,

1494
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,590
it was just kind of a vote of like,
fine.

1495
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:38,850
It was just this resentment of
like that I was getting this, this,

1496
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,470
that I got some money to do.
Yeah.

1497
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,430
Well I don't understand that.

1498
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:49,720
If he thinks that you guys are a team
and it didn't affect how much you were a

1499
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:54,340
teen, but he knows that you guys
work together to do the fucking show.

1500
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:55,363
Right?

1501
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,820
You're basically saying that it was
completely an ego thing on his part.

1502
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:01,410
That's what you're saying.

1503
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:04,710
You're saying that he didn't feel
like you were worth as much as him.

1504
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:08,610
He didn't feel like you're working.
Contribution was, like I said,

1505
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:11,190
he's a one in a billion guy.
Like he's, uh, he's, uh,

1506
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:15,540
he deserved more money than okay. That,
that said he already had his money,

1507
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,170
so he was already getting a certain
amount of money. So what, what,

1508
01:25:18,171 --> 01:25:21,780
what you're saying basically is completely
different than anything anyone's ever

1509
01:25:21,781 --> 01:25:25,320
heard in the news. No kidding.
Cause no one's ever asked
me, God, this is so crazy.

1510
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:29,790
So my point of view from all this time,
it was greatest show in my opinion,

1511
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,580
greatest comedy show of all time,
Chappelle show number one,

1512
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,640
greatest show of all time.
That fucking Clayton Bigsby character,

1513
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,950
that's the greatest sketch in
all of television, black racists

1514
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:44,880
self idea. Like he had been, he'd had
it in the heat and it's a brilliant,

1515
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:48,360
brilliant still remember writing the
sketch. It's a brilliant, I remember call,

1516
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,380
yeah,
I won't say who wrote.

1517
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:54,160
So what I had heard was that there was
all sorts of input from the network and

1518
01:25:54,161 --> 01:25:57,070
they were saying him that he used to
stop saying nigger and make it more

1519
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:58,780
friendly to commercials.
This side,

1520
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:02,990
I don't remember where it heard
this or you might want to be second.

1521
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:04,730
There was a lot of stories

1522
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:05,360
and that he,

1523
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,860
because he left the show and then I
think he had to figure out a way to make

1524
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:12,680
himself look like the victim,

1525
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:17,600
but in my estimation he wasn't
the victim. Wow. Um, again,

1526
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,090
no one wants to hear it again.
He's like,

1527
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,020
he's an unbelievably charming guy.
Hilarious.

1528
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:28,620
He's everybody's friend. Like I get it.
He's, he was my for, he's still living.

1529
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:32,210
We're still friendly. Like we're friends.
We weren't for like three, four years,

1530
01:26:32,211 --> 01:26:36,140
but now we're friendly and hang out when
he's in La. Let me ask you this man, why,

1531
01:26:36,141 --> 01:26:40,160
why doesn't he do like fucking
concerts and theaters and put out DVDs?

1532
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:44,600
I mean everybody's so excited to see
him do standup, but like you know,

1533
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:47,880
you never hear about it until he
like shows up. Lee Thomas show. Yeah.

1534
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,340
I'll show up at the store.
He'll show up,

1535
01:26:49,341 --> 01:26:52,430
showed up in Seattle and was doing
shows in a park with a speaker.

1536
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:55,880
He pulled out a microphone and a speaker
and plugged it in and just doing shows

1537
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:57,180
like outdoors and I saw,

1538
01:26:57,181 --> 01:27:01,330
I'm like about a month and a half ago
and it was just him on stage and he was

1539
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:05,090
kind of fucking, it felt like he was
fucking around. He wasn't like doing bits,

1540
01:27:05,091 --> 01:27:06,320
but then I was told that no,

1541
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:10,070
that's his new style where he just
does a lot of audience interaction.

1542
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:13,190
It's almost like a, an evening with, yeah,

1543
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:16,790
it was cool because you know what you're
like. Okay. Really? I mean, again,

1544
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:21,650
the guy can channel Shit, like he can just
stand in there and he's, he's riveting.

1545
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,610
I saw Dave do a street
performance in Montreal.

1546
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:29,980
He did a standup comedy on the street.
And what he would do was, uh, you know,

1547
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:34,100
we were doing these shows at club
soda and then after the show he goes

1548
01:27:34,101 --> 01:27:37,430
downstairs and shit, man. He was like,
I don't know, 19 or something like that.

1549
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:41,480
And he goes downstairs and there's a
group of people and so he just starts

1550
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:44,910
yelling, gathered around,
gathered around lazy. Yeah.

1551
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:49,220
That was when one of the period we met
and I started doing friends for like,

1552
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,980
I invited on the show to him,

1553
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:55,460
finding him on the podcast so we could
get him in here and wait, wait for him.

1554
01:27:55,461 --> 01:28:00,320
I think he'll be here any
minute, dude. Hey, it's day.

1555
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:05,240
Um, I, this is, this is very
disturbing. Uh, I mean, again,

1556
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:08,450
all I've ever said about it,
it was very like behind the music.

1557
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:11,810
How come he's not doing shows? Do you
have any idea? I don't know. It's like,

1558
01:28:11,811 --> 01:28:16,040
it's not advertising your shows. It's
weird. I mean he's selling out everywhere.

1559
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:20,140
I mean he does shows every once in a
while for like no DVDs. No, you know,

1560
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:21,630
I want to see the shakes.

1561
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:27,020
You know I having a contract and having
to be someplace and I have a copy of

1562
01:28:27,021 --> 01:28:30,090
Dave Chappelle when he
got back from Africa. He,

1563
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:34,340
he did a set at a comedy club and I have
a copy of that on MP3 and it's really

1564
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:35,900
weird as you make the copy,

1565
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:41,680
I don't know want to talk about it but
I like I boot like staying home a month

1566
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,370
ago really cause I that he does a bit
about doctor drew and I had to play it for

1567
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:49,920
someone. It's like you had about doctor
drew just about piece of Charlatan.

1568
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:54,650
He is fun. He's a whore.
Yeah. Dr Jews purely.

1569
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:58,400
I'm all completely anti Dr drew now.
I mean he's a nice guy.

1570
01:28:58,401 --> 01:29:01,980
When I see him I'll say hi, I'll be his
friend. But he started doing this stupid

1571
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,980
shit on a CNN show about pot having severe
withdrawal symptoms and that the THC

1572
01:29:07,651 --> 01:29:09,060
is in a higher content today,

1573
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:12,420
which is physiologically
a fucking ridiculous thing
for a doctor to say because

1574
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:13,710
since it's not physically addictive,

1575
01:29:13,711 --> 01:29:16,830
just because there's more THC does not
make it addictive. You know, it doesn't,

1576
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:19,980
it doesn't all of a sudden change the
properties of the fucking drug, you know,

1577
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:23,070
and anything where it's addictive at all,
it's psychologically addictive,

1578
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:26,190
which by the way, anything can be
psychologically addictive. You know,

1579
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:26,821
it's like saying,

1580
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:30,030
well we need to take away porn because
porn psychologically addictive,

1581
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,240
no more gambling because some people
can't handle it. Fat Foods, fatty foods,

1582
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,940
no more cheeseburgers. Cause some
people get addicted to fatty foods.

1583
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:38,160
It's like fuck that. That's
the, that's nonsense.

1584
01:29:38,161 --> 01:29:41,210
Talking only like half the country
gets addicted to fatty foods.

1585
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:44,550
Those were fucking idiots. You know? I
agree. That's evolutionary. I'm with you.

1586
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:48,420
I'm not into nerf in the world. And so
his, his proposition that marijuana,

1587
01:29:48,421 --> 01:29:51,630
you know, should, it is dangerous
and illegal or should be illegal,

1588
01:29:51,631 --> 01:29:55,020
it's fucking completely ridiculous thing
to stay. Especially when he, you know,

1589
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:59,010
pharmaceutical companies are producing
shit that's 100,000 times worse and it's

1590
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:01,020
available everywhere.
It's a stupid,

1591
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:04,950
ridiculous thing for a doctor to say it's
a terrible position for a Dr site and

1592
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:06,120
it's ignorant,
you know?

1593
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:08,580
And the only reason why he's saying it
is because he thinks that that's what the

1594
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:11,910
people who listen to him want to hear.
He's a whore. That whore behavior.

1595
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,370
I used to love him on in though.

1596
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,250
I thought it was really informative
and helpful and I just feel like it's,

1597
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:20,090
at a certain point it's like,
dude, you're just, uh, you,

1598
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,690
you want to be famous for everybody else.

1599
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:26,570
Exactly. Yeah. He's, he's working hard
for fame. It's like his fucking show.

1600
01:30:26,571 --> 01:30:27,530
It's the most ridiculous thing.

1601
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,010
The idea that he's really helping those
celebrities to get clean, you know?

1602
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:32,990
I mean, come on, man, you got
a fucking camera in their face.

1603
01:30:32,991 --> 01:30:36,380
It's the worst possible scenario
for someone to try to clean up.

1604
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,960
They give them attention
and the end of their career,

1605
01:30:38,961 --> 01:30:40,760
when everything's fucking
completely falling apart,

1606
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,100
you're going to give them
attention and put a camera on them.

1607
01:30:43,101 --> 01:30:45,750
Whether weeping and shaking
and pissing their pants,

1608
01:30:45,751 --> 01:30:47,410
and they should make it like a,

1609
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,250
whoever remains the sober the longest
gets some kind of money. Yeah.

1610
01:30:52,251 --> 01:30:55,310
That's what it should pay, right?
Yeah. Let's make it a game show. Yeah.

1611
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:58,070
That's a good idea. What is,
um, what does Stan hope spit?

1612
01:30:58,071 --> 01:31:01,040
What does he say about him? Do you
mind? I think I have on my phone.

1613
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:05,580
Yeah. I had such a good bit. It's
like such an, uh, it's, uh, it,

1614
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:10,590
it was a crazy good bit. Um, so, uh,

1615
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,900
whatever, I, I, they would
take me forever is fine. Right.

1616
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:15,280
But were you still
involved with Chappelle?

1617
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,980
The Chappelle show had like that kind of
wrap up show and stuff like that? Yeah,

1618
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:23,580
cause I liked the sketches. Yeah.
Dave wrote this sketches together.

1619
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:27,960
So then it became this thing of
like, it was, it was, uh, and again,

1620
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,520
like I, I don't want people to think
that I'm a dick or Dave's a dick.

1621
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:37,590
I just, it was a, it was a,
it was a stressful situation.

1622
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:38,820
Um,

1623
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:42,030
you, so you were involved with the
season that he was involved in,

1624
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:46,140
which was like he, he was, he
was, we wrote the sketch together,

1625
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:48,270
but he wasn't involved
in putting it on the air

1626
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:51,700
was not involved in putting them on the
air. Yeah. Did he not want it on the air?

1627
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:55,930
Uh,
I think his perception in my,

1628
01:31:55,990 --> 01:32:00,990
my feeling about it was
his perception of what was,

1629
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:06,110
uh,
recorded.

1630
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:11,080
No perception of what was relevant or,

1631
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:14,050
or what was, what was, it's what's right,

1632
01:32:14,051 --> 01:32:17,320
windows racial become racist and,
um,

1633
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:22,620
and just got sort of blurred and I
don't think he could see the difference

1634
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,633
between,

1635
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:27,860
so he thought some of this stuff
was racist. It's not a racial,

1636
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:32,300
and it was based on
completely random random. Uh,

1637
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:36,940
so what you basically saying is that
the pressure of this show over two years

1638
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:40,870
was so intense and that so many things
happened and there was so much going on

1639
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,060
that he kind of cracked a little,

1640
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,990
which is what a lot of people
thought when he moved to [inaudible].

1641
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:49,780
I mean when he went to Africa, uh,
is, is, is, I don't know, again,

1642
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:54,110
I don't, I don't presume to
know what it's like to be a,

1643
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:57,280
a famous black comedian.
Uh,

1644
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,980
it like it because the
thing that black eyes,

1645
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:03,730
black comedians get that white
people don't is you become a symbol.

1646
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:08,100
You know what I mean?
Like you become the elect the spokesman.

1647
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,590
So people on news shows start going like,
well,

1648
01:33:10,591 --> 01:33:12,860
I saw Dave Chappelle show
that you can do today.

1649
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:16,050
I saw that a thousand times when people,
it became this thing,

1650
01:33:16,051 --> 01:33:19,680
it became bigger than
the intention where it's,

1651
01:33:19,681 --> 01:33:21,480
the intention was like this little,

1652
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:26,230
this show that was almost just to make
each other laugh and then it became this

1653
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:30,770
big thing. It became like this
bully pulpit and, and so it,

1654
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,930
it became, it was so much responsibility
I think for David. He actually,

1655
01:33:34,931 --> 01:33:38,350
it stopped being fun because it
wasn't like it wasn't, it was,

1656
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,800
it was the idea of like
he said on 60 minutes like
dance, like nobody's watching.

1657
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:46,870
And then it became like dance, like
fucking way too many people are watching.

1658
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:52,320
And, and I think it got
in his head about about,

1659
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,790
is this responsible or is this,
which again, as a white person,

1660
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:59,090
you just don't have to worry about,
no one's going to go. You don't,

1661
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:03,000
you're never going to be the spokesman
for white people ever. Do you hear me? Um,

1662
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:06,890
if you keep this up, uh, no. Like
you just can't, you'll never,

1663
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:10,730
so that's the thing that as a, I think
as a, as a black comedian, it's just,

1664
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,290
it's like Eddie Murphy,

1665
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:17,000
The Times I've spoken to him and hung
out with them is still still seems upset

1666
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:21,300
by the fact that, that he
got like picketed, you know?

1667
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,870
Yeah. He's like, man, if
fucking, I'm just doing jokes.

1668
01:34:25,871 --> 01:34:29,590
And then next thing I know I got people
outside picketing. It's like, well, yeah,

1669
01:34:29,591 --> 01:34:32,680
but you're doing dice. Obviously dice had
the same thing. So it's not just racial,

1670
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:33,010
but

1671
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:35,680
it's your PR. It's the perceptions
that you're, you're, you're,

1672
01:34:35,681 --> 01:34:36,970
you're very influential.

1673
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:39,670
And when you're on stage and you're saying
a bunch of really negative shit about

1674
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:40,580
black people.
I mean,

1675
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,440
Eddie Murphy said a lot of really mean
shit about black people. You know,

1676
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:48,790
people you mean? Yeah. Excuse me. Gay
People. So it wasn't, it wasn't, um,

1677
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:51,530
it wasn't just, you know, he was
doing jokes. It was, you know,

1678
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:53,860
the jokes were really nasty.

1679
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:58,640
Yeah, no, I'm with you. I like, I
don't like all the Ilab but, but,

1680
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:02,540
um, but having heard that, I just want to
say that Eddie is an awesome dude. Yes.

1681
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,730
Yeah. Great guy to hang out with,
to talk to. Hilarious. Um, but uh,

1682
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:12,050
but so the eye are just jokes, but
they are just jokes. I mean, but again,

1683
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:14,510
if you're doing jokes in a
club with a hundred people,

1684
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:16,820
it doesn't take on that mom mentality.

1685
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:20,960
Whereas when you're in fucking Nassau
Coliseum, you started to go, oh wait,

1686
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:25,490
this is almost too much, uh,
influence over people. It's,

1687
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:28,470
it's one thing when it's a club, but
when it becomes this big like, hmm,

1688
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:29,590
what next?

1689
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:33,400
We had Brian Posehn on yesterday and he
was talking about the gathering of the

1690
01:35:33,401 --> 01:35:37,120
Juggalos. He's doing standup at
the gathering of the Juggalos.

1691
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,950
And I thought about it after you left.

1692
01:35:38,951 --> 01:35:41,430
I got baked and I was writing
and I was thinking, you know,

1693
01:35:41,431 --> 01:35:44,680
it'd be cool if we had some fucking crazy
death squad meeting somewhere cause I

1694
01:35:44,681 --> 01:35:46,330
know Stan hope did some shit like that.

1695
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,910
Like you had these parties in the desert
but it was really just like a loser

1696
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:53,710
festival. Yeah. It became a bad idea but
doing some one crazy event every year,

1697
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,730
you know,
something like that.

1698
01:35:54,731 --> 01:35:58,210
But that's when things get dangerous when
things get dangerous is when you have

1699
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:01,600
like a movement behind you and then
you have a logo and shit. Yeah.

1700
01:36:01,601 --> 01:36:05,410
It's very difficult to fucking keep
your, your, your interest pure.

1701
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:10,350
It's also, yeah, it's
hard to uh, it's it, yeah.

1702
01:36:10,351 --> 01:36:13,920
It's, you kind of go, wait, what? What
am I doing? It becomes this corporation.

1703
01:36:13,921 --> 01:36:15,150
It just becomes like this,

1704
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:20,310
like a corporation and fucking a lot of
you meet with lawyers more than you meet

1705
01:36:20,311 --> 01:36:24,220
with the writers. You know what I mean?
Like, that's the thing, part of it that's,

1706
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:28,570
that's perceived of managed it
fine. Oh, here we go to you.

1707
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:30,710
Do you have a huge issue
with the Oprah like Oprah?

1708
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:36,300
Yeah, I do. I know you don't like hope.
No. She had Dave on. He's trashing me.

1709
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:40,590
No one from our CEO calls me.
She doesn't have for my side of things.

1710
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:45,600
No one warns me. No. And then she,
but she's this like great humanist.

1711
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,930
Well, in her defense, I mean,

1712
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:52,520
is she going to have another show where
you can at least tell me or at least

1713
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:53,270
happening?

1714
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:56,060
How does she have any idea that you
were going to get trashed on the show?

1715
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:59,630
She knows that she had Dave on, he
had it in the can for weeks. Right.

1716
01:36:59,631 --> 01:37:03,530
But what are they going to tell you that
the day of trashed? You really think,

1717
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:06,260
why would they email me
something? Really? Yeah.

1718
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:09,170
I don't worry if you're going
to have someone telling you

1719
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:12,350
retelling a story, it's
like, have both people on,

1720
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:15,670
I wouldn't expect that. Um, I would
think, you know, here's the famous guy.

1721
01:37:15,671 --> 01:37:19,690
Let's see what he's got to take.
No, it's, you know, we're friends.

1722
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,690
If he goes on Oprah, I'm sure we'll see
nice things. Then I'd like Oprah. Well,

1723
01:37:22,691 --> 01:37:26,440
that's what you think until two weeks
later. And if he doesn't, uh, you know,

1724
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:29,220
I'll write something online,
but I can't believe you said that.

1725
01:37:29,221 --> 01:37:32,090
And this is the reality and the fourth,
the Douche bag and

1726
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:34,430
thanks to you, by the way, I don't know.

1727
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:36,400
I'm guessing I'm going to
have to blame you for it.

1728
01:37:36,401 --> 01:37:39,190
Now on Twitter where it
says similar to you, Oprah,

1729
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,400
the whole file comes up now
has to be because of you.

1730
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,500
Because I like about Oprah.

1731
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:49,710
I think she is a positive
voice to people like her.

1732
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,870
She's a positive voice to older women.

1733
01:37:51,871 --> 01:37:53,700
She gives him something
to look forward to.

1734
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:58,350
She has this fanatical following of
likeminded people in her message is

1735
01:37:58,351 --> 01:37:59,320
essentially positive.

1736
01:37:59,321 --> 01:38:03,600
Her messages of life improvement and
of dietary improvement and behavioral

1737
01:38:03,601 --> 01:38:06,960
improvement or messages of spreading love.
She's nothing like me.

1738
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:07,950
There's nothing about her.

1739
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:11,340
I bet she probably hates everything
I've ever done of every outside of news

1740
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:16,010
radio. She likes your MMA. I bet she hates
UFC. I bet she hates fear factor out of,

1741
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:19,320
but it's all good. I'm very
different human being than she is.

1742
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:23,280
But I recognize that as a
human being who she is is uh,

1743
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:27,930
very beneficial and very important to
people like her. I like, I like it.

1744
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:32,100
Game recognizes game son.
She's positive. Yeah,

1745
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:35,520
I think she's a fucking ego
maniacal. Well she, me, she might be.

1746
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:39,540
I had a friend who works
for and he painted a very
different picture of her. Uh,

1747
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:40,590
then, uh, you know,

1748
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:44,520
you see of her on her show when she's
being interviewed by likeminded people.

1749
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:48,660
But my friend who interviewed her is
kind of a cunt and he likes to start

1750
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:51,960
arguments and I bet he would have a
real hard time working for some powerful

1751
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:55,370
woman. And I said, I assume that that's
probably what happened. You know,

1752
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,250
he got stupid with her because he used
to get stupid with me when we worked

1753
01:38:58,251 --> 01:39:02,250
together. So I'm assuming with her it was
probably even grocer, you know? I mean,

1754
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:06,390
I just did the math, but you know, I
mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just,

1755
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:08,600
you don't like her because
of your own personal,

1756
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,950
but I didn't like it before that.
What didn't you like about it before that?

1757
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:14,640
She's an ego maniacal phone.
It's all [inaudible] Oprah.
She doesn't give a play.

1758
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:19,140
It's like the last week where there
people on her farewell shows where there's

1759
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,730
tea,
there's uh,

1760
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:25,590
people are gathered around to honor this
woman that they've made a billionaire.

1761
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,430
Like thank you for letting
us make you a billionaire.

1762
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,800
And she likes fucking like this.

1763
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:36,330
Like a fucking like a queen or something.
Okay.

1764
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:39,180
But how would she have handled it?
How, what's the other way to handle it?

1765
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:43,210
Came out and start flicking them all. Just
say good night. Do a final show. Well,

1766
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:43,681
you know,

1767
01:39:43,681 --> 01:39:47,730
maybe she wanted to give them the chance
to say thank you and she wanted to give

1768
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:51,240
herself a chance to thank them.
Why didn't Johnny Carson do that?

1769
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:54,710
Why did Johnny Carson smoked five packs
of cigarettes a day and dive a fucking

1770
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:57,090
magazines because he's a bad ass.

1771
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:58,680
You ever see the pictures of
him when he's about to die?

1772
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:00,300
I'll never forget these photos.

1773
01:40:00,301 --> 01:40:02,190
They had them in like star
magazine or one of those things.

1774
01:40:02,191 --> 01:40:03,510
He had this giant gut,

1775
01:40:03,511 --> 01:40:08,070
like he swallowed a basketball and he
was smoking like call malls and he was

1776
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:10,620
just insanely unhealthy when he died.

1777
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,300
It's amazing when you think of a guy who
was that loved by so many people was so

1778
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:19,800
fucking miserable, so miserable. Uh, yeah.

1779
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,540
You ever hear Wayne Newton
talk about them? No.

1780
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:25,920
Wayne Newton talking about Johnny Carson
is the most hilarious shit cause Johnny

1781
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:25,921
Carson,

1782
01:40:25,921 --> 01:40:29,610
we should tell jokes about Wayne Newton
and his shit on Wayne noon and Wayne

1783
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:31,890
Newton was, you know, he's a fucking
ego maniac and he couldn't take it.

1784
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:35,520
So apparently like he confronted
Johnny Carson and grabbed him at,

1785
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:37,770
threatened them and said he was
going to kick his ass and yeah,

1786
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,930
that's pretty funny.
Anyway,

1787
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:43,380
Johnny Carson's stopped doing it
and like flew in to see him. Yeah,

1788
01:40:43,381 --> 01:40:46,770
it was pretty funny. I wonder if
it's true though. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1789
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:49,050
I mean Newton might've said
that he threatened him.

1790
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:51,570
He might've gotten in there and so you
stopped telling the drugs by me and

1791
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,740
Johnny one kicked this fucking guy out
of here. They probably pull the bed.

1792
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:58,030
What I like about you and your
toughness is that you don't,

1793
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:03,040
uh, you're so physically
threatening that you don't,

1794
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:07,900
you just, the parameters with you
are very clear. Whereas I think with,

1795
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:11,170
I just, I ate, we'll never
get to violence with you,

1796
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:13,960
but I liked it if you just said like,
Hey, would you stop doing jokes about me?

1797
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,610
People would just do it.

1798
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:18,180
Yeah.

1799
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:21,210
I don't think anybody's really worried
about physical violence in this day and

1800
01:41:21,211 --> 01:41:23,820
age, you know, not from
someone kicking their ass.

1801
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,330
This is so much at stake and so much
to even pretend that you would do that.

1802
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:27,991
Like,
you know,

1803
01:41:27,991 --> 01:41:30,090
I'm going to go kick some of these
asks cause they told jokes about you.

1804
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:33,090
That's silly. I'm not, I don't
think that way ever. My, you know,

1805
01:41:33,091 --> 01:41:37,860
I've never been one who's into getting
in fights. Never. Even when I was young,

1806
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:38,401
I just,

1807
01:41:38,401 --> 01:41:41,580
I think it's dangerous and scary and
I've seen too many people get fucked up.

1808
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:46,530
I just been into martial arts and so I
was a kid because I have terrible primate,

1809
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:51,120
savage instincts and I'm trying to curb
every fucking step of the way I'm doing

1810
01:41:51,121 --> 01:41:55,230
it to try not to fuck people up. I'm
doing it. Sure. I try to not get angry,

1811
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,153
you know?
Yeah.

1812
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:59,970
Uh, no, that's good. But that, that
was what the thing with you and Carlos,

1813
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:04,470
that was what your size,
uh,

1814
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:08,580
made it,
it kind of took that off the table.

1815
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:11,940
Like you couldn't be like fuck you and
fight you. It just, and I also think,

1816
01:42:11,941 --> 01:42:12,331
and that's,

1817
01:42:12,331 --> 01:42:16,770
I don't know if you remember when I gave
you $20 a few weeks after it cause I

1818
01:42:16,771 --> 01:42:20,490
just thought you deserve,
you deserve recompense for what you did.

1819
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,840
But I think that you're the only
one who ever did that. That video,

1820
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:28,590
that video made it,
uh,

1821
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:33,020
made joke thievery and unacceptable.
And I think that that Carlos,

1822
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:37,130
his career has suffered as a result
of the video because it just made,

1823
01:42:37,131 --> 01:42:40,240
it made something that was a behind the
scenes and only communities, you know,

1824
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:42,150
and it made it put it in the public eye.

1825
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,720
Well it's also because of Brian.

1826
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:48,250
Brian is wanting to edit it and edit
it the way he edited it and made it so

1827
01:42:48,251 --> 01:42:51,910
entertaining news 10 fucking minutes long,
listen to 10 minutes of that nonsense.

1828
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,430
This argument back and
forth between two comedians.

1829
01:42:54,431 --> 01:42:57,550
It would have been really boring and it
probably would've gotten not a fraction

1830
01:42:57,551 --> 01:42:58,384
of the hits.

1831
01:42:58,390 --> 01:43:01,860
He made it so interesting because he had
all these other people saying that see

1832
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:06,130
mencias steel's material and going back
in time and you know, and, and you know,

1833
01:43:06,131 --> 01:43:07,480
switching the time and that you know,

1834
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:10,420
where you go in the past and then the
future and you know, going back and forth.

1835
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:13,210
He made it really fascinating to watch.
That was

1836
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:13,781
what's,

1837
01:43:13,781 --> 01:43:16,300
what's the luxury about that whole thing
that happened is actually I had been

1838
01:43:16,301 --> 01:43:19,810
doing my research about the guy wait
beforehand and I actually had made a prior

1839
01:43:19,811 --> 01:43:22,320
video that you did your
doctoral thesis? Yeah. Yeah.

1840
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:26,110
I mean I was waiting for a day like this
to happen and it all like pretty much

1841
01:43:26,111 --> 01:43:27,610
Bates the first time I ever met him.

1842
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:31,510
Like he like stopped and it like
went shoulder to shoulder with me.

1843
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,700
He looked at me and did that
chicken neck thing where he's like,

1844
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:36,880
like that kind of like to make me flinch
or something like that can get out of

1845
01:43:36,881 --> 01:43:41,190
my way, get out of my way. And I'm
like, really? Okay. Are you, were you

1846
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:47,350
hanging out at the comedy store talking
to Duncan Trussell and uh, he's a cunt,

1847
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:48,820
you know,
it's weird.

1848
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:51,810
He was a real problem, you know, there,

1849
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:55,580
I've never been in a situation like
that where you really realize how the

1850
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:59,240
business is structured and
that no agents gave a fuck.

1851
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:00,830
No club owners gave a fuck.

1852
01:44:00,831 --> 01:44:04,460
Everybody knew he was stealing shit
and they kept using him because he was

1853
01:44:04,461 --> 01:44:05,630
putting asses in seats.

1854
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,840
And it was so shocking to watch everybody
turn a blind eye to him cannibalizing

1855
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:12,210
old Richard Pryor seat.

1856
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:17,030
Right as you went around those
people to the audience and said, Hey,

1857
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:20,720
are you both did and said, hey,
this is what's actually happening.

1858
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:25,400
And the people have since spoken
with fewer asses in seats.

1859
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:29,530
Well you can also read his Twitter and
you realize how fucking crazy he really

1860
01:44:29,531 --> 01:44:32,350
is and watch his little Facebook
videos that he puts out.

1861
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,000
Then you get to see the real human being.

1862
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:38,080
Now behind this facade of being a fake
Mexican and now being the number one

1863
01:44:38,081 --> 01:44:39,310
Latino comic,
you know,

1864
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:43,270
but the reality is the Latino market is
fucking gigantic and they were looking

1865
01:44:43,271 --> 01:44:46,030
for a superstar. And so
Mitzi shore said, hey,

1866
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,250
why don't you change your name to Mexican?

1867
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,840
So she made him become this phase.
Actual name was Carlos Mexican.

1868
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:56,550
That was Mitsis ideas. Name's
Ned. That's a stranger.

1869
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:56,831
Yeah,

1870
01:44:56,831 --> 01:45:01,831
but not that I really liked that in
that it made people more aware of joke

1871
01:45:02,021 --> 01:45:04,600
thieves and it made it,
it's people,

1872
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,880
there was another like
confrontation like a month ago,

1873
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:13,360
guys material, which was excellent.
Yeah. I didn't see it, but uh, I,

1874
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:17,820
I heard it's pretty good. I don't want to
even, I, I'm so connected to that world.

1875
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,550
It's like I avoid led.
Yes.

1876
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:25,730
That world plagiarism
and exposing plagiarism.

1877
01:45:25,891 --> 01:45:28,260
Like I don't want to,
I just don't enough already.

1878
01:45:28,261 --> 01:45:30,710
I've said more than enough
negative shit about it. It was a,

1879
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:35,040
an issue that had to be dealt with and
an issue unlike any people bring up all

1880
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:38,160
these arguments about parallel
thinking and you're absolutely right.

1881
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:41,940
I've had jokes that I thought, I
know I wrote. I know I wrote. Yeah.

1882
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:45,240
And then I'll watch some
fucking HBO special from 1984.

1883
01:45:45,241 --> 01:45:48,360
And it's like basically the same premise.
Here's a perfect example.

1884
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:53,130
Yesterday we were talking about a racist
about if dolphins could talk and we

1885
01:45:53,131 --> 01:45:53,880
were talking about they,

1886
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,930
cause they came up with a machine
to decipher dolphin language. Right.

1887
01:45:56,970 --> 01:46:00,380
And then I said, uh, that we
would have the first words
were I hate Jews. You know,

1888
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:03,600
and then we, I was watching a clip,
somebody posted on the message board,

1889
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:08,180
you guys did a bit of a Chappelle show
were racist Dolphin and here the nigger

1890
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:09,270
hating dolphin.
Yeah.

1891
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:13,480
I'm here to reclaim that bit
from you Joe. I did a bit, uh,

1892
01:46:13,481 --> 01:46:17,980
I was doing it for like three weeks.
It was killing so hard that I had to,

1893
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:21,710
I had to close with it cause it
was just killing so hard. Uh,

1894
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:26,860
and then about three weeks into doing it,
Jim Norton goes,

1895
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:30,300
Hey Jim Florentine used
to do with that bit. Fuck.

1896
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:35,440
So then I see Florentine and he's like,
I did it 15 years ago and he's like,

1897
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:38,400
you should do it. And I was
Kinda like, I can't. Yeah, it's,

1898
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:42,720
it sucks cause it's one of those things
it's like, ah fuck. It was such a good,

1899
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:45,700
and I know I wrote it like I,
cause I remember Joe,

1900
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:48,780
I work with this kid in Vegas
and he was doing bits off my old,

1901
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:53,280
my CD from 1999 he did three bits.
Yeah.

1902
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:57,060
Just reworked them and changed them. So a
few years back our, he couldn't make it.

1903
01:46:57,061 --> 01:47:01,830
And Anyway, long story. Uh, so I
was like, you know, do I even say,

1904
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:04,270
I mean I'm not doing any of this
stuff anymore. I don't do it anymore,

1905
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:05,310
but God damn dude,

1906
01:47:05,311 --> 01:47:07,800
I mean you're going on right in front
of me and you're redoing my own,

1907
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:11,460
my old fucking material. Did you say
anything? No, no. He was so terrible.

1908
01:47:11,461 --> 01:47:13,920
It was like, you know, I'm never going
to run with this guy again anyway.

1909
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:18,390
The odds are know. Yeah, it was. But
you know, when you have a bit that,

1910
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:21,870
you know, you found out that someone,
you know, George Carlin did 20 years ago,

1911
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:22,704
you got to let it go.

1912
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:23,431
Yeah.
I mean,

1913
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:28,431
but there are bits that I've written
that that recently that like someone else

1914
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:31,890
and it's Kinda like I don't fucking,
and then you get into what day

1915
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:34,930
did you write it? Well, you
know it's a tweet. Everything.

1916
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,500
There's certain things like the news
stories when things happen that it's

1917
01:47:38,501 --> 01:47:42,490
unavoidable. When you know the Mel
Gibson arrest happened unavoidable,

1918
01:47:42,491 --> 01:47:44,020
there's going to be some similar shit.

1919
01:47:44,021 --> 01:47:46,150
You know when you're talking about
Charlie Sheen is going to be some similar

1920
01:47:46,151 --> 01:47:48,010
shit,
but when it comes to like,

1921
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:51,220
you know a a bit that's like
really like a signature premise.

1922
01:47:51,221 --> 01:47:53,410
I've had this issue with a couple
of friends where I was like, dude,

1923
01:47:53,411 --> 01:47:54,810
you've got to drop that bit.
You know,

1924
01:47:54,811 --> 01:47:57,310
that's this guy that's like
real similar to this. It's been,

1925
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:59,980
I've heard it before and they go, yeah, I
don't think it's that similar. I'm like,

1926
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:01,780
look, you're going to do it.
What are you going to do it?

1927
01:48:01,781 --> 01:48:05,080
You're going to be this unoriginal
guy, man. You someone in the audience,

1928
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,260
you're going to be out there on stage
and you must know that there's 300 people

1929
01:48:08,261 --> 01:48:12,310
out there. Someone knows
that there's another guy who
does that bit, at least one,

1930
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:15,910
maybe one person for me, I can't
do it for me. I can't do that bit.

1931
01:48:15,911 --> 01:48:19,510
Now if you can do that bit to me that
says something about you artistically,

1932
01:48:19,511 --> 01:48:21,850
that you're, you're, you got
some low standards, you know,

1933
01:48:21,851 --> 01:48:24,100
and that you're willing to compromise
to come up with new material,

1934
01:48:24,101 --> 01:48:25,630
which is like really close to stealing.

1935
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:29,180
It's like, yeah, that's one
of those things. It's a bit
of a, that's like, that's a,

1936
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,790
how do you live with yourself?

1937
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:35,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It sucks man. But
sometimes you've got to let things go.

1938
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,780
I mean, it is sometimes, you
know, someone will say, Oh,

1939
01:48:36,781 --> 01:48:39,260
this guy has a bit just like that.
And then he'd go, oh no, he doesn't.

1940
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:41,730
You listen to it and it's
like a similar premise,

1941
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:43,680
but you went in a totally
different direction with it.

1942
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:45,830
Yeah. Some kid accused me, I did,

1943
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:50,180
I wrote something on Twitter like two
months ago and some kid was like, zs.

1944
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:54,650
Aziz Ansari did that bit
on fucking his special.

1945
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:57,770
And I was like, I know. How
do you think I got the idea?

1946
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:03,450
Well, we were making fun of m
a r Kelly's video, real talk,

1947
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:06,510
which I watched again after a year.
I haven't seen it either. Video.

1948
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:09,600
I have a song memorized.
See the video, the videos.

1949
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:13,570
It's one of the greatest videos. Milton.
Milton. Milton. Yeah. He's trying to,

1950
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,930
Milton's at the end of the fighting,
they stop the fight or flight.

1951
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,900
It goes bogus girl. Yeah. Bitch.

1952
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:23,420
I wish you fun clothes. And so, uh,

1953
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:26,750
we were making fun of it on the
podcast and someone tweets me. Yeah.

1954
01:49:26,910 --> 01:49:31,320
Aziz [inaudible] already mixed
fun of it. I'm writing. No,

1955
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,820
he doesn't know that.
Sorry.

1956
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:36,690
You don't get to own one of the greatest
fucking unintentional pieces of comedy

1957
01:49:36,691 --> 01:49:39,570
ever. I don't care if he makes fun of
it. I haven't seen him make fun of it.

1958
01:49:39,571 --> 01:49:42,060
I'm sure he does. I know
he does. An r Kelly bit.

1959
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:43,890
You don't own make it fun to r Kelly.

1960
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:47,530
That's like owning making fun of Michael
Jackson or make it fun to Shaquille

1961
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:49,180
O'neil. You don't, yeah.
You don't make your own.

1962
01:49:49,181 --> 01:49:52,090
You don't own making fun of something
ridiculous. Yeah. So there's that.

1963
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,920
I see that.
But man,

1964
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:57,730
when you find a joke that you know that
used to be on some fucking Richard Pryor

1965
01:49:57,731 --> 01:49:59,650
CD,
you gotta let that job.

1966
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:00,560
Yeah.
It's hard.

1967
01:50:00,590 --> 01:50:03,950
I mean even cause I have a good
memory for jokes so it becomes like a,

1968
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:08,180
it becomes a hard,
but I guess it just forced you to be

1969
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:11,080
more original. That's when I
knew him and see was a thief.

1970
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:14,650
There was a first thing that he ever did
where it really popped a red flag back

1971
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:19,651
when we were friends is he did a bit
about a Ufo landing in the hood and that's

1972
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:23,700
like some old negatives or
steal that shit. You know,

1973
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:26,710
thinking about stealing
the Ufo from the aliens.

1974
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:31,800
Chappelle did a joke when he was in
high school that if alf came to his

1975
01:50:31,801 --> 01:50:36,240
neighborhood, uh, a week later you'd
see a nigger in an alf skin coat

1976
01:50:39,890 --> 01:50:44,590
and he was like 15. That was your
body. That's fine. Uh, yeah, yeah,

1977
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:48,900
yeah. So Carl, so you really, yeah.
You just kind of go, ah, yeah.

1978
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,180
Makes you not really want to
get a drink with them after.

1979
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:54,280
Well, it made me, made me like tell
him and then I told him, he said, no,

1980
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:57,110
I've been doing that bit for a
while. I go, do, do, do, do bits Ana,

1981
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:00,760
unless you've been doing it since 1981,
not even seventies.

1982
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:02,620
Like that nigger's crazy.
It's on that one.

1983
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,170
I think it's thinking it's one of the old,
it's like a set.

1984
01:51:05,171 --> 01:51:09,370
It's probably just released recently
on CD or something, you know? And uh,

1985
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:12,430
you know, he was like insisting on doing
the pin. I'm like, wow, that's crazy.

1986
01:51:12,431 --> 01:51:13,360
Like you're telling me that,

1987
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:17,170
you know that Richard Pryor did it already
and they to keep doing it because you

1988
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,190
came up with it on your own.

1989
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:21,060
Yeah, I look at that bill Cosby
wine, you know, playing football.

1990
01:51:21,061 --> 01:51:24,670
Either your dad that was, that was the
one that you guys inspired and do that,

1991
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:26,620
you know? I know, but
that because of you guys,

1992
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:28,840
that was the nail and that was
the final nail in the coffin.

1993
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,370
Yeah, I think so. I think that was the one
where people went, what the fuck? Like,

1994
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:37,490
there's like, he's a sacred,
you know, deity in comedy.
Bill Cosby. Yeah. You know,

1995
01:51:37,491 --> 01:51:39,570
there's not a single comic that'll,
you know,

1996
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:42,710
ever tell you that bill Cosby
ain't shit. You know, those,

1997
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:47,320
the fucking Noah's Ark bit, you
know, and Noah, what, you know,

1998
01:51:47,321 --> 01:51:49,200
you remember that bit,
that whole thing.

1999
01:51:49,201 --> 01:51:53,120
And he used to do like his stories
these long, like, he was like,

2000
01:51:53,121 --> 01:51:57,500
he had a real particular style of
comedy man. Yeah. He invented the,

2001
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:00,530
he invented a style. Yeah. The long story.

2002
01:52:00,531 --> 01:52:02,510
And when a punchline at the
end of this story, you know,

2003
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,750
I, I'm not a fan of his show. I
wasn't a fan of the Cosby show,

2004
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:09,470
know what I really want to
give was just condescending.

2005
01:52:09,471 --> 01:52:11,000
It was just the whole shell was like,

2006
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:16,310
children are morons and I'm going
to chop them down every week.

2007
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:20,080
I'm just kind of like, all
right, man. Yeah. Well, you
know, it's a fucking Sitcom,

2008
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:24,650
man. Yeah, no, I get it. But honestly,
calm you like, I liked family tides.

2009
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:29,360
I'm not even fucking around.
Like, I liked family ties. Uh,

2010
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:33,200
but that's about d like
two and a half men. Uh,

2011
01:52:33,201 --> 01:52:35,330
I'll say this for two and a half men.

2012
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:40,420
I've seen it on mute a few times on the
plane and it looks like they're having a

2013
01:52:41,061 --> 01:52:41,894
good time.

2014
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:48,740
Then maybe the best anyone has ever
really done all these guys are with a good

2015
01:52:48,741 --> 01:52:51,350
time and then on occasion I'll hear
like a Dick joke and I'm always like,

2016
01:52:51,351 --> 01:52:55,730
that's a pretty strong dick joke for
the, for, for a sitcom at that time slot.

2017
01:52:55,890 --> 01:52:59,190
I only watched it once recently and I
thought it was the most unbearable thing

2018
01:52:59,191 --> 01:53:02,430
I'd ever seen on television and I thought
it was incredible that it's so popular.

2019
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:05,040
We were talking about it yesterday.
I, I'm, I'm, I was baffled by it.

2020
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:09,030
I couldn't believe how bad the jokes
were. I was like, this is just,

2021
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:11,250
this is just an alien language.
Right.

2022
01:53:11,251 --> 01:53:14,010
I'm watching it with my mouth open and
I'm hearing the laugh track and I'm like,

2023
01:53:14,011 --> 01:53:15,240
this isn't even my language.

2024
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:16,010
Yeah.

2025
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:19,620
If you don't watch a show with a laugh
track for a while and then you do your

2026
01:53:19,621 --> 01:53:20,330
life.

2027
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:20,830
Yeah,

2028
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:25,240
I would like to watch it and have it all
the laughs extracted like someone do it

2029
01:53:25,241 --> 01:53:26,580
through pro tools,
go in there,

2030
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:31,330
extract all the labs and just have him
say that the jokes and have no response

2031
01:53:31,331 --> 01:53:33,310
and see how they fucking bizarre.

2032
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:33,950
She had,

2033
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:38,690
I wanted to do that where every po you
take the lapse out and then every punch

2034
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:42,030
line I just go Bam.
But I mean

2035
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:46,270
see like, you know the curb, your
enthusiasm has no laugh track. You know,

2036
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:47,410
and it's hilarious.

2037
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:52,180
But if you did that with like a show
like two and a half men take out all the

2038
01:53:52,181 --> 01:53:55,810
laughs. Yeah. And only have them
act out the scene. It's fucking

2039
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:59,170
posture. But having said that,
cheers. Had a laugh, track sign photo,

2040
01:53:59,171 --> 01:54:00,680
the laugh track friends had a,

2041
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:02,630
hey,
there's nothing wrong with a laugh track.

2042
01:54:02,631 --> 01:54:05,030
What I'm saying is when
something's really horrible. Yeah.

2043
01:54:05,031 --> 01:54:07,040
And then you're just
faking it. Yeah. And when,

2044
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:10,170
if you could just listen to it without
the laughter, it would be so soon.

2045
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:14,990
That's like that movie that looks
that like, uh, the movie with them.

2046
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:16,730
I always forget the guy's name,

2047
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:21,440
the guy from who hosted the Oscars
and he's handsome. He brought over

2048
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:27,980
playing the steel steel robot boxers.
That looks good.

2049
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:32,360
I get that lifts off.
It's like transforming a boxing match.

2050
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:35,170
It's like a boxing the deck.
Rocky mixed the transformer.

2051
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:40,280
Everyone looks like this is
called a real steal. Rosio.

2052
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:43,460
At first I thought it was a
knock. 'Em sock. 'Em Mood. It is.

2053
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:45,820
And that's pretty much what it is.
Yeah. I thought it looked good.

2054
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:46,550
Just cause I liked that.

2055
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:51,260
Transformers Hugh Jackman shirtless
in the real steel trailer.

2056
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:54,560
I am. I want to see that
bastard. I'm a nerd.

2057
01:54:54,650 --> 01:54:57,880
You fucking ruined the
Wolverine Character, man. I
don't care what anyone says.

2058
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:01,530
Wolverine supposed to be like
five foot three and built.

2059
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:04,350
I find those movies pitiful.
I find the odd,

2060
01:55:04,351 --> 01:55:07,110
the fact that they can only do
superhero movies now, just pitiful.

2061
01:55:07,111 --> 01:55:09,480
Like it's there. It's, I
told someone it's like,

2062
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:14,490
it's there for dumb people to be
able to explain to other dumb people.

2063
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:19,491
Like there's a dude and he got bit by
a spider and he's half and half man,

2064
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:22,350
and he wears a uniform.

2065
01:55:22,351 --> 01:55:27,060
So you're never confused about who's
who and he's got a logo on the superman,

2066
01:55:27,061 --> 01:55:30,510
has a logo on the front and
the back in case you get them.

2067
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:34,650
You're telling me you don't like
comic book movies, man. Uh, I liked,

2068
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:38,370
I'm such an old man. I liked to
Chris Reeves, Superman. Whoa.

2069
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:41,760
And uh,
which other ones have I liked?

2070
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:45,500
I didn't like men. I didn't like,
uh, yeah, like Spiderman. Okay.

2071
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:49,530
I'm watching the trailer for this,
this rock 'em sock. 'Em robots movie.

2072
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,930
Oh, I like the Batman movies.
I like the new Batman.

2073
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:56,790
I like the Tim Burton ones and I liked
the, uh, the, the, what does names?

2074
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:57,440
Yeah.

2075
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:58,400
This,
by the way,

2076
01:55:58,401 --> 01:56:02,270
this premise of this film where there's
robots and the people like where this

2077
01:56:02,271 --> 01:56:06,080
robot outfit and get in fights.
It's a fucking great idea, man.

2078
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,580
That's actually real robots.
Oh,

2079
01:56:07,581 --> 01:56:10,430
these are robots in their controlling
them remotely. That's what it is.

2080
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,230
No, they're just, they're
just training robots.

2081
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:17,700
Have our Avatar robot.

2082
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:21,100
Yes. Pretty fucking.
Have Avatar robot fights.

2083
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:24,610
To me it's no different than racing cars.
You know what you're racing cars,

2084
01:56:24,611 --> 01:56:26,920
you know, you're not supposed to be
moving that fast. You're using a machine,

2085
01:56:26,921 --> 01:56:28,030
move that fast,
you know,

2086
01:56:28,031 --> 01:56:30,700
and you're bumping into each other and
cutting and cutting each other off.

2087
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,140
In one of those that was
in, uh, it was in, um,

2088
01:56:35,170 --> 01:56:38,890
the end of x men or the
end of, uh, of, of uh,

2089
01:56:39,310 --> 01:56:43,600
ironman wasn't, that wasn't Jeff
Daniels and like, uh, or it didn't,

2090
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:45,320
didn't I liked that movie too.

2091
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:50,580
Yeah. All right man. It was fun, right?
Yeah. He's a new cognac. It looks fun.

2092
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:54,570
A lot of people are shitting on it online.
It looks pretty fucking bad ass to me.

2093
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:58,110
And they're like saying that they owe
that guy can't be cone and he's not built

2094
01:56:58,111 --> 01:56:59,310
enough. He's not this. No.

2095
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:04,360
Nobody really looked like
Arnold Schwarzenegger and
the fucking 1500 BC. Right.

2096
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:07,080
That shit's unrealistic. No carbs. Yeah.

2097
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:10,750
All red meat back then he was
on a strict diet in the, in the,

2098
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:14,240
in Paleolithic Times. Paleo Diet, Paleo.

2099
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:16,650
That's what a lot of people are
doing right now. Cause that's true.

2100
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:18,780
It's all the rage. I didn't
know that. That's a good book.

2101
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:23,670
Paleo diet is all like vegetables. No
grains, no rice. Oh yes, that's good.

2102
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:26,870
It's all things that are meat
and vegetables. You know,

2103
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:30,900
things that people in the Paleolithic
would've eaten right before agriculture,

2104
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:32,670
before hot dogs and shit.

2105
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:38,100
Um, yeah, those, those uh, you
think that that's, I guess I'm, I'm,

2106
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:41,710
I'm out of touch with what
the people want. Yeah.

2107
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:46,390
I just a big fan of robots and,
and good CGI.

2108
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:49,900
Yesterday's you're a big fan of frogs now.

2109
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:54,130
Doesn't it look like good CGI in a
financial way of looking at this movie?

2110
01:57:54,131 --> 01:57:55,660
I think it's the most genius thing ever.

2111
01:57:55,661 --> 01:57:58,930
You're mixing like fighting
like UFC mixing it like robots.

2112
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:04,140
Like it was generated by a computer
robots and fighting like the was a guy who

2113
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:12,880
had guys down on his luck and then
the, you know. Yeah I see that too.

2114
01:58:12,881 --> 01:58:16,840
I mean, but I don't know. I think it's
a good idea for kid, for a kid movie.

2115
01:58:16,841 --> 01:58:20,020
I'm guessing that's what this is kind
of like a teenager movie is good.

2116
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:24,500
You mean a movie? Cause that's their
all for fire off of these goddamn teens,

2117
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:28,750
teens. Uh, no. I've said, I told somebody
that if the Godfather was released today,

2118
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:33,130
Michael Corleone, a word,
a spandex suit, she on it

2119
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:39,530
and drive a fucking buy like a Batmobile,
but it'd be like no,

2120
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:41,700
be a cannoli movie.
Moly.

2121
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:45,040
And he would sue the G on it.

2122
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:48,870
Oh, how funny would that be if
somebody pitched that in the meeting?

2123
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:53,590
I just think he's the best.
I just, everybody loves
him. He's number one. Right?

2124
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:58,140
Right. Anyways, an outfit
that's different. He separates
him. Yeah. He puts it on.

2125
01:58:58,170 --> 01:59:01,080
He goes down, he fucks up and
know that they know who it is.

2126
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,820
Um, wait, everybody's got a costume.

2127
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:07,360
Just a costume that retarded
people can understand.

2128
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:13,070
That's superman. You just go, oh
yeah, he's fucking, I'm retarded.

2129
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:15,020
That definitely superman.

2130
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:19,450
What is your take on this
fucking Spiderman thing that
they're doing in Broadway?

2131
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:22,780
You know the, you know the whole
story behind this, the Spiderman play,

2132
01:59:22,781 --> 01:59:23,860
it's the biggest,

2133
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:27,970
most expensive play they've ever
produced by far on Broadway.

2134
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,840
And apparently it's a
fucking financial disaster

2135
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:35,330
and people are dying. People are getting
heard of their fucking backs and shit.

2136
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:38,600
I was,
if there was another accident,

2137
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:39,850
I was gonna do a Twitter,

2138
01:59:39,851 --> 01:59:44,500
a tweet where I'm Spiderman himself
came out and condemn the music.

2139
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:48,650
I was like, look, we've
got to stop as Spiderman.

2140
01:59:48,690 --> 01:59:51,780
Please give me a bad name.
That's funny. Yeah, no shit.

2141
01:59:51,781 --> 01:59:54,120
Does this the thing where
this is the guy's a hero.

2142
01:59:54,121 --> 01:59:57,030
He wants to save people and it's flooding
and it's just more people have been

2143
01:59:57,031 --> 02:00:01,530
injured then. Yeah. Then they've
killed more people in the Green Goblin.

2144
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:03,020
Am I right? Yeah. I'm all right ladies.

2145
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:07,140
They're flying around during
this broadcast, right?

2146
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:09,420
They're only there during
this, uh, this performance

2147
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,660
flounced around like they're on a Webinar,
they've reopened it.

2148
02:00:12,661 --> 02:00:16,290
They're trying to just read it, brought
the original director back. It's just,

2149
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:18,570
it's like, hey, you just want
to say it. I'm like, Hey,

2150
02:00:18,571 --> 02:00:21,860
you guys know you don't have to do
this. You're going to stop. Right.

2151
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:23,610
That is everybody. Like,
just maybe just stop.

2152
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:27,140
It's hard though. Once you
commit to something, it's
pretty much over. You know,

2153
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:31,610
it's very difficult to quit something
once you're rolling. Admit that

2154
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,840
you know there's a, the term is motivated
reasoning where you just go, oh no, no,

2155
02:00:35,841 --> 02:00:36,960
it's good.
Yeah.

2156
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:41,660
The whole reason you're saying is
because you want it to be good.

2157
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:44,060
You also tell what people's pitch.

2158
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:44,850
Oh yeah.

2159
02:00:44,850 --> 02:00:48,600
The worst is when you go to a table
reads and you hear the producers with the

2160
02:00:48,601 --> 02:00:50,090
fake laugh because yeah,

2161
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:53,950
try not make sense. Is that
there's any, yeah. Anything Grocer.

2162
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:58,440
It's a, it's, it makes you want to, it
makes you want to move to wherever I am,

2163
02:00:58,441 --> 02:00:58,630
right?

2164
02:00:58,630 --> 02:01:02,750
No, whatever the fuck I am.
The hills. If you want to,

2165
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:05,530
you think stalkers
wouldn't even bother you,

2166
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:09,370
would it to stock you out here
would take a lot of money.

2167
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:13,330
You spend a lot of money on gas.
Getting down here,

2168
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:17,250
nothing. I, I would be very
happy if I didn't have my,

2169
02:01:17,251 --> 02:01:20,640
a marital situation and children
be very happy living in the woods.

2170
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:24,270
I would like it, but the, all the
people that I see when I do the UFC,

2171
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:27,120
all the people that I see when I do
comedy shows and all the other bullshit,

2172
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:31,490
I need the opposite. I need to, I need
a balance. I need to counterbalance that

2173
02:01:31,490 --> 02:01:35,330
documentary.
And in the shining a DVD,

2174
02:01:35,331 --> 02:01:38,990
there was a documentary that Kubrick's
wife made. No, it's excellent.

2175
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:43,190
Like scat man Crothers is just
crying for no reason the best. Um,

2176
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:47,660
but uh,
Jack Nicholson says in the documentary,

2177
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:52,130
a famous person meets uh,
in uh,

2178
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:56,510
in a month the same amount of people
that a non famous person meets in a

2179
02:01:56,511 --> 02:01:59,510
lifetime. It's true. Yeah.
Which is just about true.

2180
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:03,130
Like just you have no capacity
to remember them anymore. It's a,

2181
02:02:03,131 --> 02:02:05,890
I get embarrassed sometimes
but not remembering people,

2182
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,140
but it's a thing called Dunbar's number.

2183
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:12,460
You literally only have running in
your burners hundred 52 plus, you know,

2184
02:02:12,580 --> 02:02:14,050
plus or minus.
But you know,

2185
02:02:14,051 --> 02:02:16,510
you only have room for that many
people in your brain and you know,

2186
02:02:16,511 --> 02:02:20,200
want every fucking weekend. I meet more
than that. Yeah. Every weekend at the UFC.

2187
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:23,090
Well that was, I met Obama
at the, at like a month ago,

2188
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:25,640
the on bin Ladin Eve cause my really,

2189
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:30,020
yeah cause my buddy Seth Meyers hosted
the correspondence center and I wrote a

2190
02:02:30,021 --> 02:02:34,460
bunch of shift form. And so I was there
and I met Obama. And so that debt and,

2191
02:02:34,461 --> 02:02:38,420
and we had a really fucking
funny, cool exchange. Like,

2192
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:41,600
like I said, uh, I, my
name's Neal Brennan,

2193
02:02:41,601 --> 02:02:44,570
I created Chappelle show cause I coker
British special cause I know Michelle was

2194
02:02:44,571 --> 02:02:46,430
a fan and he's like,
Oh man, we'd love that.

2195
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:49,430
In fact it's got to be the greatest show
of all time or something. I was like,

2196
02:02:49,431 --> 02:02:54,290
man, how cool would it be if you could
get him to say I'm Rick James Bitch. Uh,

2197
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:55,820
and uh, so he's like, Michelle,

2198
02:02:55,821 --> 02:02:58,340
this guy credit Chappelle show texture
has to have Michelle comes over.

2199
02:02:58,341 --> 02:03:00,920
And she's like, we were still upset when
it went off the air. And I was like,

2200
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:05,720
how do you think I felt? And so, so, uh,

2201
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:09,860
so then we have a exchange and I was like,
I'd said to Obama was like,

2202
02:03:09,861 --> 02:03:13,340
this is also odd man. I go, do you ever
get used to this? And he goes, nope.

2203
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,310
And he goes, but I can't just
up and retire like Dave did.

2204
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:18,340
Okay.

2205
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:23,190
Really funny. That day he had
gone to Alabama to survey the,

2206
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:27,460
the tornado.
He went to Cape Canaveral to,

2207
02:03:27,490 --> 02:03:30,670
they were going to launch something.
Gabby Giffords, the woman who got shot,

2208
02:03:30,671 --> 02:03:34,810
the senator guard, the congresswoman
who got shot was there, saw her,

2209
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,220
gave a commencement address at
a Miami Dade Community College,

2210
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:40,810
flies back to DC,

2211
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:45,880
has to be personal and engaging with all
these hundreds of people are lined up

2212
02:03:45,881 --> 02:03:50,200
to get a picture with him and
then he's got to do standup also.

2213
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:54,130
He's got a hit out on, been loud
that he knows. And the people like,

2214
02:03:54,131 --> 02:03:58,630
this guy's is too cool, easy to cool.
Would you want them like, oh my God,

2215
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,650
fucking stressed out. Like he's
not, he's the right amount of cool.

2216
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:07,030
And the fact that he knew
to be like, he, he'll,

2217
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:10,210
he probably doesn't even remember
meeting me. I'll never forget it.

2218
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:12,700
You know what I mean?
Like, and he knows that.

2219
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:16,670
He knows that part of the
job is just performing. Uh,

2220
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:21,190
the job of the president wears, you know,
you've got to perform Joe Rogan. Um,

2221
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:24,430
no, but I'm sure there's a party
that you, you just want to go,

2222
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:27,160
I don't give a fuck and walk
away, but you have to like, no,

2223
02:04:27,161 --> 02:04:30,260
it's part of your duties sometimes.
I don't think you asked.

2224
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:34,120
I don't think that you're overwhelmed.
You get overwhelmed, but you Kinda,

2225
02:04:34,210 --> 02:04:35,680
you kinda can't,
it's part of life.

2226
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:38,430
I would say that it just, people being
nice. You, it's what most of it is. It is.

2227
02:04:38,431 --> 02:04:41,560
Yeah. No, it really isn't. If you were
a hated person and that was going on,

2228
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:45,330
imagine if you're, you know, Monica
Lewinsky or someone like that. You know,

2229
02:04:45,331 --> 02:04:48,870
where everybody's like goofing
on you or a Le Bron, you know,

2230
02:04:48,871 --> 02:04:51,900
everybody hates him now,
you know, any, any that's,

2231
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:55,230
that's gotta be fucking really hard
to be a celebrity who's done something

2232
02:04:55,231 --> 02:04:57,630
really fucked up. I love, you know. Yeah.

2233
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:00,770
Yeah.
It's gotta make you gotta fuck with you.

2234
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,400
So what are you doing these days when,
when you have to,

2235
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:08,110
uh, doing stand up and, um, you know what,

2236
02:05:08,111 --> 02:05:09,460
I'm going to start doing it as a,

2237
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:12,580
I've been shooting cause I
like based on this paradigm,

2238
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:17,990
I'm kind of into the idea of just auto
to do everything myself, put it out like,

2239
02:05:18,190 --> 02:05:20,770
and so I've just been shooting
some sketches. I haven't shot,

2240
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,610
I haven't edited them yet, but I've
got a lot of sketch it. My brain is,

2241
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,490
my brain kind of wasn't working
that well for like two, three years.

2242
02:05:27,670 --> 02:05:28,800
It was just a little sluggish.

2243
02:05:28,801 --> 02:05:32,950
It was like my hard drive was full and
I started taking this shit called five

2244
02:05:32,951 --> 02:05:34,210
HTP.
Yes.

2245
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:39,660
And in sense that my brain
has just been like our fit.

2246
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:42,550
How much milligrams of per day are you
taking? Do you have any idea? A hundred.

2247
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:45,760
400, which is way too
many. Yeah. But I don't, I,

2248
02:05:45,761 --> 02:05:50,530
I've always suspected I didn't have
serotonin and this is serotonin. Um,

2249
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:55,180
so since then I've just been
spending a lot on ideas for sketches,

2250
02:05:55,181 --> 02:05:58,240
for stand up, you know,
for jokes, for whatever.

2251
02:05:58,241 --> 02:06:01,480
And it's gratifying that I'm going
to try to do it kind of on my own.

2252
02:06:01,481 --> 02:06:03,730
Cause I don't know, you
know, people always say,

2253
02:06:03,731 --> 02:06:06,010
why don't you write for
this show or that show?

2254
02:06:06,011 --> 02:06:10,540
I'll write for sath cause
he's my friend and, and uh,

2255
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:11,440
and I don't,

2256
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:15,970
and I don't want to be on a show where
I can't control what's being selected.

2257
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:16,381
Right.

2258
02:06:16,381 --> 02:06:18,570
So you don't want to do something on
the Internet where you can control ever.

2259
02:06:18,670 --> 02:06:19,990
Yeah.
Well I mean I can,

2260
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:24,130
I could probably have a show somewhere
and control a lot of it, but I just,

2261
02:06:24,190 --> 02:06:27,100
I just want to stop
craving corporate approval.

2262
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:32,700
I want to get past this idea of like
if you've been a benighted by Viacom or

2263
02:06:35,531 --> 02:06:36,670
whatever,
then you're more legit.

2264
02:06:36,671 --> 02:06:38,580
Cause that's the great thing about
Twitter and Facebook and all this stuff.

2265
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:41,800
He's like, it takes them
out of it, you know? Uh,

2266
02:06:41,890 --> 02:06:46,300
so I'm going to just try to shoot some
sketches and, and do stand up and,

2267
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:51,130
and I would love to be a standard. I would
love to like do what you do, you know,

2268
02:06:51,370 --> 02:06:55,430
obviously being,
doing the TV stuff greatly helped your,

2269
02:06:55,870 --> 02:06:56,710
your draw.

2270
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:59,260
Yeah. It all helps. But this has
helped more than, than anything.

2271
02:06:59,470 --> 02:07:03,580
This podcast has been the biggest impact
on my stand up by far by a giant long

2272
02:07:03,581 --> 02:07:04,480
shot.
That's great.

2273
02:07:04,510 --> 02:07:08,650
I never have been able to sell things
out way in advance like this before.

2274
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:12,230
And it's just from, from you feel like
people have a better understanding of you?

2275
02:07:12,850 --> 02:07:16,200
Yeah. In two things have happened. One,
I put out that comedy central special,

2276
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:18,970
my last one talking monkey's in space,
which is a good,

2277
02:07:19,030 --> 02:07:20,530
it was one of my best ones.

2278
02:07:20,531 --> 02:07:23,970
It was a real representative of a real
set too because a lot of times you're

2279
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:26,650
doing. And when did you release
it? Year and a half, two years ago.

2280
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:28,900
Something like that.
Year and a half. And um,

2281
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,590
when that came out it was
on comedy central, even less
like less than a year ago.

2282
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:36,010
Um, that made a big difference
because people say, oh, but

2283
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:38,830
the fucking knees actually got material.
It's actually funny. You know what,

2284
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:42,310
this bill burr said,
Netflix has been big for him.

2285
02:07:42,430 --> 02:07:45,610
I have a one on Netflix as well.
My first one I did was on Netflix.

2286
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:49,000
Netflix produced it in 2005
and then showtime bought it.

2287
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:51,190
So it was on showtime in 2006.

2288
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:55,540
But that wasn't as good as my talking
monkey's in space one. That's my best one.

2289
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:00,100
Yeah. So I mean, so that would be,
I finally have, I could do an hour,

2290
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:05,590
so I May, so that's when you're going
to do these music centers and you know,

2291
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:09,880
clubs. I'm going to go out and
start doing an hour and, and then,

2292
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:14,470
and then hopefully I'll, uh,
hopefully I can and I, you know, I,

2293
02:08:14,471 --> 02:08:16,160
I would also like to direct my own hour.

2294
02:08:16,161 --> 02:08:19,600
I think that would just be like a
Dickie, that'd be cool. Be Cool.

2295
02:08:19,601 --> 02:08:22,690
Like really cool. Yeah. Like,
cause I don't think anyone,
Louise probably done it.

2296
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:27,220
Um, but uh, but yeah, I just, I'm
sort of like aspirational again.

2297
02:08:27,221 --> 02:08:32,221
I just want to take the all of like
the sort of corporate shit out of it.

2298
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:37,870
Cause I just think it's,
it sets up a Shitty, yeah.

2299
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:41,040
Like I don't want to shoot something.
And then someone got like, they,

2300
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:44,380
the audience will may not see
this. And it's like, yeah,

2301
02:08:44,381 --> 02:08:48,970
but I shot it and it felt like me and
Doug did a pilot for showtime and it's not

2302
02:08:48,971 --> 02:08:53,500
bad like David off. Yeah. Uh, and it's,
it's all me and Doug do with thing.

2303
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:56,350
This just if there's any comedians
listening to this is really helpful.

2304
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:01,150
Once a week we have to write thousand
word essays and give them to each other.

2305
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:03,450
Like, so we have gays. Fuck,

2306
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:10,450
we have to. And so we have to,
uh, so it just helps writing,

2307
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:14,020
right. Of course. As yourself. Uh, but
yeah, so just the idea that people aren't,

2308
02:09:14,021 --> 02:09:17,580
you read a book, you guys should both
go write a book and you know that the,

2309
02:09:17,581 --> 02:09:19,810
the essays that you write to each
other back and forth for a year,

2310
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:23,150
that's a fucking great idea. 40
each other, they're just like about,

2311
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:25,750
they're basically stand up.
It's just trying to flush them out.

2312
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:30,010
But it's not like dove the fat
the past week with you has been,

2313
02:09:30,030 --> 02:09:32,590
I think we should start doing that.
You and me, we'll write to each other.

2314
02:09:33,590 --> 02:09:36,660
If you want to talk to each other, we can
make a podcast scared. Just scared of,

2315
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:37,150
right.
I'm

2316
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:41,350
scared to be judged. Uh,
yeah. So, so I, yeah,

2317
02:09:41,351 --> 02:09:45,640
just doing shit from the ground up
I guess. Cool. I mean, you know,

2318
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:49,780
I don't really have, I'm doing a bunch
of dates, which are, I'll be posting.

2319
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:53,280
What am I, what the fuck? I'm in
Chicago this weekend doing it.

2320
02:09:53,570 --> 02:09:58,570
I'm doing a show with George Lopez at
the Vic theater called Viva opening for

2321
02:09:59,381 --> 02:10:02,860
him. Viva Larissa? No, it's like
a heat. Everybody does like 20.

2322
02:10:02,861 --> 02:10:07,000
It's like four people do 20 minutes in
Emc. Really? Yeah. Called Viva Larissa.

2323
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:12,050
What is it? Ah, they've done like
three of them. Are You Spanish? Well,

2324
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:15,400
um, no, but I am a hard worker.

2325
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:21,790
Uh, are you willing to get a
Tan? Uh, they, uh, no I don't.

2326
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:25,610
It's just George. I think he just
sees it as like a way to, uh,

2327
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:29,890
have people that he thinks are
funny to time and he MCS and,

2328
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,130
and then I'm open for Seth,
uh,

2329
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:37,700
on Seth Meyers.
I think that's at the,

2330
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:41,060
that's somewhere in Chicago. It's so weird
that your friends, you look so similar.

2331
02:10:41,061 --> 02:10:44,180
I know it is fucking hot. Like people
think we're brothers from there. Um,

2332
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:49,230
if we were brothers I
wouldn't speak to him. No,

2333
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:52,010
it's a family joke. You guys get it.
So you've been through a lot of shit,

2334
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:54,500
but it seems like you're having
a good time. Yeah, man. I mean,

2335
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:56,960
sorry to blow your mix
up, but uh, but yeah,

2336
02:10:56,961 --> 02:10:59,990
like the Chevelle thing was not
easy on me. Like it was not,

2337
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:03,680
I don't even think I realized it.
Like how sort of rough it was,

2338
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:06,190
the disintegration cause it,
you know,

2339
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:08,240
we were best friends for
like 12 years before that.

2340
02:11:08,241 --> 02:11:12,100
So would you ever come on Dr Phil and
maybe with him and to work it out? Yeah,

2341
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:17,630
no, we've talked to Phil would
probably, oh no. Uh, Dr fell,

2342
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:20,490
Drew's got a pro now. Me
and Dee ever cool? No.

2343
02:11:20,590 --> 02:11:22,870
So what happened with him on the
plane when he freaked out on the unit?

2344
02:11:22,890 --> 02:11:24,780
Any information about that?
Uh,

2345
02:11:24,781 --> 02:11:27,940
I was on a plane somewhere and they've
actually shortened the flight and landed

2346
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:31,490
early because he was freaking out.
He told me that they were,

2347
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:36,910
the pilot was fucking with them
and just being a dick for TMC.

2348
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,330
I Dunno. For tms or like
they at TMZ was like their,

2349
02:11:41,331 --> 02:11:44,330
when they landed or something like
I dunno, that's what he told me.

2350
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:49,660
I didn't like the pilot called
TMZ from the cockpit. No,

2351
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,510
I don't. I honestly have no idea. That's,

2352
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:57,290
he told me that the pilot was being a
dick and like fucking with them and like

2353
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:00,620
doing this with the controllers or
something. Why? That's, I dunno.

2354
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:03,260
That's what he told me.
And then when he got here I was saying,

2355
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:07,420
I don't know if he's willing to wait
anymore. I don't, he might not. Yeah.

2356
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:13,060
What exactly is that possible?
You mean not really. Yeah.

2357
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:15,680
I can't even wrap my head around that.

2358
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,050
How's it possible that he
wouldn't be smoking weed?

2359
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:22,580
I know some people don't smoke weed.
Yeah. But when they smoke that much weed,

2360
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:27,680
lot of theory about black weed smokers
in white weed smoker, which is,

2361
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:33,140
I've never met a black burnout,
but yet like there's new,

2362
02:12:33,141 --> 02:12:35,180
like he like black hippies,

2363
02:12:35,210 --> 02:12:40,100
whereas white people can get
fucking completely burnt out.

2364
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:44,750
I don't know what it is, but we
actually did like, uh, uh, uh, study.

2365
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:46,310
We did a thing on Chappelle show words.

2366
02:12:46,610 --> 02:12:50,330
I think maybe the day you were there were
snoop got high with a bunch of people.

2367
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:54,680
Uh, we, and we ran and snoop got
high and then a bunch of like,

2368
02:12:54,770 --> 02:12:59,770
our staff got high and we ran them
through a battery of tests because I just

2369
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:02,840
have an idea that there is no such thing
as a black burnout cause snoop is a

2370
02:13:02,841 --> 02:13:05,180
sharp motherfucker. Dude, there's a lot of

2371
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:08,000
smoke more weed.

2372
02:13:08,150 --> 02:13:12,330
He's gotta be in the top
thousand Americans in terms
of the amount of weeding

2373
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:16,670
smoke that I've seen him smoke and
he's the smartest guy. I know, Bob.

2374
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:18,160
I think it's on misconceptions,
man.

2375
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:20,870
Smart Guy with weed is not
going to be a dumb guy.

2376
02:13:20,871 --> 02:13:24,710
It's going to be a smart guy was high
dumb guys on, we'd just get dumber.

2377
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:26,990
They just have more enhanced right now.

2378
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,290
They want to talk more about their stupid
ideas and they appear even more stupid.

2379
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:31,980
But there's

2380
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,160
plenty of black burnouts man. I know
a lot of them have that theory sucks.

2381
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:37,580
I know a lot. Go to the hood.
There's a lot of black dudes smoking.

2382
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:41,430
We'd sit on the porch. Do you want to do
shit? That lazy as fuck is a lot of them.

2383
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:43,230
There's a lot of people
that are smoking weed.

2384
02:13:43,231 --> 02:13:45,420
They're lazy as fuck white or black,
you know,

2385
02:13:45,421 --> 02:13:49,170
they're just lazy fucking people that
they get high and they get even lazier,

2386
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:52,590
you know? But you're a smart person.
Marijuana I think enhances you.

2387
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:56,970
Uh, yeah. I mean I, I found
that it would not enhance me,

2388
02:13:56,971 --> 02:14:01,140
but I just didn't like it and get the
right shit. Nah. Was a diva. I like,

2389
02:14:01,290 --> 02:14:04,260
I like, uh, I personally like who I am.

2390
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,690
Do you know the difference
between indicates the Tiva?
I like how you said that.

2391
02:14:06,691 --> 02:14:08,550
And with Joe on the end of it,
he made it a personal decision.

2392
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:12,960
I made it a personal, I don't know
the difference. Oh, there you go.

2393
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:16,290
The whole culture of it kind of bores me.
The culture is gross.

2394
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:19,860
We talked about this yesterday with
Brian posts saying in the interest of

2395
02:14:19,861 --> 02:14:23,580
brevity again, the a, there's a huge
difference between indicative sativa.

2396
02:14:23,581 --> 02:14:27,620
Endeca is a really relaxed like couch.
Hi Macy,

2397
02:14:28,730 --> 02:14:29,070
right?

2398
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:32,400
That's Endeca Sativa makes you want to
watch documentaries and stare at space

2399
02:14:32,401 --> 02:14:34,380
and looked through telescopes.
Right. It's a totally,

2400
02:14:34,381 --> 02:14:37,590
completely different
psychoactive experience.

2401
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:40,210
Uh,
I may have never interacted with that.

2402
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:44,470
Hi. Dot. Som. If you're mom tried
yet, I'll give you a road. She use it.

2403
02:14:44,490 --> 02:14:46,510
Use Your own discretion.
You don't want to be around me.

2404
02:14:47,470 --> 02:14:52,030
So, uh, yeah, never. I don't care to,

2405
02:14:52,510 --> 02:14:57,400
um, and uh, I'm trying
to think of what else.

2406
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:02,020
Yeah, just outlook for me. I think I'm
doing in the next month and a half,

2407
02:15:02,021 --> 02:15:05,810

Columbus. I'm doing work. Can,

2408

2409

what does that say. Dot Com.

2410
02:15:15,070 --> 02:15:19,120
It's a page, you know, people don't
know this when you post shit to Twitter,

2411
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:23,740
Twitter owns it. So if you don't
post it to somewhere originally,

2412
02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:28,120
if you post a picture, Twitter owns the
picture, they can sell it to someone.

2413
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:32,890
Uh, so, uh, people set up
these whosay guys set up a,

2414
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:37,120
a, uh, they're actually through
like ca, like the agency.

2415
02:15:37,121 --> 02:15:42,121
Like they set up a page where so that
ca clients can tweet shit and own it.

2416
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:48,160
Um, cause there's gonna be a case
eventually where someone's going to go,

2417
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:52,060
I that it was my property
and you've sold it. Um,
