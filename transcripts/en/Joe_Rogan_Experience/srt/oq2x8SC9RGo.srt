1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,991
Dump,
dump,

2
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:01,471
dump,
dump,

3
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:05,370
dump.
And where live unfortunately moral

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,600
Rinaldo is,
is deathly ill and he cannot make it

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,530
here,
but the great boss routing boom,

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,700
Pasito Guapo is here,
former UFC heavyweight champion.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,970
And your friend Kevin Random and
unfortunately the guy who won the title

8
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,420
from a passed away recently.
That was sad,

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:24,920
Huh?

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,230
Yeah.
The conspiracy theory was already on.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,460
I saw on line because he didn't.
Morrow didn't do ww II yesterday

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,031
evening.
So they said,

13
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,610
oh,
he was at the funeral of gather edelman.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,391
I said,
no,

15
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:38,120
that's not true.
He was really sick at home.

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,170
But yeah,
that was the,

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,310
that was the craziest news we found out
after we just did our podcast and then

18
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,180
we went online and um,
what?

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,230
He got sick,
he got sick with pneumonia and then it's

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,140
going to revive him.

21
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,800
Well,
he had staph infection worse than

22
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:56,490
anybody I've ever seen in my life.
Did you ever see some of

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,330
pictures?
You know what I said to people,

24
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:01,300
if you,
if you use smokeless tobacco in that

25
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,520
little box,
you could literally put in that hole

26
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,870
that he had in his chest.
Remember that?

27
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:05,360
Yeah.
Yeah,

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,160
it was insane.

29
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,300
Well,
we'll show the picture.

30
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,460
Jamie,
see if he can find the picture of Kevin

31
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,270
Randleman staph infection.
I never knew that I could get this bad,

32
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,540
but he had holes in his body where you
could look in and you see all the tissue

33
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:20,840
and attendance.
I mean,

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,000
just incredible.
You see it third,

35
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,680
Jamie,
I'm talking like a fist sized hole.

36
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,970
It was crazy.

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,780
He,
this guy survived everything as well.

38
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,614
Look at that.

39
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,910
Oh,
it's just incredible.

40
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,640
I just don't.
And he fought after this too by the way.

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Up and he fought afterwards.
But when your body is that compromised

42
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:47,290
from something like that,
I'm assuming that was mercer where the

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,150
medication resistant staph infection,
that stuff is real dangerous and people

44
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:56,110
die from it all the time.
Look at his leg to look how swollen his

45
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:58,180
ankle and his foot is.
Oh my God.

46
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,670
Very scary.
Oh God.

47
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:04,720
And Kevin Randleman in his prime mean
what a stud.

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,440
What a specimen.
That guy was to see him that

49
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,570
compromised.
I mean,

50
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:13,480
I don't know if he just ignored it and
it just kept getting worse and worse.

51
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,590
I don't know.
What happened,

52
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,390
I don't know either,
you know,

53
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:19,080
but I,
I have the feeling that it's like with

54
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,890
all the flights that were pretty much
the same,

55
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,210
you'll probably,
it's the same as well,

56
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,170
you know,
you have something,

57
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,070
you feel bad,
you know,

58
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:24,641
your launch.
I'll.

59
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,050
Everything is hurting.
Whatever man,

60
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,150
you know,
I'll take care of that tomorrow once it

61
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,910
gets worse,
not realizing because we're pushing all

62
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:33,880
the limits all the time that it at the
moment you're feeling it's probably

63
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,830
really bad already.
You should check it out,

64
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,090
but you know,
just push it away.

65
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,760
Let's get rid of my.
Let's do my work first and then we'll

66
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,490
take care of that later.
It was too late.

67
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,900
That's the feeling I have.

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,360
That is a problem with mental toughness
and some fighters they just keep pushing

69
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,670
through injuries and I've always
suspected that that might be the case

70
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,190
with Cain.
Why cain keeps getting injured over and

71
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:58,370
over again and now he's starting to get
some serious injuries where he's had

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,430
back now,
both shoulder

73
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,350
surgery,
knee surgery.

74
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,820
I mean this is a guy in his prime.
I mean,

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,420
I think Kane is only 33 or something
like that.

76
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,890
Right?
He should be regenerating like,

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,540
like this now as a heavyweight.
That's your prime.

78
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,810
The early thirties for heavyweight.
So generally when they really come into

79
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,050
their own and to see him constantly
injured,

80
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:24,400
I've always suspected it's just his
mental toughness is almost like a burden

81
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,310
because he pushes through everything.
You know,

82
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,950
Chris Weidman,
I think the same thing with his knees.

83
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,170
He's had some serious knee problems.
It's because they,

84
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,370
you know,
they have the problem.

85
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,360
They just go,
fuck it.

86
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:38,050
Let's just keep going.
And they can block out pain in a way

87
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,730
that,
you know,

88
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,240
most people,
they get a series,

89
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:40,970
knee injury,
that,

90
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,561
boy,
I got to go to.

91
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,680
The doctor got to get this checked out.
Not when you're in the middle of camp

92
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,530
and you're defending your title,
you fucking keep pushing through it.

93
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,800
Yeah.
I'm telling you,

94
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,570
all my students know because I used to
be executive like all the other guys.

95
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,600
I say if you have an injury and the
doctor tells you,

96
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,520
take two months off,
take four months off.

97
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,890
That's my advice.
Now you take double the amount of.

98
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,300
Everybody does the opposite.
Two months,

99
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,370
one month or three weeks.
Yeah,

100
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,960
don't do that because later in life,
like with what happened with me,

101
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,250
it will backfire for you and it's such a
good piece of advice right there because

102
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,980
so many guys,
especially acl surgeries,

103
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,990
how many times have we seen guys get
theirs?

104
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,190
Their knee reconstructed and then they
try to get back on the mat too quick and

105
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,930
pop bumps again.
The new knee blows out again and you're

106
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,980
looking at another six to nine months.
It's so,

107
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,530
so common.
Accrues Elisha Benji redneck.

108
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:32,690
He had like also like from a,
from an illegal corp.

109
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,940
So he had something in his knee and
illegal courtyard.

110
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,400
They had the fbi.
Yeah,

111
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,340
an illegally obtained.
It waS.

112
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,630
He got a letter from the fbi.
he almost lost his leg and then he had

113
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,381
this.
He,

114
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:48,110
we went to dinner with him one time.
he had a machine on him that filled

115
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:48,944
that.
His blood,

116
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,840
everywhere he went,
he got this crazy infection and then

117
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:57,160
years later he gets a letter from the
fbi and it was the guy who was

118
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,170
illegally,
uh,

119
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,830
it has handled in the end,
donors in the and whatever they need for

120
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,491
knees and for,
uh,

121
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,610
for everything like oregon's.
And they found that guy.

122
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,470
Yeah.
And it was from a cadaver that was

123
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:10,930
infected.
And that's why we had all that problem.

124
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,190
Yeah,
it was shit.

125
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,500
It was really crazy.
Did he get a discount or something like

126
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,540
maybe later he was just right into it.

127
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,800
Rain check for the other knee happens.
Benji radek is a guy,

128
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,530
a lot of people forgot about it.
Isn't fucking talented guy.

129
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,990
You don't.
I always talented at the time when was

130
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,520
call me crazy when anderson silva was,
had to speak of this career.

131
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,870
I said if I have six monThs with benji
and he would listen to me because

132
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,850
sometimes she gets that ego that,
oh,

133
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,300
I can strike with him.
No,

134
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,180
no,
you don't need to take him down and then

135
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,050
strike him,
you know,

136
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,790
because she would knock people out with
one punch.

137
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,640
This guy hits so hard,
he would hurt my hands on the Focus

138
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,500
mitts.
I'm as the craziest follow he has and

139
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,100
I'm telling you what,
his wrestling was so good.

140
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,100
He would just take him down and just
Beat hIm up.

141
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,230
I guarantee You that,
that that's how powerful he was.

142
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,591
Wow.
You know,

143
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,130
there's a lot

144
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,460
of guys that don't realize their
potential and benji radical was one of

145
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,620
those guys that people would always talk
about and the gym,

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,370
you know,
they say like,

147
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,650
boy,
if he could figure out how to put it all

148
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:07,484
together.

149
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,140
We did a few times at the ifl when he
was training for the anaconda.

150
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:12,290
She was there.
Yeah.

151
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,560
And then he started listening and people
go like,

152
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,560
man,
he,

153
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,480
he,
you transforming them into a kickboxer.

154
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,340
He's just listening at this moment.
But when you face another guy,

155
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:23,710
like for instance,
he fought a Scott Smith,

156
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,600
you know,
and I told him,

157
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,010
I said,
don't brawl with the guy.

158
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,210
Yeah,
but are people going to think,

159
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:32,440
I don't want to blame it on me,
tell them that I set so otherwise I'm

160
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:35,560
not going to train you anymore.
And of course the fight starts,

161
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,780
smith comes out and he starts brawling
with a guide.

162
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,340
That's what the guy does.
Don't do thIs.

163
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:41,680
Like with vandelay silva,
don't brawl with the guy.

164
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,240
You know,
you just got to pick them apart from the

165
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:47,050
outside and she would take him down.
He got in trouble at the end of the

166
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,450
first round.
Then he took him down,

167
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,450
hit him once.
That was the end of the round,

168
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,400
but almost half scotsmen aren't exactly
the same thing where I've lost my voice.

169
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:59,620
I just stopped yelling.
I said,

170
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,250
why don't you take them down?
It's really that easy for you.

171
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,100
Do it.
But he didn't.

172
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,690
He goes,
a funny thing when guys want to beat

173
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:13,440
guys at their own game or they want to
show that they're not aFraid to stand

174
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:16,530
with people.
It's hard to.

175
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:18,720
It's hard to.
You know that that fucking thing that

176
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,270
makes you great in the first place,
that makes you a fighter in the first

177
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:23,310
place.
A lot of times can BIte you in the ass.

178
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,000
Just don't.
Don't do wHat the other person is best

179
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:29,340
at.
If there's one thing he's weaker than

180
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:30,690
yours,
go to that,

181
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:34,050
whatever it is,
but it was ground literally striking.

182
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,760
Well,
that was one thing that gsp was always

183
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:38,550
so good at.
He was always so good at imposing his

184
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:40,050
strength,
like whatever the guy was.

185
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,900
If a guy was good at wrestling,
he would try to keep the fight standing.

186
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:45,270
If a guy was good at standing,
he would take them down.

187
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,970
You know what I mean?
gsp was so good at that and being

188
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,640
unpredictable too as to what his
approach was going to be.

189
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,920
He thought he was going to strike and
then he's going to take you down.

190
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:54,780
You think he's going to take you down
and he's going to kick you.

191
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,940
He was like the la jolla,
the la jolla.

192
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:59,530
Every time when he fought,
he had a new techniques.

193
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,380
He used new combinations and the same
thing happened with gsp.

194
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,150
Every time you saw him,
josh koscheck,

195
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:10,000
I remember the fight.
It was a jap and was just spinning back,

196
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:12,880
kick to the body and he nailed it over
and over again.

197
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,040
You knew that for the six weeks,
eight weeks,

198
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,900
whatever he was trading,
they worked on that.

199
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,030
You know,
for the rest of you ad lib a little bit.

200
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,680
What you normally do,
like to know.

201
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:21,470
Just pepper.

202
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,210
Yeah.
the josh koscheck fight.

203
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:23,991
man.
That was a.

204
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,970
That was an ugly one.
THat one is.

205
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,480
I swole up like that.
Josh was in a seriously bad shape after

206
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:31,100
that.
He couldn't fly after that fight.

207
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,510
Yeah,
that was.

208
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,360
That was one where they hear that they
had a drive from.

209
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,060
I think they had that fight in toronto.
Is it toronto and montreal?

210
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,770
I think it was toronto,
right?

211
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,940
No,
no,

212
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,250
that was,
I believe it was montreal because I

213
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:46,670
think toronto was jake shields.
That was the big one at the roger

214
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:47,430
center,
right?

215
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,670
I have no clue.
I think so.

216
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,500
Either way.
He was in Canada and he had a drive down

217
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:55,320
to boston and I believe he had to stay
there for a couple of weeks before he

218
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:57,780
could even fly back home to san jose.
Wow.

219
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,570
So you think that will blow up in the
air as well?

220
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,730
Again,
it was so bad.

221
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,300
It was an orbital fracture.
There is,

222
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,050
there's a picture of it right there and
that's after the fight,

223
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,940
but it was so bad that they had to
operate on it and those blowout

224
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:16,590
fractures of the eyes apparently are
extremely painful and very dangerous too

225
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,620
because it's the bone behind the eye
that gets broken so they have to go in

226
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,430
behind the eye and repair that bone and
sometimes when they do that,

227
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:30,540
your eye ball is never the same again.
It looks different like do you remember

228
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,210
bob sapp after cro?
Cop Hit him in pride,

229
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,960
I believe you called that faculty member
cro.

230
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:38,910
Cop cracked him with the left hand.
Was it or was it [inaudible]?

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,800
No,
it's a.

232
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,970
They'll go,
oh,

233
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:43,550
wait a minute.
It game watching.

234
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,350
I think it was know it was because I was
actually training.

235
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,080
Bob said,
well,

236
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,440
whenever you call it training,
I trained them one and a half times the

237
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,450
rest.
He was doing interviews.

238
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,210
Oh really?
I go,

239
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,270
dude,
this guy right now in Croatia,

240
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:58,100
he's kicking it back.
He wants to kill you because you're on

241
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,140
the top the now you just beat the host.
Yeah.

242
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,150
Is crazy that he beat him.
So,

243
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:06,901
uh,
yeah.

244
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:09,600
Then he came to train with me because I
told him before the fight,

245
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,000
but he said,
if you would fight me,

246
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,330
why would you go for.
I go,

247
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:16,800
I go full body shots because your
stamina and I kick your knees instead of

248
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,630
your legs.
I kick your knees because you have to

249
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:22,790
carry that weight all the time.
Who dropped him two or three times with

250
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,690
the liver shot?
So after that he came.

251
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,820
He said,
I really want to train with you.

252
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:27,391
I said,
okay,

253
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,400
well then I'm going to be in Japan
anyway,

254
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,230
so let's,
let's work out.

255
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,660
But yeah,
he was still busy doing media.

256
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,650
I said,
don't do that.

257
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,730
He was such a superstar in Japan.
He had to capitalize the amount of money

258
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:41,910
he was able to make.
I think people in America realized how

259
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:44,590
big for those few years.
Bob sapp got it.

260
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,930
Pan.
You have no clue.

261
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,090
We went out to dinner with him and that
they have to close the restaurant and

262
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,910
have to let them out at the back because
you see one person in the front,

263
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,803
two,
four,

264
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,910
and there was a whole group,
couldn't get out anymore.

265
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,450
You couldn't go through the lobby of the
hotel and it's not like he can blend in

266
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,640
a 375 pound man.
Huge.

267
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,960
He was.
He was.

268
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,960
This was in the tokyo post.
They had a picture of him on the cover

269
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,340
coming out of a like a massage place and
he saw this little girl thanked him and

270
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:23,630
here's the amount and the man stands
there and all these little girls that

271
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,950
had that little black thing in front of
their eyes,

272
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:30,000
you know that they do so you don't know
who that person is still there and he

273
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,050
was upset.
He said,

274
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,120
why didn't they put one in front of my
eyes?

275
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,873
I go,
yeah,

276
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,530
blocked

277
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,530
your whole ad.
People are going to go a while.

278
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,430
When he was fighting in pride,
I mean he was like a character from a

279
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:50,430
movie.
he was like the boss in a video game.

280
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,040
You remember?
Oh yeah,

281
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,100
god,
it was hilarious.

282
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,500
He did all these dances,
the bulb,

283
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,820
seb dance,
and they go to every shape and every

284
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,700
show and you had to just love him.
He's a.

285
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,310
He's a Freak and you know what,
the first time when he fought against

286
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:04,920
nogueira I go,
dude,

287
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,910
we got to hear from this.
This guy,

288
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,340
he,
he,

289
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,140
he was doing really well against a
seasoned guy like nogueira eventually.

290
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:11,711
Okay.
Last.

291
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:16,210
But he just started.
I think if you would have kept focusing

292
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,700
on the same training that he did at the
time,

293
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,440
it would've been a much,
much tougher guy because he had a lot of

294
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,300
talented physically at least.
Well,

295
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:30,190
he was just so fucking big to.
Maurice was training him at that time.

296
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,680
yeah.
Maury smith was working with a med and

297
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:33,380
married

298
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,120
there.
We're working with his kickboxing and

299
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,000
they're really trying to put some
technique to all that muscle,

300
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,190
but you know,
you're talking about a guy who

301
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:43,460
legitimately was 375 pounds with abs.

302
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,910
I mean,
he was like a science project in the

303
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:51,110
history of performance enhancing drugs.
Right.

304
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah.
I mean,

305
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,180
is there a bit of project is he's like,
this is as far as you can push it before

306
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:01,100
you fucking explode,
before your skin just explodes.

307
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,350
Like a water balloon.
Oh man.

308
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:04,950
Yeah,
we see it the past.

309
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,240
You see that with these guys who use a
latino,

310
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,760
they always are around to fight as they
start to become purple,

311
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,100
you know,
and then suddenly here they died of a

312
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:15,620
heart attack and so I wonder what
happened there?

313
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,870
Well,
he made it through.

314
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,170
He survived and then he started just
quick tapping.

315
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,450
He started doing all these fights where
he would get hit,

316
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:28,190
why he would go in hard and if it didn't
work out he would just tap and he fought

317
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,090
a bunch of guys like that where he would
start off the fight really well and then

318
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:35,210
wind up tapping out just and they would
fight again like three weeks.

319
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,890
Do the same thing.
It just kept doing it.

320
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,250
Living off of the name that he had
created while he was in pride.

321
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,520
That's a very sad thing for me that
that's almost the same as going on the

322
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:47,190
street then beg for money.
It really is to me,

323
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,490
you know,
I think that is a man.

324
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,200
He's such a good guy if you meet him.
Oh so very,

325
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,290
very nice guy.
But yeah,

326
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,124
that I,
I,

327
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,960
I don't like that.
It's the same occur,

328
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:00,540
you know what I saw that special thing
that they did on him,

329
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,430
but he sells cars now.
You know,

330
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,560
it's,
it's hard to look at that because

331
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:09,561
especially he knew where he was in the
past and that old is gone now you know,

332
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:10,494
it's,
it's,

333
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,920
you can be really high,
but you can fall really low.

334
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,110
Yeah.
And yeah,

335
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,990
he had fired a saying that they said
it's so great to fight this as but when

336
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,920
you're high,
you're high,

337
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:20,820
you know when you're.
When.

338
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,910
But when the lows are,
their is really low as well.

339
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:27,000
The difference is too much.
Well actually,

340
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,160
uh,
look what just came out with ellen and

341
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,960
rhonda.
I mean she broke down just thinking

342
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,870
about it now and it's a moment that are
there.

343
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:40,260
So everybody would have that for a few
seconds,

344
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,700
but yeah,
it get you down because like that,

345
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,080
I know that after the fight that night
she was just devastated.

346
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,800
But of course,
I mean that was a brutal,

347
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:56,740
brutal knockout and it was a fight where
nothing worked.

348
00:14:56,741 --> 00:15:00,080
I mean just nOthing worked.
She went after holly and she tried to

349
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:05,081
bully her and holly just great footwork
countered her and that kickboxing and

350
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,660
her movement.
Holly's movement is the best in all of

351
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:13,040
women's mma or footwork and movement.
She's so good At getting out of the way

352
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,130
at countering when you're coming in and
the style,

353
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,970
the bulldog style of rhonda has.
Especially the way she fought that fight

354
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:22,100
that night,
just played right into holly zahn.

355
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,100
that's it.
She knew exactly what she was going to

356
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:26,320
be able to time because she just wants
before forward

357
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,550
and that head kick,
whew.

358
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,360
you know,
that was one of the things that I said

359
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:31,310
after that fight,
I'm like,

360
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,110
this is.
She should take a long time off after

361
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,950
that fight because that's the kind of
head kick that's the kind of kao that it

362
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:41,310
takes a long time to recover from.
You might look fine,

363
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,680
you know,
you might be able to talk,

364
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,130
but mentally and also the brain itself,
that kind of an impact like a high kick

365
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:52,140
like that can really take a long time
for everything.

366
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:54,570
He'll for Anything to normalize.

367
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,980
Well,
kenny rice that she says no because I

368
00:15:56,981 --> 00:16:00,910
took my words back because if we're
talking about a floyd mayweather versus

369
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:01,601
rhonda said,
well,

370
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:02,670
if it goes to the ground,
you know?

371
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,270
Yeah,
I,

372
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,640
I truly believe,
but kenny said footwork on,

373
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,230
make sure it's not going to go to the
grant.

374
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:08,771
I go,
no,

375
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:09,131
no,
no.

376
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,330
Five rounds,
five minutes,

377
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:12,280
25 minutes.
I'll a long time.

378
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,170
He knows there will be a clinch one
time,

379
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,240
but that's exactly what happened.
Yeah,

380
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,700
yeah.
There's a difference.

381
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,470
First of all,
in fighting in an octagon,

382
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:22,770
which is a huge surface.
Like if you look at a boxing ring,

383
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,710
most people you can look them up much,
much smaller space.

384
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,450
And also I just don't think rhonda would
try to box a floyd mayweather.

385
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,300
I think she thought that she could stand
with holly holm.

386
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,430
Yep.
And I think a lot of is based on holly's

387
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,730
previous performances in the ufc,
especially the raquel pennington fight.

388
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,760
Yokel pennington who was very tough,
very durable.

389
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,130
And I've read rico,
I always give her.

390
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,250
I gave her the nickname of the ear
exploder because she's had so many

391
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:52,020
moments in the fight where you like,
screamed so loud that you blow people's

392
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:52,940
eardrums out.
Like,

393
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,570
um,
when she fought Ashley,

394
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:56,310
evan smith and bulldog choked her.
Yeah,

395
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:56,850
yeah,
yeah.

396
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,070
Blood everywhere.
And she talked to her like one second

397
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:00,570
ago.
We were screaming at the end of that

398
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:01,650
fight.
Like she's out.

399
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:05,490
She's out.
And then she but pennington so tough and

400
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:10,491
fought conservatively against holly holm
and almost one like that was a split

401
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,930
decision.
So you look at that fight and he go,

402
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:16,410
well boy man,
maybe rhonda could stand with her and

403
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,240
just go after the way.
She went after bench go,

404
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:18,980
hey,
uh,

405
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,980
the race she went after a Alexis Davis,
but man holly was just on point.

406
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,450
It was game planning also,
you know,

407
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,780
after that fight with raquel,
that was perfect for her because that

408
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:32,261
means,
okay,

409
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,820
stay away from the big bumps,
you know,

410
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,920
and they know that rhonda,
she's an athlete,

411
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,180
she can hit,
she hit you.

412
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,590
When I saw that,
um,

413
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,000
what is the open workout in Brazil?
And I'm one of these guys,

414
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,290
I have always thinks to say,
oh,

415
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,660
does not good.
You should do that.

416
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:47,950
You can prove this.
You know,

417
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,580
I'm always,
I'm very critical and I always think to

418
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,930
myself,
am I too much?

419
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:55,110
Is that what am I doing?
But at the moment I saw her training

420
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:57,570
there and this is,
this is not fighting and I know this

421
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,410
doesn't translate to fighting by hitting
the focus mitts and hitting the bag or

422
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:04,260
all that stuff.
It looked nearly perfect to me.

423
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,100
The rotation of her upper body,
the movement afterwards to move very

424
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,690
taste.
and like also,

425
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,760
I really thought,
man,

426
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,511
yeah,
okay.

427
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,900
I have nothing to say now.
This looks really good.

428
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,190
I felt the same way.
Yeah.

429
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,720
I felt like our hand techniques were on
point and then when she polished off

430
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,330
beds cohere and the first round it's
sort of spoke to that like,

431
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:23,164
okay,
well look,

432
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,910
obviously she.
She hits hard.

433
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,270
Her technique is improving and she's an
elite athlete.

434
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:29,830
Yup.
You're talking about an olympian.

435
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,520
You're talking about a person that has
that mindset to push forward and figures

436
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:35,140
out a way to get better at everything
she does,

437
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:36,980
but so does holly.
Yep.

438
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,150
So does holly and holly has got way
better kickboxing skills and way better.

439
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,600
She's got way more diversity in her
striking game where it was.

440
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,780
Ron is just punching knees to the body
when she gets close to the clench.

441
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,180
Nice the body,
but on the outside it's just punching.

442
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:55,360
Where's holly?
Holly can head kick you and knock you

443
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:57,910
the fuck out.
And she sets those kicks up with kicks

444
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,770
to the body.
She'll throw kicks to leg.

445
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,240
That jackson camp.
They all liked that oblique kicked in

446
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,780
the thigh.
This is a dangerous kick.

447
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,340
Yeah,
it's going to be a lord.

448
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:07,930
And when somebody is going to snap their
knee,

449
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:08,764
it's going to be over.

450
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,120
Do you think so because knee bars are
now allowed heel hooks on outlawed.

451
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,510
I know,
but that's a different thing.

452
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,180
You know,
you do this is once your leg is a little

453
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,140
stretched and you get hit there.
Oh yeah,

454
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,890
that's it.
A knee bar or you have to be in a

455
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,970
polyamorous,
you know.

456
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:26,050
But anybody else,
we just put the knee bar on and give you

457
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,980
time to tap.
Won't have that.

458
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:28,814
We'd no bleed cake.

459
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,510
Yeah,
I agree with you.

460
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,870
I mean,
but it's so effective right now when

461
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,760
it's legal.
I understand why they're using it.

462
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,830
[inaudible] jon jones is so good at it
and it doesn't.

463
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,650
You know,
winkle john is one of the best striking

464
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:43,430
coaches in the world.
He really is so good and so

465
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,860
underappreciated because he's such a
humble guy.

466
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:47,530
He doesn't.
He's not talking a lot.

467
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,390
It's not bragging.
He's a very down to earth,

468
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:51,860
normal,
humble guy.

469
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,460
But the results that that guy has been
able to.

470
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,090
I mean,
holly is probably one of his best

471
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:56,770
students,
but of course

472
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,261
jon,
jon,

473
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,590
jon,
I'm not a freak.

474
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,400
He can change the world.
He could be if he,

475
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,450
if he's now on the straight and narrow
and he's just fighting.

476
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,060
I see this guy,
nobody's going to beat this guy.

477
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,070
It's going to be,

478
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,450
is going to be hard,
that's for sure.

479
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:14,730
But you know,
the worry about john is that john's

480
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:18,480
going to fuck himself up because like
recently he just got caught driving with

481
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:22,730
no license and no insurance and no
registration and you know,

482
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,270
he lost his license.
He get,

483
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,340
he's got millions of dollars.
Get a fucking driver,

484
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,174
man.

485
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,910
Yeah.
But look at tiger woods.

486
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:32,060
What happened to him?
Because when all the crap happened with

487
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:33,140
him,
he mentally,

488
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:35,560
he didn't come back from that.
And I understand this is golf,

489
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,890
you know,
but same as fighting.

490
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:38,180
It's some,
it's a mind game.

491
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:40,870
It's really a mind game.
So kenny overstepped that.

492
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,380
I think he can because jones is young
and he knows how good he is.

493
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,670
But if,
if I were him,

494
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,430
I say fight for five more years is stop
you going down in history like a

495
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,050
thousand years from now,
they will still talk about you if you do

496
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:57,140
it correctly or you know,
he sidetracks and something bad's gonna

497
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,210
happen to them.
Let's not help.

498
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,020
Yeah,
I hope he pulls it together.

499
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:02,600
He's a great guy.
I really liked john as a person.

500
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,070
I mean he has his flaws like most people
and he's young and the amount of

501
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:11,450
pressure that he's on to be the youngest
ever ufc champion to have this

502
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,520
spectacular career.
So early in life.

503
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,530
The only loss he had was a
disqualification.

504
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:18,320
That was a bullshit disqualification.
This,

505
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,010
this stupid rule of 12 to six elbows.
They got to get rid of that.

506
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
If we don't know what I'm talking about,
folks in the ufc,

507
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:30,620
there's a rule and it's a crazy rule
that you can't strike someone with an

508
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,070
elbow from 12,
12:00 PM to six on a clock dial,

509
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,160
like going straight down.
AnD the only reason why you can't do it

510
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,560
is because when they were setting up the
athletic commissions,

511
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,310
the athletic commissions had seen those
karate demonstrations on tv where a guy

512
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:45,680
would break a brick with his elbow and I
said,

513
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,640
well,
you can't do that.

514
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,300
That's got to be illegal because someone
could die and this is what big John

515
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,830
Mccarthy told me that he had to talk to
these people.

516
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:52,880
And he's like,
oh,

517
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,200
okay.
All right.

518
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,440
Then that was illegal.
So that's the only reason why that's

519
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,850
still illegal.
But the great thing is if you're on your

520
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,040
back,
you're allowed to do it because that is

521
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,020
the
dumbest thing ever.

522
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:08,590
It's so stupid.
It's one of the dumbest rules that's

523
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,433
still in place.

524
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,520
Yeah.
Oh,

525
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,740
well that's.
We had a guy in holland,

526
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,760
he police,
he pulled it and wheat orlando with

527
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,160
these two guys.
When they fought each other,

528
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,660
they will sell out all the time.
I saw three fights of them live because

529
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:27,680
these guys were crazy at full tie rules
and alondo wheat and he put both of

530
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,880
them.
They would end the clench,

531
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,280
like jump all the way up.
And then come down with our.

532
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,790
Most of the collarbones do that.
They will go full blast.

533
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,550
Orlando,
we who fought in the ufc,

534
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,070
I think ufc two.
Was it two?

535
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,590
We fought against the rem co.
Pardot.

536
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:42,371
Pardot?
Yeah.

537
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:46,380
He got him in a scarf and elbows with
illegal elbows.

538
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,840
Now it is illegal and so true.
Right?

539
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,320
Well it might've been legal because it
was kind of coming from 12 on the side.

540
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,570
Maybe it was like 12 to seven or
something like 11,

541
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,810
five or one to seven.
It's up to you what you want to go.

542
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,590
It's so dumb.
It's so dumb.

543
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:05,951
I,
I,

544
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,080
you know,
I have a problem with a few rules of the

545
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,550
ufc,
but that's the number one.

546
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,340
That's the number one.
Have also a problem with the putting the

547
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,080
hand on the ground and stop news.
The head.

548
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,990
I always go if you have somebody lifted
him up.

549
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,090
Yeah.
I feel like to down deponent,

550
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,460
maybe that's a problem when they're up
against the cage because you can't get

551
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,440
your head out of the way.
Like in pride.

552
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,980
One of the crazy things about pride,
which I think to this day and one of the

553
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,090
reasons why I was so excited to have
moral here too,

554
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,790
you guys called the glory days.
I mean some of the wildest fights in the

555
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,030
history of the sport.
Yep.

556
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,800
Where you have stomps soccer,
kicks everything but no elbows,

557
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,160
no elbows to the ground.
Yeah.

558
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:44,841
No,
I,

559
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,100
I remember fights that

560
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,990
they literally have ventilators silver
in the corner over or ninja or shogun,

561
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:52,460
you know,
and it would hold the ropes.

562
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,380
Just stomp somebody skullen pretty much.
it's scary.

563
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:02,030
I think that that shouldn't,
that shouldn't be legal.

564
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:06,980
It's like what happened in the past with
the hydro huerta one fc now one

565
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:09,710
championship.
When you look at their fight,

566
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:12,590
you go,
that was the referee really messed up on

567
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,720
that one.
He liteRally dropped on all fours

568
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:18,620
because he was exhausted and then he get
penalty kicked in the face that,

569
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,620
that could've been really bad.
Well,

570
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:22,930
I think it was really bad.
I mean I don't know how much he

571
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:26,050
recovered from that.
That was a devastating knockout and it

572
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:30,120
was also roger fighting at one 70.
Which is not really his weight class.

573
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,980
It really should be a 1:55 and he fought
a big.

574
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,160
Who's the brazilian guy that he fought?
Don't remember his name,

575
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,620
but that guy's a big guy and he.
He had roger hurt and then that soccer,

576
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,950
they have like a rule at one fc.
I don't know if they still have it where

577
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,050
they,
they'll say like open,

578
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,820
like what?
You're allowed to do,

579
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,150
stomp or a kick to the downed opponent.
Well,

580
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,380
this was a closed set.
There was the guy's name,

581
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,820
zorro Babo a,
a man above it.

582
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,580
It was a devastating,
devastating soccer here.

583
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,500
He said,
I did not want to throw the kick.

584
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:06,334
Wow.

585
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,860
Well then don't.
Why would you do it?

586
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,840
Do it.
Which will be very dangerous at that

587
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:15,290
moment as well because you're breathing,
you're going to crack some rich,

588
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,890
so it can be very dangerous as well,
but you can recover from the crack ribs

589
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:22,550
a lot better than you can step away.
There's no need for that.

590
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:24,050
I never had that.
You know,

591
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,230
it means being aware indicates and know
what you're doing.

592
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,210
You know,
if I see a guys our guys out,

593
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:31,620
it's not going to hit them an extra.
Yeah,

594
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,800
it's,
there's a lot of debate about the old

595
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:40,220
rules of pride versus the rules of the
ufc and that was one of the things that

596
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:44,240
happen when cro cop started fighting in
the ufc and then fought in a cage for

597
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,680
the first time against gonzaga.
Well,

598
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,440
you know,
he fought eddie sanchez first won that

599
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:51,980
fight,
but that was not on his level.

600
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,040
And then he fought gonzaga gonzaga,
took him down,

601
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,650
held them up against the cage,
elbow the shit out of them,

602
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,420
and then stood them up and high kicked
him.

603
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,400
But he was saying like the elbows
confused him.

604
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:05,510
Like he wasn't used to that and he also
wasn't used to the cage being trapped.

605
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,140
Whereas the pride ring,
you could move around like the ropes

606
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,490
were there.
You can get under the ropes.

607
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:11,241
He could,
you know,

608
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,074
you'd never know

609
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,290
you can,
but you can look somebody up also in a

610
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,270
corner,
which you cannot do in a cage.

611
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,160
When I stepped for the first time into a
cage,

612
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,500
I was like,
oh dude,

613
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,750
this is,
this is awesome.

614
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,780
They can never look me up.
This is the biggest thing I've ever

615
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,210
seen.
Yeah.

616
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,053
So,
uh,

617
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,680
yeah.
I think gonzaga,

618
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:34,580
that fight an elvis come back to this.
I thought that was so smart what he was

619
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,290
doing.
He was constantly throwing the right

620
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:39,470
hand and it didn't even come close to
his face like this.

621
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,110
And I'm constantly thinking,
why is he doing that?

622
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,030
And then it

623
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,870
re,
you know,

624
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,580
I got,
oh he's shutting his gig down because

625
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,310
woke up.
He might think if I just drove right

626
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:52,650
stRaight like every 20 seconds in front
of your face,

627
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,730
he's going to think if I throw my left
at the moment he throws that ride

628
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,500
straight,
he's going to knock me out.

629
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,120
So he shut his whole game down and then
he was moving to the left and that was,

630
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,660
that was the blueprint to coco because
after that everybody started doing it.

631
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,550
Yeah.
And it's interesting how cro,

632
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,950
cro,
cop got his revenge in the rematch in a

633
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:15,660
big way with elbows on the ground.
Seems kind of ironic that one of the

634
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:18,540
things that cro cop was saying before
that fight is that he didn't

635
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:22,080
particularly like grappling and he
didn't particularly like elbows on the

636
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:22,980
ground.
Meanwhile,

637
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,970
that's what won him the fight.
The second fight he won by being on top

638
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,200
and but the elbows that are real
talented striker can throw from the

639
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:31,950
guard.

640
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,730
The difference in those elbows is just
unbelievably devastated.

641
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,200
And we saw that in the cro.
Cop fight.

642
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,980
Yep.
No,

643
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,230
he did a really good job that I had at
one time.

644
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,080
Also,
somebody's arm barred me and I,

645
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,940
I got out when I fought him the second
time.

646
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,490
I didn't want to knock him out.
I want to bar him first and I remembered

647
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:54,740
that armbar him the rope escape there.
I had him and then he wrote escapes and

648
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:55,390
I told him,
I said,

649
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,880
so this is pancreas.
This is bankers.

650
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:57,241
I said,
no,

651
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,210
you got it back.
And then later on I heal.

652
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,240
Hooked him actually will had crazy
rules.

653
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,170
You and you were the first guy to figure
those rules out and I loved watching you

654
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:12,000
fight back then because it was openhand
striking with the hands but kicks.

655
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,480
So like you were with the first guy that
ever saw a fight in that.

656
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,850
First of all,
that kicks so fucking hard.

657
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:20,190
You could see when you would slam these
guys with these kicks,

658
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,030
they'd be like,
oh,

659
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,010
this is a completely different
experience,

660
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,670
but also you weren't slapping.
You would see how the fuck.

661
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,310
Do you pull your hand back so far?
Yeah,

662
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,840
I got very limber.
Hands the bone.

663
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,300
Yeah.
You were pulling your hand way back and

664
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:36,300
throwing straight punches and hooks and
upper cuts.

665
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:39,660
like when you fly food narky throwing
upper cut.

666
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,170
Like a punch.
The same motion.

667
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,210
Nobody does this still.
Look,

668
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:48,450
if I'm in the garden and I,
I just lift my hand like this.

669
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,580
See?
Yeah.

670
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,420
Just slide over his chest and face.
Why is nobody doing this?

671
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,280
Why is nobody just leave it here?
Just hit them a little bit.

672
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,250
Look away.
Because most of them,

673
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,900
when you look away,
they think and the book just flat hand

674
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:07,290
on the center of the chest and just
shove it over the chest.

675
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,760
Yeah,
that makes sense.

676
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,950
That does make sense.
But wouldn't that work with a punch as

677
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,110
well with.
Yeah,

678
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,530
but you have more space wIth a poem on
this distance.

679
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,060
This is much shorter than this.
This is like an extra 15 percent,

680
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:23,820
which will make a lot of difference.
That's that distance.

681
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:26,670
That's a very good point.
That's another five or six inches at

682
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:27,570
least.
Listen,

683
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,320
that's why I never understood nobody
strong palm strikes.

684
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,910
Now that left hook,
right?

685
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,560
Straight combination,
right in boxing,

686
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,970
right.
It's a dumb combination.

687
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:38,100
If you really think about it.
If it's a short left hook,

688
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,380
I'm way too close to my straight punch.
It has no power.

689
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:44,560
I can't stretch my,
but if I do a palm strike and then a

690
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:47,560
straight punch,
now I got space for my straight punch.

691
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,440
It's much harder.
So why is nobody doing that?

692
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,770
Now?
I do closed lines and I posted a thing

693
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:57,130
on facebook like a year ago when I hit a
bag with a clothesline.

694
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,710
Dude,
I don't think people can imitate me.

695
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,890
My weight with a kick like that,
they can kick and then I said,

696
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,020
okay,
now I show clothesline.

697
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,540
Is she the back folding or out?
My whole arm is the courageous thing.

698
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,850
You can blog with ting had tried to
block whatever you want.

699
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,920
If I close line,
you have to stand still.

700
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,960
It goes straight through everything.
I guarantee you and knock you out.

701
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,940
Why is that?
Why is it clothes on so power?

702
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,460
It is so powerful because you can really
lock it up.

703
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,260
Don't stretch your arm because if you
miss time and you hit your,

704
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,530
you're going to hyperextend,
but you can drag your whole body weight

705
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:29,720
in there because you will like it and
your legs are planted on the ground.

706
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,820
Oh yeah.
You're getting all that hip torquing.

707
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,100
It is such a powerful strike and also
with the clench when even when they

708
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,020
stand like this,
if I do this,

709
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,730
it loops around to defense and it's the
mecca to had still the legal part

710
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,620
because it's outside the mohawk.

711
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,390
Well,
he's in the back of the head.

712
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:49,630
Standing never seems to get,
like in boxing they get penalized for

713
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,970
punching the back of the head.
People say no rabbit punches,

714
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:54,940
but when you think About a head kick,
a lot of headaches,

715
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:57,060
especially ones that go over the
shoulder there,

716
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,430
there the back of the head and it's,
and it's legal and that's why they're

717
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:02,350
effective.
And that's why it was so effective with

718
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,640
me with,
uh,

719
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,720
with uh,
with pancreaS.

720
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,930
I hid behind the ear.
If you look at mike dyson's fights,

721
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,430
you know,
I don't know how he did it,

722
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:11,530
but he did it.
He was always the shorter guy.

723
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,250
But if you see him hooking somebody,
he hits almost the back of their head.

724
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,020
He's got very short hooks now the body,
it's ready for impact from the front,

725
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,400
from the side,
because you're used to it.

726
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,750
well,
if you could see the punch coming,

727
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,480
the behind,
I always tell people just do with a

728
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,910
poem,
just do this to the back of your head

729
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:29,830
and see what happens.
So like just me doing this,

730
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,320
it's all ready to go.
You're not ready for that.

731
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:37,530
So you can already imagine if you go hit
as hard as you can be here.

732
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,720
It's a sweet.
It's a sweet bunch.

733
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,490
I can understand that,
but it's doing it.

734
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,860
Whereas the head that much more
dangerous.

735
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh,
do this,

736
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,861
do this.
But I mean,

737
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,930
is it that much more data than just
behind it?

738
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,130
Here?
Just do that.

739
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,420
Oh you,
you

740
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,130
remember?
Um,

741
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,730
when the hens old fart and world combat
against that judo guy.

742
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,520
I'm a,
I forget the dutch guy.

743
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,160
Yeah,
he got his back and spikers spike as

744
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:11,210
best baker by trade with them.
Also got his back and just bet if they,

745
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,210
if you can elbow the back of the head
rear naked,

746
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:17,590
choke her out the window,
but it's just going to bang bang to the

747
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:19,780
back of the head.
And it's almost more effective than a

748
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:22,690
rear naked choke because kaiser just
gonna they're just gonna try to cover

749
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,321
up.
Yeah.

750
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,750
And eventually,
yeah,

751
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,930
slIp through that.
It's interesting to me that there's some

752
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,560
really effective martial arts techniques
that are outlawed and that's one of

753
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:34,900
them.
You can't hit that spot.

754
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,570
It's,
it's,

755
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,680
it's kind of strange because In a self
defense situation or an actual martial

756
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,070
arts,
if

757
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,680
you think about what is the most
effective technique to use,

758
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,310
knees the ground are very effective to
head on a down opponent.

759
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,530
Elbows to the back of the head are very
effective.

760
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,140
But are they that much more dangerous
much?

761
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,310
Should they be outlawed?
Oh,

762
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,870
here's the video.
Yeah,

763
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,651
henzel.
Got it.

764
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:55,484
Oh,
look at this.

765
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,720
Boom,
boom.

766
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,720
I mean no need to choke,
but he choked him anyway,

767
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:00,600
I think.
Yeah,

768
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,330
I know he's going to step on his head.
Right?

769
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,460
Smashed him.
He smashed that dude.

770
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,050
Well that guy.
Here's the deal.

771
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,490
Henzel,
who's a very nice guy.

772
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:10,610
By the way.
This fucking guy was calling hensville

773
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,950
all throughout the night and fucking
with them.

774
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:13,784
Look at.
He's.

775
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,610
Yeah,
he's out cold.

776
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,260
Henzel was in his hotel room and this
guy kept calling them and fucking with

777
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:22,910
him.
He just didn't want him to have any

778
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:25,220
sleep,
so it just kept ringing his phone and I

779
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,821
was like,
oh,

780
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:26,654
okay.

781
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,333
Wait,
motherfucker.

782
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,410
Yeah.
It's so funny when you see a guy like

783
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:32,420
heads and he's always smiling,
you know,

784
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,290
don't do it.
What's wrong with people?

785
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,140
He's really nice.
He smiles all the time,

786
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,950
but he does the same thing when he gets
you in the balls,

787
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,050
you know,
watch out.

788
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,050
Did you ever see that twitter,
a sequence that hensville put online

789
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,440
will beat the shit out of these muggers
in New York city.

790
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,060
These guys in New York city tried to mug
henzel gracie not knowing who he was,

791
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,070
so hands on,
not only beat the fuck out of him,

792
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:02,000
he followed them and kept beating the
fuck out of them and make all these

793
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:04,760
pushes.
Thank you mayor bloomberg for making so

794
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:05,640
safe,
newer.

795
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,800
Don't have to worry about guns.
This to me is a pleasure.

796
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,390
You already starts with.
There are still guys following us.

797
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,110
They probably wanted to rob me or
something and then he makes.

798
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,370
It was like,
oh yeah,

799
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,660
this is really happening.
I'm so excited.

800
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,870
What a huge fuck up on their part.
Well,

801
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,130
he had one.
We were,

802
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,080
kenny arise now were somewhere.
This is not that long ago.

803
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,230
And he was also,
he was walking on the street and two

804
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:37,340
guys,
same thing.

805
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,360
He came to tell the story and uh,
and he,

806
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:41,820
he dropped the Biggest guy,
right?

807
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:44,090
He said,
I just picked the biggest next month and

808
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:45,740
why he kept walking.
The police came,

809
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,590
they stopped us trouble and he looks at
the guys and the guys go,

810
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:48,941
no,
no,

811
00:34:48,941 --> 00:34:49,970
it doesn't.
No,

812
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,620
it's fucking.
He says,

813
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,050
you just picked the wrong guy.
He told them they fuck you.

814
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,820
Good.
Yeah.

815
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,241
Yeah.
Well,

816
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,590
he looks so friendly and nice.
You know,

817
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,480
I mean,
when,

818
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,240
when he's got his game face on,
he looks like a killer,

819
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:03,950
but most of the time,
hence off smiling.

820
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,070
He's like one of those smileys happiest
guys you're ever going to run into.

821
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,420
And they look at them.
They're big smile.

822
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:09,800
Oh,
that's.

823
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,070
Is that an ifl ifl ring?
But it's,

824
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,710
this is the paperweight,
this is another really big one,

825
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:19,910
is a paperweight that they gave to us
and the hens or couldn't be a nicer guy,

826
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,270
couldn't be a nicer guy.
And it's so nice to see how well he's

827
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:26,540
done with his school too.
He has one of the biggest jujitsu

828
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,850
schools in the world.
Yep.

829
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,440
In,
in manhattan where it's so hard to be

830
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,020
successful because it's so expensive.
Real estate.

831
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,140
I think the ifl had a big part in that
because they did a thing on 20 slash 20

832
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:39,630
for him and,
or 15 minutes,

833
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:40,810
one of the two.
And,

834
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,270
and after that it just exploded because
once you get into the world of enzo,

835
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,730
you know about what kind of person he
is,

836
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,660
you know,
everyone likes him,

837
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,310
you know,
even even the guys like him.

838
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,260
so to people at home,
they saw that guy and then they saw the

839
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:54,210
technique and uh,
you know,

840
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,410
talent.
Yeah,

841
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:57,840
put hand in hand together and boom,
anthony bourdain trains.

842
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:58,670
They're also,
his wife,

843
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,700
trains.
Everybody turns out,

844
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,610
well,
he's done an amazing job of putting

845
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:06,660
together a fantastic gym in New York
city with gary tonin,

846
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:09,720
eddIe common,
so he's got these guys that are in john

847
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,050
danaher is a big part of that as well.
He's got these guys that are trained

848
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,510
there that are so successful in these
jujitsu competition,

849
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:19,260
so it's not just the legacy of being one
of the gracies and being one of the most

850
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,770
famous jujitsu practitioners ever,
but it's also on top of that,

851
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,860
it's the product,
like the results that they've gotten in

852
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:27,120
competition.
Yeah,

853
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:28,040
he's very smart.
You know,

854
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,110
he's got a really good staff as well
teaching there,

855
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,680
which is a very important thing because
most of the time guys who are really

856
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,630
good,
they want to control it too much,

857
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,100
you know,
and then it goes down.

858
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,490
Like he did a great job just gettiNg the
right guys for the job.

859
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,340
What's also,
you see extreme loyalty from the people

860
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:46,590
that train there because they love hanzo
so much.

861
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:49,050
Like there's like a real bond with
henzel gracie.

862
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:51,660
Of course you don't.
Matt serra who came from that lineage

863
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:55,290
and then you know,
a lot of his guys as well just can't say

864
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,120
enough good things about him.
It's funny.

865
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,670
It's hilarious.
then the one that's the first time

866
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:06,710
looking for a fight.
You're a model

867
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,010
and then it gets old comfortable sitting
in a certain way.

868
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,470
It's so funny if you haven't seen it,
there's a show called looking for a

869
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:18,270
fight and it's dana white,
matt,

870
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:22,110
sarah and nick the tooth.
And what they do is they go to small mma

871
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:27,111
shows all over the world and uh,
they see fights and find talent and

872
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,230
that's where they find that kid go sage
northcutt as well.

873
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,100
And then the guy who was,
who they were setting up to fight bunk.

874
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,390
Yeah.
Cm punk,

875
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,410
which is a.
I don't know what's going to happen with

876
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,420
that guy.
I don't understand this whole thing.

877
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,770
She got a lot of injuries.
Well,

878
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,830
I also think it's ridiculous for him to
fight in the ufc.

879
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,320
I think he should fight in a small
organization.

880
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,530
Take a fight in a small organization,
build yourself up.

881
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,590
I have always said that that's what
should have happened with brock lesnar.

882
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,930
I mean,
if you look at brock lesnar as an

883
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:57,180
athlete,
I always said if you took brock lesnar

884
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,230
and got him to a guy like matt hume,
or for us a hobby and said,

885
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:03,360
okay,
make this guy a chance.

886
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,270
You're dealing with a freak athlete.
Unreal.

887
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,330
Just train them correctly.
Building them up,

888
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,200
building them up slow,
get them through the right.

889
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,340
But he wanted to fight right away in the
ufc one fighting k one right to the ufc

890
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,050
fought and that k one la show.
Yup.

891
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,000
Um,
and then right to the ufc.

892
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,283
Yeah,
it's a shame,

893
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,060
you know,
and,

894
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,450
but,
but it's his name and then,

895
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:21,950
you know,
david,

896
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,531
they,
of course,

897
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:26,460
they understand that once he fights were
a baby has got to be a lot of people.

898
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,070
He's going to have a gun into bayview,
but that,

899
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,870
that is short.
It's always short.

900
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:34,050
Like the money later in your career,
your greg,

901
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:36,040
all these things.
I'm happy I never did

902
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,800
that.
Yeah,

903
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,740
I feel like make big mistakes.
Well,

904
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:40,060
I feel like he,
um,

905
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,430
he definitely had massive potential.
I mean,

906
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:45,010
he beat,
I mean he beat randy couture.

907
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,410
Yeah,
I mean that's just unbelievable.

908
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,020
I mean he beat the shit out of frank
mir.

909
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,180
I mean he beat shamed carlin and a
fight.

910
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:55,360
We're really out to show his resilience,
got the fuck beat out of him in the

911
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,260
first round.
Came back,

912
00:38:56,261 --> 00:39:00,310
submit them in the second round.
So we had some legit wins against legit

913
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,310
guys,
but just wasn't ready for guys like cain

914
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,910
or especially allister.
That was it.

915
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,110
It was a bad foot.
Well,

916
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,210
if he could have taken it to the ground,
it would have been different against

917
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,400
goto or.
That was the first time that I thought,

918
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,260
oh,
hopefully now more people start doing

919
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,400
it.
That was that crazy punch.

920
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,910
And wiTh him it was because she was not
super technically yet striking,

921
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,010
but he hit an overhead and it hit with
this part of the hand with the fist,

922
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,040
the back of the head down.

923
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,220
Then with junior dos santos knocked out
cain velasquez like that.

924
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:31,054
I go,
okay,

925
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,400
we got it.
People finding out they start getting it

926
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,170
to it and then the laskers did the same
thing to junior coming back,

927
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:38,780
so I figured,
oh,

928
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,320
they looked at it,
so now we're going to see this more

929
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:43,750
often.
But that was pretty much it.

930
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:47,460
You see it here and there one time,
but it's not a real overhead or data

931
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,950
throw real over and not with the site.
Then hits the back of the head again.

932
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:53,170
What we just talked about.
You almost like a ridge hands try.

933
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
It's almost like a richard.
Yep.

934
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,910
Well you remember when chocolate
delicioso throw that you got to

935
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,520
chocolate liddell's sweatshirt on those
new routes of fight ones,

936
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:01,110
right?
Yeah.

937
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:06,110
Had a boss one t shirt at home.
Oh you guys got one chocolate deli said

938
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:08,560
throw it like over the top of his head.

939
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,260
Like he would.
He would throw this crazy one and that's

940
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:13,180
how he hit allister when they find him
pride,

941
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,380
he threw it like,
like not a.

942
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,850
Not circular at all,
but like,

943
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,540
like a 12 slash six punch,
you know?

944
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:22,360
It's a complete different punch.
that's what I tell people.

945
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:24,160
I said,
how do I say,

946
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:29,370
I've always really liked the technique
from chuck is he's also wide open.

947
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,320
A bitch gives them almost power equal
left or right,

948
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,430
so just like the and just I like to
fight like that as well and he can hit

949
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,830
really,
really hot and he's not afraid about

950
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,720
opening up.
Sometimes though with him,

951
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,450
you know,
if he gets too excited instead of

952
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:46,660
stepping back,
he goes in for the kill and that got him

953
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,720
in trouble later in his career because
if you would simply step back and come

954
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,640
back.
But that's why every person,

955
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,840
every guy,
every,

956
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:56,480
everybody likes chocolate l you don't
look at chocolate day,

957
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:56,801
say,
oh,

958
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,230
he lost a couple of times by knockout.

959
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,410
Nobody will say that.
He did not lose one fan because he's

960
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:05,440
always there to fight.
That's why I really liked chuck.

961
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,720
Yeah.
He had one of the most exciting

962
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,750
attitudes ever in fighting.
He was always do or die and early in his

963
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:16,540
career he had an incredible chin.
Chin was just iron.

964
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,630
You ever see the palae fight when he
fought and valley tudo in Brazil?

965
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:20,110
No.
No,

966
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,200
I heard about it though.
It was crazy,

967
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,070
crazy fighting that that was a fight
where they had a net under the bottom

968
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,750
rope.
They fought in a ring,

969
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,980
but it was modified for valley tuto
where the bottom rope from the bottom,

970
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,070
the to the floor

971
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,030
of the ring was a net going get out.
They're trapped,

972
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,900
bare knuckle and chuck's got hIm trapped
in there and just beating the fuck out

973
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:43,880
of them,
like smushed up there.

974
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,140
And this was back when,
you know,

975
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,220
chuck was known for his striking,
but he was a very good wrestler.

976
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,330
Yep.
Before that.

977
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,010
Yeah,
that's why I stopped everything though,

978
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,360
you know,
that was one of the things that,

979
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,820
what the fuck was his name?
the guy who,

980
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,830
uh,
was the matchmaker for the ufc already.

981
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,770
John perretti.
John perretti told chuck right before he

982
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,990
fought his first fight in the ufc.
He said,

983
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:05,720
if you take this guy down,
you'll never fight for us again.

984
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,540
Oh wow.
That's like somebody said it to chuck

985
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,060
right before he fought and they didn't
want them to try to wrestle.

986
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,710
Fuck his way.
So chuck was like,

987
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:13,950
oh jesus,
all right,

988
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,170
that's the debut of chuck liddell.
You know,

989
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,690
who knew,
hey,

990
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,640
I got great hair

991
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,820
power.
Well you hit,

992
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,990
hit,
hit hackleman.

993
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,630
His trainer is also a legend,
you know,

994
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:27,990
and uh,
a great guy and a real wild man too.

995
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,010
They were a perfect combination,
you know,

996
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,560
hackleman and chuck.
No,

997
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:33,690
chuck's early days.
You,

998
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:35,110
you know,
you watched some of those fights like

999
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:36,220
the bob lou fight.
I mean,

1000
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,580
he was just a fucking destroyer as the
cake,

1001
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,410
right?
That was the,

1002
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,190
that was the second time they fought,
right?

1003
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:43,600
Wasn't it?
I don't worry about

1004
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,340
if we have morrow here,
he'll uh,

1005
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:47,360
he'll,
he'll tell the dates.

1006
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:48,530
EverytHing.
Well with mom

1007
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,760
tomorrow gets better.
We'll definitely have a backer.

1008
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:52,030
I would,
I would love to talk to them.

1009
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,790
I love morrow.
He's such a great guy.

1010
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,240
He really is.
We have some crazy stores in Japan also

1011
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,580
because we,
everything was just fun.

1012
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,720
We would come home or we will come home.
We will eat breakfast in Japan.

1013
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,180
You know,
you wake up early because if the jetlag

1014
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,210
were there at 5:30 window,
breakfast place opens.

1015
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,760
We sit down and our table,
we start with two,

1016
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,160
it will be at the end,
25 guys out there.

1017
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:18,540
Everybody jumps up there because it's
comedy central all morning on all the

1018
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,410
fighters.
You know,

1019
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:21,690
everybody's laughing,
everybody's having a good time.

1020
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,010
Well,
you guys did a lot of that

1021
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,730
comedy sketches to.
There was a lot of fun with pride in

1022
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:27,564
those early years days.

1023
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,740
In the early day she had.
This was just a.

1024
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:32,000
That was with the quarters,
the quarters,

1025
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,550
they allowed us to do this and it all
happened because I forgot my suit.

1026
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,790
I didn't know that.
As a commentator you needed to wear a

1027
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:43,030
suit so they thought I was messing with
them.

1028
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:43,781
I go,
no,

1029
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,810
I really didn't bring us.
Nobody told me to bring a certain.

1030
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,300
So I was in my shorts,
flip flops and had this hawaiian shirt

1031
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:54,301
on and that was the first one that I'm
hitting back and there's a bunch of

1032
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:57,310
these acacias.
They're fannIng me down a feeding me

1033
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,580
grapes and I'm doing.
I'm talking to steven who is in the

1034
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:01,690
event,
you know,

1035
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:04,090
we're going back and forth and they say,
hey man,

1036
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,670
we really liked that.
Maybe we should keep doing this.

1037
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,740
and then we started coming up with this
crazy opening.

1038
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,140
Well,
a lot of what you were doing,

1039
00:44:10,141 --> 00:44:11,790
it was,
I don't even know if I was working for

1040
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:15,240
the ufc back then,
but guys from jujitsu we would all get

1041
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,490
together.
We'd either go over my friend john's

1042
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:20,760
house where we go over my house and we
get together with a bunch of guys and we

1043
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:23,700
would watch pride and ah,
those were the days.

1044
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,650
So were the days because that,
it was the early days of mma and you

1045
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:30,780
know,
we had had in the nineties you'd have

1046
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:33,270
the,
which was kind of struggling at the time

1047
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,360
because they were kicked off a cable and
the only way you could get it was on

1048
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:39,420
direct tv.
This is presumed Was before zoo

1049
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:43,110
football.
But that's like right up around the time

1050
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:46,560
where pride started.
Take off with a first hixon fight in a

1051
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:49,050
lot of people don't know.
Hixon started off pride.

1052
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,830
Yup.
Hickson was in pride month.

1053
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,713
Yeah.
Takota.

1054
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,550
Yeah.
That was the first fight.

1055
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,490
A second.
Robert put them on a map by beating the

1056
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:57,420
gracious.
Yeah.

1057
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,950
Yeah.
That's when it became big.

1058
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:01,050
That's why I always say,
you know,

1059
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:05,850
for reason for that is rising that they
need.

1060
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,320
They need a sacral rob.
I like.

1061
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:08,990
I didn't need a japanese guy.
They,

1062
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,200
they could do a few shows like this with
a fade or an ankle and vandelay silva

1063
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:16,230
coming back and they can do a few shows,
but eventually people want to root for

1064
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:17,210
their own.
You know,

1065
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,470
they needed the japanese guy like South
Africa.

1066
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:21,890
You remember in k one?
He was getting very.

1067
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,230
I think he won the first one,
but that was before all the foreigners

1068
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:28,060
gaming ones,
the seek it teach you and all the.

1069
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,670
That was an animal bronco knocked out.
Who's,

1070
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,150
oh man,
fuck,

1071
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:36,380
I could fuck it.
We saw the yelp a,

1072
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,930
the whole in holland.
That's.

1073
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,570
That was the fame.
Most famous place.

1074
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,570
Every fight was there always.
That was one night.

1075
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,160
We had four guys from Thailand who were
there and they were fighting old guys

1076
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,170
from magiro gym like rob cayman,
mila.

1077
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:50,650
Well globally.
I mean all,

1078
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:55,651
all the great guys hold a great strikers
flamenco at a world title fights and it

1079
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:58,110
was broadcast live to Thailand.

1080
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,740
Wow.
They all got knocked out.

1081
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,410
That never happened again.
After that.

1082
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,630
They destroyed him.
It was awesome.

1083
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:08,350
What was it?
That was the holland days of,

1084
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,180
you know,
the,

1085
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,180
the top holland guys when right around
the time where ramon dekkers started

1086
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:19,960
dominating and rob came and started
dominating so much talent came out of

1087
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:24,961
holland in holland is a small country.
If you look at the size of holland,

1088
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:27,970
do you look at the amount of high level
kick boxers that have come out of there?

1089
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,470
It's pretty incredible.

1090
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,560
You know,
you did the k one for instance.

1091
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:35,440
They at the end,
from the final eight,

1092
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,680
they fight all year.
They make a final tournament for the

1093
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:42,170
people who don't understand it.
They fight 10 times a year or 10 shows

1094
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:44,770
year and then in decemBer does the final
aid,

1095
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:48,430
like the ufc started,
eight fighters the best from the whole

1096
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,550
year compete against each other.
Whoever wins gets like 40 to $50,000,

1097
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:54,880
whatever the price money is.
But they start realizing that the final

1098
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:57,670
aids were six were dutch,
seven words show now,

1099
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:58,660
if you will,
for instance,

1100
00:46:58,661 --> 00:47:03,180
in a guy who was born in Morocco but
lives in holland or even when you were

1101
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:05,360
born in a moroccan parents,
you know,

1102
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,610
suddenly you come up with the moroccan
flag because they say we can have the

1103
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,540
perfect example.
Roman vegas.

1104
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,930
The first guy I saw,
first time I saw him fight,

1105
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:19,330
I wasn't the same cart I was fighting as
well.

1106
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:20,820
So this is,
this is long time ago.

1107
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,350
This was just see class,
you know,

1108
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,910
in holland you have new c class b class
a class.

1109
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,310
And um,
and I just started.

1110
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:30,070
So I probably was new and fought c class
I

1111
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,300
believe.
And a friend of mine calls me,

1112
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,970
says,
you're going to watch.

1113
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,251
I said,
no,

1114
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:34,340
I got to fight.
I got a warm up.

1115
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:35,620
He says,
do you want to watch this?

1116
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:38,770
Get was just get.
And I see him and he's with the little

1117
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:43,660
mullet and he is skinny and he fights
this guy who was much older than he was

1118
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,160
like 16,
17 years old,

1119
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,490
an older guy with tattoos.
So automatically you go,

1120
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,680
I'm going to get killed.
And my buddy goes,

1121
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,960
just wait til he starts,
you know.

1122
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,410
And the first gig I don't,
I still remember he kicked a guy,

1123
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,310
a low kick and the guy horizontal right
horizontal and fell on the ground.

1124
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,940
I'm looking at my buddy.
I go as the craziest power I've ever

1125
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:06,550
seen.
It was so explosive and he was so skinny

1126
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,010
at the time,
but his technique was perfect.

1127
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,800
His technique was perfect and he was so
ferocious.

1128
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:13,040
Yeah,
I mean he didn't care.

1129
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,690
Like when towards the end his ankles
were so fucked up that he wanted to

1130
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:19,840
fight southpaw because he started.
He didn't want to throw the right kick,

1131
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,510
but he would.
He would kick a few times and we'd go

1132
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:25,690
fuck it and go right back to it.
And with his bad leg,

1133
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:26,790
I mean they were telling him like,
we're,

1134
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,850
we're close to amputating your leg.
You've broken your foot so many times.

1135
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,390
You broken your shin,
your,

1136
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:36,140
your whole leg is just a series of.
And he would wrap it up tight and just

1137
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,610
still wants to fight started.
He didn't give a fuck and just throw it

1138
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:41,800
right into elbows.
He'd kick everything.

1139
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,100
Our motto,
suck it.

1140
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,160
He would just place it back in the
corner and the core hammers his trainer.

1141
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,880
He told me,
I never heard him complain.

1142
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,080
Like he would say,
oh,

1143
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,720
you know,
I hurt my ankle or I hurt my hand.

1144
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,910
He said,
I had never heard him say anything.

1145
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:00,070
when he comes back,
he goes,

1146
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,080
what are you doing?
I'm putting my shoulder,

1147
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:06,280
but I can put this under the socket.
It was almost like it wasn't his body.

1148
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,320
Yeah.
Like he was using a borrowed body.

1149
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,390
Crazy guy,
man.

1150
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:11,224
Super good.
You know,

1151
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,320
that's kevin,
kevin randleman freak of nature.

1152
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,310
I mean,
he could have done any,

1153
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,830
any sport,
you know,

1154
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,170
guys like that.
And that's where ramon dekkers too and

1155
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,450
happy they found finding though.
Yeah,

1156
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:24,370
well ramon dekkers really set the
standard.

1157
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:28,720
He really set the standard for ferocity
and he sort of embodied that holland

1158
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:31,450
style,
the dutch style of more tie where they

1159
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:34,600
just.
I mean he was just a crusher crusher.

1160
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,610
Yeah.
He was like a rob came and all these

1161
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:38,020
guys,
they start what they did,

1162
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:41,020
what they lit.
The reason was they started winning

1163
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:45,850
fights in Thailand was because they had
better hands tied to hence and the kicks

1164
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:47,980
together and they didn't do that in
Thailand yet.

1165
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,370
Predominantly only kicking,
kicking in a lot of clenching.

1166
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:56,430
And then you had like a rob rob came on
or what is the greatest kick boxers

1167
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,430
ever,
you know,

1168
00:49:57,431 --> 00:49:59,800
and then you suddenly,
that's the technical version.

1169
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,600
The more smooth one probably he had the
slow twitch fibers,

1170
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:05,540
you know,
because he,

1171
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,830
don't get me wrong,
he knock you out with every punch.

1172
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:13,600
but then you had ramon dekkers was the
explosive guy that he had that technique

1173
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,480
and he,
he added the explosiveness to.

1174
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,410
It's pricelessness too.
She's just crazy power.

1175
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,930
You know,
when he fights bomb the first time,

1176
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,230
you know,
and he hits him with 26 punchy,

1177
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,100
you gotta to see the shots that he was

1178
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,890
never a 200 fights.
Never been knocked out in his life.

1179
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,180
He was the first guy to do that.
And they just see after the five wendy's

1180
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,440
down,
the whole place is quiet.

1181
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,710
Nobody moves.
And then rob cameron jumps in the ring

1182
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:43,560
with the dutch flag
pulled out.

1183
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,340
Fight up man.
rob k not robbed him.

1184
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,300
And ramon dekkers versus kolbe and kolbe
on luck.

1185
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,500
Some toy tongue,
right.

1186
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,940
Is that how you say it?
Just,

1187
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,040
it just,
I,

1188
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,110
oh,
it's been a with these bullies names.

1189
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:58,760
She knows.
It's not going to say okay at golden his

1190
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:03,770
first bam thai names are pretty crazy.
The amount of adverbs and adjectives

1191
00:51:04,551 --> 00:51:07,870
they have in their fucking like
whatever.

1192
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,880
Strange.
Yeah,

1193
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,893
the,
the uh,

1194
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,990
the amount of consonance all just lumped
in together and all these crazy names

1195
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,520
period is.
But,

1196
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,390
but just to see What kind of barriers
that hook,

1197
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,490
the kick bond.

1198
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,760
Oh yeah.
Leave that left hook,

1199
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,270
man.
What rob came in.

1200
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:28,770
The difference between rob came in.
Here we go.

1201
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,713
Yeah,
here it is.

1202
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,830
Rob came and was just more technical.
He didn't take as many chances.

1203
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,140
You didn't get hit as much.
He was very smart and very technical

1204
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:38,970
when he fought and he's a great trainer
to know.

1205
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,890
Rob cayman was really one of the guys
who was responsible for brandon vera

1206
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,680
early in his career.
You know when brandon vera was knocking

1207
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:47,960
everybody dead in the ufc early in his
career,

1208
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,150
he was training with rob came in and
when he stopped training with rob came

1209
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:53,930
in is when things started lIke not going
so well For them.

1210
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,390
Oh,
this is caLled bond.

1211
00:51:56,391 --> 00:52:00,440
This is a slow motion dishes.
They show cobana no knocking people out

1212
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:04,520
I think so they know who co bonus and
they called them the buffalo hat.

1213
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,090
That was his nickname because he never
went down while he had a giant head.

1214
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,580
And then this is,
see if they can show.

1215
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:15,610
So go slow motion.
Maybe that says slowmo honestly,

1216
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,570
that there we go.
Now they're actually fighting.

1217
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,800
This is going to be so crazy the way he
gives him the extra punch lights,

1218
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,310
an event,
you'll see it.

1219
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,420
So ramon,
like most of the time,

1220
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:31,460
fought south paws that what it was.
No,

1221
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:36,350
he didn't get the docs don't fault both.
So most of the time when he fights

1222
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:38,720
different is because he hAs an injury,
like you said.

1223
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,090
Oh,
this is lawrence skin,

1224
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,120
a kenshin,
uh,

1225
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,050
who's an amazing,
uh,

1226
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,720
like analyst.
He does a fantastic job of breaking down

1227
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:50,060
fights.
HiS fight breakdowns are amazing,

1228
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:53,240
but he does a lot of it in slow motion
to show technique.

1229
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:57,120
So see if he could find just the actual
fight instead of that video because when

1230
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,670
you should definitely,
if you're a fan of striking and you want

1231
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:02,220
to understand it a little bit of a
little bit better watch lawrence and

1232
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:02,780
stuff.

1233
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,411
What is the,
uh,

1234
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,170
his Youtube channel.
Lawrence's youtube channel because she

1235
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:07,670
kept him some props.
Just his nAme.

1236
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:09,650
Lawrence pension.
He's amazing.

1237
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,980
Lawrence is amazing.
He does such a great job of breaking

1238
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,870
down fights.
His videos are incredible.

1239
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,470
And um,
he really deserves a lot of credit for

1240
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:20,270
that.
I love watching his breakdowns,

1241
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,000
especially tie.
He loves it.

1242
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:25,530
A lot of moitai moitai breakdown.
So here's the actual fight itself,

1243
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,600
man.
these are the,

1244
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:32,330
these are like in a lot of ways,
like unprecedented times because that

1245
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:37,331
ties back in those days we,
we were used to karate and we were used

1246
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:41,170
to a pka kickboxing.
Yeah,

1247
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,170
10 gigs.
Wok to the.

1248
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,280
At first I didn't know.
And then when westerners started going

1249
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:49,860
over to Thailand and competing as the
ties,

1250
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,540
we've started seeing what high level
more time they had and they're kicking

1251
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:56,760
technique.
And especially the low kicks was just

1252
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:57,630
devastating.

1253
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,770
That was the first,
the,

1254
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,870
the,
the american championship when they

1255
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,910
came,
when they lost it was low kicks,

1256
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,180
gamble.
We're making sure weren't ready for

1257
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,730
rufus.
Went and fought.

1258
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:08,490
And it's kind of funny because duke
roufus talks about,

1259
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:11,140
he kind of laughs about it now that they
were saying when,

1260
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:14,130
when his brother got fucked up,
I forget who his brother fought,

1261
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:16,230
but he got lit up with leg kicks and
stopped.

1262
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,810
And duke was like,
well,

1263
00:54:17,811 --> 00:54:20,070
there's not a lot of techniques of that.
And you know,

1264
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,960
I don't think there's much doesn't take
much talent,

1265
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:25,080
but
they didn't know.

1266
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,180
You said it's god.
This is it.

1267
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:33,810
Ramon dekkers in his prime.
I know the coupon gets up the finishing

1268
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:38,811
point she's going to give,
which went to god the fucking hands.

1269
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:44,120
How tough was coal bon looking at me?
He's out on his feet.

1270
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:44,963
He's walking forward.

1271
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,760
They've given him a standing eight count
the last right hand.

1272
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:50,310
What's the into?
This is going to be so bad as.

1273
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,610
It's amazing.
How much bond could take the book.

1274
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,670
Oh,
that's it.

1275
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,950
Watch.
Look at the audience.

1276
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,520
Just only dutch guys.
Everybody's quiet and then you see a

1277
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,750
cayman coming in,
but it's going to get the flag

1278
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,540
man.
How fucking tough was cold bond too,

1279
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,480
to take those shots.
A lot of people lost a lot of money

1280
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,370
there.
I mean there's not a whole lot of people

1281
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:21,990
on the planet.
His weight,

1282
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:26,250
they would have taken those punches as
many as he took clean to the face and

1283
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,270
there we saw the flag
and,

1284
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,710
and ramon dekkers was just teeing off
full power.

1285
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,900
I mean,
winging those shots in on them too,

1286
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,070
man.
You know,

1287
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,430
there's such a scary guy.
Yeah,

1288
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,273
man.
Yeah.

1289
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,650
Glory days while he's up there now with
gavin.

1290
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,790
So they're having a blast.
Yeah.

1291
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,780
He,
he died young as well.

1292
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,970
Yeah.
A heart attack while he was riding his

1293
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:51,691
bike.
His bike.

1294
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:52,880
Yep.
What was that?

1295
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,440
Do they know what happened?
No,

1296
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,590
the first started,
maybe it fell,

1297
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:56,790
but it was,
it was just hard.

1298
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,150
And he's also,
because we all been crazy every week.

1299
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:01,290
We all liked going push,
pushing limits,

1300
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,540
you know,
we were drinking with everything in it,

1301
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:07,260
but he was stoli like a year.
Nothing was started cycling and I knew,

1302
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,510
you know,
once he starts showing and he loved

1303
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:12,960
cycling,
I'm was going to go 50 miles an hour.

1304
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:15,480
I know he's going to because that's how,
who he is.

1305
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,930
He can't stop being the best at
everything he does.

1306
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,570
So I thought it wasn't just riding his
bike,

1307
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,130
be going crazy with wisco.
Yeah,

1308
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,250
that's his attitude was pushing animal
such an animal.

1309
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,650
He probably pushed himself to his heart
broke.

1310
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,390
And also when you see him,
you know,

1311
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,750
all the elder punishment,
he got into tae with all the cuts on his

1312
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:38,560
forehead
looks really bad.

1313
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,720
So when you're looking at it,
you go,

1314
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,580
oh yeah,
that's.

1315
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,830
Yeah,
I want that.

1316
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,690
Well,
I remember when he fought duane ludwig

1317
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,710
towards the end of his career.
I mean deep into.

1318
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,290
I mean his face was flattened out is
massive scar tissue all over his eyes.

1319
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:54,200
His nose was flattened out.
I mean he took a lot of fun.

1320
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,370
I don't think anybody's face changed
more than vandalized though,

1321
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:01,130
that his face got flattened.
I mean,

1322
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,640
you look at vandelay during the old
valley,

1323
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:06,330
tudo days and then vandelay towards the
end and pride.

1324
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,460
I mean it changed his face,
didn't they do surgery?

1325
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:10,930
But the post,
like nick diaz did,

1326
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:13,720
you know,
to make a flutter in the ufc.

1327
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,600
They did not only did that,
they took cartilage out of his rib and

1328
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,580
reconstructed his nose and vandal.

1329
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,280
He had his nose made big so that he
could get more.

1330
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,790
Aaron.
He looked crazy because his nose looks

1331
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,620
very different than it used to look
like.

1332
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:30,040
I remember the first time I saw him was
on the way.

1333
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,010
He was like for the weigh ins.
He wasn't fighting.

1334
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,040
He was with someone else and he came up
the stage and I didn't know who the fuck

1335
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,280
it was
scary and someone said,

1336
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:40,180
that's vandelay.
And I went,

1337
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,560
what?
What?

1338
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:45,910
Because he had just gotten the surgery
so his face was pulled tight.

1339
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:49,780
His eyebrows were pulled tight and his
nose was big.

1340
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:54,130
It was like he had his nose made much
larger with a big piece of cartilage so

1341
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:57,280
that they can take punches.
Oh yeah.

1342
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,730
That's the same at the stupid air.
So you know those golden flowers.

1343
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,570
I sucked them out three times a day.
You've got to step through it and you

1344
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,150
didn't need a big syringe and a large
needle because I do not want to have

1345
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,230
those areas and they go,
oh no.

1346
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,910
The considerate trophies.
I go,

1347
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:14,050
okay,
good for you.

1348
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,330
For me,
I always worry your guards.

1349
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:19,960
I have a little tiny pieces of it here
and they always wore at your garden.

1350
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,210
It's just,
it's just not smart.

1351
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,890
It's it.
It affects your hearing,

1352
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,080
like it looks cool,
but it affects the way,

1353
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,680
the reason that is designed that way.
So the sound echoes off the outside of

1354
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:33,310
the year and you could hear better.
Like if you take your ear like folks who

1355
00:58:33,311 --> 00:58:34,990
don't have cauliflower ear,
take your ear,

1356
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,390
go over the top of your ear and bend it
down.

1357
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,150
That's what those guys are hearing like
all the time.

1358
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,430
Like randy,
randy can't even use iphone earpods.

1359
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:43,990
Those.
You're,

1360
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,823
you're,
you're,

1361
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,640
they can put them in things.
So yeah,

1362
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,170
walk around with a bluetooth and I said,
how can you listen to.

1363
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,870
It's not even an air will.
Randy told me to his,

1364
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,660
you know what happens with what it is is
calcification.

1365
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:01,300
So when your,
your brakes and bleeds,

1366
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,030
if you don't drain it,
it actually turns the calcium.

1367
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,250
Turns out.
So it's like a bone.

1368
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,630
So what randy would do is get on top of
guys and grind his ear into their

1369
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,760
eyeball.
He would get his ear like when he's

1370
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,370
taking guys down,
he was shoved his ear.

1371
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,430
Right?
It's like he had a rock.

1372
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:19,460
Something very wrong with this guy
looking at.

1373
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,403
Yeah.
Well,

1374
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:25,430
and just to let people know at home it
really tiny surgery can fix this right

1375
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,264
away.
I mean,

1376
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,710
they can fix this in,
in,

1377
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,390
in 10 minutes.
Now.

1378
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,970
One of eddie bravo's black belts.
Brent,

1379
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:33,230
He had it done.
He had his,

1380
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:35,930
uh,
his ear caught and then they pulled back

1381
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:37,100
and they pull the stuff out.

1382
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,250
But it can,
it can get very dangerous too.

1383
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,360
You can get some infections in there.
Like you remember dave?

1384
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:42,250
Tarell?
Yeah.

1385
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,400
Dave had his ear fucking removed because
he had such.

1386
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,890
He had his ear removed.
They had to cauterize the inside of his

1387
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:52,580
ear because infections were so bad that
it was like it was fucking with his

1388
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:54,560
equilibrium.
His balance was off.

1389
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,010
Like the whole inside of his ear was
just pus and infections.

1390
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,850
Kimbo against thompson.
James thompson fight when he,

1391
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,170
they called it like a satellite was hits
it that you see.

1392
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,420
He went in there with.
I mean,

1393
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:10,310
he didn't,
not only did he not drain it,

1394
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:12,760
it was like a recent blood.
It was like,

1395
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,480
it was like he had a mouse living in his
ear.

1396
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,640
It was big.
Oh,

1397
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,720
that was nasty.
And then he hits it.

1398
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,640
That was nastia splitter.
Well,

1399
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:21,710
probably no one's worse than jessica.

1400
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,030
I versus a laura.
Laura smith.

1401
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,890
Was it Laura Smith?
What was her name?

1402
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,020
the gunshot.
Leslie leslie smith.

1403
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,150
Thank you.
And jessica.

1404
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:37,151
I hits her an ear and you see the blood
up in the air from her ear was insane.

1405
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,550
It will be crazy if she hits.
She used the blood flying and I go try

1406
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:46,320
to catch it to this great to see it
right there.

1407
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:50,030
And half of her ear was hanging off her
head.

1408
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,160
And by the way,
how tough is leslie smith?

1409
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:55,010
Because leslie smith was mad that they
stopped the fight.

1410
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,740
She had a fucking hole that you could
see her brain.

1411
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:58,280
Oh,
I.

1412
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,310
I'm always been a big fan of less,
but listen nickname.

1413
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,750
Right.
The gunslinger or something.

1414
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:03,740
That's a.
It's a.

1415
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,260
What is her nickname?
Something like a western.

1416
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,573
I dunno.
Yeah,

1417
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,270
I dunno.
It fits her Because she's tough.

1418
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:15,620
And jessica to start targeting that one
spot over and over again.

1419
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:16,670
Oh,
it's disgusting.

1420
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,530
That was a.
That was a nasty ear,

1421
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:19,364
man.
That was a bad.

1422
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:20,770
I never got that.
People use.

1423
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,830
I will be too nice at that moment.
I won't.

1424
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,640
I won't hit that day or I guess people
go like,

1425
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,620
oh,
that's a clint eastwood.

1426
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:31,730
I thought a bike.
Cynthia is towards

1427
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,143
the peacemaker.

1428
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,240
Well,
woman's mma is really heating up right

1429
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:38,751
now.
Right?

1430
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:39,760
With joanna.
You and judge.

1431
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,390
Check a lover.
Who's the.

1432
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,330
Who's the guy?
Yeah,

1433
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:45,530
she's fun,
man.

1434
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,380
That chick is wild.
She breaks her hands a lot too.

1435
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,080
Unfortunately.
She broke her hands in to ufc fight so

1436
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:53,480
far in the first.
The first ones,

1437
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:54,530
but I just the last five.
yeah,

1438
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,850
that's why she couldn't finish.
He said.

1439
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,230
Yeah,
total edible.

1440
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,630
Yeah.
She's tough as shit level show.

1441
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,670
The way she gets in,
in,

1442
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,780
in the,
in their head,

1443
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:05,090
you know,
the way his story gets low and looks at

1444
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:06,680
it from below.
She's dangerous.

1445
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:10,700
She's dangerous,
but claudia good data is a fucking beast

1446
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:11,390
to.
Yup.

1447
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,910
That's a great fight.
And they're going to coach alongside

1448
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:15,920
each other.
They're gonna coach on the ultimate

1449
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:19,130
fighter and then they're gonna fight and
they're gonna fight the day,

1450
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,380
the big july ufc 200 card.

1451
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,191
Oh,
well yeah.

1452
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:27,240
So they're going to have the finalS on
friday where the ultimate fighter finals

1453
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:28,800
and then they're going to fight for the
title.

1454
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,810
You want to young jay,
check and logic a day,

1455
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,880
and then they're going to have the big
200 card,

1456
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,850
which they don't even know exactly who'S
going to fight in the 200 card.

1457
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:40,290
And I mean that's july.
So a lot depends on conor mcgregor

1458
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,950
versus dos anjos no,
no,

1459
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,690
this just for joanna.
I want to see the ultimate fighter.

1460
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:47,450
Now you know,
because that.

1461
01:02:47,451 --> 01:02:50,100
That's going to be interesting because
they're a personality I think.

1462
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,660
Oh yeah.
It's going to make it.

1463
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,060
Well,
a good data.

1464
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,900
Also an animal.
Well,

1465
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:58,350
they fought and it was a split decision
very close right away.

1466
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,830
The codella luke's,
right?

1467
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,590
Her body.
Yes.

1468
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,960
Like in a,
also like a machine.

1469
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,770
Very good moitai too,
but really good ground game.

1470
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,120
Yep.
So the question is,

1471
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:12,540
what is she gonna be able to get it to
the ground because joanna hurt her in

1472
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:15,330
the first round,
knocked her down and won that round.

1473
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:16,860
But a lot of people thought that
claudIa,

1474
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:20,040
I might've won the second and third.
So it was a very close fight,

1475
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:24,390
very close fight,
very controversial and very tightly

1476
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,210
disputed fight.
So I think the rematch can be very

1477
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:28,920
exciting.
I'm looking forward to that.

1478
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:33,480
Who said chika work with for wrestling?
That's a good question.

1479
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,540
That's a good question.
I don't know who her wrestling coaches,

1480
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,030
but I think she does a lot of her work
in Poland,

1481
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,410
you know,
because she lives in Poland.

1482
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,350
So,
I mean there's so many good european

1483
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:44,430
wrestling coaches,
you know,

1484
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,520
europe and wrestling,
there's a lot of great,

1485
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,140
uh,
like especially,

1486
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:49,430
uh,
they,

1487
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,180
they,
they bring a lot of eastern bloc

1488
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,920
wrestlers,
a lot of the russian wrestlers.

1489
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,260
Like that's what how george st pierre
got so good,

1490
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:58,830
the russian nationals who are training
up in montreal and he goes,

1491
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,410
oh,
so technical to,

1492
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:02,340
you know,
those guys,

1493
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,790
the russian style of wrestling is so
technical,

1494
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:07,830
so drill oriented,
you know,

1495
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,790
there's so many really high level.
I mean look at what's happening now in

1496
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:16,470
the ufc with all these sambo guYs.
These high level grapplers like,

1497
01:04:16,471 --> 01:04:17,700
um,
um,

1498
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,300
well first of all you've got a habib,
norma madoff who,

1499
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:22,980
who's one of the best in the lightweight
division,

1500
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,440
but he's another one that has a hard
time staying healthy,

1501
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:27,270
you know,
but,

1502
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,670
but you,
you think it's a training or you think

1503
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:32,250
it's just the person who knows,
you know,

1504
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,510
it could be both.
You know what I mean?

1505
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:35,940
He's such a fucking animal.
You see the way he fights,

1506
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,570
you got to think he trains that way.

1507
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,140
The way he fights it.
Just so grinding.

1508
01:04:40,141 --> 01:04:42,810
He so fucking attacking and relentless
like a badger,

1509
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,670
you know?
So who knows?

1510
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,390
Yeah,
I,

1511
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:46,340
I always,
I,

1512
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,160
I wish I was guilty of that as well.
I trained really hood like,

1513
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:52,800
but what I hear stories I hear fight or
saying,

1514
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:57,060
oh,
we go like on fridays we spar like 70

1515
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,780
percent and I go in and they said no,
that's it.

1516
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,000
I say that's just,
that's it for sparring.

1517
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,920
Yeah.
Oh wow.

1518
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,370
And they always ask,
oh,

1519
01:05:06,371 --> 01:05:08,730
so how many times she did it after your
workout?

1520
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,030
Because that's what we're gonna do you
know if we're going to try to.

1521
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,030
I'll try to hurt your legs while I.
If you have to fight,

1522
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:17,890
I won't be in your body.
I will go with kickstarter.

1523
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,440
I expect that most show to go hard with
me and the hats,

1524
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,251
you know?
Yeah,

1525
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,480
of course.
We watch out for the head.

1526
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:24,970
We don't knock each other out too much.
Too much,

1527
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:27,120
too much because it happens as well,
right?

1528
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,800
It's inevitable,
but that's why.

1529
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:32,800
But I didn't fight for seven years.
When I did that,

1530
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:33,431
2000,
six,

1531
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,830
five,
I felt great to share no ring rust.

1532
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,200
I said no,
because we're doing it two times a day.

1533
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,970
We're training,
we're training,

1534
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,220
you know,
and if you're used to it is the same as

1535
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:43,870
a fight.
Even if they go hard,

1536
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,710
that's a fight.
Yeah.

1537
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,950
Well it's very similar if you train like
that.

1538
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:52,270
Some people feel like that's one of the
ideas behind hard training is that when

1539
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:55,150
you train hard,
you fight hard and it becomes normal.

1540
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:59,440
But then other people think,
well you really should just train

1541
01:05:59,441 --> 01:06:00,940
technical,
like a lot of the ties.

1542
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,090
Do they train more technical and more
light wIth their sparring.

1543
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:06,790
The hard work is all pad work in bag
work.

1544
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,660
So there's people that think like that's
the way to save yourself.

1545
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,510
Wonderboy says that.
He says he spars very light now because

1546
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,520
he wants to preserve his chin,
wants to preserve hIs head.

1547
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:16,910
He's like,
he saves the,

1548
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:19,240
the hard work for the bag and for
fights.

1549
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:22,180
I used to,
to in a lot with my buddy amir,

1550
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:25,570
amir,
perhaps the navy seal guy from Israel.

1551
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,040
And um,
he,

1552
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,410
um,
he's the one guy who could hang with me

1553
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:32,440
and I mean stemming noise because I will
not go my way,

1554
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,050
but we will go hot.
People who see us,

1555
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,990
they think without a control,
but it's not at all.

1556
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,670
So it's also about who you train with.
If one day your,

1557
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:46,090
your steady sparring partner is sick and
somebody else pops up or you don't know

1558
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,370
that guy and that guy tries to make a
name for himself,

1559
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,020
you know,
that's when you get the injuries.

1560
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,170
But I truly believe in going hArd.
How many times do you see?

1561
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:58,380
It really angers me if I see guys in a
clinch needing other people and they

1562
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:01,900
need them.
Like they need training,

1563
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:06,490
they just lift their legs.
Nobody gives a real neat look at joanna

1564
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,630
when she makes sydney different story or
alister explode in there.

1565
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:14,540
Yeah,
to have a sticker on a nice to the

1566
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,140
thighs and it's not going to do anything
if you do it like that.

1567
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,550
right?
If you do one hard one,

1568
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,460
it's worse than a low kick because they
don't expect it.

1569
01:07:21,461 --> 01:07:23,230
The muscles relax.
He goes straight through,

1570
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,770
but nobody doeS it.
So yeah,

1571
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:27,340
there's a few.
And we were talking about it one percent

1572
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:28,720
of the fighters,
but isn't it though,

1573
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:31,390
like all techniques,
like some guys just aren't that good at

1574
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:33,520
certain techniques,
they just don't have the kind of pop

1575
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:36,430
like you'll see guys throw kicks and
this is nothing to them.

1576
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:39,370
And it's not that they're not trying as
they don't have the looseness of the

1577
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:41,770
hips,
they don't have that sort of snap into

1578
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,840
the keg,
no emotional time.

1579
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,410
It's just technique.
If he,

1580
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,360
if you train your legs and you put like
10 pound ankle weights and you just

1581
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:50,980
start throwing knees from zero,
don't,

1582
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,490
don't make it.
Then a bouncing lake,

1583
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,330
um,
sit ups,

1584
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,650
I can do a thousand sit ups as long as I
use momentum to get back up.

1585
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,630
That's the problem with a lot of guys
do.

1586
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:04,960
They do the knees.
It's all momentum standstill,

1587
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,520
xplode standstill,
explode.

1588
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:11,460
And a trick also with nis is to move
your hips away from your partner

1589
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:14,320
statements with a straight punch.
The longer than he is on its way,

1590
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,850
the more power it's going to have.
And these guys,

1591
01:08:16,851 --> 01:08:17,391
they don't,
they,

1592
01:08:17,391 --> 01:08:18,680
they actually,
they teach.

1593
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,860
Throw your hips in with the needs of the
body is the dumbest thing to do.

1594
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,440
It's like me giving you a straight punch
and closing the distance.

1595
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:26,480
I'm jamming myself.
You don't want to do that.

1596
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:28,370
Free it up.
let the hip flexor do the work.

1597
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,440
And at the moment you connect.
Yeah,

1598
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:32,230
that's when you want to push your weight
in.

1599
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:36,860
But a lot of guys don't do it like that.
They just need like they do in training.

1600
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:39,660
Inspiring.
Do you get frustrated when.

1601
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:43,070
I mean obviously there's some very high
level training going on an mma,

1602
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:45,500
some very high level training,
but there's also some training where you

1603
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:48,140
see these guys like they're just not
really prepared correctly.

1604
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,750
Well if kicking inTo bowls and the
inside low kick a night,

1605
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:55,160
90 percent of when it happens,
it's just because the guy doesn't know

1606
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:57,950
how to get because he's kicking me,
kicking up his right foot.

1607
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,810
If he gets with a leftist,
rightfully his toes,

1608
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:01,970
I guarantee you,
pointing straight to the opponent.

1609
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,720
What they need to do is open that foot
letter,

1610
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:08,870
toes point to the side,
and then the angle is much easier to

1611
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:10,400
kick.
You will never have that problem.

1612
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,180
These are just guys who Don't know how
to kick and that's why to kick into

1613
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:13,791
pills.
Well,

1614
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:17,030
it's interesting because there's that
kick to the balls of so much more common

1615
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:21,950
in mma than it is in more tie in glory
because they know exactly that going

1616
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,833
kick.
You know,

1617
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:25,940
we were taLking about gloria getting
before the podcast started.

1618
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:30,470
We're talking about glory.
Getting picked up by fight past glory

1619
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:34,640
right now is so good.
there's so much high level kickbox and

1620
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:36,800
talent in the world and now that you
know,

1621
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:39,740
glory picked up.
It'S showtime and k ones not really

1622
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:42,710
around anymore.
I mean glories the game is the game.

1623
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,050
That's it.
He got the best guys on the planet now.

1624
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:46,370
You know goco saki,
even.

1625
01:09:46,371 --> 01:09:47,060
Yeah.
He got injured.

1626
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,270
No,
but I don't know.

1627
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,560
I don't know.
I just found out,

1628
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,410
you know,
mara told me because he was gonna maybe

1629
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:56,810
do that show.
I think maybe now it's ron crook falling

1630
01:09:56,811 --> 01:09:58,730
in for him,
but I'm saki.

1631
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:01,100
That's,
that's the guy was like tyson.

1632
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:03,060
And this what I teach a lot,
double rides,

1633
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,640
double left punches,
you know,

1634
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,030
everybody has a pattern.
Um,

1635
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,370
the fight that really upset me is
packeo.

1636
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:14,500
Ken's mayweather.
Re veterans hanging against the ropes.

1637
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,610
I was just unloading,
but everYthing is left,

1638
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:16,971
right,
left,

1639
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:17,301
right,
left,

1640
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:17,661
right,
left,

1641
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:19,700
right now.
If you think of Mike Tyson suddenly

1642
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:22,520
throws in the left upper god liver shut
or spleen.

1643
01:10:22,521 --> 01:10:24,200
Write up like a double right?
Double left.

1644
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:28,520
You mix that into a pattern because if
you throw a boxer in the corner and you

1645
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:30,200
start unloading on him with right,
left,

1646
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:30,621
right,
left,

1647
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:31,710
right,
left punch veteran,

1648
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,020
they just punch.

1649
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,430
Yeah,
but if you go left,

1650
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:35,150
right,
left,

1651
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,140
left,
left bubble,

1652
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,940
and you changed the second punch as
well,

1653
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,940
like a three shot with a left hook,
and then you go to the body.

1654
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:43,040
Well,
keep looking in his eyes or a left

1655
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:45,230
uppercut.
Change the angle of the punch,

1656
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,620
but use the same arm.
That's when you get really effective and

1657
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:51,860
you see it as in boxing and thai boxing.
Everybody who does it is really

1658
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:54,050
effective at it.
Yet he didn't do it.

1659
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:56,360
They got paid $80,000,000 in
$180,000,000.

1660
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:58,770
You would expect to do that.
Yeah.

1661
01:10:58,771 --> 01:11:01,040
I had a shoulder injury that doesn't
prevent them from touring.

1662
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,330
A double left.
Our double right.

1663
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,430
Mike dyson,
spleen might up bucket.

1664
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,600
I think you know,
six out guys.

1665
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:08,900
I would like to bang,
bang over unusual patterns.

1666
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:09,860
Yep.
That's it.

1667
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,600
Yeah.
Did you ever see the uh,

1668
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,310
well john wayne has got fucking amazing
highlight

1669
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,790
reel,
but one of them on my instagram page the

1670
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:21,600
other day where he hits this guy with
seven upper cuts in a row with the right

1671
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:22,434
side is bad.

1672
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:23,343
Bang,
bang,

1673
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,030
bang.
Like you can't prepare.

1674
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:26,500
You don't know the guy's going to do
that.

1675
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:29,070
I do this yesterday.
My class double right up at gun left.

1676
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:32,560
People don't know double lift.
I had to hector pena.

1677
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,320
He had three left upper cuts and the
second,

1678
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,360
the third one,
the guy fell already down.

1679
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,400
He hit him on the way down is three
leftover.

1680
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,580
Here's the deal,
john wayne par highlight.

1681
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,400
I love this highlight.
He said

1682
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,390
he's an animal.
If one is good,

1683
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:49,900
two is better.
John wayne par is a wild mother.

1684
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,730
Really a great guy.
total edible.

1685
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:57,150
He also came up with that striking
organization where he lives with mom.

1686
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:58,280
Vague loss pretty much,
right?

1687
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:02,420
It's his tie.
I'd never got anybody who doesn't do

1688
01:12:02,421 --> 01:12:05,810
that or why they don't do that here.
well they should and maybe he can bring

1689
01:12:05,811 --> 01:12:07,390
it to the United States,
but you know,

1690
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:10,460
what he wanted to do is have like a
cage.

1691
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,220
Like he likes the cage,
he likes the fact that you're trapped in

1692
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:15,320
there and he likes the small gloves.
So it was like,

1693
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:16,700
let's just do listen.
Fuck.

1694
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:18,700
The ground game was just strike like
this.

1695
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,470
I love a guy like that.
He's a wild guy.

1696
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,380
He's fun.
Have you ever seen the pictures of his

1697
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:24,740
face?

1698
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,270
Like how many times he's been stitched
up?

1699
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,680
Oh no.
I can only imagine.

1700
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:30,830
There's a picture of John William
[inaudible] face after one of his fights

1701
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,130
were.
His entire face is like a roadmap of

1702
01:12:34,131 --> 01:12:36,020
stitches.
It's fucking crazy.

1703
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,170
Like see if you could find that picture
because it's one of those pictures.

1704
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:40,370
You just,
you just look at it.

1705
01:12:40,371 --> 01:12:41,750
You start shaking your head and
blinking.

1706
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,650
Like what the fuck?
His whole face is patched together.

1707
01:12:45,651 --> 01:12:46,850
Look at,
look at this photograph.

1708
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,170
Look at this.
Oh,

1709
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,880
jesus christ.
Real.

1710
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,770
Yes.
That is the craziest thing.

1711
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,450
It's one fight.
One fight.

1712
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:55,190
His entire face.
A thai guy.

1713
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,450
Yeah.
He got the shit elbowed out of them.

1714
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:01,190
Wow.
It's such an insane photo.

1715
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:06,310
He's other face.
He's over 300 stitches in his face.

1716
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,020
300.

1717
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,910
Wow.
Yeah.

1718
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:12,710
Well eddie.
Well the ears are still good.

1719
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:17,780
At least it doesn't have the color left.
one's been hit there as well from shots.

1720
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:19,680
Yeah.
Not really from grappling.

1721
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:21,990
He fought one mma fight,
but you know,

1722
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:23,790
he's just never really trained.
Grappling.

1723
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:25,460
IT's not really his thing.
You know,

1724
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:28,590
put fucking has moitai goes.
I trained with him.

1725
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:32,220
I got a chance to work out with him and
learn some techniques from everything he

1726
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,460
throws is with power.
The way he throws a leg,

1727
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,310
he pulls the right hand back as he
throws that jab,

1728
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,670
he doesn't just jab like a boxer would
throw,

1729
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,090
jab,
the way he jabs.

1730
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:45,080
He's like pulling back the right and
stepping for got

1731
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,200
everything he throws is designed to kill
you.

1732
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,820
That's been,
that's been my my thing also.

1733
01:13:51,821 --> 01:13:53,980
I like it like that.
Everything you throw make them.

1734
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,530
When you said in the beginning I kicked
somebody and you see their faces and I

1735
01:13:59,531 --> 01:14:02,620
don't care if they block it.
I jusT kick as hard as I can on the

1736
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:05,860
defense just to get inside their heads
that they know that you better blog this

1737
01:14:05,861 --> 01:14:08,350
kick because next time if you're not
blogging it,

1738
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:10,210
you're gonna have it's gonna be a
problem,

1739
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:12,070
you know,
and then start breaking your

1740
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,720
opponent down.
Mentally hit him,

1741
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,680
hold the hands up high.
Just hit as hard as you can under.

1742
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,620
Hence a lot of guys don't do that.
They truly believed that this is enough

1743
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:22,570
defense for like a,
a right hook.

1744
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,790
It's not.
It's like me putting on a helmet.

1745
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,200
I say this in seminars at seminars to,
okay,

1746
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:34,380
imagine I would tape a focus mit to my
face and you can give me a straight

1747
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:37,660
punch or a hook.
You think I go down and everybody goes,

1748
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,510
yeah,
of course you're going to go down.

1749
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,170
I said,
so why is everybody doing this?

1750
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,740
You make yourself one with your head.
I'm just going to hit your hands as hard

1751
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,450
as I can.
You will still go down,

1752
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:49,210
you know,
but what happens in the mind of a

1753
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:51,820
fighter,
as soon as I hit you and I see your hand

1754
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,910
going up,
automatically I let my power off because

1755
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:55,781
it's like,
oh,

1756
01:14:55,781 --> 01:14:57,280
it's it's defendant.

1757
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,770
What if you just don't care or closed
line?

1758
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:02,140
And like I said in the beginning,
it'll go straight through.

1759
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,710
Yeah,
well you started throwing kicks in the

1760
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,360
pancrase days.
I remember,

1761
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,930
you know,
because I came from a kicking

1762
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:10,480
background,
there was not that many good kickers in

1763
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:15,180
mma before maury smith for conan.
We really didn't see that many head kick

1764
01:15:15,181 --> 01:15:19,960
kaos in mma and especially against a
black belt when maurice fought conan

1765
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:22,450
soviet era.
I mean there's a first time that was in

1766
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:24,070
um,
public.

1767
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,180
No,
no,

1768
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,970
it was in that other one.
It wasn't that john pretty organization,

1769
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:31,390
wasn't it like
extreme fighting?

1770
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:32,280
Yeah.
Extreme files.

1771
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,120
Yeah.
And that was the first time I was like,

1772
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:34,811
oh,
okay,

1773
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:37,330
now we're finally seeing a guy who could
throw some kicks in mma,

1774
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:40,580
but with the first time really was you
in pancreas because you,

1775
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:43,440
they make,
you wear those crazy boots you had like

1776
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:47,270
wrestling shoes on with a big boot shin,
shin thing.

1777
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,960
Yeah.
But you still at slam that kick into

1778
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:54,100
their arms and just see like nobody
wants to hold pads for a guy like that.

1779
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,170
no,
forget about like getting it on your raw

1780
01:15:56,171 --> 01:15:57,790
arm,
but you know,

1781
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,210
it's,
it's a great way to go in,

1782
01:15:59,211 --> 01:16:00,940
into a fight because you know,
you can,

1783
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,250
you're capable of doIng that.
Yeah.

1784
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:04,330
So you only have to connect,
you know,

1785
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:05,890
and if you know that joanie,
you have to connect,

1786
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:07,990
just wait and connect.
And I also,

1787
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:10,270
I'm not that guy who likes to get hit,
you know,

1788
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:11,310
I don't mind,
but I'm,

1789
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:14,620
I wrote a nut so I just use movement,
you know,

1790
01:16:14,621 --> 01:16:17,110
and then uh,
and then just explode at moments that

1791
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:20,230
you need to explode.
How many finders you training right now?

1792
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:22,400
Do you train any active guys?
No,

1793
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:22,860
you,
I,

1794
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,740
I train a few guys at my gym,
but I've been traveling a lot now so,

1795
01:16:26,741 --> 01:16:28,390
uh,
the coaches that I have at my gym or

1796
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:30,430
training them,
but we got a one,

1797
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:34,150
three,
three pros and then a bunch of amateur

1798
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:34,650
guys.

1799
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:39,650
So you're stIll doing inside mma with
ken kenny and um,

1800
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,510
you do world series of fighting still
wheelchairs a fight.

1801
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:48,130
Actually this weekend coming up on a
saturday this saturday on nbc isn't

1802
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,950
really nice.
More osis funding again.

1803
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,490
He's very talented.
His footwork to.

1804
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:55,300
That's the guy that people sleep on.
Yup.

1805
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,070
Yeah.
They don't really realize how talented

1806
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,960
that guy's in.
It's unfortunate that world series of

1807
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:02,170
fighting is not getting as much
attention as it deserves.

1808
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:03,461
Yeah.
Well,

1809
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:08,170
there's a lot of mma.
I know it's very hard to pull eyeballs

1810
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:08,610
to it.
It's a,

1811
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:11,180
but it's the with gloria.
Gloria doesn't have the eyeballs,

1812
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:14,330
which blows me away because if there's
something exciting,

1813
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:15,980
you know,
gore,

1814
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:18,770
it's a gloria event in that just
engaging kid to.

1815
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,760
Oh,
what an animal.

1816
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,670
A fucking sad.
She's a fun,

1817
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,380
fun,
fun to watch.

1818
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:25,214
I,
you know,

1819
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,050
he should tone a little down,
loa say,

1820
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,460
but,
you know,

1821
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,310
maybe it's just fight style and he just
wants to go because sometimes he gets

1822
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:35,050
hit hard and I think eventually we had,
there were clay guida or you know,

1823
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:35,660
like fighters.

1824
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,510
Eventually it's going to be who's going
to give.

1825
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:41,450
Yeah.
You can only get hit hard and just walk

1826
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:44,780
through things so much until eventually
your body doesn't cooperate anymore.

1827
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:47,240
And then most of the time,
once that happens,

1828
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,480
it's going to happen a lot.
So there's a lot of crazy shit going on

1829
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:52,520
right now in mma.
I'm the big one.

1830
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:54,770
To me,
the one that I'm most excited about is

1831
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,660
March 5th.
Conor mcgregor versus those.

1832
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:00,020
That is a fucking crazy fight.
First of all,

1833
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,540
who the hell has ever been like connor?
Yep,

1834
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,210
well I mean the best shit talker of all
time.

1835
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:07,100
Hilarious.
I,

1836
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,780
I'm,
I'm,

1837
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:09,020
I'm,
I'm in love with that guy.

1838
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,950
I love him.
I love everything about him.

1839
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:15,140
We had him on his show.
He's funny as you know,

1840
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:17,240
everything he does.
Every speech he does,

1841
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:19,730
it's different.
It's not like he's repeating everything

1842
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:22,010
I do,
like I do an interview before and it's

1843
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:23,210
about,
let's say your movie,

1844
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:23,780
you know,
you,

1845
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,400
you say the same thing over and over
again,

1846
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:26,870
but he doesn't know,
you know,

1847
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,270
and he doesn't really use profanity as
well,

1848
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:32,930
so it keeps it clean,
but very encouraging.

1849
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,360
Yeah,
you can use it on television was so

1850
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:36,270
great.
You know.

1851
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,750
And then how old chapo shirt.
Oh,

1852
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,780
how crazy is he who does that?
But to see,

1853
01:18:41,781 --> 01:18:43,880
but he's making gets in everybody's
head.

1854
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,300
That's why he beat the.
Although you could tell,

1855
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:49,160
you could simply tell.
Everybody can say,

1856
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:50,320
oh no,
I'm,

1857
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:52,830
I'm used to that.
I will put a street over or rafael dos

1858
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:53,780
anjos says that also.

1859
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,240
I said,
eventually it's gonna come through,

1860
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,790
you know,
you gotta start doing something back.

1861
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:02,930
He was a few fun things that you always
can do is not engaging him.

1862
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,530
I liked the way dos sandra says
handling.

1863
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,460
He's just letting him talk and he's
like,

1864
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:10,130
when we find this one I'm out,
or I know he's just like solid and

1865
01:19:10,131 --> 01:19:12,950
stoic.
I think he's also learning the lesson of

1866
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:16,340
how although sorta got rattled and he's
not going to get route.

1867
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:18,560
I think told sandra is a different guy
is a.

1868
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:24,150
He's even doing the chapel posed,
shaking hands and sean penn and that

1869
01:19:25,131 --> 01:19:27,410
fixture,
so fucking crazy.

1870
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:29,210
I love him.
God,

1871
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:33,280
that guy's fucking awesome.
It's hilarious and he can flock in fire

1872
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,281
fights.
Get great.

1873
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:37,010
Reflects this.
I mean it's timing is really good.

1874
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:39,680
He's using his reach really well and the
way for us to,

1875
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,290
as a hobby.

1876
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,170
He described his lefthand for us to
hobby,

1877
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:44,030
by the way,
did an amazing breakdown.

1878
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:47,330
If you're listening to this,
go to youtube for rasa hobby,

1879
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:50,970
who I in my mind is one of the true
great masters of video.

1880
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,990
He does an amazing breakdown of this
fight,

1881
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:56,270
but the way he describes ca connor,
he's like,

1882
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:59,210
he's got the touch of death that left
hand and it's true.

1883
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,290
He just lights guys up at that left
hand.

1884
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:02,990
Plus it's a laser guided,
you know,

1885
01:20:02,991 --> 01:20:04,280
it's,
it's on target.

1886
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:06,300
It's not just.
He just doesn't hit the head.

1887
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,590
Hit your jaw.
Yeah.

1888
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,250
He's so

1889
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,860
great timing,
so accurate and so and so beautiful with

1890
01:20:11,861 --> 01:20:14,400
his footwork.
The way slid out of the way of all those

1891
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:16,320
advanced and just drop that left hand
in.

1892
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,593
Just,
you know,

1893
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,640
rda is this guy,
you know,

1894
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:23,100
in the beginning I go always under the
radar.

1895
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:24,300
Right.
And some of these,

1896
01:20:24,301 --> 01:20:26,190
boom,
he's there and he's just beating

1897
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:27,024
everybody.
I mean,

1898
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,090
I had ever expected that it was a
monster.

1899
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,500
He really is.
Well,

1900
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:34,920
a lot of what's going on to his.
His conditioning is off the charts.

1901
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:39,870
Was working with nick curse on who's one
of the disciples of marinovich and

1902
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:43,950
they've got him doing these crazy
explosive plyometric drills and all

1903
01:20:43,951 --> 01:20:47,130
these footwork drills and have you ever
seen his training routine?

1904
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:51,330
You're realIzing they got a fucking
oxygen mask on him and he's throwing

1905
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,240
body shots on the bag.
It's all this incredible,

1906
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,250
brutal breakdown for for strength and
conditioning so that he could really go

1907
01:20:59,251 --> 01:21:00,450
five rounds like that.

1908
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,640
There's no such thing as having enough
seminar.

1909
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:05,340
That's what I always tell everybody.
No such thing.

1910
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:06,930
Yeah.
You got to go all the way.

1911
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:09,570
That's why I trained so hard because I
don't want to have that.

1912
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,600
I had to experience in thai boxing one
time when I run out of gas.

1913
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,390
It's not fun and especially in you no
longer around and with an opponent

1914
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,120
seeing you know,
is he getting tired now?

1915
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:22,170
They get wings,
you know,

1916
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:24,750
they turn it on and you're in a bad spot
there.

1917
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,840
Yeah.
It's the worst thing in the worlD to see

1918
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,780
an opponent notice that you're tired and
he's not.

1919
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,690
He's coming after you and he starts
dropping low kicks on you and punching

1920
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:35,520
you in the face and you can't do
anything.

1921
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:40,050
Your Body's not cooperating and they get
worse because then your breathing starts

1922
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:42,560
going wrong.
The breathing patterns not too relaxed

1923
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:42,930
anymore.

1924
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:46,110
You have to stop flexing because the
punches are coming.

1925
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,200
I'll take your stamina even more away.
Everything goes down.

1926
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:50,640
Open.
Stamina is a weapon.

1927
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:51,631
It really is.
I mean,

1928
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:56,250
look at nick diaz who was a guy who
fought so many guys and outwork them.

1929
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,310
I mean the frank shamrock five's a
perfect example that fight.

1930
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:02,010
He,
he just kept popping them with punches

1931
01:22:02,011 --> 01:22:04,590
like 50 percent punches,
but he's hitting him and he can't

1932
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:07,200
breathe because when,
when I punched persons punching you,

1933
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:09,120
even if they're punching you and it's
not full blast,

1934
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:11,700
you're still tightening up so you don't
get a chance to breathe.

1935
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,880
And nick diaz doesn't get tired.
Does ultra marathons?

1936
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:17,250
The fucking guy swam from alcatraz
twice.

1937
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:21,540
He's in incredible shape.
He's done triathlons.

1938
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:22,620
I don't know if he's done ultra
marathons,

1939
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,860
probably take that back,
but swimming from alcatraz is a fucking

1940
01:22:25,861 --> 01:22:26,820
crazy endeavor.

1941
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:30,060
Done it twice.
Well pedis for instance,

1942
01:22:30,061 --> 01:22:33,090
I thought he was never going to lose and
the only time she was losing what's

1943
01:22:33,091 --> 01:22:34,860
against guys with great stamina,
you know,

1944
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:38,520
clay guida and an rda who just keep
pushing the fight,

1945
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:40,890
you know,
and in the grappling grappling.

1946
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:44,610
Yeah,
I think physically pedis is not strong

1947
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:48,000
enough for those guys.
Guys like dos anjos that just put it to

1948
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:49,710
them or eddie alvarez just put it to
them.

1949
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:52,080
The physical,
like they turned it into one of those

1950
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:55,280
grueling wrestling match.
I mean I think his take down defense is

1951
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:57,240
pretty good and I think his grappling is
not bad.

1952
01:22:57,390 --> 01:23:01,590
I mean he won the title with an arm bar,
but I just think physically when it

1953
01:23:01,591 --> 01:23:04,710
comes to these grueling exchanges,
I just don't know if he's physically

1954
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:08,150
strong to fight that fight with lego
dosantos yup.

1955
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,760
Or even eddie alvarez and in that.

1956
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,600
In that fight.
Yeah.

1957
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,000
Well footwork.
Again,

1958
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:14,460
they're gonna he needs,
he's going to need a lot of forward

1959
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:16,400
laker mariah's.
He stopped staying down by.

1960
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:19,710
Well he didn't even stop and just moves
out the way he moves out of the way the

1961
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,470
lights guys up to and in his power to.
That's a big thing in pettis has a lot

1962
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:26,140
of power to me.
I'm not counting pedis pedis could

1963
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:28,960
easily come back and win the title again
and he's a monster,

1964
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,600
but I,
I never expected him to lose.

1965
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,670
I thought because she has this complete
package,

1966
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,280
it was she a great striker,
the great submissions,

1967
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:37,780
takedown defense.
I go,

1968
01:23:37,781 --> 01:23:38,680
okay,
this is the guy,

1969
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:42,550
put them on a weedy bucks.
You put away ceremony even better and

1970
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:44,050
more impressive than dos anjos.
Yeah.

1971
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:47,650
That was the craziest dos anjos.
He hurts her one and battered him up

1972
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:50,380
against the cage,
but I thought that the stoppage was so

1973
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:53,530
weird because like looked at the referee
and he's telling the referee stopped the

1974
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:57,550
fight and dosantos has serone sororities
turtled up and he's still covering up.

1975
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:01,300
I don't know when a fight should be
stopped in that situation.

1976
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,450
When a guy's guy gets hurt to the body
was obviously hurt,

1977
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:08,020
but dos anjos is hitting them and
cowboys covering up.

1978
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,740
Like when do you stop a fight?
Like if a guy's covering up and you're

1979
01:24:11,741 --> 01:24:14,260
hitting his arms and he's talking like
he's trying to get back up to his feet,

1980
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:16,630
like when does a fight get stopped?
When is it okay?

1981
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,730
Because some referees wouldn't have
stopped the fight.

1982
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:19,541
Yep.
No,

1983
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:20,980
you're right.
Here's a perfect example,

1984
01:24:20,981 --> 01:24:23,170
right?
Chris weidman versus luke rockhold.

1985
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:26,560
When luke rockhold got on top of chrIs
weidman at the end of the round was

1986
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,050
beating the fuck out of him.
I was saying they should stop that.

1987
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:34,270
Like he's not defending him,
but like that's not the same as like the

1988
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:36,580
cowboy cerrone dos anjos fight.
I'm like,

1989
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:38,410
man,
that was a little bit of a more

1990
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:40,840
controversial stuff because you're still
is a defense.

1991
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,190
No,
they shouldn't.

1992
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:44,860
They shouldn't stop the only one wIthout
coming in and do.

1993
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:46,690
If he doesn't,
doesn't cover up.

1994
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:49,480
he's going to get hit with a punch.
So he's got to cover up and when you're

1995
01:24:49,481 --> 01:24:50,860
covering up and the guys boom,
boom,

1996
01:24:50,861 --> 01:24:51,370
boom,
boom,

1997
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:52,840
boom.
There's not a lot You can do.

1998
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,610
Yeah.
If you got to put your hand down to get

1999
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:56,230
up and if you put your hand down and get
up,

2000
01:24:56,231 --> 01:24:57,210
you're going to get tagged.
Yep.

2001
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,140
So it's kind of,
it's,

2002
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:03,730
it's almost like a guy can have a fight
stopped without you being in real

2003
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,410
trouble.
Although cowboy was certainly in

2004
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:06,070
trouble.
Yup.

2005
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:07,960
But it's,
it's a weird little kind of a.

2006
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,030
It's up.
It's so subjective.

2007
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,390
It's up to the referee to decide the
decision.

2008
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:16,660
That's why I don't want to be a referee.
It's a very hard decision today.

2009
01:25:16,661 --> 01:25:18,040
It really is just never good.

2010
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:18,761
Yeah.
Great.

2011
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:20,140
But you did for the safety of the
photos.

2012
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,380
If they don't,
you know,

2013
01:25:21,381 --> 01:25:22,840
drawn to go out and they don't defend
them.

2014
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:24,460
I should've stopped right away if they
really,

2015
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,140
because they don't.
That's why they're doing it.

2016
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:26,621
Right.
I mean,

2017
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:27,710
you,
you know how uh,

2018
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:30,850
like a big jaw and he tells me that I,
I've seen him doing it against the

2019
01:25:30,851 --> 01:25:32,020
fighters,
into the dressing room.

2020
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:36,070
He'll tell them,
do not come to me after the fight that

2021
01:25:36,071 --> 01:25:38,480
if you lay on the ground to the guy who
hit you and you're just bugging up,

2022
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,890
I will stop the fight and he says it two
or three times.

2023
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:45,970
Do not come to me after the fight and
complain about it because you know right

2024
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:49,240
now improve your position and sometimes
you,

2025
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:51,940
you don't see that.
I'm also,

2026
01:25:51,941 --> 01:25:53,910
it's for instance,
a guillotine attempt.

2027
01:25:53,911 --> 01:25:56,680
So or,
or you see guys who defend the

2028
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:58,810
guillotine like you're standing still
and I go,

2029
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:00,180
don't defend the galaxy.
And you know,

2030
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,920
go for position,
make sure that you get close,

2031
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,100
you hold a heads to make sure

2032
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,490
he doesn't jump guard because if you
defend well,

2033
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,250
look at that militate against henzel.
Gracie in the ifl use definitive did

2034
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,040
yoga.
He jumped garth.

2035
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:16,250
Now he's got them now.
Rhonda rousey against carmouche.

2036
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:21,080
You know she's got a crazy crank on the,
on their head and instead of defending

2037
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:21,651
what people say,
oh,

2038
01:26:21,651 --> 01:26:22,890
differently the defendant.
No,

2039
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:23,420
no,
she didn't.

2040
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,250
She's had to position.
She grabbed the foot,

2041
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:29,060
feet unlocked to fit and she got out.
She took a chance that she took a chest

2042
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:30,920
and that's what people should do on the
ground also.

2043
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:31,940
They said to me,
yeah,

2044
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:33,530
but if they hit you,
I said,

2045
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,820
escape,
buck up,

2046
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:35,990
move to this.
If you bulk up,

2047
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:37,130
they're going to have to look for
balance.

2048
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:40,640
Make sure they never sit on your chest,
push them always to your belly.

2049
01:26:40,641 --> 01:26:43,760
If you can push into your belly,
you hold a nice and you push yourself up

2050
01:26:43,761 --> 01:26:45,920
or it's same result is sitting on your
belly.

2051
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,770
But you gotta go.
You gotta move how easy it is.

2052
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:52,280
Is it for you if,
if somebody mounts you to go to put them

2053
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:53,240
in,
at least to have god?

2054
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,493
Well,
you got to.

2055
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,610
It's real easy,
right?

2056
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,830
I think a lot of guys don't train off
their back then.

2057
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,870
It's the craziest thing.
It drives me nuts.

2058
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:03,830
Get them into gartman y amount position.
It shouldn't even be happening.

2059
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,590
Go to the side mount position when they
could stop you.

2060
01:27:06,591 --> 01:27:08,960
It's only when they put the stretch,
you out a hook,

2061
01:27:08,961 --> 01:27:10,000
their feet,
you know,

2062
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,650
but then there's not a lot they can do
because she just stopped their arms.

2063
01:27:13,651 --> 01:27:16,070
So it's interesting when you see the
different levels of,

2064
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,190
of their game off their back.
Like Brian Ortega,

2065
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:22,580
have you been watching that guy?
Jesus fucking christ.

2066
01:27:22,581 --> 01:27:27,050
His triangles are good.
His guard game is so good and he's one

2067
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:27,620
of those guys.

2068
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:30,230
He's like a gold standard for how to
fight off your back.

2069
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:31,820
Yeah.
When they get him on his back,

2070
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:36,290
he is just that packing attacking you.
You're not going to get him stagnant

2071
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:39,260
where he's just lying there waiting for
the referee to stand them back up.

2072
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:42,560
That's when you've got that kind of a
ground game off your back.

2073
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:44,660
It's A totally new dimension for your
opponents.

2074
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:48,380
They're used to taking a guy down and
maybe throw in some body punches with

2075
01:27:48,381 --> 01:27:50,090
him.
You're fucking defense defending the

2076
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:54,340
whole tags are up on your neck and you
got to try to pass her up and get outta

2077
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:56,210
there.
That's the gold standard and that's what

2078
01:27:56,211 --> 01:27:59,570
everybody should aspire to,
to have that kind of a dangerous ground

2079
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:00,540
game.
Yup.

2080
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,160
That's why I thought,
um,

2081
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:03,880
for instance,
uh,

2082
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,840
Johnny Hendricks is a wonderful thing.
No,

2083
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,130
no,
no,

2084
01:28:08,130 --> 01:28:10,430
no.
Oh my god.

2085
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:13,190
How could I forget him?
He was carlos condit,

2086
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:14,690
the international bulk carrier.
I was gonna say.

2087
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:17,900
Yeah.
I mean I thought a conduit honda because

2088
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:20,280
he's constantly attacking underground,
you know?

2089
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,150
And if somebody is on top of you and he
hit you once every what time?

2090
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,840
That shouldn't count.
If destroy undefeated,

2091
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,970
if it,
if it goes through a decision and nobody

2092
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,790
get really hurt,
but the guy who's constantly attacking

2093
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,080
is going to win the fight.
Right?

2094
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:35,060
Okay.
Why so why doesn't that count on the

2095
01:28:35,061 --> 01:28:37,850
ground?
Just because it goes on top doesn't mean

2096
01:28:37,851 --> 01:28:38,750
he's winning.
No.

2097
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:42,150
How about the fact that that's how you
want the title versus kevin rowlanD down

2098
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,020
random?
Not even with submission,

2099
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:46,220
that example,
but like,

2100
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,740
man,
that was shook you down and you just

2101
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,710
kept attacking from your back.
Yeah.

2102
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:53,840
Mccarthy said later,
I didn't put them back on a fit because

2103
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:56,750
boss was working from his bag.
That was the reason they didn't put us

2104
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:58,430
back on the feet.
But you know,

2105
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:00,410
if you have a gay guy,
psychologists content or what,

2106
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:02,160
you saw a lot of pride,
also great

2107
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,400
groundwork and a constantly attacking
and then they get rewarded for that

2108
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:07,680
after the fight.
They actually win the fight and it

2109
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:09,090
should be because people go,
yeah,

2110
01:29:09,091 --> 01:29:11,100
but the defense is no,
no.

2111
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:13,080
It's not about the defense.
Same as the strike.

2112
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:16,080
It's not about that.
It's about a guy who takes the chances

2113
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:17,940
because we all know if you have somebody
in the guard,

2114
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:20,960
you go for an arm bar as I possibility
there's going to be an assignment.

2115
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,650
No,
that's a worse posItion for you.

2116
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,710
So you're taking risks and if you're
willing to take those chris,

2117
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:27,810
they should be rewarded.
Well,

2118
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:30,660
how also like pride.
I like that 10 minute first round.

2119
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,860
That was good.
It makes it,

2120
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:33,750
makes it more strategical.
Yeah.

2121
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,270
He really can't burn out in the
beginning.

2122
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,750
That was the thing with bankers in the
beginning,

2123
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:39,570
but 30 minute fights.
That's why the arts came on my hands

2124
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:43,740
because that means holistic,
which is relaxed because I was such a

2125
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:46,350
hothead in thai boxing like somebody
hits me,

2126
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,530
god there might just knock them out,
you know,

2127
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,460
and I go,
man,

2128
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,800
these japanese guys are known for being
tough.

2129
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:55,620
If this happens,
the first three minutes I get 27 more

2130
01:29:55,621 --> 01:29:57,870
minutes ago.
If I'm empty,

2131
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,390
that's not a good thing.
So stay calm,

2132
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:02,460
stay calm,
and you start to be more strategical.

2133
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:05,270
So pancreas,
was there any rounds or was it just know

2134
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:09,990
30 minutes at the end.
In the end there were a few under,

2135
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,790
unlike the undercard for 10 minutes
fights,

2136
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:15,180
but most of the time was,
everything was 15 minutes and the title

2137
01:30:15,181 --> 01:30:17,880
fights and the end was 30 in the
beginning the first year.

2138
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:19,530
And a half minutes.
Three minutes.

2139
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:20,730
Yeah.
Wow.

2140
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:21,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

2141
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:23,550
That's,
that's a real strategic fight.

2142
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,590
I'm a fan of that though.
I liked that.

2143
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:26,790
I liked that too.
But,

2144
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:28,500
but you know,
and again,

2145
01:30:28,501 --> 01:30:31,540
if you look at some ufc fights where
they just lay la la,

2146
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,240
then you know,
in the old days,

2147
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,900
whoever without a standup and then it
becomes kind of boring.

2148
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:41,310
But that was one of the things when I
moved to pancras always tell this story,

2149
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:44,930
but when I saw my opponent,
he was 45 pounds heavier and I asked

2150
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:45,950
when,
the way in was,

2151
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,420
he says,
there's no way in we everybody fights,

2152
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:49,740
everybody go out.
it's great.

2153
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:50,650
Nice.
Well,

2154
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:52,800
I was just bluffing of course.
And I go,

2155
01:30:52,801 --> 01:30:53,631
okay,
so how many months?

2156
01:30:53,631 --> 01:30:54,780
We got one round,
one round.

2157
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:55,650
Awesome.
How many minutes?

2158
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:56,091
Thirty.
You'd go.

2159
01:30:56,091 --> 01:30:56,970
Oh,
awesome.

2160
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:58,950
awesome.
When I look at my manager,

2161
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:04,250
I could lose 30 minutes,
45 more pounds on me as opposed to a

2162
01:31:04,951 --> 01:31:07,770
three minute kickboxing for.
That's what I was thinking around,

2163
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:08,604
you know,
boxing,

2164
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:09,650
kickboxing.
Yep.

2165
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:10,860
Yeah.
So yeah,

2166
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:14,490
that opened my eyes a little bit there.
and you become more strategical.

2167
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,420
That's a good thing.
Well,

2168
01:31:15,421 --> 01:31:17,520
it's also good for grapplers when they
work,

2169
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:20,790
like say if you have a five minute fight
or a five minute round and you work for

2170
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,890
four minutes and 30 seconds and get the
fight to the ground,

2171
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:24,870
you only have 30 seconds to try to
secure a submission.

2172
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:28,770
Whereas if you take god to ground a 10
minute fight in your format in 30

2173
01:31:28,771 --> 01:31:31,410
seconds,
now you have five minutes and 30 seconds

2174
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:33,540
to try to finish him.
Which is a lot of time.

2175
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,910
Yeah.
But you know this,

2176
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:36,660
there's always the other side of the
middle of you know,

2177
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:37,560
you,
you can say,

2178
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:41,250
well they should have taken them down
sooner or are these guys and say,

2179
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:43,230
yeah,
but I just need more work on the ground.

2180
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,820
Well,
just go faster.

2181
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,720
This is the game you after that they not
the other way around.

2182
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,670
Yeah.
Well you could definitely look at it

2183
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:52,950
that way.
What do you think about fabrice

2184
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,630
overdoing,
returning against king?

2185
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,840
I think it's a.
It's Going to be a great fight.

2186
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,800
I think again for the.
Okay.

2187
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:00,190
We know

2188
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,590
that the Seminar Played a big factor is
huge,

2189
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,270
but um,
for,

2190
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:06,470
do man,
he's only been on an,

2191
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,650
on an arrowed as going straight up
since.

2192
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,380
Since pride.
Yeah.

2193
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:13,090
I mean always that fight that he lost
against the allister,

2194
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,680
eh,
really loose.

2195
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:17,050
I think if you would count the punches
and kicks that alice,

2196
01:32:17,051 --> 01:32:19,290
I get it because I was afraid at the
time because I was at.

2197
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,760
Ellis does a,
it was a big friend of mine at the time

2198
01:32:21,761 --> 01:32:22,594
and I go,
oh,

2199
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:25,360
because for doom hidden more connected.
More on.

2200
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,440
He blew his knee out to in that fight.
Yeah.

2201
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:31,420
see,
so striking now with codero there,

2202
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,610
they're working really well to get a say
with rda and everybody there,

2203
01:32:35,611 --> 01:32:39,280
they're doing just a phenomenal job or
was just what a great striking coach.

2204
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:40,114
That guy.
Yeah.

2205
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:41,770
He's done an amazing job.
Yeah,

2206
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:42,710
because he's a,
he's an.

2207
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:45,260
You could talk to the guy.
They barbecue together today.

2208
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,890
You know,
he's there in your best interest.

2209
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:52,240
That's duane ludwig.
Same guy tompkins.

2210
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,100
All these guys.
There are all.

2211
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:56,050
The way to.
I remember stories was sean,

2212
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,290
we will come home partying five,
six in the morning.

2213
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:03,940
He would go straight to as if it was the
day of the way in straight to the soul.

2214
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:06,880
now with the guys putting them,
helping them focus mitts,

2215
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,410
if they wanted to lose weight,
he never ever missed a beat,

2216
01:33:09,411 --> 01:33:10,930
you know,
and then like a dwayne has adults,

2217
01:33:10,931 --> 01:33:13,290
a lot of trainers out there,
but there's a whole bunch of trends,

2218
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:15,160
you know,
as well as I do who don't have that.

2219
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:18,220
Yeah.
Well you got to be completely obsessed

2220
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:20,530
to be a great treat me.
That's what makes ludwig so good.

2221
01:33:20,531 --> 01:33:22,520
He's completely obsessed.
He is.

2222
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:23,500
And that,
those.

2223
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:25,000
I mean,
it's the same with a fighter.

2224
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,190
It's the same with anything.
If you're not completely obsessed,

2225
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:28,720
you're just not going to reach your
potential.

2226
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:30,670
That's it.
You need to like it.

2227
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:32,860
Also,
I was talking about that yesterday.

2228
01:33:32,861 --> 01:33:35,140
It's um,
you can have all the talent if you don't

2229
01:33:35,141 --> 01:33:36,850
like it,
if he hear fighters,

2230
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:39,740
which blows my mind always when I hear
quintin french,

2231
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:41,110
he says,
I hate training.

2232
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:42,550
And I go,
wow,

2233
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:45,970
I love training.
I want to get tired,

2234
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:49,540
I want to try new stuff.
I always loved it till the end when I

2235
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,670
got my tendonitis and everything started
hurting really,

2236
01:33:51,671 --> 01:33:52,960
really bad,
you know?

2237
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,850
Then you can't even think straight
anymore.

2238
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:57,280
That's when I stopped.
But before that,

2239
01:33:57,281 --> 01:33:59,530
I always loved it.
And if you love something,

2240
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,640
you know,
same in school.

2241
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:02,100
When you work at,
you know,

2242
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:03,700
math lab,
I don't even math,

2243
01:34:03,701 --> 01:34:05,590
but you were good at the things that you
liked.

2244
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:07,480
Biology.
I love biology.

2245
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:08,314
Boom.
Ace,

2246
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:08,970
you know,
it's,

2247
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:11,470
it's all the things that you like.
You automatically do your best.

2248
01:34:11,471 --> 01:34:12,820
For example.
Yeah.

2249
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:15,910
If you're a passionate person,
if you're passionate about what you're

2250
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:17,740
pursuing,
you're going to do better than a person

2251
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:22,360
who's just doing it as a job and clinton
has so much talent and unbelievable

2252
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,400
power.
He's got a fantastic chin.

2253
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:25,131
Yeah,
right.

2254
01:34:25,131 --> 01:34:26,110
Writer wrote up,
pops up,

2255
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:26,944
right?
always.

2256
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,350
Always.
When you talk about quinn is the first

2257
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,640
and the arched even backwards.
Yeah.

2258
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:35,050
He didn't go straight up.
He actually went a lIttle further and

2259
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:40,051
then that was the most spectacular slam
kayo and the history of mma.

2260
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:45,070
Ricardo arona had them locked up in a
triangle and quintin slammed him into

2261
01:34:45,071 --> 01:34:47,070
oblivion and headbutted him too,
on the way down.

2262
01:34:47,071 --> 01:34:51,380
I mean inadvertent headbutt,
but slammed them and then bought by then

2263
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:53,770
his head slammed into him too.
Oh my god.

2264
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,010
That was a horrific fight.
Ricardo ricardo never,

2265
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,010
never recovered from that.

2266
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,780
Well,
ricardo,

2267
01:34:59,781 --> 01:35:02,860
I read the cool story about kevin random
and he was talking a read on.

2268
01:35:02,861 --> 01:35:03,381
Sure,
doug,

2269
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:06,170
that he said he just fought kevin and he
won.

2270
01:35:06,171 --> 01:35:10,580
He says for I wasn't addressing wound by
myself and in Japan was nobody there and

2271
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:12,420
you know,
I was just aching and he said,

2272
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:14,930
because I would just want to the most
important fight of my career.

2273
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,740
And he said suddenly he sees his shadow
and he thinks it was gentleman.

2274
01:35:18,741 --> 01:35:21,530
So he automaticallY said at that time
everybody was fighting.

2275
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,490
It was before or after.
It didn't really matter.

2276
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:26,810
It was this fighting thing.
And randleman came in and he thought

2277
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:29,450
there was going to be a fighter reynold
liftgate walked up to him and said,

2278
01:35:29,451 --> 01:35:30,530
dude,
great job.

2279
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:32,350
Congratulations.
You know,

2280
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,580
you're awesome.
And he blew me away.

2281
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:39,581
He said it rIght away.
I saw the monster as a different person.

2282
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:42,380
That's so hard now.
Also with random and uh,

2283
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:43,071
you,
you know him.

2284
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,740
Everybody who knows him is such a good
guy.

2285
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:47,020
Yeah.
He was a great guy.

2286
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:49,960
He was a really friendly,
happy go lucky guy.

2287
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,140
It's so unfortunate,
you know,

2288
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,860
I don't,
I don't know what happened with him.

2289
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:56,840
And what happened with sean tompkins.
How did sean,

2290
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,510
you know,
this was the saddest thing ever because

2291
01:35:59,511 --> 01:36:01,850
when I went to the funeral,
his,

2292
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:03,180
um,
his,

2293
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:06,050
uh,
he was in a coffin and I didn't want to

2294
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:07,940
see that.
I did that one time with a friend of

2295
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:09,690
mine and I didn't like that.
So I said,

2296
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:12,260
don't want to do it in his mother.
It was so sad,

2297
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:12,990
man.
It's uh,

2298
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:15,890
she came to me crying and she said,
oh,

2299
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:20,240
he was in,
he was home and that weekend she was

2300
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:23,580
going to tell him that he had to go to
the doctor because in the family that

2301
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:25,910
runs in the family,
that they have enlarged hearts and he

2302
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:29,690
needs to check that out.
And that was what was going down there.

2303
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:31,040
He was no drugs,
no,

2304
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:32,330
not because people start,
of course,

2305
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:34,750
the conspiracy theories,
they didn't find anything,

2306
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,640
find anything.
And the crazy thing was I talked the day

2307
01:36:37,641 --> 01:36:39,320
before we,
sean,

2308
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:42,860
it was so weird because then you guys
announced it on uc.

2309
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:44,480
It was.
I go,

2310
01:36:44,481 --> 01:36:45,030
whoa,
sean.

2311
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:46,430
So I started.
I started googling,

2312
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:48,260
but he,
it was so weird.

2313
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:52,100
He texted me something and I thought for
some reason I thought,

2314
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:53,930
oh,
he wants to talk to me because normally

2315
01:36:53,931 --> 01:36:56,180
we would text.
So I picked up the phone and I called

2316
01:36:56,181 --> 01:36:58,640
him and he was going out with a muscle
beach,

2317
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:02,630
one of our friends that we'd call the
muscle beach and he was um,

2318
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,910
he,
he muscle beach was drunk and he says,

2319
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:07,520
by can't leave a man behind.
I'm going to stay with him,

2320
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:08,810
you know,
I'm going to make sure he's going to be

2321
01:37:08,811 --> 01:37:09,720
okay.
Boom.

2322
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:13,970
And he kept going and the problem that I
was reading about didn't even come up.

2323
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:16,070
We start talking about everything.
It was great,

2324
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,190
great diaries as part I love you,
you know that I really love you.

2325
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:21,830
And then finally when we hang up,
he started texting,

2326
01:37:21,831 --> 01:37:24,650
you know that I love you,
tom.

2327
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,140
The whole team tompkins loves you.
It was really weird.

2328
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:29,600
He never did that.
And the next day he passed away.

2329
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,290
So it was almost like he felt that it
was going to happen.

2330
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:34,363
Wow.
Yeah.

2331
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:36,470
Crazy.
That's crazy.

2332
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:39,020
Yeah.
He was another guy that was really loved

2333
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:44,000
by the guys that he trained those
relationships between trainers and

2334
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:45,620
students,
trainers and fighters.

2335
01:37:45,621 --> 01:37:47,270
They're so important,
you know,

2336
01:37:47,271 --> 01:37:49,640
and it's so hard for a fighter to find
the right trainer,

2337
01:37:49,641 --> 01:37:51,440
the right train of the fits,
their personality.

2338
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:52,910
Someone who's technical,
you know,

2339
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:55,920
someone who has also that emotional
bond.

2340
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,040
That's the thing,
does 100 percent commitment.

2341
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:02,130
That's the thing.
And it was being a fighter.

2342
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:05,340
It's soul sound cool.
And that's why a lot of guys don't make

2343
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:08,550
it because they only want to look cool.
You know,

2344
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:11,790
you don't really fight foot to fight.
Like once they fight a start fighting

2345
01:38:11,791 --> 01:38:13,350
for money,
you know,

2346
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:17,070
don't do that.
Then it's going downhill.

2347
01:38:17,071 --> 01:38:18,480
Yeah.
But I needed a paycheck then don't

2348
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:19,020
fight.
Find it,

2349
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,330
find another job.
You need that commitment.

2350
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:23,310
You need to be 100 percent emphasis.
Same with the trainers.

2351
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:27,180
You know you can be off for a little bit
because this guy is going to go in the

2352
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:30,660
ring or in a cage and you have to make
sure that he's going to stay safe.

2353
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,180
Yeah.
When you see a fighter that's only

2354
01:38:33,181 --> 01:38:36,280
fighting for the paycheck,
it's very rarely works out,

2355
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:37,530
which is very rarely.

2356
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:39,760
We're not at a championship level,
you know?

2357
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:43,140
I mean it miGht,
it might be okay at a journeyman level,

2358
01:38:43,141 --> 01:38:46,020
you might pull it off if you're tough
and you're Skilled,

2359
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,660
but to beat the best guys,
you have to be obsessed.

2360
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:50,700
Like the best guys are obsessed.
Yeah.

2361
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,190
You want to be the best.
It's not about Payday.

2362
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:54,120
I said,
I said,

2363
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:56,550
that will come if you are the best,
the bay,

2364
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:59,070
they will be better.
But focus on getting good at fighting

2365
01:38:59,071 --> 01:39:00,300
for yourself.
I always say,

2366
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:02,970
you know,
don't put your family number one spot.

2367
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:04,590
I understand you want to do that,
but you know,

2368
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:06,600
once you start,
that means that you care.

2369
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:08,370
Care care.
It's a very.

2370
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:12,120
How you say it,
it's a selfish.

2371
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:14,370
It should be selfish.
You should be.

2372
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:17,280
I fight for me,
I don't care.

2373
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,260
The way I explained it to my,
my,

2374
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:21,420
my students is when they,
for instance,

2375
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:22,560
they are nervous.

2376
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:23,700
I say,
okay,

2377
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,170
well let's,
let's take a step back.

2378
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,440
Imagine your opponent now and you will
go in a room.

2379
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:31,230
They loved the room and you guys going
to compete against each other.

2380
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:33,540
Whoever wins,
it doesn't matter who wins.

2381
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:36,300
When the door opens you,
both of you are not going to say who won

2382
01:39:36,301 --> 01:39:37,710
or lost.
Nobody's going to say,

2383
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:40,350
do you really care if you lose at that
moment?

2384
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,300
And he goes,
I know.

2385
01:39:42,301 --> 01:39:42,910
Yeah,
because.

2386
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:44,320
No,
because yeah,

2387
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:45,540
he's just a better fighter,
right?

2388
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,800
I said,
so why do you care?

2389
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,140
And then they start realizing,
ah,

2390
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:52,740
it's because the people more,
but he might think this and he might

2391
01:39:52,741 --> 01:39:56,160
think this and see.
And that's why I always say fight for

2392
01:39:56,161 --> 01:39:57,960
yourself.
If you lose,

2393
01:39:57,961 --> 01:40:00,900
you give a joel,
you are always a winner.

2394
01:40:00,901 --> 01:40:02,310
It doesn't matter.
You know what?

2395
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:06,360
Bad is not going all the way not using
all your potential and then lose.

2396
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,270
Because you didn't do that,
that's something that after a fight

2397
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:10,680
you're going to say,
oh man,

2398
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:12,320
I could have gotten harder,
so why didn't you?

2399
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:14,760
You know,
just leave it all out there and if you

2400
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:17,640
leave it all out there,
there's no excuses and every other

2401
01:40:17,641 --> 01:40:20,610
fighter will really enjoy you winning or
losing.

2402
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,200
How many fighters do you have?
Who,

2403
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,240
who never became a champion,
but out here,

2404
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:25,920
all the other fighters talking about
them,

2405
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:26,440
she,
oh,

2406
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,490
you fight him.
Oh dude,

2407
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,960
that guy's crazy.
Yeah,

2408
01:40:29,961 --> 01:40:33,570
you better prepare now because it's
going to be a nightmare to fight that

2409
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:34,530
guy.
You see?

2410
01:40:34,531 --> 01:40:36,690
That's what I think is the most
important.

2411
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:39,480
If your peers like it,
the way you fight,

2412
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:41,490
you're good.
You can't really lose.

2413
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:44,660
Yeah.
worker guy like chocolate dell where he

2414
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:49,670
has that incredible fan base because he
always fought with everything he had and

2415
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:53,770
whether he lost by knockout or won
knockout,

2416
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:54,580
people still loved him.

2417
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,230
That's it.
Didn't lose a friend.

2418
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,200
I always use chuck as an example and
that's.

2419
01:40:59,201 --> 01:41:01,330
And that's what every filenet tell my
students,

2420
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:04,090
look at chocolate l,
I want you to be like that.

2421
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:05,800
Leave it out there,
you know,

2422
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:09,160
I just want you to listen to a little
bit more because if I would get in

2423
01:41:09,161 --> 01:41:12,430
chuck's head,
you know as soon as chuck hits somebody,

2424
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:17,260
that's the same with benji radic day,
have one vision and that's the knockout,

2425
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,800
and they forget about the rest defense
defense as say,

2426
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:22,630
as soon as you hit somebody,
step back,

2427
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:24,100
you're going to have some time.
Don't worry,

2428
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,750
but you just Hit the head,
okay,

2429
01:41:25,751 --> 01:41:26,890
what is she going to protect?
No,

2430
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:30,160
the head go for the body.
Do what crosses across to the body.

2431
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,380
Nobody does it,
but do it as hard as you can.

2432
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:34,750
Cross hook,
cross and a left hook to the head.

2433
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:35,900
Bob,
bob,

2434
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:37,420
boom.
Suddenly there's a lefty to that.

2435
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:39,550
If you do the crossword cross,
it's a heart issue.

2436
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:44,530
Can you will force them to block it,
which will open up for the left hook to

2437
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:47,170
the head.
Same as with the body body ahead too.

2438
01:41:47,210 --> 01:41:49,870
Bloody bloody hood that go papa,
boom,

2439
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:51,420
but the book I said,
yeah,

2440
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:54,220
won't work like that.
You see a ricoh over hoover who does his

2441
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:56,320
first mixed martial arts fight,
body,

2442
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,300
body,
boom,

2443
01:41:58,301 --> 01:42:01,030
and then the head.
Now bit the first two body shots.

2444
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:03,850
If this guy doesn't block him,
he's going to get knocked out to the

2445
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:05,830
body,
so now he respects your power.

2446
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:08,380
That's what Mike Tyson did.
Spleen might,

2447
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:10,810
upper gut.
He hits you so hard on the spleen that

2448
01:42:10,811 --> 01:42:14,170
the second time when he loads up or you,
he thinks he thinks it's going to be the

2449
01:42:14,171 --> 01:42:16,390
same punch,
but then he changed his angle to an

2450
01:42:16,391 --> 01:42:19,000
uppercut and his defenses here for the
screenshot.

2451
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:22,630
If you do it powerful and heart,
it will work,

2452
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,010
but if you do a buddy buddy hair bite
about it,

2453
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:27,730
you know it's not gonna work.
Make everything count.

2454
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:29,500
Yeah.
A lot of guys are trying to conserve

2455
01:42:29,501 --> 01:42:33,580
their energy.
You buy what I did after a workout,

2456
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:36,220
I will put it back on the ground and it
would 30 minutes,

2457
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:41,221
just go punching on a bag on the ground,
rolling into god giving you don't get

2458
01:42:41,651 --> 01:42:43,270
diane from there.
Come on guYs.

2459
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:45,190
You don't really get that as nothing
there.

2460
01:42:45,191 --> 01:42:47,470
You can just go.
What is she going to do?

2461
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,870
If he's on his back,
he's going to hit you back.

2462
01:42:49,871 --> 01:42:52,030
It's not going to hit you back.
You got to watch out for submissions,

2463
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:54,270
but that's not get get you in,
in,

2464
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:57,130
in trouble with your stamina.
Just go.

2465
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:00,010
Just go.
do you think now looking back when you

2466
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:01,840
have these tendinitis and all these
other issues,

2467
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:04,300
will you too tough for your body because
that what it is?

2468
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,030
No,
I,

2469
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:06,970
I.
What I think is that because I was so

2470
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:09,860
sick as a kid that they,
they overflow.

2471
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:12,880
We with cortisones.
I had so many cortisone,

2472
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:14,190
so where was I?
I was,

2473
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:17,130
I believe it was like 46 pills a day.
I took all.

2474
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,130
I had really bad skin disease.
Yes,

2475
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:24,220
I was.
So I had a lot of stuff that I took for

2476
01:43:24,221 --> 01:43:24,960
that and,
and the,

2477
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,020
the tests they did on me,
I mean every week I had to go get 20

2478
01:43:29,021 --> 01:43:31,480
shots,
10 shots in each arm of what they would

2479
01:43:31,481 --> 01:43:34,090
do.
They would inject a little tiny bit of

2480
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:37,960
where you are alert for and then to
hopefully it's like the flu vaccine.

2481
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:40,840
They hopefully the body finds a way to
counter attack that,

2482
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:45,640
but every time when to do that I'll be
sick and so I needed to recoup from that

2483
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:49,510
the whole time and I think eventually
the cortisones because they're really

2484
01:43:49,511 --> 01:43:51,040
bad for the bones and attendance.

2485
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:54,110
I think the court is really got my
tendinitis.

2486
01:43:54,111 --> 01:43:56,960
That's the reason.
That's interesting.

2487
01:43:56,961 --> 01:44:00,080
I never heard that before.
I've never heard of anybody having.

2488
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:01,370
Well,
I never heard of anybody having that

2489
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:04,220
many shots as a kid and then going on to
be a world championship fighter.

2490
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:10,310
And the craziest thing is that when I
was young I did track and field and I

2491
01:44:10,311 --> 01:44:14,480
did it a pretty high level already
because I wanted it to be the next bruce

2492
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:16,550
jenner at the time he was my hero.
You know wHat I mean?

2493
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:19,400
That's how old I was.
He was the guy,

2494
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:23,340
the decathlon guy.
That's what I wanted and I remember in

2495
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:27,890
the end every time with javelin I had,
I already had that tendonitis and I

2496
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:31,430
started recognizing that and I don't
know why it stayed away my entire career

2497
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:34,820
and came back only at the end.
It's got to be the gods wiLl of god

2498
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:35,361
telling me,
okay,

2499
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:37,640
it was good fighter,
you know,

2500
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,460
but um,
for some reason at the end it came back,

2501
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:44,630
but I remember the pain from when I was
14 years old.

2502
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,620
Do you have a desire to train like
championship level fighters because I

2503
01:44:48,621 --> 01:44:53,180
see you're talking about what guys don't
do correctly in which would like to see

2504
01:44:53,181 --> 01:44:53,931
them do,
like,

2505
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:58,370
do you have this desire to get involved
with someone who's like really trying to

2506
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,550
make a run at a title?
Oh,

2507
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,081
you know,
I,

2508
01:45:00,081 --> 01:45:04,130
I enJoy things like for instance,
a rico roofer came in last week.

2509
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:04,691
I love that.
Can,

2510
01:45:04,691 --> 01:45:05,270
you know?
Yeah,

2511
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:08,880
because she's an athlete,
not just champion ethic gLory,

2512
01:45:08,881 --> 01:45:10,730
heavyweight champion,
amazing kickbox.

2513
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:13,910
So when he said he was going to do mma,
I send them an email right away.

2514
01:45:13,911 --> 01:45:14,601
I said,
listen,

2515
01:45:14,601 --> 01:45:16,280
rico,
come to me.

2516
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:18,780
Give me two hours of my time.
I'll,

2517
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:20,990
I'll show you things.
They got to be very,

2518
01:45:20,991 --> 01:45:23,240
very helpful for you.
I'm not looking to be a coach because

2519
01:45:23,241 --> 01:45:25,010
they don't have the time for that.
I'm way too busy for that,

2520
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,690
but I can get you in two hours.

2521
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:29,270
I can get you a lot of inflammation.
Or like for instance,

2522
01:45:29,271 --> 01:45:32,060
John jones is a while back.
I was interviewing him and then he said

2523
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:36,140
right away I was in albuquerque.
What are you going to do after this?

2524
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:38,060
I said to my hotel is amanda,
you train me.

2525
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:40,580
You sEe those guys who really want to
learn and they want you to start

2526
01:45:40,581 --> 01:45:44,810
learning and these guys listen and then
suddenly they start being more explosive

2527
01:45:44,811 --> 01:45:46,890
with kicking air and they go like,
this is,

2528
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:48,110
this is crazy.
You know,

2529
01:45:48,111 --> 01:45:49,490
like sound effects.
I do a lot.

2530
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:53,210
It had high pitch sound effects.
If you see somebody,

2531
01:45:53,211 --> 01:45:55,580
for instance,
if you do the focus mitts or you hit a

2532
01:45:55,581 --> 01:45:56,420
back,
you go pump,

2533
01:45:56,421 --> 01:45:57,860
pump,
pump pump one,

2534
01:45:57,861 --> 01:45:58,281
two,
three,

2535
01:45:58,281 --> 01:46:01,670
four like that punch.
And so if you just stop or you go in

2536
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:04,220
your mind,
you go just do that.

2537
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:09,220
And then just by doing that your body
automatically will adapt and will get

2538
01:46:09,231 --> 01:46:11,630
more explosive.
And he realized that.

2539
01:46:11,631 --> 01:46:12,464
He goes,
well,

2540
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:16,760
and the next week or two weeks later,
we had greg jackson on the show and greg

2541
01:46:16,761 --> 01:46:18,080
tells me,
he says,

2542
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:18,914
man,
what,

2543
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:22,220
what,
what have you been teaching and what do

2544
01:46:22,221 --> 01:46:22,701
you mean?
He says,

2545
01:46:22,701 --> 01:46:25,670
everybody makes these crazy son.
I said,

2546
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:28,100
do they hit faster and harder?
And he goes,

2547
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,250
yeah,
so,

2548
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,870
you know,
so it really works to get in people's

2549
01:46:32,871 --> 01:46:33,860
heads.
Yeah.

2550
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:38,240
And then if you have an athlete,
like an athlete like jones who will

2551
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:39,980
listen to you.
Yeah,

2552
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:44,750
that's gold that came to you.
Have a guy like that came to you and

2553
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:45,471
said,
listen boss,

2554
01:46:45,471 --> 01:46:48,140
I want you to train me.
How is that something you would be

2555
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:51,290
interested in doing?
There's going to be harder.

2556
01:46:51,291 --> 01:46:55,520
It depends whether you know the tv show
now to new podcast that elder to jim and

2557
01:46:55,521 --> 01:46:55,890
I met,
uh,

2558
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:56,940
so much stuff.

2559
01:46:56,950 --> 01:47:00,510
The world shares of fighting that I
suddenly cannot do because then we got

2560
01:47:00,511 --> 01:47:02,900
to have 100 percent commitment.
You know,

2561
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:06,090
I like a lot because I'm a very basic
guy.

2562
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,420
Everything is basic,
the basics with me because everybody

2563
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:12,150
forgets the basics.
So most of the time when when somebody

2564
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:13,560
comes out,
like tim silvia,

2565
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:16,500
a little while ago,
he came to my gym and he threw the left

2566
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:17,990
hook wrong and I,
I tell them,

2567
01:47:17,991 --> 01:47:18,390
I said,
man,

2568
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:21,120
just can be way harder.
And he started learning to throw the

2569
01:47:21,121 --> 01:47:24,810
hook without loading up and he wanted
his fight in 15 seconds with a left

2570
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:25,360
hook.
He goes,

2571
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,160
this is crazy.
It works that I enjoy to give them an

2572
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,770
hour time and show them what they do
wrong.

2573
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,380
And then if they actually listened to
it,

2574
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:36,210
they realize why wait a minute,
I got more power.

2575
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,430
You know,
I don't try to change the style.

2576
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:42,720
I just showed them how you get maximum
power and if you mix it up between your

2577
01:47:42,721 --> 01:47:43,680
styles,
that's up to you.

2578
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:47,730
But I see you have this incredible
passion about this guys and about

2579
01:47:47,731 --> 01:47:49,470
working on technique.
That's why I'm,

2580
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,390
I'm curious like,
have you ever thought about like,

2581
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:53,250
just going into training and.
YeaH,

2582
01:47:53,251 --> 01:47:53,620
no,
it's,

2583
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:55,170
it's um,
it was too busy,

2584
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,790
too busy,
but also,

2585
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,970
um,
I don't now anymore,

2586
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:01,210
but you know,
a lot of guys that you do over the

2587
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:01,940
years,
so you put a lot,

2588
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,050
you invest a lot of time and it doesn't
work,

2589
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:08,160
it doesn't work out or they get a better
deal somewhere else and they just leave

2590
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:09,960
you in a year.
She does with a lot of fighters,

2591
01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:12,900
you know,
and trainers that finally the trainer

2592
01:48:12,901 --> 01:48:16,350
has something or a manager and then they
just kick him to the side because I'm

2593
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:17,920
going to save 10 percent here are going
to,

2594
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:19,043
you know then.

2595
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,250
but,
but then again,

2596
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,710
those guys,
most of the time you see them losing,

2597
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,960
you know,
because you broke the winning

2598
01:48:24,961 --> 01:48:27,120
combination.
If you have something.

2599
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:30,390
My stretching routine and everybody
always says please post is because you

2600
01:48:30,391 --> 01:48:33,270
always talk about this.
My stretching routine is the same as it

2601
01:48:33,271 --> 01:48:34,104
was when,
uh,

2602
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:37,050
when I started in [inaudible] 93,
well that's probably even before my

2603
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:38,070
karate.
And I say,

2604
01:48:38,071 --> 01:48:39,250
you never changed it.
I said,

2605
01:48:39,251 --> 01:48:40,140
no,
I never change her.

2606
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:43,800
Why wouldn't you do more access?
Because with that stretching routine,

2607
01:48:43,801 --> 01:48:46,770
I never had a problem.
Why would I change it and they've given

2608
01:48:46,771 --> 01:48:50,010
me a problem in training is he.
So now if I start adding things or

2609
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:52,110
subtracting to certainly I get injured.
Just my own fault.

2610
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,720
I had a winning combination.
Never always helped me.

2611
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,720
Let's not break that.
Let's keep it the same.

2612
01:48:58,170 --> 01:48:59,220
And that's what everythinG.

2613
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:00,810
Yeah.
It'S just.

2614
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,000
I know that you have your gym and
thousand oaks.

2615
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:04,380
YeP.
You know what's it callEd?

2616
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,300
The westlake village.
Her boss woodlands elite.

2617
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:10,450
Mma and you.
It's mostly a recreational peoples.

2618
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:11,310
That is,
that's it?

2619
01:49:11,370 --> 01:49:12,031
Yeah.
Tuesdays,

2620
01:49:12,031 --> 01:49:13,440
thursdays.
I'm there at 6:00.

2621
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:15,290
you know.
What kind of classes do you teach on?

2622
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,180
Tuesdays is mostly striking.
[inaudible] only striking a thursdays I

2623
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:24,930
start with ground but only like for 20
minutes because people want to work out

2624
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:28,020
like the fight.
If I took five classes with the fighters

2625
01:49:28,021 --> 01:49:29,570
here,
we do a lot of growth to escapes and

2626
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:31,170
reversals.
I always start like that.

2627
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:34,680
That's how I trained.
I never started on my knees with

2628
01:49:34,681 --> 01:49:37,830
grappling.
I always lay on my back and I tell my

2629
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:40,230
partner,
you can take any position you want to,

2630
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:42,630
gordon.
So important is the most important thing

2631
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:45,270
for a bad spot.
You put yourself in a bad spot and

2632
01:49:45,271 --> 01:49:47,980
figure out how to be comfortable in
those bad and work out of them all the

2633
01:49:47,981 --> 01:49:48,520
time.

2634
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,600
That's it,
you know,

2635
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:52,570
and the basics.
I had an a student one time coming over

2636
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:54,780
to me and after class and he said,
boss,

2637
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:55,660
you know what's funny?
I said,

2638
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:56,800
tommy,
he says,

2639
01:49:57,010 --> 01:50:00,940
I've been working in now for three years
and you're teaching the same stuff.

2640
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:02,261
I say,
yeah,

2641
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:03,850
that is funny,
so you wouldn't have something more

2642
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:05,190
funny.
And he goes,

2643
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:05,741
yeah,
I say,

2644
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:10,090
you're still not doing it,
and the reason I'm doing this is because

2645
01:50:10,091 --> 01:50:12,520
if people like you,
because you guys don't listen,

2646
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:13,990
look around.
Yeah,

2647
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,030
they don't.
They don't do it every bug to forget the

2648
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:17,330
basics.
They all want to do Just spinning

2649
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:20,260
becky's to the head,
the breakfast and the crazy elbows and

2650
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:22,840
doing that.
Forget about basic stuff.

2651
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:26,140
A simple one to how many times in boxing
you see a Knockout,

2652
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:31,540
highest level of the planet who will do
the trick is just the timing and when

2653
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:32,770
you throw it,
the timing,

2654
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:35,800
the efficiency of the technique and
having it down where you own it.

2655
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:36,760
Yep.
That's it.

2656
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,850
Yeah.
So you're enjoying teaching.

2657
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,790
You enjoy teaching couple times a week.
You enjoy doing that.

2658
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:44,990
That's why I'm doing it.
And here's your striking class.

2659
01:50:44,991 --> 01:50:49,420
Were guys sparring in there or are they
mostly working on technique and it's all

2660
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:53,290
technique and my classes you go like you
see girls in my class,

2661
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:54,670
but I still like to double love double
right.

2662
01:50:54,671 --> 01:50:57,360
I can tell them any combination of
people who are watching diego,

2663
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,600
like whoa,
what is this?

2664
01:50:58,601 --> 01:51:01,300
But they've been with me for awhile and
they're very technical,

2665
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:02,051
you know,
and they,

2666
01:51:02,051 --> 01:51:05,520
they do really well with the striking.
Like yesterday again,

2667
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:07,810
they were laughing about it.
She still goes,

2668
01:51:07,811 --> 01:51:10,170
always worked together.
Lora and dina,

2669
01:51:10,171 --> 01:51:11,950
that they're really good.
They're probably gonna listen to this

2670
01:51:11,951 --> 01:51:13,120
also,
but I said,

2671
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:15,880
listen,
everybody throws a low kick at the end.

2672
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:17,320
for instance,
a combination with a low kick,

2673
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:19,720
but once you do that in a class at the
local,

2674
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,810
they have their hands always down,
so I let him do it to me,

2675
01:51:22,811 --> 01:51:23,590
that combination.

2676
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:26,350
And then just before they make kick,
I stretch my hand in front of the face

2677
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,320
and I said,
I want everybody to do this because I

2678
01:51:29,321 --> 01:51:30,730
just walked around.
I said,

2679
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:34,120
and as we're only three people from the
likes of 22 or 24 people,

2680
01:51:34,121 --> 01:51:35,650
there are,
we're doing it,

2681
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,240
you know,
just keep your hands up,

2682
01:51:37,241 --> 01:51:38,770
just make,
you don't have to hit him.

2683
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:42,040
Just be aware that I could be a punch,
you know,

2684
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:44,670
keep your hands up.
And I walked over and they said,

2685
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,550
where are we?
One of the three.

2686
01:51:45,551 --> 01:51:46,091
I say,
you know,

2687
01:51:46,091 --> 01:51:49,420
you were one of the three because you
guys are always doing it.

2688
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:53,500
It's Just an a habit.
Make it good habit then don't lose the

2689
01:51:53,501 --> 01:51:55,990
habit.
But unfortunately a lot of guys lose it.

2690
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:58,090
Now what is this podcast you're dealing
with?

2691
01:51:58,091 --> 01:51:59,680
Moral.
And that was one of the reasons why you

2692
01:51:59,681 --> 01:52:01,060
guys wanted to come in here together.

2693
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:03,100
And like you said,
unfortunately moral got sick,

2694
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:04,720
but you guys are doing a podcast
together.

2695
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,510
We're doing a podcast or rutan and
brunello.

2696
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:10,710
It's called a written and all.
And it's an itunes soundcloud.

2697
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:11,521
It's everywhere.
We,

2698
01:52:11,521 --> 01:52:12,240
uh,
it's a,

2699
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:16,060
it's a really fun.
People have no clue who morrow really

2700
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:16,541
is.
You know,

2701
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:18,810
they start now because the pick peas on
shore doc,

2702
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:19,960
you know,
he's bipolar,

2703
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:21,970
you know,
and he just goes up and down.

2704
01:52:21,971 --> 01:52:25,440
But the guy is a genius.
Like there's no prompt,

2705
01:52:25,441 --> 01:52:28,720
there's no nothing.
He just like kenny rice for instance,

2706
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:29,650
same,
same,

2707
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:30,820
you know,
they have a brain,

2708
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:35,620
you can ask him about a horse in the
1989 and you will know in the name of

2709
01:52:35,621 --> 01:52:37,480
it,
it is a moral.

2710
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:40,390
And um,
and I told you the story before here

2711
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:42,340
with a pro wrestling the gig that he now
has,

2712
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,620
the people are raving about him
everywhere.

2713
01:52:45,621 --> 01:52:47,360
All,
even the pro wrestlers say,

2714
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:49,490
did,
did a best guy I ever had.

2715
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:54,110
And I told access stevie when once they
hire morrow.

2716
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:54,381
And,
uh,

2717
01:52:54,381 --> 01:52:58,130
George Barnett to do the progressive new
Japan pro wrestling on tv.

2718
01:52:58,610 --> 01:52:59,600
Uh,
I told him,

2719
01:52:59,601 --> 01:53:01,670
I say,
you watch marvel was going to work for

2720
01:53:01,671 --> 01:53:04,220
the wwe.
After they hear him doing this,

2721
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:06,890
he's going to get a job.
Mark my words while he's doing

2722
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:07,724
everything now

2723
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:10,230
doing that.
He's doing showtime boxing.

2724
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:12,960
He did a bunch of glory fights or this
is your,

2725
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:15,460
this is a landing page.
Beautiful.

2726
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:18,140
Rutan rinella.
Written down the episodes.

2727
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:20,220
Have you guys done so far?
Seven tomorrow.

2728
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:23,460
Tomorrow's the seventh and tomorrow is
dedicated to kevin,

2729
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:27,300
kevin randleman.
We got to have his wife on the Mark

2730
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:31,080
Coleman on and we're going to talk about
his life and all the funny things.

2731
01:53:31,081 --> 01:53:33,390
I mean,
I got such a crazy stories with kevin.

2732
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,370
I mean,
I went to his wedding with my whole

2733
01:53:35,371 --> 01:53:39,420
family and it was so my family
destroyed.

2734
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:41,610
I mean,
they want to go with us to the funeral.

2735
01:53:41,611 --> 01:53:43,220
Everything was uh,
uh,

2736
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:43,991
you know,
it,

2737
01:53:43,991 --> 01:53:46,170
it was so sad.
The next day after the wedding,

2738
01:53:46,171 --> 01:53:48,240
we were all at the pool.
People laying down,

2739
01:53:48,241 --> 01:53:49,440
a little hung over,
you know,

2740
01:53:49,441 --> 01:53:53,580
and then suddenly there was a waterfall,
fully bald net and somebody started to

2741
01:53:53,581 --> 01:53:56,370
play volleyball and you know,
all these competitive guys there

2742
01:53:56,910 --> 01:54:01,910
suddenly this big themes on side with
the kits we're going to town and

2743
01:54:01,951 --> 01:54:04,560
everybody's wonderfully.
it was such a good time.

2744
01:54:04,561 --> 01:54:06,990
We had such a great time.
And then,

2745
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:07,980
you know,
things like,

2746
01:54:07,981 --> 01:54:09,450
uh,
a thing like this happens.

2747
01:54:09,870 --> 01:54:11,310
It's a,
it's reallY upsetting.

2748
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,840
It is,
it is.

2749
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,560
He was,
he truly was a great guy.

2750
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:17,860
I mean all my interactions with him
where he's always laughing and smiling

2751
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:21,310
and hugging people.
And I remember I ran into kevin once we

2752
01:54:21,311 --> 01:54:24,100
were at the fights.
It was a smaller organization.

2753
01:54:24,101 --> 01:54:26,650
It was,
there was some fights going on in vegas

2754
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:30,370
and kevin and I ran into each other at
the concession stand and he gives me

2755
01:54:30,371 --> 01:54:31,840
this big hug.
What's up man?

2756
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:34,090
Man.
And then other people will come over and

2757
01:54:34,091 --> 01:54:35,360
it just fans,
fans coming.

2758
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:35,591
Oh,
hey,

2759
01:54:35,591 --> 01:54:36,401
what's up kevin?
He was like,

2760
01:54:36,401 --> 01:54:37,330
hey,
how you doing man?

2761
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:39,280
Hugging everybody and smile.
I'm like,

2762
01:54:39,281 --> 01:54:40,840
what?
I'm fucking jovial guy.

2763
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:43,820
You know,
the first time I fought and we fought

2764
01:54:43,821 --> 01:54:46,440
and only met one time,
the fight before when he beat morris

2765
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:49,040
smith or to make the picture indication
that became the poster later.

2766
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:53,810
That was the only time I met him.
So now I'm in the hotel and I think

2767
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:56,240
before the weigh ins and I'm waiting for
the elevator,

2768
01:54:56,241 --> 01:54:58,530
I'm by myself.
The elevator door opens and there is,

2769
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:00,980
he is and he doesn't go.
It needs to be in.

2770
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:05,000
So I get into the elevator close now
we're with the two of us in the elevator

2771
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:08,330
and I'm looking,
but I can see his face in a mirror

2772
01:55:08,331 --> 01:55:11,120
reflection there and he already has a
smirk on his face.

2773
01:55:11,121 --> 01:55:12,200
No smoking.
And look at him.

2774
01:55:12,201 --> 01:55:14,000
And I go,
you know,

2775
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:17,380
good luck tomorrow.
And he goes,

2776
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:18,810
thank you.
He says,

2777
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,650
you hit two and I got here,
thank you.

2778
01:55:21,010 --> 01:55:22,180
And I will look.
And he says,

2779
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:26,440
if you keep your feet on the floor,
I promise you I won't take you down.

2780
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:27,543
And I go,
really?

2781
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,720
Okay.
Okay.

2782
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:35,010
He knows that
he gets notice.

2783
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,840
Crazy guy.
So either if you keep your feet on the

2784
01:55:37,841 --> 01:55:41,470
floor.
So no kicks you crazy.

2785
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:42,970
Crazy deal.
Yeah,

2786
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:44,280
right.
Well that's strange

2787
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,240
deal.
And so,

2788
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:47,490
um,
so in the fight,

2789
01:55:47,491 --> 01:55:50,570
the fight starts and you'll see in the
fight was it starts,

2790
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:53,070
the first thing he does,
he slept his thigh,

2791
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:55,480
like kicked me.
Right.

2792
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:58,920
So now I'm in.
So I go,

2793
01:55:58,921 --> 01:56:01,260
oh wait,
he's gonna think I gave him a low kick

2794
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:04,410
so I've got to act like you give them a
lucky but gave him a front kick to the

2795
01:56:04,411 --> 01:56:09,411
face so if he will wants to time it to
take me down to get him square in the

2796
01:56:09,621 --> 01:56:11,660
face.
So I move,

2797
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:15,390
I make a front kick and it goes just in
front of it and he's backing up.

2798
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:20,040
I just miss him with the front kick to
the face and I see something in his eyes

2799
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:23,610
and I pulled his day.
I couldn't have told this data while

2800
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:27,600
after I couldn't figure what it was.
But in his mind he of course thought I

2801
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:30,180
thought we said we're not going to kick,
you know,

2802
01:56:30,181 --> 01:56:32,850
but he did that slapping thing on his
thigh.

2803
01:56:32,851 --> 01:56:34,260
So it threw me off.
I thought,

2804
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:35,730
oh no,
he wants me to kick him.

2805
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:38,160
Okay.
So I guess that whole thing was not

2806
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:39,270
real.
Let's start kicking,

2807
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,300
you know,
but he got me because I kicked it,

2808
01:56:41,301 --> 01:56:42,134
took me down,

2809
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:45,500
and then the only the front could get
missed.

2810
01:56:45,501 --> 01:56:47,900
He backed up a ca would have been fun.
Well,

2811
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:49,690
there's always gamesmanship,
you know,

2812
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,830
it's definitely a lot of that.
Oh,

2813
01:56:51,831 --> 01:56:55,250
I was talking to him the whole time,
the big john wooden in his book,

2814
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:57,650
because I was literally.
People were bullying because laying on a

2815
01:56:57,651 --> 01:56:59,060
garden I say,
listen man.

2816
01:56:59,061 --> 01:57:02,070
I think friends would like,
it's better if he's

2817
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:09,070
trying to negotiate
to go back on their feet,

2818
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:10,520
you know,
I think

2819
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:15,420
is a good guy.
Yeah.

2820
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,480
He was a great guy.
He's a great guy too.

2821
01:57:17,481 --> 01:57:19,460
You know,
you guys were a part of the early days

2822
01:57:19,461 --> 01:57:20,360
of mma.
I mean,

2823
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,890
you are one of the original pioneers of
this sport without a doubt.

2824
01:57:24,891 --> 01:57:26,500
I mean,
you're fighting with the osha course.

2825
01:57:26,501 --> 01:57:29,210
Soccer for the longest time I had that
poster.

2826
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:31,970
There was a poster for the,
your announcing your fight with.

2827
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:36,500
She said the world's greatest martial
artists boss route and that's how they

2828
01:57:36,501 --> 01:57:37,370
uh,
announced you.

2829
01:57:37,371 --> 01:57:38,150
I mean,
they were,

2830
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:42,080
they were building you up because you
were like one of the first really elite

2831
01:57:42,081 --> 01:57:44,700
strikers to fight an mma,
you know?

2832
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:45,600
Yeah.
They always,

2833
01:57:45,601 --> 01:57:46,371
they always said,
I said,

2834
01:57:46,371 --> 01:57:50,270
I said they messed up right there on the
post and they forgot to world looking.

2835
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:54,470
The greatest looking marshall out is.
I told him that,

2836
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:59,660
but they forgot it was a good time,
but dumb man.

2837
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:02,960
Then when you look back on it,
I mean it's got to be pretty amazing the

2838
01:58:02,961 --> 01:58:07,430
time that you came along mean from
becoming a king of pancrase from

2839
01:58:07,431 --> 01:58:09,830
entering into the ufc and the ufc
heavyweight champion.

2840
01:58:09,831 --> 01:58:11,030
Like what,
what number was that?

2841
01:58:11,031 --> 01:58:12,880
Ufc 18 and 20.
Twenty.

2842
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,570
I became the champ.
Wow.

2843
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,040
Almost a 200.
No,

2844
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:17,720
that's incredible.
It's crazy.

2845
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:20,390
You know.
Then why it was such a great honor.

2846
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:25,230
The hall of fame when they said the also
the pioneer section because the pioneer

2847
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:27,980
section is a section that I will only
grow so far.

2848
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:30,980
Yeah.
It will not show even in 2000 years from

2849
01:58:30,981 --> 01:58:33,300
now.
It just keeps going and whatever because

2850
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:34,610
the new olympic,
but it doesn't matter.

2851
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,170
We were always the ones that started it,
you know,

2852
01:58:39,171 --> 01:58:41,090
and that's a cool thing and it was a
cool.

2853
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,040
I mean it's,
it's

2854
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,000
crazy also that this is the oldest sport
in the world really fighting it is the

2855
01:58:46,001 --> 01:58:51,001
oldest form of competition,
but it's also the newest sport because

2856
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:54,570
there's no sport from 1993,
which is when the ufc first started is

2857
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:59,350
no sport from then that has exploded a
new sport that came along in 1993.

2858
01:58:59,351 --> 01:59:01,570
That's exploded.
And now in 2016,

2859
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:04,210
I mean you have ronda rousey's on the
ellen show that we've talked about

2860
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:04,880
today.
The economy,

2861
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,920
greg or joel dos anjos fight is probably
gonna get close to $2 million pay per

2862
01:59:08,921 --> 01:59:09,551
view buys.
I mean,

2863
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:12,910
that's going to be fucking crazy.
You're dealing with the sport that's

2864
01:59:12,911 --> 01:59:15,130
exploding,
just exploding now.

2865
01:59:15,310 --> 01:59:18,000
So it's,
it's so strange that this is this

2866
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:20,890
combination of things.
The oldest sport is also the newest

2867
01:59:20,891 --> 01:59:24,520
sport and you from the time you started
competing,

2868
01:59:24,521 --> 01:59:26,770
you caught it like right at the
beginning of the wave.

2869
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:27,850
Yeah.
That's it's,

2870
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:29,750
it's really cool.
It's um,

2871
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:33,230
it's an amazing feeling.
Many times fence ask,

2872
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:35,540
wouldn't you want to be born like 20
years later?

2873
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:35,961
I say,
no,

2874
01:59:35,961 --> 01:59:39,330
I'm perfectly happy right now and then
I'll show the way I wrapped it up.

2875
01:59:39,331 --> 01:59:40,650
I didn't lose him.
I lost 22.

2876
01:59:40,651 --> 01:59:45,651
Five is a great way to stop while I'm
ahead to every week I keep going.

2877
01:59:46,081 --> 01:59:46,914
She,
if I get home and what,

2878
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:47,970
what vin?
One more,

2879
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:50,020
you'll lose.
You win or you lose,

2880
01:59:50,021 --> 01:59:52,530
you know,
like that's not a great way to wrap up a

2881
01:59:52,531 --> 01:59:54,960
career.
Know of course injuries with me played a

2882
01:59:54,990 --> 01:59:56,280
factor,
you know,

2883
01:59:56,281 --> 01:59:58,350
maybe I got the injuries because they
said,

2884
01:59:58,351 --> 02:00:00,010
hey,
it's been going really well man.

2885
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:03,800
You got to stop now in know because
you're getting older and you don't want

2886
02:00:03,801 --> 02:00:07,400
to admit that you get older because
she's still explosive and you still want

2887
02:00:07,401 --> 02:00:08,970
to do it.
Then you still train with guys.

2888
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:11,010
When I came back,
I trained with the guys in vegas and I

2889
02:00:11,011 --> 02:00:12,810
go,
did everybody looked at me?

2890
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:14,490
They said,
then you have a second career.

2891
02:00:14,491 --> 02:00:15,780
This is the craziest thing.
I said,

2892
02:00:15,781 --> 02:00:16,770
yeah,
there's this crazy right.

2893
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,870
I'm feeling so good.
You know,

2894
02:00:18,871 --> 02:00:21,600
I could have ended a warm.
I couldn't to do 20 minutes of warm up

2895
02:00:21,601 --> 02:00:24,840
when I started because I didn't train
for three and a half years and six weeks

2896
02:00:24,841 --> 02:00:28,440
later I'm not taking breaks anymore.
I just go into the next opponents.

2897
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:30,600
I was,
even myself,

2898
02:00:30,601 --> 02:00:32,010
I am a single man.
This is great.

2899
02:00:32,011 --> 02:00:36,390
And then all the injury started coming
back and now I go,

2900
02:00:36,391 --> 02:00:37,430
okay,
now I got it.

2901
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,050
My knees,
my tendinitis.

2902
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:42,000
I tore a hamstring,
pull the rip,

2903
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:46,410
rip out at the place at the dan
henderson's place,

2904
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:48,150
you know,
they took me down in the mid air.

2905
02:00:48,151 --> 02:00:52,650
I reversed the take down,
but with that I use so much upper bodY

2906
02:00:52,651 --> 02:00:54,540
strength strength that I popped the rip
out.

2907
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,870
So now there was 12 days before the
fight I couldn't punch anymore.

2908
02:00:58,110 --> 02:01:00,540
Can point you back.
The only thing I did was the workout.

2909
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:03,300
I have the audio workout in the air and
it was the only thing I could do.

2910
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:04,463
Wow.
Yeah.

2911
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,560
So what you got out of this,
the sport

2912
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,630
with your faculties,
100 percent intact,

2913
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:11,510
that is the ultimate goal of any fighter
to retire.

2914
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:14,240
And especially you because you're now a
commentator,

2915
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:16,640
you're also an analyst,
mean what you do,

2916
02:01:16,641 --> 02:01:18,710
a fantastic job of breaking down fights,
uh,

2917
02:01:18,711 --> 02:01:22,280
really enjoy you on inside mma because
you have such a knowledgeabLe

2918
02:01:22,281 --> 02:01:24,620
perspective.
but also you're very honest.

2919
02:01:24,621 --> 02:01:27,710
You don't play politics.
You're very honest about how you feel

2920
02:01:27,711 --> 02:01:29,990
about a fight coming up about where it
guy fucked up.

2921
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:33,850
but we're where a person's chances lie.
And I think it's,

2922
02:01:33,851 --> 02:01:34,270
uh,
it's,

2923
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:36,560
it's amazing what you've done.
It really is amazing.

2924
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:39,440
Thank you.
You're sharp ever.

2925
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:40,551
I,
you knoW,

2926
02:01:40,551 --> 02:01:43,040
I,
I'm almost trying not to get hit,

2927
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,590
you know,
it didn't really work in my tunnel

2928
02:01:44,591 --> 02:01:48,230
fighting as kevin
because he'd beat the crap out of me,

2929
02:01:48,231 --> 02:01:49,820
but the first four minutes,
but,

2930
02:01:49,821 --> 02:01:53,660
you know,
but after that it was okay for the rest.

2931
02:01:53,661 --> 02:01:55,490
I don't think I ever got hit,
you know,

2932
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:57,080
I,
I always try to,

2933
02:01:57,110 --> 02:02:00,410
you know,
slip and move or fighting intelligent is

2934
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:05,270
most important aspect of fighting to use
your mind to use your mind and proper

2935
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:07,880
tactics and techniques.
That's why I love mighty mouse.

2936
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:10,660
Mighty mouse is on.
Yeah,

2937
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:11,960
I agree.
I mean,

2938
02:02:11,961 --> 02:02:15,080
I don't think there's any competition.
I'm think jon jones is a phenomenal

2939
02:02:15,081 --> 02:02:17,430
talent and he's an amazing fighter,
but I think it's,

2940
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:21,320
it's almost disrespectful to put him as
pound for pound the best when you look

2941
02:02:21,321 --> 02:02:23,460
at some of the wars that he's had with
gustafson.

2942
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:26,270
I mean the war that he had with daniel
cormier was daniel.

2943
02:02:26,271 --> 02:02:29,330
Obviously he's a great fighter,
is a really good fight in,

2944
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:31,610
you know,
john won the fight of course clearly,

2945
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,800
but you look at what mighty mouse is
going into.

2946
02:02:33,801 --> 02:02:37,490
The competition doesn't even get hit.
Dodson is a fucking freak.

2947
02:02:37,510 --> 02:02:39,680
Yep.
I mean dotson's a freak and dotson just

2948
02:02:39,681 --> 02:02:41,100
couldn't touch him.
Dotson.

2949
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:43,880
Elvis said in the beginning,
it's like he's glued to the ground,

2950
02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:45,770
like he moves back.
You'd never slipped.

2951
02:02:45,771 --> 02:02:50,660
She never just grateful to work,
but the man dj who met tom did a really

2952
02:02:50,661 --> 02:02:52,520
good job.
That's a really,

2953
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:53,354
uh,
that's.

2954
02:02:53,370 --> 02:02:55,280
Yeah,
that's a whole new level where he's got

2955
02:02:55,281 --> 02:02:58,220
so much going on in his mind.
He's very smart.

2956
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:01,460
He's very dedicated.
He's got a great control of his ego.

2957
02:03:01,461 --> 02:03:03,290
He doesn't fight like a fully fights.
Very,

2958
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:06,260
very technical.
His footwork is fantastic.

2959
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:08,660
He's his choices that he makes it a
fight.

2960
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:11,510
He's unpredictable in his movements.
It's Just,

2961
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,460
I think he's the best ever.
I really do.

2962
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:16,470
He needs to guide to fight like a
carnival gregor though,

2963
02:03:16,471 --> 02:03:18,710
because.
So he has a big payday one day because

2964
02:03:18,711 --> 02:03:21,170
rafael dos anjos is going to make a lot
of money.

2965
02:03:21,171 --> 02:03:22,240
This fight,
you know,

2966
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:24,200
if a 2 million,
if that's really going to hit it.

2967
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:24,911
Yeah.
And,

2968
02:03:24,911 --> 02:03:27,520
and you watch that,
we'll probably get up also if he,

2969
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:30,830
if for some reason mcgregor wins this
because you're going to be very hard to

2970
02:03:30,831 --> 02:03:33,410
fight for him because I think a dos
anjos yeah.

2971
02:03:33,411 --> 02:03:35,420
It's going to be verY tough fight
because we saw with mendez.

2972
02:03:35,421 --> 02:03:36,080
Yeah.
Well we'll,

2973
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:36,920
we'll noTice.
Same thing,

2974
02:03:36,921 --> 02:03:38,090
you know,
once it goes to the ground,

2975
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:43,840
but you still don't know in that fight.
He is so aware of where he is.

2976
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:46,400
When he fought mendez and I talking
about mcgregor,

2977
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:48,720
he was Just laying on the ground,
you know,

2978
02:03:48,721 --> 02:03:51,060
he didn't even try to escape.
It was almost like he said,

2979
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:52,010
oh,
he's going to run out of gas.

2980
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,470
Mendez tooK that fight on two weeks.
That's what I mean.

2981
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:56,210
Just different as you could have done
that.

2982
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:57,950
But he knew that.
That's what I'm saying.

2983
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,140
He knew,
oh,

2984
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:01,400
I'm just going to carry it into the
second round and I'm going to get them,

2985
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:02,690
you know,
didn't even try.

2986
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:06,020
So I think once against the rafael dos
anjos yeah,

2987
02:04:06,021 --> 02:04:07,370
he's going to need this.
Go into the garden.

2988
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:10,460
That's one thing for sure.
It's a different aniMal.

2989
02:04:10,461 --> 02:04:12,470
He'll be there every minute of every
round.

2990
02:04:12,471 --> 02:04:14,660
He'd be There for 25 minutes trying to
kill you.

2991
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,820
Yeah.
Dos anjos is a fucking animal man.

2992
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:18,980
He's an animal.
It's a different animal.

2993
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:23,070
Totally different kind of a fight.
So I'm so curious as to how that's going

2994
02:04:23,071 --> 02:04:26,030
to play out.
When you look aT how obsessed connor is

2995
02:04:26,031 --> 02:04:31,031
with footwork and movement and being
smooth and fast and laying like one of

2996
02:04:31,671 --> 02:04:34,220
the things that he said when I was
interviewing them after the fight,

2997
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:35,690
he's like,
no power lucy,

2998
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:37,100
that no power,
just precision,

2999
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:38,010
just precision.

3000
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,900
Like all those come out.
He just drops out,

3001
02:04:39,901 --> 02:04:40,950
punch in.
I mean,

3002
02:04:40,951 --> 02:04:42,930
he's not,
he's not grunting.

3003
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,900
He's not.
He just drops it in and boom.

3004
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:48,840
It takes them out.
The thing is I see him everywhere,

3005
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:53,190
so I hope he's not gonna make the rousey
mistake because I said it two weeks

3006
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:55,920
before.
I think what she's doing is not good.

3007
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:58,350
She said,
every talk show every mexican I go to

3008
02:04:58,351 --> 02:05:00,780
the supermarket,
three magazine covers.

3009
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:01,860
I mean,
iT's insane.

3010
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,780
Stopped doing that,
you know,

3011
02:05:03,781 --> 02:05:05,220
fight first,
fight first.

3012
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:06,630
That makes you big,
you know,

3013
02:05:06,631 --> 02:05:09,270
once you lose that,
all the other stuff that you're doing

3014
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:12,240
right now is going to go as well because
they want that champion,

3015
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:13,810
you know,
so mcgregor,

3016
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:18,830
I hope that he keeps,
stays focused and only picks the ones

3017
02:05:19,081 --> 02:05:21,810
that he needs to do contractually.
And that's It.

3018
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,030
Yeah.
I think he's going to be a lot smarter

3019
02:05:24,031 --> 02:05:24,370
about.

3020
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:28,080
I think rhonda just got overwhelmed with
the amount of superstardom that came her

3021
02:05:28,081 --> 02:05:29,590
way.
Unprecedented him.

3022
02:05:29,591 --> 02:05:31,350
I mean,
there's never been an athlete like that

3023
02:05:31,351 --> 02:05:33,570
before.
This female ass kicker who's on top of

3024
02:05:33,571 --> 02:05:36,420
the world.
I mean she was a new thing and because

3025
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:38,320
of that there were so many temptations
and,

3026
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:40,460
and that's why for her it's also what's
so,

3027
02:05:40,461 --> 02:05:41,610
so hard.
When she lost,

3028
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:44,220
she was such a high,
you know,

3029
02:05:44,221 --> 02:05:46,790
and then boom,
there you have such a low that well does

3030
02:05:46,830 --> 02:05:49,420
the auto,
this is how your opponents could have

3031
02:05:49,421 --> 02:05:50,580
felt,
you know,

3032
02:05:50,581 --> 02:05:53,130
and I think that kind of stuff,
you don't want one side,

3033
02:05:53,131 --> 02:05:56,370
it's really good for her because now she
understands that now she's going to go,

3034
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:57,240
oh,
okay.

3035
02:05:57,330 --> 02:05:59,040
No,
I tasted the other side.

3036
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:00,700
You're going to make you a better
person.

3037
02:06:00,701 --> 02:06:02,520
Then you start reminiscing about all the
things.

3038
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:03,570
Did I,
you know,

3039
02:06:03,571 --> 02:06:06,240
what I owe and that interview I wasn't
really.

3040
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:08,040
That wasn't really cool.
You know,

3041
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:11,040
those things are backfiring once you
said losing as mcgregor,

3042
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:13,440
the same thing.
Although with him there's always.

3043
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:15,360
It's a funny thing,
you know,

3044
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:18,030
with rhonda,
it's real,

3045
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:19,140
like real,
real,

3046
02:06:19,141 --> 02:06:22,320
but mcgregor said,
will he do the reason is so

3047
02:06:22,321 --> 02:06:23,154
unbelievable.
He good?

3048
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,410
Is he in his mind?
He truly lives.

3049
02:06:25,411 --> 02:06:27,090
There's no way he could lose,
you know,

3050
02:06:27,091 --> 02:06:29,850
and a guy was a guy like that.
Mendez hit them hard.

3051
02:06:30,330 --> 02:06:35,010
I mean heart and he didn't even flinch.
There was no zero,

3052
02:06:35,011 --> 02:06:36,600
no movement.
Crazy.

3053
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:39,990
It was the craziest thing we sell.
Mendez took out ricardo lopez,

3054
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:43,470
ricardo lamas rather,
luggage mendez.

3055
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,640
It's fucking hard.
That's a hard area.

3056
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:48,390
Connor Just eats it.
Each on the tip of his job.

3057
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:50,410
It was not like,
just crazy.

3058
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:51,480
Yeah,
his chart,

3059
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:52,500
his jaw is incredible.

3060
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:55,650
His mind is incredible.
I'm so fascinated by that fight.

3061
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:56,880
so fascinating.
He says,

3062
02:06:57,130 --> 02:06:59,080
we're one for one of us,
goes to order.

3063
02:06:59,110 --> 02:07:01,650
We all go to work all the way back.
When he said that,

3064
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:04,100
remember in boston was that.
That was,

3065
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:06,500
that's where he got me.
That's when roadway.

3066
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:07,081
I said,
okay,

3067
02:07:07,081 --> 02:07:08,800
this guy,
that's why we got to worry about on the

3068
02:07:08,801 --> 02:07:11,570
inside of way we wanted and then the
next time it wasn't inside mma.

3069
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:12,061
He says,
man,

3070
02:07:12,061 --> 02:07:14,370
I got my water grabs look in in my
suits.

3071
02:07:14,371 --> 02:07:15,990
How cool is that?
He was so happy.

3072
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,990
He got his name.
And did you ever see the video?

3073
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:21,450
Oh,
I did some homework on him because we

3074
02:07:21,451 --> 02:07:23,970
were going to interview him and I saw
this video.

3075
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:26,790
It isn't a hotel and in in dublin I
believe,

3076
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:30,360
and there's coconuts to just see that
boat now.

3077
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:33,240
Okay.
So he's talking into the camera that's

3078
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:35,710
shooting this,
whatever you is the following him around

3079
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:36,170
to suddenly,

3080
02:07:36,170 --> 02:07:38,590
here's why wife going no way.
Right.

3081
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:40,260
And he goes,
he's talking to kevin,

3082
02:07:40,261 --> 02:07:41,130
he looks at and says,
says what?

3083
02:07:41,131 --> 02:07:41,980
He said,
no way.

3084
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:43,930
And he says the one second.
So he walks over,

3085
02:07:43,931 --> 02:07:46,150
she,
she comes with a coconut and there's a

3086
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:48,310
hole in there that put a little cork
thing in there.

3087
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:50,560
So he goes,
no way.

3088
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:52,760
He never saw it.
Coconut.

3089
02:07:53,210 --> 02:07:57,180
So they pull the thing I think with the
straw and go or no way.

3090
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,750
You think they did this for a bit
because I have to fight a brazilian guy

3091
02:08:01,751 --> 02:08:04,720
and that's why they put their start
reminiscing and that is a knock on the

3092
02:08:04,721 --> 02:08:07,360
door.
So He opened the door and he has the

3093
02:08:07,361 --> 02:08:10,180
cognitive dissonance.
This trainer at a trade that sees the

3094
02:08:10,181 --> 02:08:11,280
co,
he does her,

3095
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:12,820
the trader goes,
no way.

3096
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:16,780
Everybody does.
It is so funny.

3097
02:08:16,781 --> 02:08:18,040
And then you see him at the attic.

3098
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:23,040
He lifts at the attic from his mom and
dad with his wife the attic and he's

3099
02:08:24,221 --> 02:08:28,270
putting a suit on and he's trying to
figure out a thing in the pocket,

3100
02:08:28,271 --> 02:08:28,931
you know,
and he goes,

3101
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:30,760
I don't know how to do it,
but you know,

3102
02:08:30,761 --> 02:08:32,710
I,
I think in a few years from now,

3103
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:34,110
I will say though,
it's,

3104
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:37,330
this becomes second nature and then you
see him now.

3105
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:41,710
How cool is that?
You're really there and now all the way

3106
02:08:41,711 --> 02:08:43,180
up there.
Good guy.

3107
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:44,740
Well,
he's making so much money now.

3108
02:08:44,741 --> 02:08:47,770
It's unprecedented.
I was talking to dana on the phone today

3109
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:50,680
and dana was saying he's going to be the
first guy to make $100,000,000,

3110
02:08:51,570 --> 02:08:53,680
although made $5,000,000 from that last
fight.

3111
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:57,070
Aldo did $5 million,
$5 million and all those going back to

3112
02:08:57,071 --> 02:08:59,470
Brazil with that moneY where it's worth
probably like who knows,

3113
02:08:59,471 --> 02:09:00,320
15,
20,

3114
02:09:00,950 --> 02:09:01,690
something like that.

3115
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:02,300
I mean in,
in,

3116
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:04,690
in,
for a guy like aldo who loves Brazil and

3117
02:09:04,691 --> 02:09:07,690
loves to be in Brazil,
that money goes a long way in Brazil,

3118
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:10,440
you know when you can help a lot of
people in Brazil with that money to.

3119
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:12,760
Whereas if you bring That money to
America,

3120
02:09:12,761 --> 02:09:17,761
I mean $5,000,000,000 in los angeles,
you can get it in house and then it's

3121
02:09:18,821 --> 02:09:21,490
gone.
But in Brazil he can,

3122
02:09:21,491 --> 02:09:23,350
he can hold onto that money for a long
time.

3123
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:25,270
well,
who knows how much current is going to

3124
02:09:25,271 --> 02:09:28,240
make in this dos dos anjos fight and
even if he loses you still defenses,

3125
02:09:28,241 --> 02:09:29,980
featherweight title,
which is crazy.

3126
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:32,500
What if he fucking wins?
If he fucking winter,

3127
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:34,840
then he goes up and fights robbie lawler
at welterweight.

3128
02:09:35,130 --> 02:09:37,590
Oh yeah.
Wonder boy,

3129
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:39,940
it's going to be insane.
That's what a boy has.

3130
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,190
The same kind of timing that he asked is
different.

3131
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:47,230
I always talk about distance as
yesterday in my class.

3132
02:09:47,231 --> 02:09:49,540
I said again,
the most important thing if fighting

3133
02:09:49,541 --> 02:09:51,640
fish,
keep your nose pointed to your opponent

3134
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:56,910
because if you say ice that they think
looking away dishes is not keep you full

3135
02:09:56,951 --> 02:10:00,190
vision and distance.
You know if you,

3136
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:04,390
if you manage to stay just outside this
reach and then you can counter,

3137
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:05,920
it's golden.
That's what.

3138
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:11,070
You know what a boy wonder boy has that
no one has his karate kicks.

3139
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:14,020
He's got the front leg side kick to the
body,

3140
02:10:14,021 --> 02:10:17,290
the front leg roundhouse kick to the
face when he was fucking Johnny

3141
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:18,930
Hendricks up with that.
He front leg side,

3142
02:10:18,931 --> 02:10:21,250
kick them to the body and then frontline
roundhouse kicked him in the face.

3143
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:23,140
You can see hendrix was like,
whoa,

3144
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:24,330
what is this?
Yeah,

3145
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:27,420
he kicks in a way that no one does.
No one.

3146
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:30,250
Like when he wheeled kicked allen burger
ellenberger was saying before that

3147
02:10:30,251 --> 02:10:31,480
fight,
those kicks are a waste of time.

3148
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:32,980
He's like,
I think it's a waste of energy.

3149
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:33,823
All that spinning stuff.

3150
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:38,750
He'll kick some
hope solo is a big fan.

3151
02:10:38,751 --> 02:10:40,070
Did you see that?
Oh,

3152
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:42,390
hope solo made.
I made a video message for wonder.

3153
02:10:42,391 --> 02:10:44,810
Boy loves him.
How cool Is that?

3154
02:10:44,811 --> 02:10:45,740
Amazing.
Yeah.

3155
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:49,370
His fight with hendrix was his coming
out moment like where you really got to

3156
02:10:49,371 --> 02:10:53,840
see him with all of his work that he's
done with wide and his take down defense

3157
02:10:53,841 --> 02:10:58,280
and his wrestling and you're seeing that
kickboxing that we always knew we had

3158
02:10:58,281 --> 02:11:02,540
with the 57 and o kickbox is.
You think you're seeing it come together

3159
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:06,050
inside the octagon.
Where is all these other mma skills have

3160
02:11:06,051 --> 02:11:08,300
caught up with his kickboxing?
fuck man,

3161
02:11:08,301 --> 02:11:09,170
that guy is good.
Yeah.

3162
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:11,690
You something.
I was so impressed wiTh that fight with

3163
02:11:11,691 --> 02:11:13,730
hendrix.
I was so impressed with him when his

3164
02:11:13,731 --> 02:11:16,730
father said it before.
If I was talking about the distance,

3165
02:11:17,150 --> 02:11:17,840
you know,
I go,

3166
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,530
oh,
well let's see.

3167
02:11:18,530 --> 02:11:20,120
And then when I saw it,
The footwork,

3168
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:23,600
it's like a snake.
He's like in and out and he wrestled.

3169
02:11:23,601 --> 02:11:25,280
Did he has to be right?
I mean,

3170
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:27,080
how does he stands?
He's,

3171
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:29,030
first of all,
it's done a lot of work with weidMan.

3172
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:33,050
Him and weidman trained together a lot
and also he's carlos machado.

3173
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,270
Son-in-law.
Oh yeah,

3174
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:34,631
yeah,
yeah.

3175
02:11:34,631 --> 02:11:36,640
Right.
So he mean he's learning jujitsu,

3176
02:11:36,650 --> 02:11:37,790
I'm sure from.
I mean,

3177
02:11:37,791 --> 02:11:40,040
I don't know what belty has under that,
but jesus christ,

3178
02:11:40,041 --> 02:11:43,730
that's a high level.
It's a beautiful thing to be connected

3179
02:11:43,731 --> 02:11:44,180
to that.
How.

3180
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:48,800
How did I hear something that he was
going to be like family of light

3181
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:50,480
minnows.
What was the connection to.

3182
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:54,350
Is she going to live there now while he
trains with them a lot.

3183
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:56,630
There's a big wide men,
of course,

3184
02:11:56,740 --> 02:11:57,910
elite wrestler.
No,

3185
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:01,280
ncaa all american.
I mean one of the best wrestlers right

3186
02:12:01,281 --> 02:12:04,370
now in mma,
so to have a guy like weidman training,

3187
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:06,530
I knew that they do a lot of training
sessions at hofstra.

3188
02:12:06,530 --> 02:12:08,510
They'd go down there and do a lot of
work with the wrestling,

3189
02:12:08,890 --> 02:12:11,930
but that's what he needed.
He needed to be able to confidently stay

3190
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:15,500
on his feet and not worry about
executing the kicks because you see them

3191
02:12:15,501 --> 02:12:17,480
earlier in his career.
He just didn't.

3192
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:20,420
It wasn't loose,
it wasn't loose the way he is in a

3193
02:12:20,421 --> 02:12:23,360
kickboxing fight.
Did you ever see him in the world combat

3194
02:12:23,361 --> 02:12:25,100
leak?
Chuck norrIs's organization?

3195
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:27,890
Oh my god.
You see them in pure kickboxing.

3196
02:12:27,891 --> 02:12:30,630
You see what a talent.
This kid is just incredible and we're

3197
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:34,280
going to watch it,
but it's so unusual because iT's hands

3198
02:12:34,281 --> 02:12:36,710
down and loose and in and out like a
snake.

3199
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:42,100
Trying to find a guy who emulates those.
I mean leona machida is obviously got

3200
02:12:42,171 --> 02:12:45,800
great karate skill,
but wonder boys on another level.

3201
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:50,150
it's like several levels past that.
The combinations that guy throws.

3202
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:53,660
Like when he hit hendricks,
he's tagging them and then as he slide

3203
02:12:53,661 --> 02:12:55,600
now,
roundhouse kicks them in the body and

3204
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:58,850
then he slides back in and hit them with
another combination and then he slides

3205
02:12:58,851 --> 02:13:01,310
out,
slides back in again and hendrix is just

3206
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:03,770
overwhelmed.
He never saw anybody do that to hendrix.

3207
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:05,060
Yeah,
I think um,

3208
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:10,540
what's interesting to try with guys like
that elvis said this with cheeto show

3209
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:15,450
and even with conor mcgregor and when he
fought aldo and,

3210
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:17,330
and,
and in this case now as well,

3211
02:13:17,570 --> 02:13:20,030
because the stance is so karate white,
right?

3212
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:24,350
But it's a karate with low kicks there
used to here iN America,

3213
02:13:24,850 --> 02:13:25,780
you know,
so I'm,

3214
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:30,940
I said to my buddies,
I imagine that I'm the camp former aldo

3215
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:34,860
said four months ago.
Listen,

3216
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:38,070
you're going to face mcgregor eventually
is going to happen.

3217
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,550
Let's switch you to south pole so we can
use your left low kicks.

3218
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:43,380
It goes,
the way they stand,

3219
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:48,000
It's going to be very hard for them to
get away from low kicks on the outside

3220
02:13:49,010 --> 02:13:52,040
inside is easy because what mcgregor
does,

3221
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:56,460
he lowers himself and once his knee goes
in the same line as this,

3222
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:58,410
but so to say,
you don't,

3223
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:01,530
you don't have any space to land that
inside located.

3224
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,660
It's really weird.
If you angle it up,

3225
02:14:03,661 --> 02:14:07,800
the angle is gone,
but low kicks in that stand outside

3226
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:10,290
located outside low kicks froM the
southpaw stance,

3227
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:12,420
from a southpaw stance,
powerful loki.

3228
02:14:12,430 --> 02:14:14,370
So that lag,
because if you stop the legs,

3229
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:17,400
you're going stop every.
Well nikki holtz getting Raymond Daniels

3230
02:14:17,401 --> 02:14:19,440
because raymond danIels is a very
similar style.

3231
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:21,510
Daniels,
of course it was a karate champion as

3232
02:14:21,511 --> 02:14:25,440
unbelievable kicking Talent,
but nikki hall skin stays glued to him

3233
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:27,780
and throws leg kicks.
It just chops them down,

3234
02:14:27,781 --> 02:14:29,160
chops them down,
champs him down,

3235
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:30,150
and then beats them up.

3236
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:33,690
And that's the same thing with joseph
valtellina st did the same thing with

3237
02:14:33,910 --> 02:14:34,790
Raymond Daniels.
Yep.

3238
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:37,140
Chop them down with low kicks,
chop them down with low kicks.

3239
02:14:37,141 --> 02:14:40,170
And then he had ticked them and knocked
them out of linea is also something.

3240
02:14:40,171 --> 02:14:40,830
Yeah.
Wow.

3241
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:43,040
Yeah.
But he's another guy that he.

3242
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:47,220
He had to relinquish his title because
of concussions and he's going to do the

3243
02:14:47,221 --> 02:14:49,440
podcast soon.
We're Talking about him coming on the

3244
02:14:49,441 --> 02:14:54,330
podcast because he wants to talk about
some of the situations he's gone through

3245
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:56,820
dealing with concussion syndrome.
Wow.

3246
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,170
Yeah.
And he's young.

3247
02:14:58,650 --> 02:14:59,490
Yup.
Yeah,

3248
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:01,230
just hard training.
Hard fights.

3249
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:03,390
Nikki holds can fight was hard.
You know,

3250
02:15:03,391 --> 02:15:04,980
he's had,
he sent some fucking wars,

3251
02:15:04,981 --> 02:15:07,140
you know,
he has see in training we never.

3252
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:11,610
Like I never get knocked out thankfully,
but I could hit a few times,

3253
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:13,230
but never,
you know,

3254
02:15:13,231 --> 02:15:16,980
not every workout for sure,
like ones that are just so many time.

3255
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:19,260
It will be good to have good sparring
partners.

3256
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:23,760
It always happens when you go somewhere
and then one of these at a boxing club,

3257
02:15:23,761 --> 02:15:25,100
but ceRtainly a boxer jumps up,
hey,

3258
02:15:25,101 --> 02:15:27,390
you want to go for your run?
And then it goes harder,

3259
02:15:27,391 --> 02:15:27,901
harder,
harder,

3260
02:15:27,901 --> 02:15:28,734
harder,
and then.

3261
02:15:29,170 --> 02:15:31,350
Yeah,
well that's one of the smart things that

3262
02:15:31,351 --> 02:15:34,200
Conor does.
Connor keeps all of his training

3263
02:15:34,201 --> 02:15:35,790
partners very close.
You know,

3264
02:15:35,850 --> 02:15:37,620
he's got all these guys got gunnar
nelson,

3265
02:15:37,621 --> 02:15:40,140

he trains with on a regular basis and he

3266
02:15:40,141 --> 02:15:43,650
keeps those guys very close to him and
everybody's got a common goal.

3267
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,480
Everybody's trying to help everybody
else.

3268
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:49,440
Everybody's trying to get themselves
healthy so that they're going to be

3269
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:51,840
stepping into that cage at 100 percent.
That's it.

3270
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:53,060
Winning combination.
See,

3271
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:54,610

3272
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:57,630
