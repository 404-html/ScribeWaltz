1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,310
The Joe Rogan experience that became an
issue in Abu Dhabi with a lot of

2
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:05,144
wrestlers,
arrests.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,200
I should take guys down and just hold
them in positions and not go for

4
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:12,140
submissions.
Just try to go for points and you know,

5
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:14,240
and people will get furious.
They'd be like,

6
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:17,360
well this isn't Jujitsu,
but some people felt like the only way

7
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:20,840
to compete with these guys is to do what
they're doing is to fight smart.

8
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:24,200
The only way you can win is to to fight
on points.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Would you rather lose on points then
when by holding a guy down?

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,110
Yeah.
I have lost like,

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,500
that doesn't bother you.
Does that mean you don't.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,550
You show me a good loser.
I'll show you a loser,

13
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:41,790
muddy,
but you know,

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,791
yeah.
I rather lose on points with keeping my

15
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:51,851
mentality always with the objective to
get into a better place then to stop my

16
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:56,870
game and try to find out how I'm going
to win this match while using the time

17
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:01,040
on my side.
So I have five matches where I lost when

18
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,980
I could've went.
I was winning on points and then I went

19
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,260
for something or I try to advance the
position and I lost it and then doing it

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,830
and then whatever the guy sweating me
and then I lost because the time ran

21
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,980
out.
So I have lost matches like that and it

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,610
served as a good learning experience and
everything and you know,

23
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:19,400
yeah.
I rather lose on points then to sit

24
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,860
there and stopped again and wait for the
time to,

25
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,790
to,
to run out because I w I don't know if I

26
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,990
would feel like shit,
you know,

27
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:31,991
I feel like deep inside me I have a
thing that I feel really bad if I don't

28
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,040
try to go for the next position.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,770
I feel guilty almost.
So you're checking my grandfather's like

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,920
I tweeted something yesterday,
somebody sent me that.

31
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:47,810
I was talking about how I felt when my
child was born that it was.

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,300
Oh,
I was thinking about how crazy it must

33
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:51,134
be.
Um,

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,390
how many different babies being born
right now?

35
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,670
If you could see them all in real time
in front of you,

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,490
like on a giant screen,
you'd be like a baby invasion.

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,410
I mean you don't think about it because
you're only in that hospital room while

38
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,790
that one's being born.
Well,

39
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,791
somebody sent me a tweet and that tweet
is a link that shows in real time every

40
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:13,610
baby being born all around the world and
it is a fucking invasion.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,380
It is scary APP.
Yeah,

42
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,510
it is.
Like if Obama gave out his cell phone,

43
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,280
so it's like heaven.
It's just one baby baby baby,

44
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:22,851
baby,
baby.

45
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,230
Switzerland,
Africa,

46
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,490
Indonesia,
China,

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,100
Diana.
Nah,

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,690
Nah,
Nah,

49
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,820
Nah.
And that's just the reported babies.

50
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:32,450
That's not the little tikes shit out in
the bottom of a fucking grass hut in the

51
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,640
middle of the jungle.
No,

52
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,690
they didn't count those.
They only counted the ones.

53
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,610
The ones that are in the census.
Yeah,

54
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,130
I mean we'll look at that.
Those are the babies.

55
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,430
See those babies on both sides.
Holy Shit.

56
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,830
That's scary.
Isn't that incredible?

57
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,270
Yeah.
Those are all babies

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,400
deaths going about.
I don't see a lot of.

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,620
Yeah.

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,070
Second,
not a lot of us.

61
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:57,740
Birth most times that only google Dr.
Com.

62
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:58,730
That's all it is.
Well,

63
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,900
it's good.
Dr. Com,

64
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,630
black size hose.
So the stuff that we can see,

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,580
it's all like real blurry.
That's the other stuff.

66
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,580
Do you think this is what the NSA sees?
They see like every new human being

67
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,770
coming online?
Yeah.

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,750
The NSA is.
They're paying attention 24 hours a day

69
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,870
to every one of these babies.
Make sure they're not fucking doing

70
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:20,410
anything illegal,
so I'll get all these babies is crazy.

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,620
There's a fucking in.
You should have run out of oxygen or

72
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,260
something.
It's terrifying man and I don't see a

73
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,850
lot of American flags either.
Man.

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,480
I see a lot of those other countries
around the red Chinese flag.

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,950
That bothers me as an American.
I think we need to do our job and do

76
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,410
some more fucking.
Most of the deaths.

77
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,230
China is number one.
Most birth India.

78
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,940
Look at that.
It just stopped.

79
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,100
What if freaked out?
No,

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,100
because the computer crash.
No,

81
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,730
I just.
Well,

82
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:53,731
what if they just stopped having babies?
What if one day we went on that thing

83
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,660
and it was a day where there was no
babies.

84
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,460
Um,
so I did a podcast today with a guy from

85
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,830
cracked.com.
Dan O'brian are at a really funny book

86
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:05,831
called how to fight presidents.
He literally took every president in the

87
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:10,340
history of America to see who was the
baddest ass,

88
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:13,370
who's the one guy you wouldn't want to
fight and who would win in a fight if

89
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,660
they were pitted against each other.
It's like,

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,060
it's in some ways the greatest book of
all time.

91
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,800
And like I said,
I go,

92
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,300
this is the,
this is going to be the greatest

93
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,490
podcasts of all time.
It was the funniest thing because we got

94
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:27,491
into a heavy heated argument about who
would win in a fight and you got to put

95
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,660
a couple of presidents up at the top of
the list.

96
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:32,720
You got to put a blanket because he was
renowned for his physical strength.

97
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,940
There is.
He fought vampires to right?

98
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,133
Well,
he did,

99
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,550
but he used in the movie he used an ax,
but Abe Lincoln was 64 and had.

100
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,680
What's that disease where your arms are
longer,

101
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,560
you have really long arms,
like longer than your body had crazy one

102
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,030
and he was,
he was known to be really strong and

103
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,000
very,
very tough.

104
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,903
Acuity

105
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,710
was stable on the table.
I think you also have to think of people

106
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:58,460
that lived during that era.
There were a lot tougher period.

107
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,860
They grew up doing everything with their
hands,

108
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,780
right?
Building things.

109
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,500
So no,
that's not what we were talking about.

110
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,120
Were you talking about this?

111
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,250
So then he said,
I said,

112
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:08,190
what about Barack Obama?
And he got quiet it.

113
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,870
Dan's a comedian,
really good guy.

114
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,400
He got quiet and he said,
well,

115
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:12,280
I can't really,
you know,

116
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,650
I,
I'd rather leave that alone.

117
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:14,431
I said,
why?

118
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,330
He said,
well,

119
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,430
I try not to.
You try not to include any living

120
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,530
presidents because it caused too much
trouble.

121
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,000
I said,
what do you mean?

122
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,631
He said,
well,

123
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:25,830
I went through sort of a thing about how
Barack Obama's not that tough a

124
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:29,370
president and it'd be easy to kick his
ass and uh,

125
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,410
you know,
I was doing it tongue in cheek,

126
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,850
you know,
you'd probably kick him here and he's

127
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:37,170
kind of skinny and you could do and he
gets a call from the secret service

128
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,940
because he posted it as a blog.
He posted as a blog from cracked.com.

129
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,620
Well,
he said the reason,

130
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:47,880
the only blog that's not up there
anymore is that because he got called

131
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,040
down to the federal building,
I believe.

132
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,560
I think that's what he said.
It's on my podcast.

133
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,940
And he had to go line by line with these
agents on what he,

134
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,850
by what he was saying.
And he was like,

135
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,690
well,
I said,

136
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,830
you know,
I said,

137
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,400
Dick Tornado instead of a penis cycling,
because it's kind of funnier.

138
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,450
He was trying to teach them a humor.
These guys were totally fucked her list.

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,620
He got all nervous.
He was like apologizing.

140
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,010
He made them a to take it down and it
was a chapter that was isolated from the

141
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,730
book.
I'd be like,

142
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,860
so that I was like,
we live in America,

143
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,200
how now you have to be careful when
you've threatened to president,

144
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,730
you will get called.
But guys,

145
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,080
guys,
come on,

146
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,970
come on man.
I mean,

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,240
and,
and he took his job,

148
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,030
can't,
they probably can't.

149
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
Well,
they tell me no way to go.

150
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,000
Like,
yeah,

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,300
they probably knew.
Of course he's joking,

152
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,750
but there's a thing that you set in
motion a certain status.

153
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,700
What happens?
Because they said we will subpoena

154
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,360
everybody that made a comment on your,
on the blog,

155
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,960
kick his ass and,
and,

156
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,090
and,
and Dan said,

157
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,070
well,
it's a bunch of 14 year olds have fun

158
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:52,490
with that.
And the main guy had called them first.

159
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:53,000
He goes,
look,

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,890
I know you're kidding.
I know you got a sense of humor.

161
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,510
You've got to go down and talk to these
guys.

162
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,680
It's just the way it is,
pal.
