1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
Trying to watch it online. Yeah, stop
it. You don't need to look at us.

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:08,040
You fucking freak Spec on now.
Okay. Hi Ustream folks. Sorry.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,580
We're off air for a little bit
with the vagina light. Yeah,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,030
we missed the whole proof of concept.
We're working now,

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,220
you know behind the scenes type shit.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,510
Eliza and Heffron together might rule
the world with this artificial vagina

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:24,510
slash he's got to get half Ron.
Except you on a team though.

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:28,740
But I think I can broker that
deal. I appreciate, you know,

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,400
seen as you're both last comic standing
winners you're, you're already having in,

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,350
right? We have that bond. Unbreakable.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,360
Did you have to do the audition where
you only did stand up in front of the

12
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:43,850
judges and no audience? It wasn't
even, people don't get it. I,

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,140
my audition,
you walk into the judges aren't there.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,430
It was just like a producer's
assistants or like talent people.

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,820
They weren't even people you know and
you walk in, you pitch your, you know,

16
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,670
you do your joke. And I did. I talked
for about 15 seconds. She goes, yeah,

17
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,790
just come back this afternoon.
And then I came back and they were like,

18
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,330
you're not on the list.
I was like, yes I am.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,170
And all these people kept trying to come
back that weren't approved because it

20
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,220
was so disorganized.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,480
You had to go through like a couple of
rounds before he got to it that you went,

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,370
you went twice head the head. Right.
What does that mean? That's like they,

23
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,740
she got challenged at the end
where it was kind of like a,

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,420
you all live in the house you lived,

25
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,370
there's like 12 comics
at the end of the week.

26
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,980
Everybody pretty much votes who they
hate the most. And it was never me,

27
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,620
but they voted. If there was one
other girl, they voted on her.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,610
And then if you get voted off, you have
a chance to then challenge two comics.

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,630
So then the three of you do a show down
in front of a live audience and to get

30
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,980
kicked off and Wednesday.

31
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,430
So I won both weeks in a row because
everyone that got kicked off the house

32
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,110
would keep challenging
me and I kept winning.

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,300
That's the only reason I want to show.
Wow. So, so when someone challenges you,

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,690
how do they figure out who
wins? The audience decides
votes right then and there,

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,940
like a little button they
press or something. I think so.

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,640
I think that's how they
did it. Wow. And uh,

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,870
that's gotta be a weird way to do comedy.
It's comedy under the gun, you know,

38
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:00,840
that's kind of creepy if you,
if you're a competitive person,

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,270
which I wasn't until this or,
I mean,

40
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:07,020
I don't think playing Jv lacrosse counts
for anything. Uh, it's, it's great.

41
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,060
It's dormant. It was, it was, I mean,

42
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,310
I'd always played with people
that were better than me.

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,920
And then when you get to comedy, I had
never thought of comedy as a competition.

44
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:17,700
And now that's all I think of it as.
I'm super aggressive about it.

45
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,890
Why don't like you compete with yourself,

46
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:24,720
but it's game time to him.
Yeah.

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,840
Do you know whatever motivates you?
It's for some people it's done.

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,960
Some people get real competitive.
Some people,

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,170
I would never go up to someone
else. But you know, it's,

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,740
it's like before you play a sport,

51
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:38,010
like you psych yourself up and you get
out there and then you go for blood I

52
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,530
guess. Wow. That's an
interesting way of looking at it.

53
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,810
I saw you like two
weeks ago and there was,

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,170
I hadn't seen you before like for years,
like until that show,

55
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,520
like I hadn't seen it on stage recently,

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,090
but it was cool about it is that you
really have that vibe of the comedy store

57
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:55,110
and not many, uh, comics actually
carry some kind of vibe with it.

58
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,980
And when you watch you,
you could see the comedy store bribe.

59
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,010
It's the same reason Boston comics were

60
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,080
so good.
Yeah,

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,110
because there's so many hell rooms there
and you get used to that combat comedy

62
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,070
and the comedy store is combat comedy
defined. There is no organization there.

63
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:13,840
It's a chaos room. It's, the room itself
is an odd set up and it's, I come,

64
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,760
I like to think I cut my teeth on rooms
like the original room and then smaller,

65
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,060
tougher rooms not going to get anywhere
by going up in front of your four

66
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,370
friends and like people that
are laughing you for no reason.

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,310
So doing those bags and those tough
rooms where they just stare at you.

68
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,560
Some people don't speak
English, it prepares, it's
like swinging with two bats.

69
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,680
Yes, you're totally right.
When you go other places like
people are so much nicer,

70
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,710
so much about this store and all
the murder that's been committed.

71
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,360
There are a lot of period,
I don't know,

72
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,100
it was Bugsy Siegel's nightclub in like
the 30s or whenever that was and there

73
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,700
was like a bunch of people murdered
in that place. There was a horse.

74
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,990
Oh Co abortion. Illegal
abortions. This like nerdy.

75
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:54,240
People say they've heard babies crying
and like, wait a minute, wait a minute,

76
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,210
wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold
on a second. People are crazy.

77
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:02,290
I never heard anything about part of the
abortion backroom illegal abortions on

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,160
Bugsy Siegel days. Forties or 50s
oh my God. And they did in there,

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,250
right on the stage? No, no, no sage. But
it was like in the basement or something.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,580
No one ever goes in the basement.
Lies is just making shit up.

81
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,950
No, I'm not. I promise. Come on.

82
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,130
Is there any documentation and can we
find out about this online or is this just

83
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,560
Holly? I've never heard that
before. That's why I'm shocked.

84
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,380
I mean I've been around the store for a
long time. I'd never heard that story.

85
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:31,420
That's right.
I heard crazy stories though.

86
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,340
People are always talking about ghosts.
They're like,

87
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,490
when they do like haunted Hollywood shows,
they always include the comedy store.

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,710
Tell me about the guy that
always does it from the Formosa.

89
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,140
It's always on ie and he's always
kind of like a fat guy. That always,

90
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,360
I would say it's all bullshit except a
few people that have said they've seen

91
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,870
things are like really
cool guys like Blake Clark.

92
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,970
Blake Clark was a Vietnam vet and he was
a standup comic. He's seen some shit,

93
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,450
you know,

94
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,780
he's been around and he was working at
the comedy store one night and I didn't

95
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,600
hear the story directly from him
so I don't want to paraphrase it,

96
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,700
but in essence,
who's closing up?

97
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,640
And he went into the room and all of a
sudden there was someone there and he

98
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,780
starts talking to this person and uh,
he,

99
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,270
the person's not talking back to him
and then he realizes that some sort of a

100
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,000
ghost. And you know what? If you
ask him what that guy looks like,

101
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,490
other people will be able to
corroborate the same image.

102
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,170
A lot of people see the same
like in the belly or have,

103
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:24,070
I think it's a guy with like a top hat
or something. People see the same things.

104
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:27,340
A girl that did our show, I do a
Monday night show, their brand new,

105
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,600
never been their campus here friend.

106
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,630
She saw something and told one of
us on not privy to the story at all.

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,800
It sounds like it should be horse shit,

108
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,870
because every one of those
shows that you watch,

109
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,780
the problem is those goddamn shows,
you know,

110
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:44,140
it's like the create this artificial
environment and you gain old cameras and

111
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,080
lights and everything and you're growing
and looking for ghosts and you have to

112
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,130
find something in every episode
and you're just knocking.

113
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,630
There's not that many ghosts happening.
You know, if there are ghosts,

114
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,090
it's not enough that you're going
to get them on a television show.

115
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,010
We don't ever see them.
I don't know if it's real,

116
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,770
but I'm not willing to say that it's not,

117
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,220
I'm not willing to say there's no ghosts.
I don't.

118
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,260
So many people are full of shit. It's
tough. It's a tough conversation.

119
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,780
I can't fit. I don't think you
can beat my ghost theory though.

120
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:12,890
My theory is you find somebody that was
murdered like the midnight on Halloween

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,340
and you go to the, like the wife's grave,
you know, he's like a husband, wife thing,

122
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,540
and you just start making fun of her on
midnight and just go, hey goes, yeah,

123
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,840
I'm making fun of your dead wife.
Yeah, and nothing's going to happen.

124
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,370
That's my ghost though.

125
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,930
Maybe the ghosts recognize from the great
beyond that you're a douchebag above

126
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,640
this.
Respecting your murdered white

127
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,920
ghost has crossed over.
I don't think.

128
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,970
I think it's what people have when they
go sidings and all this and he was an

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,430
EVP or they do the white noise thing
goes that have a problem with mean.

130
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,620
Yeah.
What's it?

131
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:50,240
What were you like that movie white
noise where you can turn up the right and

132
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,650
you can hear the ghosts like talking.

133
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:56,540
It's like a thick lens flares that goes
to have a problem with the ones that

134
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,200
haven't crossed over the ones that are
stuck because they died prematurely or in

135
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,960
some sort of horrible accident.
That's if you will.

136
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:05,330
There's people that believe
that everything has a memory.

137
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,190
There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake,

138
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,250
I think he's an evolutionary biologist
and he has this theory that everything

139
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:17,260
has some sort of a memory
like furniture and houses.

140
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:20,120
They that even though you
can't really access it,

141
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,480
like the energy of the house
can be compromised by having
a lot of negative shit

142
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,550
happening. It's all energy. It's not

143
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,740
like the house becomes a creepy thing
like it has memory to it and that's

144
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:37,320
certainly what the store is when
you do like an exorcism or a sale,

145
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:38,890
if they ask for an object
or if you're in a Pluto,

146
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,140
it's an object from the person because
it has that energy or that's why if you,

147
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,450
if something comes out of a negative,

148
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:48,770
and I mean I totally buy into the whole
energy thing about not transferring like

149
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:51,900
negative energy and stuff.
And I do too if you like cooks you,

150
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:54,920
but that's what they say, Cook with love,
your love goes into it and you give it,

151
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:58,340
it's about that if you're in tune
to it, otherwise you just eat. Yeah,

152
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,260
no that totally makes sense.
That something,

153
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,650
I mean and if it goes along really with
the same idea that if everything has a

154
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:07,790
memory and if you're cooking with love
and then food has like a memory of your

155
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,520
love and you creating it,
people will like it more.

156
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,650
I sort of makes it sound totally Hippie,

157
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,880
but I should not eat so many lean pockets
cause what's, what's that doing to me?

158
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,170
All the cows torture,

159
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,150
torture or pigs are just stuffed in the
boxes for the heads are sideways for

160
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,340
half their life. It's so easy to love
Bacon. No, never had weekends. Awesome.

161
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:36,020
And pigs are cunts. Therein lies
the problem. Fuck pigs are assholes.

162
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,471
Pigs.

163
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:40,640
More people die from pigs and farms than
any other animal because people fall

164
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:44,000
into the pig. Sties and the pigs
just fucking eat them. Was that,

165
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,050
what movie was that snatch?
Yeah, that Shit's true.

166
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,240
I'll start of research. You
could have to that. That's me.

167
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,480
I'm fucking in the theater on my
blackberry writing research people and the

168
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,470
end of was at Hannibal.
We're the guy like the crippled guy.

169
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,370
They pushed him into the pigs and they
beat him up. Yeah. A lot of pig eating.

170
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:07,160
Yeah. That's some serious shit. Have you
seen people fuck pigs? So those videos of,

171
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,420
oh, the horrendous. So glad I came today.

172
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,080
Hall people fucking the
animal videos or her random.

173
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,150
I've never seen a video of anyone having
sex and I don't want to know, don't,

174
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,030
don't ever watch it,
but what you should see,

175
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:22,290
what everybody should see is a
documentary called zoo. Zoo is on,

176
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,250
there was a bunch of people that have
Zuph. I believe it's at proud zoophilia.

177
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,990
Is this where like sexually attractive?
No, no, no. They get fucked by horses.

178
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,590
Isn't that how like Catherine the great
died supposedly at the comedy store in

179
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,870
the belly room. Supposedly that's
how cats and their Greek God.

180
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,280
But we know for sure that there's one
guy died that way because a, it's,

181
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:50,460
it changed the law in Washington
state and Washington state.

182
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,130
It used to be legal to have
sex with animals mandatory.

183
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,070
You got gotta do what you gotta do.
You're stuck in Seattle.

184
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,350
But a bunch of people decided to
move there from all over the country.

185
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,070
They met on an internet message board and
they moved there and started like this

186
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,130
whole farm community thing where
they got fucked by animals.

187
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,660
Like there was like a whole bunch of
freaks that like found themselves.

188
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:17,580
They found themselves a
friend. We're getting boned
by. There's a horse. Yes. Look,

189
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,270
the guy had like blonde hair. I have
seen that. I saw a clip of that. Yeah,

190
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:25,620
and the Mr Hands is the video pony
bite her and she like likes it when he,

191
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,070
the pony by May. This is a different one.
That's a different one. It can't be too,

192
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,830
yeah, no, there's a bunch.
There's over. I don't know.

193
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,180
I don't necessarily think so,
but it's kind of fucked up.

194
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,400
I mean it just seems unnatural for sure.

195
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:41,850
It seems like you were indulging the
worst and human spirit. You know the idea.

196
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:45,090
You just want to just exploit animals
and have them fucking in the ass all the

197
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:49,950
time. Yeah. He got, he got broken
like broken open and bled out.

198
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:53,250
The Guy who died, what are you
going to go on to do? It's like,

199
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:55,650
well you subsect of the animals and
now I work at the Verizon store.

200
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,850
Well that's a thing. He was like, fuck,

201
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,750
I wish I remembered what he did.
I think he was an architect.

202
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,420
I mean he was like an
intelligent guy apparently.

203
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,110
Let me find out because this is just to,
uh,

204
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,630
to important in line between
intelligence and absolute insanity.

205
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,680
And the line is a horse cock
dog doesn't like this part.

206
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,160
What a horrendous way to die.
That ribbon, she removed it.

207
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,350
That ribbon or what does that went
around the cane. That's dessert. Oh,

208
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,130
she's saving? Yeah, that's peppermint. God
bless your heart a little after dinner.

209
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:33,060
Mint. So you gave up on the droid
completely. Oh, you follow that?

210
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,160
What happened there? I can't find,
started doing weird things. Right.

211
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,540
And so I was like, screw it. I'm
going to go with a droid just to try.

212
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,860
Because I used to have a tree. I missed
the touchscreen. Right. All these things.

213
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,850
It was too much and there are all these
problems. It could have made calls.

214
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:51,270
It made weird sounding calls. It was all
like warble note. Anyways, so I went,

215
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,070
I was on,
my breaking point was no one could hear

216
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,800
me on the phone, but I was
on the phone yesterday. Yeah.

217
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,400
Five times during a phone call.

218
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,570
My face somehow dialed someone else and
it starts ringing as I'm speaking to

219
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:04,960
someone else. Like three Wade.
Yeah. Who needs that? Yeah,

220
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,410
like the droid enables you to call
people you don't want to. So I just,

221
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,470
I was like, I'm done. I want
this for free. And so I got
the brand new blackberry.

222
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,650
Not Brand new, but you know what's
weird about Black Berry owners though?

223
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,620
I don't know if they know this and Joe,
you,

224
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:21,040
yours does this every time you text me
on your blackberry is that if I replies,

225
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,550
it replies, what? I texted you
every time you text me back.

226
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,490
So it's like you get like three texts.
He,

227
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,490
it's like it's reading like
emails style. No, it's like,

228
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,910
it's just crazy how much it
has to be a setting, like a,

229
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,680
some kind of setting in your textbook.
And it's called sock. I love my,

230
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:41,950
I will give up touchscreen any day. I'm,
I can't leave. I left my blackberry.

231
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm never living in again. Sorry. My phone
is the shit, but 18 ticks sucks it. Why?

232
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:49,180
Why, why, why don't you go to the iPhone?
You seem very apple friendly. I Eliza,

233
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,550
it's my parents. Got It. Who, uh,
I love the, I love the iPhone.

234
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,980
I don't want it. I want a
keyboard. I want a full keyboard.

235
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:00,490
I don't want my face fucking with my phone
calls. Right. As I found out yesterday.

236
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,790
Hmm. It fucks with it that
much. Huh? Five Times.

237
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,790
And it was a very important
gossip conversation. Dan.

238
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,650
Me and my friends are defending a friend
in real life, so it was very important.

239
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:15,470
The iPhone doesn't do that
though. The iPhone doesn't
hang up on your face. No. No,

240
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,020
not how can you not because,

241
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,590
because it detects when your face as
close and it turns it off. The droid does.

242
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,460
Lau. Droid does. It didn't and
maybe there's a mode for it,

243
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,380
but the iPhone doesn't have
the full keyboard. Yeah.

244
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,310
But you can get more than one plaid cover.

245
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,410
That's pretty, they have that though.
They, they definitely have that. Whatever.

246
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,490
I want. God, if I, if I just, you know,

247
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,080
I use the iPhone more of like as a like
an internet device. Yeah. Do as a phone.

248
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,590
Am I get an eye touch? Yeah. If I was
a producer on the road a lot this year,

249
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:46,850
just so I can have something cause this
is not great with those are pretty slick.

250
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,340
The, especially the three g one
where you can pull up anywhere. Yeah.

251
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,990
It's pretty nice. I like that
fucking technology bitches. Yeah.

252
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,180
So that they've found some tools that
indicate that human beings were traveling

253
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:04,080
by boat more than 150 in as
much as 700,000 years ago.

254
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,810
Wow. Because a, there's an island,

255
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,890
I believe the island is Crete and
they found these fucking tools.

256
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,190
There's a hold on. He's
found these tools. Yeah.

257
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,050
They found tools that were way, well,
creed has been separate from, uh,

258
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,290
from the mainland by 40 miles
for over 5 million years.

259
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,280
So the fact that they found
tools there 700,000 years ago,

260
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,330
I mean somehow or another,

261
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:30,900
someone got there in a fucking boat
or when it was a part of the world,

262
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:34,560
like Pangea, when it was all together,
people were there and then it split off.

263
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,010
How's that foot? That's 5
million years. You need carbs.

264
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,520
Supposedly 5 million years.
People weren't around. You know,

265
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,140
so what they're saying is if this island
was 500 or 5 million years separate

266
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,930
from everybody else and nothing
developed on this island,

267
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,120
but otherwise it'd have
to be like parallel,

268
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,900
right. I believe in that
really. Absolutely. If you
have parallel thought process,

269
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:00,170
how can having you not a parallel
evolution like separate groups of people

270
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,440
developed on this island or like when
you come up with the same joke as someone

271
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:08,190
else and they totally, Sam, I hear you.
It's totally, this is totally the same.

272
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,510
I should talkative guy. This is, that
is a, is a fascinating subject though.

273
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,600
It's been fascinating to
me. Well, I think, uh,

274
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,870
like they always taught us that
Christopher Columbus came America first.

275
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,870
We were like dead last.
The Chinese were here before.

276
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,420
They use Chinese maps to
come here in the first place.

277
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:24,650
Like they were your way before.

278
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,290
So what you're seeing what your
textbook wants you to believe.

279
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,260
They found the oldest human
being in North America,

280
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,950
the bones they found was a Chinese guy.
Yup. There you go. 10,000 years old.

281
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,720
So that's even not even predates
the American Indian. I'm that crazy.

282
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,910
Can we pay reparations to
the wrong group? Well, you,

283
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,740
American Indians came from Asia to that's,

284
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,580
that's one thing they found out like def
definitively because this Mormon dude

285
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:51,110
was trying to do a genealogy tests on
American Indians because he wanted to

286
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:55,640
prove that American Indians
were Israelites and that
they had come here and this

287
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:59,150
would prove the Mormon text to be correct
Israel. That's what everybody thinks.

288
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:02,750
That was the idea. Yeah. So,
but they tested them. They,

289
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,360
when they tested American Indians there,

290
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,330
they'd come from Siberia because what
comes from the Bering Strait? Yeah,

291
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,020
a crossover when it was all on Alaska.
It's a that's fascinating shit.

292
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,130
You know what I mean? When I said
that, um, that the Chinese were first.

293
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:20,090
I don't think that's true. I think maybe
the American Indians were here like,

294
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,550
I think they crossed that
before 10,000 years ago.

295
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,790
I think there are probably here first,
but just the idea that here any,

296
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,650
I mean a bunch of it, a bunch of what
people are here. They fucking walked here.

297
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,060
They've walked here from
another continent. Yeah.
But not in one lifetime. No.

298
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,630
But it,
they took a groups of humans over time,

299
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:43,250
walk through like insanely cold,
harsh environments and got tow.

300
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,880
Erica got gotta be warm or somewhere.
It's fucking crazy.

301
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,110
I love that kind of stuff
cause you imagine if you had
to go back in time and no

302
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,200
one even was even riding horses yet and
you're like, what are we going to do?

303
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:57,320
We get to walk everywhere.
Don't you have like a,

304
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,930
you have a bit of a
brilliant bit about this,

305
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,930
about like what will we do with all the
lights went out? Like I can't make shit.

306
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,880
That's the only time I've
ever seen you in person.

307
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,110
I think you did a show at red rock.

308
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,100
It's the first time I ever met you as a
long time ago. Oh Wow. I remember that.

309
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,950
That was only one thing. I went on a four
year or something. And you did that bad.

310
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,410
I thought it was, I thought it was
very smart and so funny. Thank you.

311
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,500
That's all I got. I
remember that now. Yeah.

312
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:23,060
That's the idea is that people are
getting dumber as technology gets more and

313
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:27,170
more powerful. There's people that have
less and less resources of their own,

314
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,970
less and less ability to do things.

315
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,710
No littler and littler every year about
what makes everything work. You know,

316
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:37,000
in the 50s like if a guy broke down
on the side of the road, I look,

317
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,670
I would pull over and knew how to fix
your fucking car. Right? You know,

318
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,530
you've got a broken belt here, buddy.
Let's go get a belt for you. And you know,

319
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,190
you know that shit could work.
You could do that. Now if you're,

320
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,180
you're fucking Ford,

321
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:50,010
that crazy car you got that thing
breaks down the side of the road with

322
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,960
all the electronics and shit,
it won't start.

323
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,870
Nobody knows what the fuck
is going on in the day.

324
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:57,720
You know what is interesting about that?
Unless you don't have higher education,

325
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,170
then you're more likely to become a
mechanic or someone that knows about cars.

326
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:02,040
The more education you get,

327
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:06,360
the further removed you are from what
makes the world tick mechanically. Yeah,

328
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,450
that's true.
But what I'm saying is that most people,

329
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:14,000
like there's a general knowledge
that's missing. I agree. And American.

330
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,670
Don't touch my fucking cars when you
touch your car and do you ever have to

331
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,820
bring it into the shop and they fix it
and the check engine light lawn for like

332
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,220
two months.
I grew up here.

333
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,470
I grew up never ever using a card,
like a place that worked,

334
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,150
fix her car ever up to,

335
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,270
I moved here in California because
my dad like every time it broke down,

336
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,931
he's like,
all right,

337
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:34,300
we got to go get a new engine and
I'm gonna show you how to do it.

338
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,730
And like I had to Redo
that whole car. Yeah. But,

339
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,030
but that's crazy now because
now I have to do that.

340
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:43,570
I had to drop off my car the other
day and it was like an oil change.

341
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,140
It was four hours for an oil
change at this Ford dealer.

342
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,480
And they actually have a restaurant
inside the Ford dealer called like the,

343
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,863
I forget what it's called,

344
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,320
but you order food and the
Bacon looks like seat covers.

345
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,280
It's just like really long rectangle
or why can't I use a Jiffy Lube or

346
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:03,180
something? Why don't you
go to Jeff? Because, no,

347
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,650
I think it's something like if you
have a and you're under warranty,

348
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:09,550
you're supposed to take it to the dealer,
you know, just in case. So. Well No, no.

349
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,980
So the warranty,
if there's anything ever wrong with it,

350
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:15,780
they can't blame somebody
else. What I mean, yeah.

351
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,420
Jiffy Lube is the shit. Oh yeah. I
liked him for the pope and 10 done.

352
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,660
My friend's car got fucked up by Jiffy
Lube. They didn't, they stripped the uh,

353
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,410
oil uh, oil back in cause they use those
things like you know, things real quick.

354
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,980
And if they put it in wrong cause they're
doing cars all day long, you know,

355
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:36,010
it's strips it and then he just, his
car leaked oil for the rest of his car.

356
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:36,980
It was like a brand new car

357
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,460
died was off on his comedy is dead.
I am always the basement.

358
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,870
How they can always get me to buy new air
filter for my air conditioner go dirty.

359
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,070
It is, I'm like, it's a filter.

360
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,830
It's supposed to be dirty and just
take a hose to try it. I don't want it.

361
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,790
I don't want to die either. Fix
that shit. What are you going to do?

362
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,200
That fluid in there? Yeah. Do that
shit with the the red stuff. Yeah,

363
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,810
but those filters you just spray out and
that's all you need to do that either.

364
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,540
Then they started talking
transmission fluid and shit like that.

365
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,900
Then you're like, listen kid, you know
you don't know what the fuck you're doing.

366
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,580
Get out of that transmission.
If you tell me I need it.

367
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,220
If there's something I don't know about,
I'm that girl.

368
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,040
I wonder how many people get shit
done to their car every year.

369
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,520
They don't really need just because
someone wants to make you on my car cause

370
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:21,360
they said I needed it.

371
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,330
Balls that big Porsche wings.
It was English.

372
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,850
That's what I want.
A car with a wing on the back of it.

373
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,510
Literally walk into a store like
a makeup store and she'd be like,

374
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:36,930
what do I need and let them sell to me.
I don't give a fuck and I'll buy it.

375
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,110
I don't even wear that much makeup. I just
like to have it. I will buy everything.

376
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,180
Food.
I'm an easy target.

377
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,810
Yo, have you seen this homeless man
guy from Columbus, Ohio? This is, no,

378
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,980
this is amazing. Yeah, I keep hearing

379
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,710
about it. So I have not seen check, check
this out. I tried to show it to you,

380
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:53,380
but what it is, it's a home.
My hometown, Columbus, Ohio.

381
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,530
This homeless guy held up a
sign and I said that, you know,

382
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,700
I can do voices for food
or money or whatever. Yeah,
totally not that right. Yeah,

383
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,890
it looks exactly like

384
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,520
freeway exit ramps.

385
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,660
But recently there's been this guy with
an interesting sign in [inaudible] 71

386
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,560
and Hudson street.

387
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,130
His handwritten signs says he has
the God given gift of a great voice.

388
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,870
Hey,
we're gonna make you work for your dollar.

389
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,580
Say something with that great radio Voice.

390
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,890
You're listening to nothing
but the best of all these.

391
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:29,360
You're listening to magic 98.9
so much.

392
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,010
God bless you. Whoa. And we'll be back
with more right after these words.

393
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,260
And don't forget tomorrow morning is your
chance to win a pair of tickets to see

394
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:43,670
this man live in concert.
Thank you so much.

395
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,840
Mona was 14 years old. I was
born and raised in Brooklyn,
New York when I was 14,

396
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:52,640
I kind of listen to one of our
area radio announcers and uh,

397
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,100
as a field trip to go meet the guy.

398
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,280
And he looked nothing
like what he sounded like.

399
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:01,100
So I asked him about that
and he said to me, listen,

400
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:04,090
radio is defined theater of mine.

401
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,390
And so when he said theater of
mine, I just said, well, hey,

402
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,630
I can't be an actor at camp,
be an on air personality.

403
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:13,420
But the voice just became something of a,

404
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,970
of a development over years
and then went to school for it.

405
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,320
And then alcohol and drugs and a few
other things became a part of my life.

406
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,140
I got two years clean and I'm trying hard
to get it back and hopefully somebody

407
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:28,110
from one of these television
or radio thing, hey,

408
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,830
I need a voiceover or I need
something. So, you know,

409
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:37,120
I'm hoping one day watch family
guy weeknights at seven 30 on Fox,

410
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,110
20 year anything. But that's what
it is. And I love radio. Okay.

411
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,540
Yeah, I got sad at the end and
the beginning was kind of Nice.

412
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,010
Beginning was actually cool.
If that was a 15 second clip,

413
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,850
it will be the shit got weird. Who
greets those signs? That's smart.

414
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,220
That's really small.
The worst. That's when,

415
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,610
when it's the couple like it
looks like that, you know,

416
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,620
they just do math together and they're
just living on the road and have like a

417
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:04,830
bowling ball bag and the
worst is when they have a dog.

418
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,090
Isn't that awful that the dog is what
touches your heartstrings? That person,

419
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:10,470
but I totally fucking dark.
If they had a kid,

420
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,360
probably the kid would get taken away.

421
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,470
Someone protective services would come
and take the kid away most likely. Right.

422
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,420
I mean, you can't have a
kid and be homeless. Kenya,

423
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,740
I saw an episode of law and order
the election you of Oh my God.

424
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,320
Yeah. Madness. It gets enough box at
that kid knows how to change a tire,

425
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,660
eat a tire to how to cook a
tire. Well, that guy was like,

426
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:36,550
I noticed that the guidance sound or
anything like he looked, I'm like,

427
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:39,990
I felt like he was going to be like, I
was white, so I went out, died my skin,

428
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,340
got my nose clean. To do when you're
homeless is to have a gimmick.

429
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,610
Isn't it amazing that voice is like,

430
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,630
it's like a tool almost like the DJ voice.
Like it's such a uh,

431
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,700
an affection that you take
on when you talk like a Dj.

432
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:59,690
Here we go. You know,
it's like something to it.

433
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,980
It's creepy though.
What have you done for me lately?

434
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,130
That's like an old radius
thing. That's like a dying
sound. Probably though. Is it?

435
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,150
Because podcasts, podcasts don't do
that. There's not like the guy gets it.

436
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,290
Hey there. Hey, we should do that. We
should do a podcast and a DJ voice.

437
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,700
You're listening to red by radio.
Hey you, here we go. All right.

438
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,900
It's also the Strip club Dj. They're very
similar. This is this the same voice,

439
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,070
but with a couple of drinks.

440
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Denver has your approval
Lexus to the main stage.

441
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,740
It's like the same guy over, especially
in La are, so I have a bit about this,

442
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:43,220
which I'm not going into.
They're so ignorant sounding.

443
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,920
There's this one I listen to like the
hip hop stations and I don't know if he's

444
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:49,730
like Latino or what. He's like, y'all,
you guide, get your ad Oh insurance.

445
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:53,870
And I'm like, why does that, the word
is auto. And it's always like, Yo,

446
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,410
after you motherfuckers, if they want
insurance, y'all gotta get down there.

447
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,600
And I'm like,
you are just spreading ignorance.

448
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,650
Like people think it's okay to get a
job and you're yelling at me and you're

449
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:06,290
mispronouncing everything
and have it in Spanish.

450
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,000
I know how to speak Spanish
properly speaking to their people,

451
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,030
Chichi that there's, there's a lot
of them as well. It's not that,

452
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,350
it's just so wouldn't, if
you're, if you're fine,

453
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,860
let's say you're La Rasa and
you're going to community college,

454
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:24,950
you're going to school or you're trying
to get a better education and this is

455
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:28,820
what, this is what your people are telling
you, it's okay to sound like sort of,

456
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,600
maybe they're just hanging out, you know?
Maybe that's just the way they talk.

457
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,790
Yeah, it's, I, I know what you're saying.

458
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,200
I do agree that maybe you should
have like better English and stuff,

459
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:45,710
but you know if you know
what the fuck he's saying,

460
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,500
we're not saying anything.
They're not saying no,

461
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,550
they're not talking about the news. It's
just like, Yo, boost mobile. That no way.

462
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,170
That not ghetto.
I like it.

463
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,230
I want to make sure there's a few ghetto
stations around so I can listen to them.

464
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:00,140
I like it because that's just connected
to like remember that old video with the

465
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:04,850
leper confound found in the
tree. I remember finding
this. Yeah. Have you seen,

466
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,340
oh, this is from like four years
because you will remember this.

467
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:10,820
Once you see this Leprechaun, a bunch
of people are going to be tweeting me.

468
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,520
They think I'm racist after this.
Y'All can eat it

469
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,500
in Alabama yet, but it's called
Leprechaun in Alabama and they found this.

470
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:19,460
Let me know what you're saying.

471
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,430
You're saying that people should speak
like they're educated and set a good

472
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:25,970
example. You should know what you're
saying is you're going to say anything.

473
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:28,910
I'm never going to listen to you because
you sound, what I'm saying is I'm,

474
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:29,900
everybody's different.

475
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,460
I like watching people and listening
to people that are nothing like me,

476
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,460
you know? So I like listening
to ghetto shows. No other games.

477
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,630
I like listening to them on the radio too.
That's what they want to talk.

478
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,830
They don't have to say anything.
Listen to that shit.

479
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,870
This is the leprechaun cheap.
That's what I'm saying.

480
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,940
As a peer with 99.6 we went back
would also force of fresh tunes.

481
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,310
I got to make a point for a
living and they can just blabber.

482
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,450
Yeah but that's what the Jew,

483
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,330
I mean nobody wants to hear a
point in between their songs.

484
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,600
I don't remember anything. I
just want you to music. I miss.

485
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,960
I Miss Real Dj's. Curiosity
leads to large crowds in mobiles.

486
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,930
Tritan mini have you bring binoculars,
Ken quarters,

487
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,010
even camera phones to take pictures to
me and the lack of level coding to me.

488
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,420
Tell your friends to go be the chief

489
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,270
cause that Yay

490
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,220
the Leprechaun only comes out.
It gets better.

491
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,030
If you shine a light in its direction,
its suddenly disappears.

492
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,010
This sketch resembles what many of you
are saying. The leprechaun looks high,

493
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,450
hard to believe and have come up with
their own theories and exit this real.

494
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,323
The image

495
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,230
theory is casting a shadow from.
Do they show it Liam?

496
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,650
Oh, oh, oh,

497
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,630
oh know aren't going to know faster

498
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,860
around stove and it told me get
up in a tree at play a Leprechaun.

499
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,880
Would you buy me a joint?
I England.

500
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,120
[inaudible] a jar a week.

501
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,090
You have better language,
better action,

502
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,270
more activities and more individual.

503
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,710
It's the guys on the radio and I would
point is Bella social lab is bad.

504
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:26,670
The real action? No by no
clown. Is Bush more enjoyable,

505
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,940
more enjoyable?
We don't get down to the bottom.

506
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,150
This is not the news anymore.

507
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,180
This is like a remix version of it
though. This is bullshit. You're fucking

508
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,780
with the Leprechaun.

509
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,060
He suited up from him was
all smells right here.

510
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,490
What's this is this liberal
curve probably slowed him down.

511
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,400
This is Nicholas.

512
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,580
We can having an aneurysm as we fucked
up and pick the wrong youtube video.

513
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,030
All right. And this is what's
called poor prior planning. So,

514
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,950
but there was there a real,
a real true story.

515
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,830
There was a real story that people
thought there was 11. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

516
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,590
That was really, that was a mixed
in with like complete craziness.

517
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,890
That's know what's real though, man.
Well they haven't, that was rendering.

518
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:13,990
You know what? This has probably,
I'll tell you what it is, man.

519
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,140
This is probably a real
fucking Leprechaun. And this
is the disinformation. Yeah.

520
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:19,540
Government puts out of the Leprechaun.

521
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,760
Yeah. Fallen birds. Big It out dog.
What is your speeches over there?

522
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,880
Blanche,
she's under your desk following.

523
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,300
I want to make sure we can get
in my letterbox. She won't.

524
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,620
I think I shut the door. I don't
know. Blanche come here. Come here.

525
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:35,240
I've got something for you. What is
it? Sharon know she doesn't want this.

526
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,850
Is this a stereotype? Pretty girl with
a little dog cause she's not little.

527
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:43,330
She actually is. She's quite
heavy. Yeah, she's like 13 pounds.

528
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,960
And I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with it. She's chill as fuck. Uh,

529
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,190
you don't ever bring that dog to like
the mall Dhea. You're, you do that?

530
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,930
I'd bring her everywhere,
but there's not a cute bag.

531
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:55,720
It's this big like over the shoulder
baffled bag, like a duffle bag.

532
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,300
Like she's like a basketball player.
You use it.

533
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:02,170
Is this like a crazy special bond that
you have with a dog when you adopted dog?

534
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,500
Cause that dog's life could have
been super fucked up. Super fucked.

535
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:09,400
It could have been shit. I mean, you
never know. She could have been put down.

536
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,410
She needs anything can happen. But you
came along and got her and I, she gets,

537
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:16,510
she's very needy. She gets upset
if I leave. So I take her off.

538
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,680
Work is not a problem and she's not little
enough to be annoying and I'm not hot

539
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:24,550
enough to be annoying
about it. So it's okay.

540
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,210
What do this dogs or fucking fascinating
animals. A dog chew gum. Yeah.

541
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,300
Let, why don't you go the fuck dogs
love gum. They actually chew it.

542
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,910
That's not good for your dog. Why? Why?
Why? Why would it be round about this? No,

543
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,930
that's not right.
Don't get caught your dog though.

544
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:43,330
Eating chewing gum and it's just
like, oh, what are you eating?

545
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,530
And I'm laying around on the floor.
You fucking Slob. Yeah, it dogs eat.

546
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,130
No price is leave it everywhere.

547
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,120
My dogs really like it just gets on top
of things and gets on top of my coffee

548
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:58,710
table now or whatever. Oh really
good. You got a set of rules son.

549
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,730
You gotta be Alpha about that Shit.

550
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,750
Even with little dogs there's just
certain shit you shouldn't have them do.

551
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:07,180
It shouldn't be walking where you eat.
Exactly what their dirty shit.

552
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,880
I like how you said to go walking where
I eat the like everyone eats at the

553
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:13,620
coffee table and now have you noticed
like the kitchen table is like it's

554
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,210
getting phased out?
No.

555
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,800
To put on families like you eat at the
table with your kitty to the table table.

556
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,670
Really? We don't need it to,
you're like perpetual single guy.

557
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,200
Maybe he got a table that you don't
want to talk about that now. No,

558
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,990
you're always to go
single again. Watch out.

559
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,860
We should play that Pat Song Prince Song.
I've got a broken heart again,

560
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,730
once you pull it up, Brian,
I need to talk. We sad. No,

561
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,760
Brian has got to learn to once a again,
I got a broke out. A broken heart again,

562
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,570
bitchy girls. Is that the problem?
It's just a nice, yeah. Yeah.

563
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,690
He's a nice guy. Nice guy. I don't think
he's too nice. He's just, you know,

564
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:01,120
it slap him or you gotta write,
you gotta get the right combination.

565
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,560
I don't have it.
That's the whole key to relationships.

566
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,650
Not necessarily that you're
wrong and that person's,

567
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,760
the person that you got along with. This
is wrong. It's like the combinations off.

568
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,390
Some people would go great
with some one person,

569
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,580
but with other people
that clash and it's just,

570
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,270
everybody's got to find that on my brand.
Like chemistry. It's all about Brian.

571
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,250
It's not just about bodies, men. It's
about the person behind the body.

572
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,810
Sounds depressing. My dog got to
concentrate on the sole. Brian,

573
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,800
you've got to concentrate on being real
with these bitches and find one who is

574
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:36,500
willing to be real with you back.
See what I'm saying, Bro. Yeah,

575
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,030
you gotta tap deep into it.
Hang on. Wait a second. Get to,

576
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,460
it's real good to what's real.
And if they're not giving you the real,

577
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,360
then you give him the pen pal.
I get it. Give him the Heisman.

578
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:50,600
He go step out of my life. I see what
you're dealing with. Times of port.

579
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,170
Thanks for talking to me.
Let's get a check. A traffic.

580
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,300
Alright, here's Bob or the
midway. What's going on Bob?

581
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,850
We have a slowed down at the five.
You know,

582
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:05,390
I noticed today driving here that
if I wanted to be a gardener,

583
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,860
all I would have to do is walk down
the highway. I would find shoes, hats,

584
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,720
rakes, garbage bags. Like there was like
so much shit on the side of the road.

585
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,630
Have you noticed how much
crap is on our highways?

586
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:20,570
Like ridiculous things
like couches and chairs.

587
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:23,090
And is it because you think
they're not cleaning up as much?

588
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,510
I think it's all these landscaper guys
that just have those trucks that have

589
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:29,690
like all the shit in the back,
you know where there's just falls off.

590
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,850
I'm waiting for it.
Right.

591
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,810
I'm waiting for a rape to come
right through my windshield.

592
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:37,811
I ran over a railroad tie
once a big metal railroad tie,

593
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,460
you know those big
fucking things that like,

594
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,390
yeah know in movies get crushed
on empire. I'm sorry. Not a tie.

595
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:49,240
The Gay bar, the bar, the
middle bar or a bar. The Bar,

596
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,630
wherever that the railroad track
goes on a track. Oh my God.

597
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,710
We're all retarded part of the
rabbit with the tail. The metal shit.

598
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,490
The metal shed bro.
Fucking long thing that the wheel rolls.

599
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,280
I thought you were talking
about the state. Nope. No,
no, no. It was a bigger one.

600
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,160
Or are you talking about the state?
No, no, no. I'm just kidding.

601
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:12,260
Do you guys track this railroad? Right?
Not a tie. I said ty, incorrect word.

602
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,450
What I meant is a,
a section of track.

603
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:18,590
It was like a big ass fucking giant hunk
of metal and I'm driving on the highway

604
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:21,440
and all of a sudden I,
I see it before it's too late.

605
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:26,470
There's nothing I could do and Bob by
hit it and it just tears my wheel apart.

606
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,110
Smashes, it tears the wheat,
the tire off the wheel.

607
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,290
And I had to make a decision and I said,
you know what?

608
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,850
I'm just going to drive
on this fucking thing.

609
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,380
I'm not getting out on the highway and
like risking getting hit by some fucking

610
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,190
car. I'm like, I'm going
to cook this car, you know,

611
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,380
I'm just going to drive in this fucked
up wheel and cook this car. And it was,

612
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,380
sparks were flying and
shit and smoke and it was,

613
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,440
it was nuts because it
was like half of a wheel.

614
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,170
It was like half a wheel
in this fucked up time.

615
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,580
And I'm going like literally
you have far to go? Yeah.

616
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,500
I have like almost a almost a mile deep.

617
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:04,850
Did you binge it rims locked.car up I
how to get a bunch of shit done to it

618
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:07,580
after it's over. Yeah. But you
know what is better than me dying.

619
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,990
That's what I thought of. I, there's
a kid I went to high school with it.

620
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,410
It was changing his tire off the side
of the road and somebody hit the car and

621
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:15,730
killed him. Why you shouldn't
change your on tires. Well,

622
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,520
but have you been watching
horror movies lately?

623
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,130
It's always the girl getting her flat
tire and waiting for the guy to fix it.

624
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,580
Girls take 10 minutes out of your time.
Find out figuring out how to do it.

625
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,580
Just in case of emergency,
you don't want to be calling these times.

626
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:32,510
It's a physical, so truck drivers trying
to get those fucking wheels off, bro.

627
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:37,040
Those those times, sometimes it's really
hard. Sometimes it's hard for a man,

628
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,720
like a big man to get your
your fucking bolts loose.

629
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,020
I'm the first ask others for help.
Nobody would attempt stuff.

630
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,390
Sometimes it's a payment you should try.

631
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,990
You should learn how to do it if you
can, but fuck man, you can do it fast.

632
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,670
It's pretty easy.

633
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,140
[inaudible] I guarantee you some bolts
that you would not be able to crack.

634
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,360
I've been in.
I could look at you.

635
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,840
You've just rose up like a man and puffed
a chance. Never had a problem ever.

636
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,580
I love it. I've never had a
problem ever changed a tire ever.

637
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,460
Really awesome. Easy. Wow.
Between the two of you.

638
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:09,630
Who Do you just have to use the retard
strength like okay I got to do it.

639
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,520
I mean sorry,
not retard strength.

640
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,880
I changed a lot of tires when I was
a kid but I stopped a long time ago.

641
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,190
I forgot everything that's involved in it,

642
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,310
but when I was in auto shop in high
school we listed though it used to change

643
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,710
tires like you know, do you use
that fucking stupid machine cause

644
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:29,330
I know that moves the tire in
place and put the weights on it.

645
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,150
It was kind of kind of interesting
stuff but I forgot all of it.

646
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,710
We had this shot,

647
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:39,540
this a teacher in auto shop that all he
would do was fix up shitty old mustangs.

648
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,150
I wish I could remember his name
because he was a real character.

649
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,800
It's probably on Facebook. Probably
Facebook me Bro. You remember me?

650
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:50,480
I remember you. I just forgot your
name and he, he's probably dead by now.

651
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,110
I didn't want make you feel old. It
is. No, no. Getting away from it.

652
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,910
Every year I get a little older.

653
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,890
I hate when I think of like an
old actor that I think is dead.

654
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:05,940
And then I go and find out that he
has like a Facebook and a website.

655
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:10,410
Remember that shit? What? Jonathan Winters
the other day I was like, oh, he's dead.

656
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,950
He's still alive. He's still alive.
He's got fucking CDs coming out.

657
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:17,130
He's got paintings. He's got it
like a website. It's hard to keep,

658
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:19,050
a lot of people die.
It's hard to keep track of.

659
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,550
Jonathan Winters used to be on all the
time back in the day that he just kind of

660
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,540
remember like knew who Jonathan Winters.
Sure. Yeah. He was the guy who used to,

661
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,320
he used to guest on Mork and Mindy,
Remember Douglas?

662
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,460
Kirk Douglas, I think is dead. Oh,
Michael Douglas. Michael Douglas is,

663
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,830
I don't, I don't know. Right, right.

664
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,130
Kate,
why our queue with a capital k,

665
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:54,690
capital t k just so, uh,
you're from Dallas, right? Yes.

666
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,790
Four years old. He's alive.
Wow. I just won $20. Holy Shit.

667
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,600
Did you ever go on the Aleks and Terry
show down there or do you know those guys?

668
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,260
I do know that name. Uh, I'm not,
I didn't do standup and Dallas.

669
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,390
I've done it since, but
I didn't, I never did it.

670
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:13,610
I went to college in Boston and we sweat
this real name. You ready for this?

671
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,180
This is, this is Kirk Douglas.
His real name. It's, is it Jewish?

672
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:22,140
Is that what it is? It's is sir. I S. S.

673
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,470
U R is Sir Denea low vich.

674
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,650
That's his real name. It just rolls off
the tongue. I can see why he chose. Oh,

675
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,750
vich. Wow. It says it in Russian letters.

676
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,440
Is it on Wikipedia?
Yeah.

677
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,860
What would you like if you had to change
your name because he had it fucked up

678
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:42,190
named like that. What would you change
it to if it kind of just Darth Vader? No,

679
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:44,040
like seriously.
I will change my name to Darth Vader.

680
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,790
Would your backup name be like a real
name? Luke Skywalker? No. It'd be like,

681
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,800
it'd be like Lance Kenobi bitch.
That would be my full name. Yeah.

682
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,750
I don't know anything about cars
or star wars. No, you don't.

683
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,460
I got Kevin James had to do that too.
Well, I don't want to say his last name.

684
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:07,660
He probably doesn't want people knowing I
had to do it. I can be called Reich. Oh,

685
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:12,520
here you in. This sound rude. I sound
like it sounds like next generation. Yeah.

686
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:15,950
It's like no matter what, like people were
forced to think about the third. Right?

687
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,340
Right.
That's fucked up just a little bit.

688
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,860
They're going to not like you as much
as they should and you're bubbling.

689
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:24,140
Personality is not going to shine through
you being held back by a douchebag

690
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,810
name, Bro. Fuck that shit.
Can't go wrong with red fish.

691
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,620
Keep it as that and then just be the guy.
Be the one to change that stereotype.

692
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,690
You can think of. Nazis were going to give
you reinvent yourself as Red Ban, Huh?

693
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,040
Yeah, that fucking name. Legally, but now,
now ever since I've been rid me for one,

694
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,690
now there's like a red band,

695
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,630
like techno artists from the UK and
there's this other ripping you off.

696
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,330
There's all these red
bands now and it's like,

697
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:53,470
that's not fair and tell people to jump
on the red band wagon. He's got it.

698
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,010
You're right. [inaudible] dot com
is his, he's in the box. It's over.

699
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:00,280
It's done dude. You're like a
rapper. You've changed your name.

700
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,400
You really had to sell. I
can't be calling. Right. Cool.

701
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,960
I have my last name doesn't do me
any favors. How about Charlie Sheen?

702
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,730
Those guys too. There were Charlie
Sheen and Emilio Vazquez, her brothers,

703
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,500
but Charlie was like,
that Shit's just too Mexican.

704
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,740
Joey's like, I'm going with dad.
Uncle would help. Dad rocked it.

705
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,980
They have different fathers.
Is that what it is?

706
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,260
Or different fathers gotta be mothers
so they're allowed to have sex with each

707
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:33,610
other. Totally Bang. It makes sense now.

708
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:36,370
That's how they're married.
Their kids would be fun.
That's how they were married.

709
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,510
Charlie Sheen is holding it down though
and kind of tell you I'm talking about a

710
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:44,270
god that just keeps doing
the same shit and dislike.

711
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,090
Just keeps moving forward for him.

712
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:48,460
When he walks on set for two and
a half and don't like the day.

713
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,060
Is everyone just like quiet like
Zimmer pretend like nothing happened.

714
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,980
Kid high fives. I doubt it.
Do you watch that show at all?

715
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,840
I bet he owns that shit. The best
thing about that show is when the,

716
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:06,340
how they show the kid, like morph
into the adult. That's trippy. Yeah.

717
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,730
The thing about Charlie Sheen is
Charlie Sheen has like $100 million,

718
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,430
so he doesn't give a fuck either.

719
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,470
So it doesn't matter if he gets
caught with hookers. She's like,

720
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:18,050
what the fuck ever shut it. I
hope he does. Hot shots. Three d

721
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
you think you could pitch it?

722
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,840
What would be the is retired
navy seal guy or whatever.

723
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,920
He has a son,
uh,

724
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Bieber and Justin Bieber
and Justin Bieber's he has
to train him to take over a

725
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,630
fucking huge mood.
We were doing coke right now.

726
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,050
This would be the best conversation.
Yeah. Dude, this is a fucking huge movie.

727
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,880
I'm telling you right now.
The agent right now,

728
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,510
I know Mike Young and Mike Young
knows Leonardo Dicaprio. Okay,

729
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:50,240
we're going to get this fucking thing.
We're going to put this deal together.

730
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,170
Okay. Mike John Rose Tobey Maguire to told
me McGuire, I wouldn't be a bad choice

731
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,500
and pitch it to him and see what he says.

732
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,770
Mike Engle price on Mike Young last night
and he said he was the Charlie Sheen

733
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:03,170
is hot right now, if that's what
you're on speaker where you do it.

734
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,940
He said something hilarious.
He said something Larry's.
He's like, yeah man. I saw,

735
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,460
I saw,

736
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,540
I saw Joe at the UFC MMA and he held up
and you just said something like write

737
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:16,110
more or someone. I looked up at him
and I went like this with my fingers.

738
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,800
Right, like from stage. Yeah. It's just,

739
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,940
it was very funny. He's like, he's like,
he's right. He's right. He's right.

740
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,750
It was an inside joke. He, we would
always joke around with, the problem was,

741
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,950
I don't want to do now. He's a good
guy. The wrapper, if Mike were black,

742
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,830
he would be Drake.
I think they look alike.

743
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,960
I'm going to drink whiskey
with him or was that,

744
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,880
my ties are Nando's hot whiskey
drinks with Mike. Heidi.

745
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,640
I had hot toddies last night. That's
like young or Drake, Huh? Both of them.

746
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,110
Who did you mean?
Initially? Mike Young. Oh,

747
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,090
I'm sure he wouldn't have be need for
coffee or Mike have travels with the

748
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:56,130
Russell tribes or Russell Peters
does it. Really? Yeah. That's good.

749
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,040
That's why he was in Montreal for the
UFC. I love his song. Take me back.

750
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,340
It's a fun song, man. We should
find that. We want to play that.

751
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,270
Is that even on the lot? That's
hard. Okay, I'll find it.

752
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,510
You know I could always email it to you.
I'm sure I have it on my computer.

753
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,350
I'll just buy it from iTunes. Also.
Port bike from iTunes. Fuck yeah,

754
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,590
I'll support Mike if you can put the link
up. It's actually a really good song.

755
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:22,160
Have you ever heard my caps on? You
ever heard a song? It's a good song.

756
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,730
We freaked out. It's really
good. I was like, Mike, man,

757
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,510
this is like a good fucking pop
song. I don't know what it is. Is,

758
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,000
is he rapping it? Oh, it
was sorta sorta wraps.

759
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,330
I'm Jewish. My brother's a rapper.
We love it. Where the fuck is it?

760
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:43,090
I don't even have it on this
computer. Son of bitch, motherfucker.

761
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,450
Oh, here we go. Yeah, I can buy
it by, by that shits on Pie.

762
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:51,410
I want to hear a song. Oh, it's so good.
Like we, I was actually addicted to this.

763
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:55,040
Shocked. I was really shocked. I mean
it's, it's not the greatest song ever,

764
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:58,700
but it's like I told him, I go, dude, this
could be on the radio, like taking you.

765
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,780
Definitely. Yeah, we're here. Right? Why?

766
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,990
What's your account has been or

767
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,650
what the fuck is going on? But then
we're being held back by technology,

768
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,800
by things. Speaking of
which, this is something,

769
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,600
were we talking about this before the
podcast started? Um, conspiracy theory,

770
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:21,260
punk conspiracy theory about what the
fuck is happening with these birds,

771
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Arkansas.
Shoot.

772
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,720
What are you saying Joe Rogan.

773
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,360
Eliza talk about the birds and
the fish that suddenly die. Oh,

774
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:32,250
I didn't even see that birds and
the fish conversation. I didn't,

775
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,990
I didn't read the Twitter. That's all
I do. But that is what the subject is.

776
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,240
The um, the, these fucking birds,

777
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:44,100
like thousands of them fell from the sky
and over a hundred thousand drum fish

778
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:47,970
are dead.
And then this guy gets murdered.

779
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,760
Who is an expert in
chemical warfare and uh,

780
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,570
some guy in, there's all these, these
websites connecting him to uh, to this,

781
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:00,060
this fucking dead bird
kill that they were,

782
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,480
I mean who knows how much of it is real
and what speculative and what's just

783
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:05,700
conspiracy conspiracy theory nonsense.

784
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,620
But it's pretty fascinating that this
guy who's an expert in chemical warfare

785
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,630
gets a assassinated.

786
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:16,270
He's probably responsible for it.
And Peta is the one that is acid at him.

787
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,930
They're fucked fucking
and his favorite song.

788
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:24,370
I highly doubt it but I think
that's funny. Oh Mike Young.

789
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,710
Cause he plays hard.
Yeah,

790
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,410
I sent you, that's not the
song. Take me back now.

791
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:44,500
Funny how time disappears.
Young rebels on the street full of fire,

792
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:49,260
but fear the late night street fights
underneath the street lights Dj played on

793
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:51,660
Becca that you needed on that night too.

794
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:54,120
Young footballers just
rocking in the cost.

795
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,410
They'll forex in lack some neighborhood
movie stars running around town.

796
00:45:58,411 --> 00:46:02,610
Now free is a bird just loud as
you can because you gotta be heard.

797
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,400
Your blood pumps skill. You feel real
limits at bold too. Cool for school. Yo,

798
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:11,520
I never met the principal spend
every night getting high as a kite,

799
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,110
just sneaking in the back end.

800
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:17,300
Everything gets site young with
the Honga fast pace, no fee.

801
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:22,320
If I'm living every day,
I'm going to live 108 but now as a kid,

802
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,440
never had to worry about what I did.

803
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,790
I'm a man now was the plan
now gotta get it done.

804
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:33,460
No time fun.
Now take me back Manassas.

805
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:38,340
A different version is a had to worry
about this. This loop is done, man.

806
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:42,940
Now maybe he remastered it. Gotta move
on those days. Someone else's doing.

807
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,280
Hence we sell Tom crushing. The
feel is such a rush. She was older,

808
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:51,420
so she made me promise. Maybe he had
a fallout. Condom County. Anyway,

809
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,930
the song sounds like of a cracker
a little bit. I was like, Oh crap.

810
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,110
And those guys that saying that butterfly
song, if you want to give it online,

811
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,310
it's called take crazy town crazy.
It's like crazy town.

812
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,430
If anybody wants to get it online,
it's called take me. Take me back.

813
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,750
It's Mike Young. It's from the album
work in progress, which is a great album.

814
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:13,660
Said. Why that place of
service og like that for sure.

815
00:47:13,661 --> 00:47:17,710
You open up the flood gates of a million
angry Douche bags all over the Internet

816
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:20,160
going to fucking song.
No SOPs cock

817
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,520
like young, fuck my girl. How many people
are out there yelling and screaming?

818
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,420
You should drown in Aids on message
boards. It's going to be a thing now.

819
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,100
That's all it does. It's a thing
for a long time. She'd go to the,

820
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,860
if you go to the underground forum or
if you go to the Rogan board, you know,

821
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:42,240
or this is, those are the two forms
that I go to on a regular basis. Eliza,

822
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,093
you take it from,

823
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,480
are you addicted to any kind of web
websites or forums or anything like that?

824
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,870
I compulsively check my own
Facebook page, but uh, d listed.

825
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,870
I don't really do celebrity gossip,
but I do like that guy's writing. Yeah,

826
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:57,590
he's fun. Also one called
catalog living.net. What?

827
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,260
It is hilarious.

828
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:03,190
They take pictures out of catalogs and
it's these two characters and they,

829
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,450
if you go to it,
I'll show it to you.

830
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,050
They make fun of the way furniture set
up and catalogs because they set up these

831
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,760
ridiculous room and no
one will live like that.

832
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,980
It's these from the point of view of
these, I think it's Gary and Elaine.

833
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,480
They live in the catalog and it's from
their point of view. If you just read one,

834
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,110
it's so funny. I liked, I
checked that. What's it called
again? Cat. It's so, it's,

835
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,110
it's just, no, it's just
catalog. living.net. Do you know,

836
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:27,770
have a message board on your website? I
think so. I don't think it ever reject it.

837
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:31,810
If you want to contact you go to
Facebook or something, it's fine. Oh,

838
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:35,470
that's funny. But why do you, uh, how come
you don't want to have your own thing?

839
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,170
Why would you want to just have it
on Facebook? Like message boards?

840
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,520
It's like it's a,

841
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:42,880
it's an interesting thing to be able to
have like a whole group of people that

842
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:45,580
you're, you know, you're communicating
with and it's all hosted on your side.

843
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,220
I think she just think I do. Right.
But I also have one, there it is.

844
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:51,880
I have one for my web show
that we do. There's a message
board for that. And what,

845
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,790
yeah, what does this web show,
because you were guys were,

846
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,050
you were going to tell me before the
show started, but we decided to wait.

847
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,660
My show is called the
weekly news. Wea. Koi.

848
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,420
Why you've been doing that for a while.
How long have you been doing it for?

849
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,680
About maybe three years.

850
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:05,320
Then we took a break because we lost
our sponsor and we just got back starts

851
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:09,520
next week. And how do people
see it? Where's it at? Coda?
The stream.tv. The Stream?

852
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,360
Yeah, like water, str
am dot. TV slash weekly.

853
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,230
And now there's all these backlog
episodes and uh, we get on there and I,

854
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,170
I just thought it was important to do
a show where it wasn't some girl just

855
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:21,850
cackling about Kim Kardashians.

856
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:25,150
So we talk about the headlines and
what's in the news and I get into debates

857
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:28,540
with people and it's all in good
fun. And uh, it's the weekly news,

858
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,380
but if Kim Kardashians subject comes up,
don't be afraid of it.

859
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,251
I'm not afraid of it.

860
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:35,220
Fuck those motherfuckers don't
want them holding the camera.

861
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,250
Can you say her name's that?

862
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:39,280
People hear me saying it and then they
search or I don't want to add to that.

863
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,110
You don't want to add to it
for our whole family there.

864
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,400
What's wrong with our society?
Are you sure? Positive one.

865
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,550
It was like weapons and shit.

866
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:49,860
We're doing overseas with our society
more insular and not so much as the city's

867
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,500
actions. What's wrong with the
world? Girls like that? I can't even,

868
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,400
I mean you're probably friends with our,
no, no, no, no, no. I'm not friends.

869
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,280
You want to know? My opinion is this, this
is not a gel. She's gorgeous by the way.

870
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:05,320
I'll give her that. She's gorgeous. It's
all these women that are uneducated,

871
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,870
unintelligent self entitled,

872
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,230
did Jack Crap for anything and
now it's not even about the money.

873
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:15,580
You have all this notoriety and publicity
and there's nothing to you and it

874
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:18,100
teaches women in our society.
If you're just,

875
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,640
if you put on some makeup and let
someone pee on you or if you are,

876
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,870
not that she's a gold digger,

877
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:26,860
but if you do nothing and just
act like a total fucking whore,

878
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,640
rewards will come through higher
education. Screw integrity.

879
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:36,170
I see your point in any industry.
I also see it though.

880
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,670
You've got to let the market dictate
and I think that there's a market for a

881
00:50:39,671 --> 00:50:43,670
horse. There's a morning bird is a
bargain for empty people on television.

882
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:46,160
There's a market like their players,
I mean, and not calling her a whore.

883
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:48,380
She's seems like a nice person
and she's got a great ass.

884
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,010
What I'm saying is there's a,

885
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,590
this is a market for people that are
trying to get attention for no reason and

886
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,424
they're doing this.

887
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,220
People get fascinating fixated on them
because they're regular people and they

888
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,390
start following them and then they become
players in of legit fucking show that

889
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:04,820
people get hooked up on and roped into.

890
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,450
I am part of the problem cause I
watch like real housewives of Atlanta,

891
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,350
16 weeks pregnant. Crazy. I've
been watching Beverly Hills.

892
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,880
I watch all of them and I'm so, I'm a part
of that problem. But I guess my thing,

893
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,050
the Beverly Hill don't be hating.
That's all. I'll say it. I hate it.

894
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,790
It's got to let them
let a freak be a freak.

895
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,780
He just got to let them just got a
lot of and watch it. You fascinating.

896
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,580
That's what 16 and pregnant. I
can't watch. I can't watch that.

897
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,230
That one good shape.
That has been beating people's,

898
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:34,040
he's been arrested like three times.
If I was 16 and pregnant,

899
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:37,700
I've been kicking dude's acids too. I sit
scary. She's probably out of her mind.

900
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,640
What's wrong with MTV for doing that shit?
That's well,

901
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,120
you know what's right with they're showing
it to us. I don't think it's wrong.

902
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,340
You don't have to watch it. You
know what? There's a glamorized.

903
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,960
I think it's not quite summarizing it,
man.

904
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:50,570
I think for a lot of people it's going
to scare the fucking shit out as I was

905
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:51,740
like,
why are all the girl's fat

906
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,740
catty woman? You give credit where
it's due. I mean there were attractive,

907
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,300
I said Kim Kardashian was pretty chess.
You did worthless but pretty worthless.

908
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,320
Pretty and worth.
If someone wants to fuck you,

909
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:12,290
you're worth something worthless in my
eyes cause I don't want to fuck her.

910
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,760
I want to fuck camp north north from the
Atlanta one. The sister that you liked,

911
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:20,480
that one that they can one the wig chick.
You like her totally have sex with her.

912
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,830
I'm going to have cigarettes with
her and fucking just kidding.

913
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,930
Brian has a tight,
tight.

914
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,830
Brian likes wants a big woman
that gets on top. No, no,

915
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,010
horrible. That is wigs. Hate fake hair.

916
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,660
That's just what a girl was trying
to choke you. Was She fucked you?

917
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,880
What if a girl was trying to choke me?

918
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:43,500
I don't like that shit and I don't
like every girl tried to do that.

919
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,960
I don't like crazy. There was
this girl when I went to a fight,

920
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,050
I went to a rave once when I was like
20 and there was this girl that I took

921
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:54,440
home and add the next morning.
She heard that we had sex,

922
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,450
but she was trying to choke
me it in the next morning.

923
00:52:56,451 --> 00:53:00,380
She had no eyebrows that they had
like smeared off and it was like raver

924
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:03,210
eyebrows where she had no eyebrows that
were painted on and when she woke up it

925
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:05,450
was just smear it all over her face.
She wanted to,

926
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,550
she was trying to choke me the whole time.
It's like,

927
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:11,390
what the fuck this chicken murder
somebody by now the girl wanting to do.

928
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:14,550
I can understand that.
I've never heard of a girl like

929
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,740
is a big choker or he should be here.
I can see that every time I there was,

930
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,410
we were in Austin. Yeah,
Austin in this the whole time.

931
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,220
He's just sitting there
like he just met this girl.

932
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:29,040
He's just choking her the whole time.
I shouldn't be talking about this.

933
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,680
Is that the comedy queen made it
sound like you were in bed with no,

934
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,640
it wasn't like he doesn't care.
I always talk about that.

935
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,740
I'm sure he doesn't care.
I don't think any guy would care,

936
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,110
but it was just uncomfortable for me
because like, wow, I can't do that.

937
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,500
Can't just go up to a girl, be like, Hey,
I'm your neck. You Fun when you're young.

938
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,400
If you date a girl who's like really
into her feet and like playing with your

939
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:52,560
deck, where your feet you
is get like foot fetishes.

940
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,780
That's where they get it from. Where it
starts. Yeah. That's where it starts.

941
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,750
I Dunno. It's just really,
if you read, could be both.

942
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,160
It could be.
Could be.

943
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,920
Could we have a bunch of reasons
for having some weird fetish,

944
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,810
but that could be one that he just dated.

945
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:09,000
A girl in the sex was really
hot and she likes to get choked,

946
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:13,140
so he just started associated
like choking, like hot sex.

947
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,060
That's crazy. Right? I don't know.
I don't have any, don't like boobs.

948
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,320
That almost offends me, that don't don't
like that guy or I don't really care.

949
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:25,800
I'm like, how could you not care about,
but that's so important. Yeah, I agree.

950
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,210
100% are mostly guys.
Are you hanging out with what guys?

951
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:33,780
Are you thinking that they're
looking for flaws? Yeah,

952
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,400
I know you got a whole big tits and
shit, Blaine, and the guy's like,

953
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,750
just right here.
People talk on TV or male comics.

954
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:44,370
They're like a more of a buck guy.
I'm like, I don't get that at all. Um,

955
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:46,800
if I had to choose between one or the
other, I would say I'm more of a Buckeye.

956
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,280
Why? No, it's not the problem.

957
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,140
I love breasts as well,

958
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,700
but I've seen a lot of really attractive
women that have a small breasts and big

959
00:54:56,701 --> 00:54:58,680
assets. You're looking at their
breasts more than you are there,

960
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:02,630
but it doesn't matter. It's aesthetic,
you know? What do you think is sexy?

961
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:05,670
You know, I don't mind girls with small
breasts. It doesn't bother me. I'm like,

962
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:09,960
I have, I said this before just because
you have big tits. That's all it is.

963
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,280
And you're from Texas. It's
like, it's a great system.

964
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:17,940
It's ingrained in your system.
That's a big titty state I lived between.

965
00:55:17,941 --> 00:55:22,450
If you had to choose between a girl with
big tits and a flat ass or girl tits

966
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:26,590
and a big juicy yes she has no,
but it makes it easier to lie down.

967
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,690
You can touch the boobs.
No crazy. That flat ass.

968
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,800
I hate those acids. So flagged,
but it's really mostly,

969
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,520
these are people I knew a girl in college,

970
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:40,521
I had one of those flat asses that look
like where girls sometimes disturbing.

971
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:42,420
She had a little chunk to her.

972
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,340
I didn't want to hang out with her just
because of how uncomfortable her asking

973
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,530
me.
It's different than a tiny,

974
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,010
but like elephant butts where it's
just like a flat rhino surface.

975
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,250
There was this one girl
when we were in high school.

976
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,080
It's just one girl that had this,
the strangest body. She was like, um,

977
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,420
she was like five feet tall,

978
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,530
but she was like three feet wide and
her shoulders and her hips were equally

979
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,310
wise. No, she was just a
big girl. She was so big.

980
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,210
Like I remember just like standing next
to her. She was so fucking wine. So big.

981
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:16,020
You're like, this poor kid.
Nothing you can do about it.

982
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:17,640
She's just giant bones.

983
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,540
She was just like this five foot tall
neanderthal looking fucking freak,

984
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:24,220
tiniest neanderthal and the herd
that's all small. They were,

985
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,110
there were all little at one time.
My favorite,

986
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,630
all neanderthals were five feet tall,
like 200 pounds.

987
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:30,430
They were totally felt different than us.
Yeah.

988
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,670
They look like wolverine from the
Eczema in comic books. For Real.

989
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:38,230
That's what they looked like. Yeah. He's
really short. He's really and yoked.

990
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,890
But these things are actually shorter
than him. You know, we used to,

991
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,720
we talked about this in the
podcast and we've before,

992
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:47,140
but in the end her talls about why
they died off. Um, I don't know,

993
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:50,770
but I bet they have best the best boobs.
The, well, the reason why they died offers

994
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,050
because human males fuck
the female neanderthals.

995
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:59,050
But human females wouldn't let
the mail neanderthals fuck them.

996
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,150
But don't they rape and pillage.
Isn't that their shtick?

997
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,080
We were kicking their asses.
We're smarter than, than,

998
00:57:03,081 --> 00:57:06,190
than we may better weapons who are
fucking them up fucking their women.

999
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,770
And then we just sorta integrated them in.
The males died off.

1000
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:09,783
That's what happened.

1001
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,780
Well that's why the French are so I say
we like it was me like I was a black.

1002
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,150
The boys kicking some stupid monkey s
that's why the French are little bit you

1003
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:19,804
think?
Yeah,

1004
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,250
because of the neanderthals and that is
a part of France to do with like all the

1005
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:26,140
strong ones went off to
war and they were so weak.

1006
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:30,070
All the big guys died so all the little
ones were left over and that's why, wow,

1007
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,430
what a trip, what a trip for
any culture. I guy's ridiculous.

1008
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,790
How crazy is that?
That that's like a real concern.

1009
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,000
Some cultures that men go off to war
and they'll die off and then leave,

1010
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:42,640
like all the smart number of females.

1011
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:46,870
Then the women have to become fucking
warriors who tried to fend off invading

1012
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:51,130
herds of men and whatever happened to
that old school that go to war for like

1013
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:55,030
three years and the chick actually
waited for the guy. You know? Nowadays.

1014
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:56,360
It's like this.
Second,

1015
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,890
people leave now world war two they were
getting closet pussy just like they are

1016
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:02,890
today and it's so easy now. The girl
leaves and he puts it on Facebook. Oh,

1017
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:04,810
I'm going to be lonely
for the next three years.

1018
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,930
You know how many fucking messages
that girl gets on your boyfriend who's

1019
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,760
overseas? You deserve
dynasty of age, right? Yes.

1020
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,330
AIDS definitely the dumb Hugger,
right?

1021
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:20,320
Unless your boyfriend's a Douche bag
and didn't realize it until he left,

1022
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:23,740
went to war and then what? You get stuck
there because you want to be a patriot.

1023
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,740
Cheat on him. Just share lonely.
Can't generalize. I mean,

1024
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,760
maybe the poor girl just realize that
she's free now. Just fucking hat.

1025
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,880
Maybe I want to explore my life and I
don't want to get into confrontation with

1026
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:38,350
Randy because he gets fucking angry and
he shoots his guns. Shouldn't say Randy.

1027
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,850
When Renco tourist,
one of my heroes,

1028
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,740
I should come up with a better
name for my fake person.

1029
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:44,710
I don't think he's gonna
think you know a Ronald.

1030
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,740
I don't know why no one named Ronald
is tough. I would say Ronald Reagan.

1031
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:53,440
Ronald Reagan, Ronald. He had lush,

1032
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:57,580
bless you cheeks. Trying to think
of any MMA guys I know named Ron.

1033
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,570
Fuck the Ronald Reagan,
but that's what the real name is.

1034
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,470
Ron. If you're Ronald, you
become nerd. No one's like Jack,

1035
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,330
Ronald or Ronny. So you have
to pick, Huh? Well the Ronnie,

1036
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,170
but this one is the same, isn't it? This
long name is Ronnie. Really? Dave's Randy.

1037
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:19,370
Hey, are you related to
Dr Laura Schlessinger? No,

1038
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,830
not get that question all the time.

1039
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,810
It's Hearst has a c that's gotta
be annoying as fuck. Right?

1040
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,850
It doesn't happen enough
that I'm like upset about it.

1041
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,160
Did they ever think that you're her?
Maybe I'll get easier upset.

1042
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:31,700
That would be worse.
I said maybe I'll get easier.

1043
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,020
It's easier to upset me than you.
It happens, but it's not for me.

1044
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:39,140
It used to be like Fred Rogan,
the sports guy,

1045
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,730
but spelled different. Worse people to
be asked if you're related or Fred's.

1046
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,270
I'm sure he's a good guy.
I'm related to Kim's all see ag.

1047
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,440
Who's that wig where like,

1048
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:57,770
oh, you know her. You know her last
name and everything, but she goes by,

1049
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,460
she has a song. I think she quit
smoking while she's having the baby.

1050
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:05,940
I bought her CD. No, she's smoking.
She smoked emotions pregnant.

1051
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,690
Absolutely. That's hard to see, man.

1052
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:11,390
That is one of the hardest things
to see the nurse, so you know,

1053
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,390
she saw that in Canada.
He stepped out of me and Ari Shaffir,

1054
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:18,760
we're way up in fuck. I think we're
in Saskatoon somewhere. Crazy. Yeah,

1055
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,860
it was way on the middle of nowhere.
It's really interesting.

1056
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:24,230
And we stepped out of this restaurant.
There's chick there,

1057
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,130
big fucking belly sitting there
smoking a cigarette. I'm like, wow.

1058
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,470
Probably trying to do the kid a favor.
Get rid of it.

1059
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:33,770
So it doesn't have to be
born in Saskatoon. Fuck.

1060
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,030
People have made the argument
that it doesn't. I mean,

1061
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:41,240
it's stupid that it doesn't affect the
cuboid affects the kid. Absolutely.

1062
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,600
I blame that for awhile.
I'm fucked up. What? My mom,

1063
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:47,980
my mom's smoking while I was in the womb.
That's all my issues. I remember when,

1064
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,740
I remember my friend's mom smoked and
we'd go bowling every Saturday and she

1065
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:54,800
would just sit there with the window
cracked open and just the smoke would hit

1066
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:57,340
me in the face the whole way to
the bowling alley. Remember going,

1067
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,780
oh this is the worst.
This kid I went to high school with,

1068
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,380
his mom and dad both chain smoked. It was
the creepiest thing you would go over.

1069
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:07,700
It was just a house of death. You'd go
over their house and there was smoke ever.

1070
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:10,460
It was fucking cold as shit cause
we lived in Boston, you know,

1071
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,180
so you go over their house and their
living room was just filled with fucking

1072
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:17,300
smoke. It was just, you would
walk into like a death cloud,

1073
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:19,700
like they're killing themselves
or choking themselves to death.

1074
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,960
My best friend growing up,

1075
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,350
her parents were insomniacs that
chain smoked and so she'd be like,

1076
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:28,370
come sleep over my house and we'll go home
reeking of cigarettes before a formal,

1077
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:30,390
she's like, come over to my house for
pictures. I'm like, I don't want it.

1078
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:33,560
You'd probably be jacked from the
nicotine to. Did you get like,

1079
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:37,190
did you feel the nicotine,
we kids who you're just,
you're already running around.

1080
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:41,870
We have mellow child. What?
Mellow child. He's trying to
get to know you. No, no, no.

1081
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:45,680
I mean, because of all the
cigarettes fellow Chow's IML a child

1082
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:51,890
by her. So relaxed, but it's
such a confusing conversation,

1083
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,600
Bryan burrough.
Yeah.

1084
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,350
I feel really bad for little kids who's
parents smoke and the smoke around him

1085
01:01:57,351 --> 01:02:00,080
all the time. They get it in
their head that that's, you know,

1086
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,660
it's just a part of life. You
know? Some people small can shit.

1087
01:02:02,661 --> 01:02:05,390
Maybe I should try it too. Well, it is
relaxing and then next thing you know,

1088
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:06,590
you're hooked on the tit to.

1089
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,250
It is a bizarre thing that there's no
politicians calling out for that shit to

1090
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:14,480
be illegal. Is it bizarre? It's very
bizarre. Bizarre that people tolerate it.

1091
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,230
400,000 people die every year
from cigarette smoke and no one,

1092
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:21,900
no one is up arms. Do you know what do you
mean? No one is up in arms. They're not.

1093
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:22,800
No one's up in arms.

1094
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:25,920
No one's trying to stop and no one's
making it a part of political campaigns

1095
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,620
probably make a lot of money from pricing.
Oh yeah.

1096
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,930
Well they definitely do think it
should be illegal to smoke anywhere.

1097
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:33,870
But in your house, like when I go out to
eat, even if you're smoking on the curb,

1098
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:37,170
it's affecting me. It's such a thing
as just fish habitat, illegal period.

1099
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,470
I think even the most smokers
would say, dude, if it wasn't sold,

1100
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,180
if you guys made it legal,
sure.

1101
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,360
I think you should be able to do
whatever you want to do and your house,

1102
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,550
you want to smoke a cigarette,
I think you should be able to talk to her.

1103
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,910
I definitely don't agree with any sort
of nanny state bullshit where you can say

1104
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:54,930
that happy meals can't be legal because
kids get tricked into eating them cause

1105
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:58,200
there's this toy inside of the shut
the fuck up and it's a God damn happy.

1106
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:01,350
Exactly. If you want to buy a happy meal
every now and then for a Goof, what?

1107
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,560
Who gives a shit stop? This is
nonsense. So people should die out.

1108
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:08,730
We shouldn't go jazz. It
will. Yeah, I think so.

1109
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:13,170
Government's job to protect is not the
government's job to make you eat right or

1110
01:03:13,171 --> 01:03:13,891
make things easier.

1111
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:16,530
It's their job to protect your right
to do whatever the fuck you want.

1112
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,270
That's all hers. Don't think you
should be able to tell me or can.

1113
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,120
I know cigars can give you cancer too,

1114
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:23,700
and I like us to Garvey known then I
don't think he should be able to tell him

1115
01:03:23,701 --> 01:03:27,480
what the fuck to do. I want to do
what I want to do, but they just,

1116
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,430
you shouldn't be able to smoke in my face,

1117
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,990
but there should be some sort of a way
that we can find out what the fuck those

1118
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:38,991
599 chemicals that they've added the
cigarettes are first of all because of a

1119
01:03:39,651 --> 01:03:44,510
bunch of 'em have been concocted entirely
to effect the addiction process. No,

1120
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:48,330
it's mostly spices. Spices.
It's a certain menthol smell.

1121
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,410
It's angel balls there
should that dessert.

1122
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,770
It's the stuff that they put
installation, you know, fiberglass.

1123
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,640
It's in menthols is what they used to
always say, make you itchy as a kid.

1124
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,430
You don't wait on it.
And then you'd have all,

1125
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,280
I remember that I used to install that
shit. I used to install fiber glass,

1126
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,193
paint stuff.

1127
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:09,990
Anthrocon when I worked as a labor for
doing construction when I was a kid,

1128
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,830
my father was an architect so I got a
lot of jobs on construction sites and we

1129
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:15,240
used to have to install
a lot of that shit.

1130
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,770
And you just go home just issuing
man everywhere hardware floors,

1131
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,860
you get bad zits too.
That's what my attic used to have in it.

1132
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:25,560
And I used to just like looking
at the pink panther logo,

1133
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:29,610
so like jump in there just to look at it.
And if this summer,

1134
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,500
summer in Boston installing that shit,
oh I get so hot there,

1135
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,710
I went to college there and wide,
well ac in my apartment, it gets wet.

1136
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,650
It's like that wet heat that you
don't get here in California.

1137
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:44,220
California heats no big deal. So 110
degrees out here and you're like, ah,

1138
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:46,050
it's hot. But no big deal. You know,

1139
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:50,370
it's 110 in Boston or New Jersey or
in one of those that's just swamp.

1140
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:51,780
Especially if you're like in a city,

1141
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:54,210
there's no relief and
there's a steam everywhere.

1142
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,640
You know they have bear
problems in New Jersey.

1143
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,580
Do you know that New Jersey has like,

1144
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:02,550
they just started opening
the open season on bears.

1145
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:04,260
Now they have bear hunting tags.

1146
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:09,220
You can get bear hunting in New Jersey
and it's not shooting bears if they seem

1147
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:12,030
like they were looking at that control.

1148
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:15,810
You don't realize that a big part
of New Jersey apparently is rural.

1149
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,120
We always think of New Jersey was neural
big.

1150
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:21,600
We always think of New Jersey.

1151
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:25,740
He's like Newark and these industrial
areas and these dumps shit. Sopranos,

1152
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,960
do I have a bad accident? No, no, no, no.
It's just, those are weird words. Newark,

1153
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:33,860
Newark, New Jersey. I was born
and, but a huge part of New Jersey.

1154
01:05:33,861 --> 01:05:35,230
It's just woods,
you know,

1155
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,490
and there's fucking bears are invading
into people's neighborhoods and one's

1156
01:05:39,491 --> 01:05:41,770
bears get addicted to
eating out of garbage cans.

1157
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,450
They know how easy it is
to get the food that way.

1158
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,750
They just go to that every time because
it's way easier than killing animals or

1159
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,950
pulling up roots and shit.

1160
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,710
So they just start fucking up people's
garbage and they just move into

1161
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:53,260
neighborhoods and have like real problems.
Can Show your funny bear club.

1162
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,290
It was on like the tonight show a
couple of weeks ago. I saw this in the,

1163
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:58,840
and you don't need the New York cabs
in the back. They have like little,

1164
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:00,970
like NBC video clips and you can watch,
right?

1165
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,190
I was in New York couple weeks
when I saw this. Just put, Hey,

1166
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:04,450
what are you doing bear?

1167
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,270
It's literally 10 seconds and
it's the funniest thing ever.

1168
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:11,320
People should look at it. It was,
they named a whole segment after it.

1169
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:15,460
This is this the top one. The thing
where I keep looking for it. Hey,

1170
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:17,630
what do you doing bear? Hey,
what are you doing there?

1171
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:23,440
And what is it if this farmer
and he is here to us, this one,

1172
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,760
watch this. Oh, I know what you're
talking about. Who's not a farmer.

1173
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:31,630
He's a hunter to understand thing. A
farmer and a hunter's. Totally kidding.

1174
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:36,460
It's close. Well, maybe
for it until he gets here.

1175
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:38,880
Well anyway, what it is is, uh,

1176
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:43,360
this bear decides to climb up this
ladder where this guy is a hunting.

1177
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:47,170
She's really scary and
he scares it off quicker.

1178
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:49,623
Wow.

1179
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:53,900
Bears are highly intelligent. And that's
not the sentence. That's a different one.

1180
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,670
It's a different one. Yeah.
That's okay. Sorry. That's okay.

1181
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,700
It's like almost the same thing though.
Well,

1182
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,780
I don't understand why this is parents
just get it like to the, anyway,

1183
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,310
the barrier.
This is the best podcast average.

1184
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,620
I hate when people can't find
the clips and then they're like,

1185
01:07:09,621 --> 01:07:12,650
just wait a second. It's, and that it's
not funny. And then their internet sucks.

1186
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:16,420
Here it comes. Yeah. And then just watch

1187
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,660
the bears looking up the ladder.

1188
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:29,150
There's a bear at the bottom of this tree
stand and now the bear is climbing up

1189
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:33,320
the tree. Stand the ladder here
comes. Yeah. It's a lot of it.

1190
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:37,720
It's treestand
bears climbing halfway up right now.

1191
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:42,740
Oh my God. Say something, Dude. Hey, what
are you doing there? Were you doing there?

1192
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,990
What the fuck?

1193
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:52,400
How lucky is he that that bear does not
know what's going on and just run away?

1194
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:57,110
Was fucking crazy. What are
you doing there? And then
there's like a made mistake.

1195
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:01,240
Wrong House. There's a guy that's pretty
relaxed. Yeah, that guy's relaxed around.

1196
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,470
Would've been screaming again.

1197
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:05,660
Bear was halfway up the fucking
ladder before he said anything.

1198
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:09,960
He was hoping the bear is going
to change its mind. That's crazy.

1199
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:12,740
You don't get real big when a bear comes.
You just have to reason with it.

1200
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,670
Bears respond to logic it unless have
their babies with them and then they're

1201
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:18,880
going to eat your ass
hall growing up in Texas,

1202
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:22,670
asshole asshole first and they'll
eat you out from the inside.

1203
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,490
Growing up in Texas, did you do a
lot of hunting? Like a lot of, um,

1204
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,660
should we don't hunt for bargains?

1205
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,240
You know what I did use
to do my friend Lauren,

1206
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:35,960
her parents were into something called
like reenactment shootings and they would

1207
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:40,961
dress up in period costumes like early
or late 19th century cowboy attire.

1208
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:45,350
And we would go out to like the middle
of nowhere and like fresco before it had

1209
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:49,040
houses there and they would have little
town set up and they would do timed

1210
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:52,760
events shooting like rifles and you get
awards at the end and we would just sit

1211
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:56,270
there in the back of a suburban and
drink Dr Pepper and watch her parents do

1212
01:08:56,271 --> 01:08:57,104
this every Sunday,

1213
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,940
like 6:00 AM and they had like cowboy
names and there was like a little

1214
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:06,140
community. Holy Shit, we got
to shoot guns. Wow. Awesome.

1215
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:09,970
It's like a cowboy version of dungeons
and dragons or something. Yeah,

1216
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,570
it's kind of like civil war reenactments,

1217
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:16,571
but there's no shot shooting back those
things and like civil war reenactments

1218
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:19,810
and um, I don't get them either.
I don't, I don't get the, uh,

1219
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,660
I guess I get the renaissance thing
a little bit more. Renaissance Fair.

1220
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:27,770
It seems like there. Yeah, that's what I
go there having fun. The food is so good.

1221
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:29,810
The civil war thing is
like ridiculous stuff.

1222
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,650
Are you just running around with a gun?
I don't think so.

1223
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,590
I think they plan out the
war plan out like battles,

1224
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:39,500
like this is when these guys came over
the hill and it's like an accurate

1225
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:43,360
historical what happened
or believe so directions.

1226
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,730
Well I think they just pretending they're
really doing it in real history and

1227
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:49,710
they're getting a boner for it.
There's weird all civil war buff,

1228
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,070
fucking weird man running around with
fake bullets and you're shooting blanks

1229
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,890
and shit. And as a kid though, watching
that, that was really cool. You know?

1230
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:01,820
And it showed you that something that
you normally used to have books for now

1231
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:05,300
you can just be a video game. I wonder
how often those civil war reenactments.

1232
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,760
I'm wondering how often people get
actually shot. That's like, oh,

1233
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:11,870
I thought these were all blanks.
Like you did least. Who just said,

1234
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:13,210
I'm just going to go in,
I'm going to shoot someone.

1235
01:10:13,211 --> 01:10:15,320
And I'll say it was an action.
I thought it was thought it was blank.

1236
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:17,510
I'll never know who all have the same gun.
They won't know it's from me.

1237
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,410
And they would have to figure out who
shot the real bullets. Brandon Lee,

1238
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:26,480
dude law and order, civil war, the
friendly leaking, right? Oh yeah.

1239
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:31,490
That always scary. It's fucking
terrifying. They changed
the rules. Now you know,

1240
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,610
because of that movie, you're not
allowed to point a gun at a person.

1241
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:37,220
When you're in a gun scene
and you're shooting at them,

1242
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,110
you're not allowed to shoot
a blank at the person.

1243
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:40,190
You have to point away from them.

1244
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:43,430
So like the props I just loaded in a real
bullet on accident. I don't think so.

1245
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:46,430
I think there was something in
the casing that wasn't exploded.

1246
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,350
Like there's something in,
it was like,

1247
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:51,770
there was something stuck on the top
of it. I think that's what it was.

1248
01:10:51,771 --> 01:10:54,650
It was like sitting and acted as a
projectile and it shot him and it was a

1249
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,060
really close range.
I think too.

1250
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,420
I've thought about that and I've always
thought about that as like a horrible

1251
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,570
way to go. And then I realized
I can't even get callbacks.

1252
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,450
So I don't think being shot on
set is like an issue of mine yet.

1253
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:10,610
Like you're not gonna be that picky. When
I was, when I first came to California,

1254
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,640
it was like 1994 there was a guy who
I was working with whose friend had

1255
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:21,650
committed suicide accidentally on a
set because they had a blank gun and he

1256
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,260
didn't know that you could just put a
blank on up to your head and pull the

1257
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:29,280
trigger. The camp no blows your
brains out with the fucking wow.

1258
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,960
I never knew that.
We wouldn't have done it,

1259
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:35,940
but he took this in front of everybody
and he's like, Hey, look at this. Boom.

1260
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:40,490
And he fucking blows his brains out
the force and the air of wow. Wow.

1261
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,270
What an awful way. He probably didn't
die. Right then he died, hemorrhage,

1262
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:48,240
big hole in his head, went
down, started hemorrhaging.

1263
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,100
They bring him to the hospital
dead. That's fucked up shit. Yeah.

1264
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,290
That was on youtube. Do you ever see
the Budd Dwyer? Have you ever seen that?

1265
01:11:55,710 --> 01:12:00,440
But Dwyer was a, he was a politician.
Do you want to watch it? Yeah. God,

1266
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:03,240
Budd Dwyer was a politician,
I believe it was in Pittsburgh,

1267
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:05,220
and he was corrupt and
he got caught and he,

1268
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:08,910
they called a press conference and he
pulls out a 44 magnum and the press

1269
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:13,350
conference and blows his brains
online. Oh yeah. That's sad. No,

1270
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:16,320
it's going to freak the fuck out.
Maybe we'll find out what you're made of.

1271
01:12:16,321 --> 01:12:19,020
If you're an ice princess, you might
just look at this and go, yeah.

1272
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:23,910
Lisa Cell Phone Cam. Fuck
Budd Dwyer. Fuck yeah.

1273
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:26,640
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not
about you right now.

1274
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:35,920
Where's Greg? Is that him? Yeah,
it's like Alfred Hitchcock. Yes.

1275
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,330
Words. Don Johnson. So he, uh,

1276
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:43,890
he wants everybody in the room and he's
got an envelope. Yes. Oh yeah. Watch this.

1277
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,630
Here.
He opens the envelope.

1278
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,650
Where are you looking right here?
Look at this.

1279
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,440
Great reminder that right for the moment.

1280
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:58,740
He hands out some letters

1281
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:03,330
and then he pulls out the gun.

1282
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,150
Wants you to shit.

1283
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:13,100
When I
rolled with it as well,

1284
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,300
that
all

1285
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:33,700
down Maddie,
please

1286
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:40,240
don't Mag.
I almost started crying.

1287
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:41,600
Someone called the ambulance.

1288
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,820
Yeah, that wasn't cool. How would
you want to watch that? Yeah.

1289
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,640
That was in the movies. There's not
even that much blood gushing out well,

1290
01:13:49,641 --> 01:13:51,040
but in the movies aren't really accurate,

1291
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:53,270
but you would think a movie
would do more, right? Like what?

1292
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:55,270
It's always exacerbated.
Everything's always bigger.

1293
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,770
I've never seen blood gushed out
of someone's nose like that. Yeah.

1294
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,800
That's horrendous. I'm so sad now.
Really. What bugs in a better place now?

1295
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:07,290
Probably not. Maybe so. Probably
at the comedy store placement.

1296
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,520
He's in the basement doing abortion,
so I hate he was pregnant at the time.

1297
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:17,410
That's why it's terrible. So he
killed himself. Oh Connie. I know.

1298
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,310
It's a trip to think that the spectrum
of human behaviors that that vast,

1299
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:25,570
that there's people that their
life is so far beyond repair,

1300
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:29,410
their brain is so fucked or
emotions are so fucking damaged.

1301
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:30,670
Everything just so much pain.

1302
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,610
They just want to stick a tube up metal
in their mouth and just end it all but

1303
01:14:34,611 --> 01:14:38,680
playing. That's one of this haunting
videos that will always be in my head,

1304
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:41,200
that the woman getting hit
by the train is another one.

1305
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:43,600
The Guy Getting fucked by the
horse. The guy. I'll watch that.

1306
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:46,570
That will make me feel better.
Monkey pull up two guys.

1307
01:14:46,571 --> 01:14:51,030
One horse.com like here hurts now
cause the, cause I'm watching that oil.

1308
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:55,410
The DOTCOM is, well this is what I was
talking about with this. The Movie Zoo.

1309
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,450
Yeah. It's really, they really
change the law because of this.

1310
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:02,120
So what happened was, I can't wait to
watch here. This guy died and then they,

1311
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:06,070
they interrogated his friends and they
found out about this farm and they went

1312
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:09,940
there and there was over a hundred
hours of video of guys getting fucked by

1313
01:15:09,941 --> 01:15:13,980
animals. Yeah. Well they don't show
it in the documentary at the moment.

1314
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:17,010
The documentary is like, most of it
is like reenactments and you know,

1315
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,470
kind of describing everything
that happened when it went down.

1316
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:21,760
It's just so fascinating,

1317
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,090
especially from the point of view of
the people who were they living there

1318
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:28,300
because you know, these people were like
in love with animals. I mean they're,

1319
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:30,700
they're really, there's something
going on that's not right.

1320
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,600
This is the question before we saw this,

1321
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:36,310
when whoever built this website
was like web mastering it.

1322
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,880
Do you think it's fair to be
like, hey, hey cutie on the phone.

1323
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,700
How do I get that Jpeg
of the horse running?

1324
01:15:40,701 --> 01:15:44,250
I can be really cute on this website. You
know what the pony is it from clip art?

1325
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,250
Like what do I get this?

1326
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:48,730
We put it auto compliment the horse
cock and really well from a website from

1327
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:53,320
like 1986 the two of them on two of them.
Crazy horse cock jokes.

1328
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:58,120
This is obvious. Okay, this is gonna be
fun to watch her face. I don't want to,

1329
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:00,190
by the way,
this is why this is 100%

1330
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,820
no, no. There's another guy. This is,
yeah, that's why it's two guys. One horse.

1331
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:10,654
That's the guys are,

1332
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,180
look how he's holding it to try
to keep it from going into far.

1333
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:14,110
That's my favorite part.

1334
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:22,730
Oh Jesus Christ. Joseph.
Yup. Look at that.

1335
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,470
Do you have any say in it too much?

1336
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:29,720
It doesn't test now.
That's a horse day

1337
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:33,620
and that kills him right there.
Listen to this.

1338
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:38,810
Oh God, he was there.
They were saying he came,

1339
01:16:38,811 --> 01:16:40,970
he came. They were like all
excited that the horse came.

1340
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:46,340
How vial that killed that guy?
Yeah. The guy who was in that video,

1341
01:16:46,341 --> 01:16:51,200
it was a guy that used to go by the name
of Mr Hands. Don't drop. You can do,

1342
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:52,130
you can do this.
Eliza,

1343
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,230
you got through the whole last
comic standing really hot and like,

1344
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,970
what are you doing Bryan? I was trying
to cheer her up with Lemon parties.

1345
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:10,060
What? Blue waffle dubois boy blue. No,

1346
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,300
blue off blue buffalo documentary just
blew off. Why don't you Google that shit?

1347
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,250
It's like the 20th image down. You
have to ingest it. She's really good.

1348
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:24,170
The picture. Oh my God. I'm Google images.

1349
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,480
Blue waffle
can even call it a vagina.

1350
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,210
That's Photoshop Vagina.

1351
01:17:32,211 --> 01:17:35,070
I think some girls with their vagina
get that out of him. Looks like no,

1352
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:36,050
that's not out of hand.

1353
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,220
That looks like the Predator
got in a car accident

1354
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,110
and then drown and then drowned.

1355
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:51,050
I wonder if I can ever jerk off to
that picture if I really tried hard.

1356
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:55,940
If you had to, if you only have
to come like a little dribble,

1357
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,030
you could probably pull out. Yeah,
you can. Yeah, you can. Yeah. You can.

1358
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:06,020
If you're not turned on. I mean you
can't control it like consciously, but,

1359
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:11,150
but factors that'll how hard your cause
more comes more for guys barely turned

1360
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:16,890
on. You like it? Bull bull
challenge this. No, with snow it's,

1361
01:18:16,891 --> 01:18:19,290
it's a fact. If a guy's
not turned on, if you're,

1362
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,250
you're jerking off to a picture
of a fucking disease vagina,

1363
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:23,500
you're not going to get a full of wax.

1364
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:27,290
It's going to be like not going to get a
full much come as you would if you were

1365
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:31,670
super turned on. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Do it flow. I can show you. Show you.

1366
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,800
He'll fuck you and
everything's going to work out.

1367
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:37,490
This is all been a plot by
Brian. Look, see, watch.

1368
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:42,170
Brian don't do this is disrespectful.
She's a girl.

1369
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:43,820
You can't do that. This
kid, that's not cool.

1370
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,250
For the folks listening on Itunes,
Brian just pulled out a big rubber penis,

1371
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,720
which you can't do on a movie set.
Brian, we're where we're number three,

1372
01:18:56,721 --> 01:19:01,230
number seven and number 29 in the top 30
podcast. Did you get that email? Yeah,

1373
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:04,910
that's pretty sweet. We're just
all their episode loaded episodes.

1374
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:07,460
So everybody that's tuning into podcast,

1375
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:11,080
thank you very much and thanks for all
the positive emails and twitters and it's,

1376
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:14,600
this is a lot of fun to do and we enjoy
doing it and we enjoy having people like

1377
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:17,330
a wiser come on. Very polite dog. No,

1378
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:20,330
we're going to keep this
rolling and we said time, no,

1379
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,090
I just wanted to say thank you to
people who have to wait till the end.

1380
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,573
If somebody said,

1381
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:28,190
oh I don't know what people are tweeting
you back because I said something about

1382
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:31,520
Saskatchewan, I'll back it up. Don't
just don't listen to them. You can't,

1383
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:34,060
you can't be this
connected machines control.

1384
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:37,830
You can machines could trailing you man.
That was a good way to,

1385
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,620
the good way to come back. It is
a good way to connect, you know,

1386
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,760
just don't want to connect all the time
because then you're get to eventually

1387
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:44,210
it's going to,

1388
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:47,140
they're going to invade all aspects of
your personal robots will take over. Well,

1389
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,070
who's going to be some
sort of a, you know, hey,

1390
01:19:49,071 --> 01:19:52,160
you know a camera where you can see two V,
two views,

1391
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,610
the view of you and the view that you
see of the world and you can choose,

1392
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:58,010
share these views with people.
That's what's going to happen.

1393
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:01,400
You're going to have your own little
fucking Internet TV channel and it's your

1394
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:04,610
life and you know people.
Some people let them see everything.

1395
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,490
You'll look straight.
You can see out when I'm washing myself,

1396
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,290
but you can't see back.
You can't see me naked.

1397
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:13,060
Like people would draw the line at
which cameras are going to keep on.

1398
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,610
Really someone's taking showers and shit
with cameras on them and move around

1399
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:18,493
the house.

1400
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:24,850
It's called something like she's Roulette
Chevorlet oh, that's totally different.

1401
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,130
That's dudes pulling their dicks out.
What's why it's chat. Realizing they,

1402
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:31,580
I'm uncomfortable with my step mom
was telling me about this solid black.

1403
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,680
She goes, she goes and I went
on to Emily's, my stepsister,

1404
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:37,920
one of Natalie's computer and I could
see her on her friend's looking and I

1405
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,690
didn't know what they were looking
at and I went in their room,

1406
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:44,300
they were on chat roulette and they
were looking at some guy's cock cock,

1407
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,090
no reason. She was like, it was just
a big cock and I was like, yeah,

1408
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,360
I think half a chat roulette is that.
I've never seen, I don't know what,

1409
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:52,711
I've never,

1410
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:55,590
what's cool is they have an iPhone
version and that was one that that's a few

1411
01:20:55,591 --> 01:20:57,540
people to download and
save a bit about this.

1412
01:20:57,541 --> 01:21:00,630
How was one of the few people to download
it and then they pulled it off the

1413
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,480
iTunes store so you can't
download it anymore.

1414
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,590
There's like a good 20,000 people that
downloaded that APP that's still use it

1415
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:11,190
because it's still works, but now
it's, but now there's no new people,

1416
01:21:11,191 --> 01:21:16,050
so you're just start recognizing
penises like, oh, here's Jim again. Yep.

1417
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,630
Is that his wife in the
background when they pull it,

1418
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:22,320
they can't take it off your phone. Like
it will still work. It will still work.

1419
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:26,040
Damn well how come? No one's figured
out a way to get it back to the phone?

1420
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,720
I don't know cause I'm just
getting everybody's fighting.

1421
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,980
Tired of looking at the same cop

1422
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:35,910
that if you ever done that facetime
thing where you have to talk. How's that?

1423
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:40,220
Was that facetime and see if you had an
iPhone you could call me and do video

1424
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:44,610
video. Yeah, I think it did. Yeah.
Cause can you do hit it each time?

1425
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,060
Do you have to have a Wifi
connection now? Uh, yeah. Yeah.

1426
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:50,460
You have to have a wifi connection
and showed that t mobile phone,

1427
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:53,200
the new one that doesn't have wifi but it
has the four g or whatever it's called.

1428
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:56,280
I don't think, I don't know if it'll
work in anything other than apple phones.

1429
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:58,760
But what has this two way video chat?
I think it only works apple.

1430
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:01,620
I think you've got Skype now.
If you have Skype video now,

1431
01:22:01,621 --> 01:22:02,640
just groups released on the

1432
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:08,630
Skype video. So you can do the
same thing as this. Yeah. And it's,

1433
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:12,150
that would be more universal. Skype video
is actually three g two. It's not Wifi,

1434
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:17,100
uh, Skype video. So the jerking
off his back on back on,

1435
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,720
is that what it is? A lot of that.
A lot of two way jerking off.

1436
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:23,460
Is there a way to record it?
Oh,

1437
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:27,290
somebody secretly record Brett Farve Dick
was to 8 trillion off totally theirs.

1438
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:31,520
I don't think it's his dick. No. Why
you say that? Because I mean it was

1439
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,270
maybe after he had um,
practice when he was really tired.

1440
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,123
He gets it up.

1441
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:48,960
Do you have imagined you could imagine
a different, right. I have in my dreams.

1442
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:53,640
How would you imagine Brett farms cock
to be like a wolf shoulder pads and warp

1443
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:54,474
radiator cock?

1444
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,100
He liked to think of your superheroes
is having superior wiener is kind of a

1445
01:22:59,101 --> 01:23:02,100
trip when you see a dude with gray hair
out there playing professional football

1446
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:04,920
and log.
Really what the hell is going on here?

1447
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:10,150
What's going on? How are you doing
this? How are you playing old though?

1448
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:14,860
He just has gray hair. He's 40 something
old for a professional football player,

1449
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,840
it's the magic white is balls look like.
Nope.

1450
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:20,710
There's lots of old people in athletics
that are able to compete somehow or

1451
01:23:20,711 --> 01:23:24,370
another after age 40 there's not
that many. It's pretty fucking small.

1452
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:30,160
Yes. Quarterbacks. They're not as known
as impact as a quarterback and linebacker.

1453
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:34,330
They're getting nailed on the
as often as like a bigger guy.

1454
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,520
But when they get nailed
that getting the extra hard,

1455
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:39,300
cause they are like a little bonus,
you know, take out the quarterback.

1456
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:42,610
People get very excited to do that.
And the quarter in fact jail. Yes.

1457
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:46,510
You know they're going to
change football though folks.

1458
01:23:46,511 --> 01:23:49,340
They're gonna put fucking centers in
Canton. Their helmets, they're to,

1459
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:53,290
they're going to find out what kind of
impact people get. Crest has let me style.

1460
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:53,951
Oh I thought you meant so.

1461
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:57,190
They could have cursed my belief it
like if they were hearing it from their

1462
01:23:57,191 --> 01:23:59,020
point of view,
like I'm wondering if football,

1463
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,320
the football has a real
issue with head injuries.

1464
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:07,780
A lot of these guys are getting like
really massive brain damage and then as

1465
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:11,290
they're older men, they're just fucked
up. They would get Lou Gehrig's disease.

1466
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:15,250
They have all of these issues. They
eventually become paralyzed. Some of them,

1467
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:19,510
their body just just eventually shuts
down and it's from continued head trauma

1468
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:23,390
or smashing their head into
these fucking helmets. And so a,

1469
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:27,580
they're going to start making them wear
these sensors that detect what kind of

1470
01:24:27,581 --> 01:24:28,480
impact they get.

1471
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:33,690
And they do it for hockey because they're
probably not more body and on hockey

1472
01:24:34,631 --> 01:24:37,900
they slam into each other and everybody's
slides around too. You know, it's like,

1473
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:40,420
it's probably better to be on ice when
you're slamming into each other because

1474
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:43,330
even though they hit you really hard,
there's a little, there's, it's slippery.

1475
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:46,990
You not dug into the ground like you
are like in a football field where it's

1476
01:24:46,991 --> 01:24:49,270
dirt and you're running
and you're running a,

1477
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,030
they'd absorbed saying guess more
impact in packets it stationary. Yeah.

1478
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,010
I just feel like you would move.

1479
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:57,160
I mean that's why like hockey
fights don't seem as dangerous.

1480
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:59,600
I mean sometimes guys get fucked
up and hockey fights. I saw guy,

1481
01:24:59,601 --> 01:25:03,470
but it's his own helmet. Oh, that's not
right. It's an accident. But it happened.

1482
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:07,260
That's the Douchey move, you know, hockey
fight, everybody knows he puts the,

1483
01:25:07,261 --> 01:25:10,210
take the gloves off and you
circle and then he'd go at it.

1484
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:13,780
You don't be hitting people with their
fucking helmet. That's this week. Shit.

1485
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,280
There's nothing worse.
I will say this,

1486
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:16,570
I just remember playing
sports in high school.

1487
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:19,150
There's nothing worse than
when you aim to hurt someone,

1488
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:22,270
but you accidentally hurt them in a way
you didn't intend to and it looks more

1489
01:25:22,271 --> 01:25:24,480
aggressive than you meant and
that's when you're like, that's,

1490
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:26,260
I didn't mean to punch her in the mouth.

1491
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,840
I meant for it and it was an
accident and it gets caught.

1492
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,410
And so you are like a super
competitive person. You're,

1493
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,250
you're there throwing in cheap shots.

1494
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,530
Did you throw cheap shots on girls
in Lacrosse? A lot of yellow cars.

1495
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,130
Oh my nickname.

1496
01:25:38,131 --> 01:25:41,740
You one of my Nigga was butcher because
I was defense and I took it very serious.

1497
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:44,230
Oh, you're mean. So you would
just hit them with their sticks,

1498
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:48,400
hit them with the sticks and shit really,
as opposed to not do it anyway. Right.

1499
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:52,420
A little love tap.
He hit him with a stick.

1500
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,780
Like I was hitting bitches with
sticks, man. She was playing Lacrosse.

1501
01:25:55,781 --> 01:25:57,700
He was hitting chicks
with sticks from Texas.

1502
01:25:57,701 --> 01:26:00,250
They don't like one of my worst memories
from high school. I got a red card.

1503
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,100
You know what? You would be into
union. You would be into martial arts.

1504
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,790
Have you ever done any martial arts?
You are so aggressive.

1505
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,770
That would be such a good thing for you.

1506
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:13,010
I would love to take something just
so I could back. Like when, uh,

1507
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,350
when it's something like a girl
is a bitch and a nightclub,

1508
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,770
I would be able to back up
my shit talking. Well, you
don't want to fight. No,

1509
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:20,450
but I feel confident enough it'll,

1510
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:23,300
it'll be better because you won't be
worried about it ever get in a fight.

1511
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:25,820
But I would like that confidence
to know that I could handle it.

1512
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,990
I just mean for just getting all
this energy out of you. Like in,

1513
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,640
you mean the elliptical 20 minutes
a day isn't going to do it.

1514
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:34,760
It's not going to do it. No. You need to
hit something. You need to hit something.

1515
01:26:34,761 --> 01:26:37,880
Where should I go? Well, I'll, we'll
talk afterwards. Tell me where,

1516
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:40,550
where you live because you don't
want to tell these fucking freaks.

1517
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,650
These online people are listening.
No, but can I tell you something? Yes.

1518
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,310
Speaking of where you live,
somebody sent this to me.

1519
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:48,800
I'll give you the address right now.
Somebody sent this to me.

1520
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:52,250
There was a website you can go to and it's
probably a bunch of these. Here it is.

1521
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:53,983
It's called

1522
01:26:56,270 --> 01:27:01,270
spokeo.com s p o k e o.com and you can
type in your name and your name will come

1523
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:06,170
up where you live. Don't say this.
No, no. You can block yourself.

1524
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,720
I took myself off of it this morning.
That's what I'm telling you. Anyone,

1525
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:11,510
they'll tell you how much your house is
worth. Let's talk about this letter. No,

1526
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:14,540
people should take themselves off
if people are going to find you.

1527
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:18,500
If they want to find you. Oh
yeah, it's 2010, 11 nine stone.

1528
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,400
But you should use your block yourself.
Yeah. You shouldn't promote this.

1529
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:26,840
I was pissed and I said my house
was worth less than it was. Yeah.

1530
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:29,480
So don't tell me where you live on
the air, but afterwards, um, I'll,

1531
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:30,560
I'll find a place.
That scenario,

1532
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:33,550
I don't want to get kicked in the shins
or hitting the boob or in the mouth.

1533
01:27:33,551 --> 01:27:36,410
You have protection for all
of those things done. But uh,

1534
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:40,400
really the best thing for a girl to learn
his Jiu Jitsu because Ju Jitsu is not

1535
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:44,060
really reliant on strength.
It's really more reliant on technique.

1536
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:48,110
So you could actually subdue a man.
Like you could choke a man like Dan,

1537
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:48,951
my friend Felicia,

1538
01:27:48,951 --> 01:27:53,180
she weighs about 130 pounds and
she fucks men up all the time.

1539
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:56,210
She's a black belt. And the men,
it's so frustrating for men.

1540
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:59,990
There's nothing they can do. Two pressure
points. No, it's just, it's technique.

1541
01:27:59,991 --> 01:28:03,650
It's chokes and arm locks and stuff
like that. But when you do it correctly,

1542
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,910
so if you get attacked by rapists,

1543
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:07,830
he will grab him and throw him on the
ground and start rolling around with him.

1544
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:12,930
I want to learn small joint manipulation.
That shit doesn't work. Yeah.

1545
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,770
No Dude's will let you break.
Their fingers are still punching the face.

1546
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:18,230
It doesn't work. Believe me,
when adrenaline's flowing,

1547
01:28:18,231 --> 01:28:19,560
you're not even going to feel that finger.
Oh,

1548
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:21,230
was not for fights and
still just being annoying.

1549
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:25,930
It doesn't really work where it pulled
her hand away. Went fucking handbag. No.

1550
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:28,850
That's why you have to be smart.
I only pick on people weaker than me.

1551
01:28:28,990 --> 01:28:33,990
When we get that you or your friends see
you pull them into your web and break

1552
01:28:34,461 --> 01:28:37,910
their fingers. So fucking
some weird maneuver. See,

1553
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:41,480
you're a competitive person and this is
like, it's all natural and it's just,

1554
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:46,460
it'll help you so much if you just fucking
punch at a heavy bag or do a Jujitsu

1555
01:28:46,461 --> 01:28:49,190
class, like it'd be so much
more relaxed. I would love to.

1556
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:52,940
I would love to take something
like that. It's fun. It's fun. I,

1557
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:56,060
that's not a thing you have you
ever tried yoga? I have done yoga.

1558
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:59,660
I like to move and that's very, I don't
enjoy meditating and stuff like that.

1559
01:28:59,661 --> 01:29:02,490
That's very hard. Right, but
is not just in meditation.

1560
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:06,950
It's just the ability to, to relax in
these really uncomfortable positions.

1561
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:11,490
Strength Them. It's good for you though,
is good for you. You can. There's other,

1562
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:13,790
I do it rarely though. I
talk a lot of shit, but I,

1563
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:17,220
if I take one yoga class a month,
it's a lot. I do it when on my own,

1564
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:20,850
like before shows, I always do it.
It helps you warm up, stretch out,

1565
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:26,070
relax my body. I think green tea, green
tea and massages now just green tea. Okay.

1566
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:30,690
Does it energize?
Got Some caffeine in I think,

1567
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:32,820
but I don't think it's like as much
as a cup of coffee or anything.

1568
01:29:32,821 --> 01:29:35,530
I think it's less than that, but it's
probably healthier for you. You know?

1569
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:39,030
It's a shit. You're a [inaudible].
You ever heard that? Yeah.

1570
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:40,230
You'd be throw some honey in there.

1571
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:43,740
It's a interesting t because it gives
you a different kind of stimulant.

1572
01:29:43,741 --> 01:29:48,360
It's different than the caffeine. Sort of
a coffee stimulant is a little clearer.

1573
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,220
Little clearheaded.
It's not as buzzy.

1574
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:52,680
It's not as fucking now it's called
fuck around and start a business.

1575
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,970
I made some fucked up decisions,

1576
01:29:56,971 --> 01:30:00,900
high out coffee because coffee
will get you motivated to do shit.

1577
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,380
I fought in a tournament
once when I was a kid.

1578
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:06,690
I was delivering newspapers and I was,

1579
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:11,100
I had been injured and I wasn't training
and I decided that day of that I was

1580
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:14,820
going to fight the tournament after I
ate two donuts and drank a big cup of

1581
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:18,870
coffee and I was fucking wired
and I'm like, I want a cool fight.

1582
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,080
And so I entered into this tournament
just because a coffee. Totally. Yeah.

1583
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:26,040
I don't one of want to be in
like really big tournament.

1584
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:29,890
For me it was a u s open.
I drink a red bull before I go on an age

1585
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:37,100
VCO taekwondo, I was a high
window. You guys open. It was a,

1586
01:30:37,101 --> 01:30:39,060
I would have never even fought.
And if it wasn't for the coffee,

1587
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:41,520
coffee just had me so convinced
that it was a fun thing to do.

1588
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,840
Let's go fucking do this and coffee. Well,
back then I was competing, so it was,

1589
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:48,330
it was really the only reason why I wasn't
going to fight in a tournament that I

1590
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:49,800
had an injury.
But the injury,

1591
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:54,420
like it kind of healed itself over the
week that I had off and just too fucking

1592
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:56,220
Boston cream donuts,
which is like,

1593
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:01,460
who knows how many and sang
grams of sugars in there
and a giant thing of Dunkin

1594
01:31:01,651 --> 01:31:05,510
donuts coffee, one of those big ones,
like a 16 ouncers crap. Your brains out,

1595
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:10,860
explosions household just
opens up and it just,

1596
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:15,650
just the way it comes out to, it's
so easy. It just all comes out. Yeah.

1597
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:19,670
You know what sucks on, it's kind
of on the same thing. Uh, I, uh,

1598
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,680
did one of those things where you go
to the bathroom before you get in the

1599
01:31:21,681 --> 01:31:24,050
shower, you don't flush the toilet
because you don't want it. The shower,

1600
01:31:24,051 --> 01:31:27,530
did she use that water? And I left it
there. My cat has been drinking out.

1601
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:29,920
Fuck up.
Wait,

1602
01:31:29,921 --> 01:31:34,130
can I tell you something
there that doesn't do a lot
of houses aren't made that

1603
01:31:34,131 --> 01:31:38,960
way anymore. What? Oh yeah.
Well, I'm not fancy mic.

1604
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:42,460
Fancy person. My building's old. I'm just
saying like, that doesn't always happen.

1605
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:45,720
You might want to flush. No, no, let
go. And I flushed. It changes though.

1606
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:49,850
The water everywhere at my house. The
whole water, the water's freezing.

1607
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:53,730
Freezing like 45 seconds minute.

1608
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,500
That's ridiculous.
Oh yeah.

1609
01:31:56,930 --> 01:32:01,920
I live in a old ass fucking engineering
house. That's some polio. Yeah.

1610
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,570
Anyways, the cat got in it and
I don't know what happened,

1611
01:32:04,571 --> 01:32:07,720
but it came outside and there's
just like Paul Shit everywhere.

1612
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:13,180
She's so then I didn't have anything
to clean it up with except Windex and

1613
01:32:13,181 --> 01:32:16,110
pledge
shit.

1614
01:32:18,570 --> 01:32:22,460
It smells better, you know,
it's so I squirted on there.

1615
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,700
The Windex actually cleaned a lot,

1616
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:28,150
but then the next day I was just like
looking at my floor and he's a little

1617
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:31,840
white dots everywhere on the floor and
you can see it looks like a cat ghost

1618
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:36,750
walked, you know, like,
oh, that's disgusting.

1619
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,900
It's awful.
Yeah.

1620
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:40,630
There's nothing quite like a Turd that
you forget about and then you come back

1621
01:32:40,631 --> 01:32:42,670
to it the next day. Oh
that's, you have to flush it.

1622
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:46,080
And it had been sitting there stewing.
You took a shit while you're on the phone.

1623
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:49,390
He didn't want to the person to hear
the flushing and the background to know

1624
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:51,580
you're a human.
I take so many dumps them on the phone,

1625
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,950
so I take some of my
best phone conversation.

1626
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:57,100
Have you ever had your
girlfriend or wife or whatever?

1627
01:32:57,101 --> 01:32:58,810
Like I had like two months ago,

1628
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,030
walked in and she forgot to
flush and had one of those,

1629
01:33:01,031 --> 01:33:04,810
like what I was looking at
her and was like inevitable,

1630
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:06,040
huge Joey Dee and shit.

1631
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:11,130
It's inevitable. I hate that. Why are we
talking about poop? People drop logs, son.

1632
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:14,270
It's a part of life. That's what my
daughter talks about. I call it now,

1633
01:33:14,271 --> 01:33:18,230
she's two and a half. She calls it drop
his log because they keep telling me,

1634
01:33:18,231 --> 01:33:22,010
did you drop it? Log you drop a log in
your body that got them dropping. Lars,

1635
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:27,590
when kids find out what's
funny and what makes you laugh,

1636
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:31,200
they just repeated over and over again.
So she has her own account comics. Yeah,

1637
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,990
very similar.
Really the same thing.

1638
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,350
Is that a fucked up thing when someone
goes to see you and you know they're

1639
01:33:36,351 --> 01:33:40,690
going to see the same show like the
next night? Just want to be like,

1640
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:45,050
as I'm telling the joke, we were like,
and you probably, as I'm saying it,

1641
01:33:45,051 --> 01:33:47,060
I want to stop and be like, look, I
know you know where I'm going to say,

1642
01:33:47,061 --> 01:33:51,940
but if you could just be
quiet for everyone else,
she'll sit on your lap. Yeah,

1643
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:55,460
that's a weird, like I've, I've talked
to people before shows. I go, dude,

1644
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:58,100
we love you so much for coming. See you
every night that you have shows like,

1645
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,600
Yikes,

1646
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:03,500
what we've got to open every show totally
different and it makes my material up

1647
01:34:03,501 --> 01:34:07,220
and fucker can't tell the same jokes
over and over again with the same timing.

1648
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:11,420
It takes a long ass time of repeating
a joke too to get it effortless to the

1649
01:34:11,421 --> 01:34:14,660
point where it looks like you're
thinking it up out in the moment and when

1650
01:34:14,661 --> 01:34:19,070
someone sees behind the curtain like that
two nights in a row, it's, it's weird.

1651
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:22,630
I've had people yell out a
punchline before, oh that's brutal.

1652
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:27,020
You get so nervous to take that pause
that you need for whatever your joke is

1653
01:34:27,021 --> 01:34:30,340
just for timing sake. And then they're
like goats and you're like, yeah,

1654
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:33,620
that's a such a douchey move in PR.
The problem is with with youtube,

1655
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,670
like your material gets online, it takes
like a long ass time to develop it. Joke.

1656
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:40,040
People don't know.
It starts off,

1657
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,490
starts off as like it's something funny
in this or something funny in this,

1658
01:34:43,491 --> 01:34:44,840
right?
I mean that's how I always started out.

1659
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:46,010
Like what the fuck is funny in this?

1660
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:48,500
There's something funny in this and
that a lot of times I'll have a bunch of

1661
01:34:48,501 --> 01:34:51,450
different ideas, different ways
to go that I've written out, but,

1662
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,700
but it takes a long ass time to figure
out which way I'm going to go with it.

1663
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,260
I have to do it over and
over and over again. So for,

1664
01:34:57,261 --> 01:34:58,670
if someone gets a hold of it,

1665
01:34:58,671 --> 01:35:01,970
like in that process and then puts it
up on youtube and then everybody watches

1666
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:05,250
it and then they come to the show and
they yell out your punch line. Yeah,

1667
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:09,950
it just doubled. Triple fucked you.
They're not doing it to be dicks.

1668
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:13,310
Like they're so excited to be
there. Yeah. There's a lot of that.

1669
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:15,860
And there's some people that are just
douche bags and they fuck up everything

1670
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:19,460
they touch and they just can't help
them. They are, man. That's true.

1671
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:20,930
You can get some toxic people.

1672
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,860
People come up to me after and they'll
reference a joke I did not 20 minutes

1673
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:27,340
earlier and I take myself so seriously.

1674
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:30,320
I won't realize that they're
referencing it and I'll be like,

1675
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:33,620
I have a bit about that. They're like, I
know. That's why I just talked about that.

1676
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:37,460
I'm like, oh right. Do you guys want to
tee shirt? That's funny. You sell merge?

1677
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:41,360
Yeah. What is your t shirt say? I have a
bunch of them. Do you have any sexy ones?

1678
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:46,290
You have the Grey Cup on stuff that I
don't should do that dude by that do what?

1679
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:49,970
Daisy Duke back from the old
dukes of Hazzard days. Oh yeah.

1680
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,090
Get a tee shirt with my face on it.
If you go to my Facebook page,

1681
01:35:53,091 --> 01:35:55,120
you can see my album cover.
It's not sexy, but there's many,

1682
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,610
cause he's got some glamour shots online.

1683
01:35:58,611 --> 01:36:02,540
I saw some cover your album
cover. It's super, super,

1684
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,010
super glamour shot.

1685
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:07,220
I mean it was supposed to be like an
eighties glamour shot thing as to what

1686
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:11,660
exactly it looks at it. It's
so, no, that's not the one
I'm talking about. Oh yeah,

1687
01:36:11,661 --> 01:36:16,180
I like that. That's how powerful
I like that. Eliza alive. Jesus.

1688
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:20,120
Your CD this out right now. Yeah, it's on
iTunes. You can get it on Itunes, iTunes,

1689
01:36:20,121 --> 01:36:22,840
the DVDs coming out. If you're
anti-apple where else can they get it?

1690
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:26,780
Can they get it on Amazon? Your
website, [inaudible] dot com powerful.

1691
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:29,440
Do you actually sell it as a physical
CD or do you have them printed?

1692
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,510
I just got him. Isn't it crazy that
those students still exist? Yeah.

1693
01:36:32,511 --> 01:36:35,550
You know what I saw is it called a drop
card? Do you know what this is? No.

1694
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,820
My friend showed this to me.
It's a car.

1695
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:41,000
You pay me for the CDI give you this
card and it's so you take it home and you

1696
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:45,460
download it with a code. So it was like a
free download, that gift card drop card.

1697
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:48,380
That's cool. That is cool.
You know? Do you think,

1698
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:52,010
I mean it's only a matter of time before
a solid state media just disappears.

1699
01:36:52,011 --> 01:36:56,530
Right? Like actual physical media, like
a physical DVD or a physical, right?

1700
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:01,130
No, and I don't buy cds anymore. I
stopped. I just, everything on Itunes,

1701
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,970
I just buy him to use it to snort
cocaine, cocaine off. So bad ass, dude.

1702
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,010
You know what I love when,
when I'm in a fucking,

1703
01:37:07,011 --> 01:37:09,890
like there was a song the other day,
I couldn't figure out who it was.

1704
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:13,740
And so I put up that Shizam thing.
Oh, I have that. Yeah. There's a,

1705
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,060
if there were folks who don't know,
it's a program that lets you a your plate.

1706
01:37:17,061 --> 01:37:19,190
There's a music playing in the background.
You,

1707
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:21,290
you press Shizam it listens to the music,

1708
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,800

tells you who sung the song,

1709
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:27,860
what the song's title is in [inaudible]
she has you will a link that you could

1710
01:37:27,861 --> 01:37:30,330
buy it on iTunes right
there and going to play it.

1711
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:32,540
You can play it right there too.
You can play it.

1712
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:35,960
Just press play and it's playing on
your phone. It's fucking incredible.

1713
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:38,810
And it's called [inaudible] and I've
just been buying songs like that and just

1714
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:43,640
add them to my iPhone. This all but I love
the song. Bam. Is there a way on apple,

1715
01:37:43,641 --> 01:37:47,030
like an apple on iTunes?
Like when I download music to work out,

1716
01:37:47,031 --> 01:37:49,610
I always like to do like top
40 like what's on the radio.

1717
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:51,530
Is there where you can search on Itunes,

1718
01:37:51,531 --> 01:37:55,320
like top 40 hip hop songs and it'll bring
it off? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Probably.

1719
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,190
Yeah.
Well,

1720
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,010
all you have to do is to look at it looked
like the top 10 lists and stuff like

1721
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:01,940
that. You know, like maybe like just in
hip hop. I don't want like billboard.

1722
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:05,040
I want absolutely. You were into hip
hop. What kind of laptop do you like?

1723
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:09,620
Do you like old shit? Like Gangstarr
uh, thanks. I did. It depends.

1724
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:13,950
Any one hit wonder within the realm of
hip hop, rnb or rap for the last 15 years.

1725
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:17,220
I know, right? I'm more of a radio
part. I love the radiant word.

1726
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:20,220
Have you ever heard of Dmard? [inaudible]
you haven't heard of the yards?

1727

launched them. I'm an angel. No,

that funny? Yeah, it's a trip. Yeah,

1731

it's awesome. Um, dirty.

1732
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:43,440
We always overdo this video, but it's
so good. Yeah. Put on the deaf side one.

1733
01:38:43,441 --> 01:38:45,390
She's got to see this shit.
Yeah. Check this shit out.

1734
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,400
That's my mom passed. Go full screen.
It's going to be a guy shooting himself.

1735
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:53,790
It's going to race that.
Okay. Well not easy.

1736
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:57,460
I think this with his granny and then I
lived with my mom and dad down the road.

1737
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,020
And then you land lives

1738
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:06,190
Africans for how long? The
whole time. Since we are small.

1739
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:11,670
And you decided to do this, why is
this recent? Well he died. He's got,

1740
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:13,940
he owns a cheesy shit.
Okay.

1741
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:18,240
Makes that next level of
beats and basically like I
got some serious lag. Gags.

1742

The skill, you know in the
mock? Yeah. Yeah. Are they
being serious? I'll fuck you.

1743
01:39:22,631 --> 01:39:23,410
Here we go.

1744
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:27,310
Yeah. Dj Hot deck did up the
mother fucking beat box dog.

1745
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:30,850
Bring that next level shit.

01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:35,383
Yeah.

1747
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:40,480
What about be so quick suboptimal.

1748
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,820
This pops up.
You'll feel

1749
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:50,670
that I need to bring light to be static.
Stepped off the box.

1750
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,423
Digital Zone.

1751
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:58,360
I'm scoping probing Mondo three last week

1752
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:05,110
when I see things on the ship going to
teach today. Can I touch you friend?

1753
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,150
Come on. This is a trip, Aisha.
You've ever seen? Awesome.

1754
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:16,560
These guys are the shit person made
the video knows what the fuck her fuck.

1755
01:40:16,561 --> 01:40:20,780
Yeah they do. It's so awesome to
be a joke. No, it's not a giant,

1756
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:24,930
a bad ass band. I met them. They came
alive. Yeah, they're bad ass man.

1757
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:29,750
Good. She says cause
like some hipster shit.

1758
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:33,440
Oh No, you're kidding. I love
them. They're fucking bad ass.

1759
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,170
They have a bunch of bad ass
songs. Yeah. Tough accent.

1760
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,100
What kind of rap do you like? All
the top 40 shit. What do you like?

1761
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,870
I just like whatever is on the right.
Whatever's on a hip hop station right now.

1762
01:40:41,871 --> 01:40:45,410
I know. Wow. I just like
rap and hip hop. Oh, okay.

1763
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:49,160
Whatever's on that.
Can she only no radio edits of songs?

1764
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:50,840
I don't know if there's a curse word.
I don't know what cause

1765
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,070
that's the only kind of music

1766
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,810
you listen to really.
I'm in the car lot.

1767
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:00,221
It's an excuse.

1768
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:03,730
Like in the car you can only get top 40
you never know who's listening. Ipod,

1769
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:07,420
I don't like listening to it unless I'm
working out. So I only like fast songs.

1770
01:41:07,421 --> 01:41:10,450
I can work out to my girl talk
or something. I don't know.

1771
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,980
I've been hearing a lot of people,
the girl talks could, yeah.

1772
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:16,330
I haven't been hearing a lot of people
saying that the podcast is the best for

1773
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:18,070
working out nowadays because it's,
he's like,

1774
01:41:18,071 --> 01:41:20,520
you're not getting lost in
music and board. You know,

1775
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:24,070
cause I always stop and take it out
and switch it if it's a bad song.

1776
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,030
Right around your workout.

1777
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:28,780
I got a lot of Twitter messages from
dudes listen to us when they're doing the

1778
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,800
workouts and driving to a lot of driving
people. Yeah. I cannot listen to music.

1779
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,720
I couldn't listen to someone talk really.

1780
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,340
I've listened to a bunch of lectures
and I've listened to a few podcasts too.

1781
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:42,670
I listen to a cool Graham Hancock podcast
recently that was listening to that

1782
01:41:42,671 --> 01:41:43,540
while I was driving around.

1783
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,710
So be able to focus off it over the sound
of my heart bursting out of my chest

1784
01:41:47,711 --> 01:41:51,590
while I run. So you can only
listen to music as I was saying.

1785
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,240
Yeah, I see what you're saying
when you're working out. Yeah.

1786
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,460
You know what else works that
I found this out two days ago.

1787
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,530
I was at the gym and I have the
TVS attached to the treadmill.

1788
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:03,610
They won't like the nature channel and
I was watching a cheetah run down a

1789
01:42:03,611 --> 01:42:07,840
gazelle and they slowed it down and I got
so into it cause you don't know what's

1790
01:42:07,841 --> 01:42:08,441
going to happen.

1791
01:42:08,441 --> 01:42:12,040
And I found myself going faster
watching this cheetah and it was super

1792
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:14,770
animalistic and he got him in
the end and I was happy for him.

1793
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:16,330
I felt bad for the,
for the antelope

1794
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:20,970
that antelope had to die eventually.
Yeah.

1795
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:24,130
Like he's going to live forever and
cure cancer. You don't know that.

1796
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:27,340
I know those antelopes. They never
give a shit. They just welfare.

1797
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:31,300
They eat and poop. That's all they do.
Nothing gets done in the antelope world,

1798
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:35,070
just running around, running from
Cheetahs and shit. There's just run.

1799
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:36,720
It was a rush on that.

1800
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:41,530
Did you see that video that someone
put on line of a African hunters like

1801
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,940
recent? Within the last
50 60 years. I got the,

1802
01:42:43,941 --> 01:42:47,950
I believe it's a video from the
60s of a hunting with spears,

1803
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:51,850
hunting elephants and hippos with spears.
Oh Dude,

1804
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:55,050
it is a fucking rat.
I don't want to see hippos.

1805
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:59,110
I to stagers animal in the animal kingdom.
You know they're giant pigs.

1806
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,760
I did not know that. Yeah. Hippos.
Hippos are in the pig family.

1807
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,560
They're giant fucking mean.

1808
01:43:05,561 --> 01:43:09,530
Pigs eat people are they fucking
warriors of the videos of,

1809
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:12,490
I don't know what the name of the
warriors are because they know they were

1810
01:43:12,491 --> 01:43:17,230
wearing a merit like they're wearing
like t shirts and shit cause we gave them

1811
01:43:17,231 --> 01:43:20,440
to them probably. Yeah. Yeah. We gave
them to them in exchange for filming them.

1812
01:43:20,441 --> 01:43:24,250
Fucking up these hippos shit spears.
If you want to find it good.

1813
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:26,620
Go to twitter.com/joe Rogan.

1814
01:43:26,621 --> 01:43:30,310
This thing was recorded on January 4th.
Um,

1815
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:33,760
and so I'm pretty sure I put it
up on January 3rd. You should.

1816
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:36,730
You should check it out cause it's
a trip. It's, it's so hard to watch.

1817
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,070
It's really freaky cause they think they,

1818
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:42,070
it takes a long ass time to kill
an elephant with spears. Sure.

1819
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:45,940
I had it sounds off and they all like,
they all work together.

1820
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:48,280
Like the whole tribe, we'll work
together to take down these animals.

1821
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,070
So they have like,
you know,

1822
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:52,790
literally thousands of people circling
these and they're choking them off.

1823
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,970
They make this big circle and then they
forced the animals into the center and

1824
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:57,980
then they spear him to death.
I guess they gotta eat.

1825
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:00,860
You gotta eat and there's no other
way to do it. You know, they have,

1826
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:05,150
they have no options. It just go to the
store. I think it would just devolve.

1827
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:08,090
Why don't you have electricity yet?
You're so stupid.

1828
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:12,440
It's amazing that they really are still
living the way they lived thousands of

1829
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:12,830
years ago.

1830
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:16,880
I went to Africa a couple of times when
we went on a safari and you get to like

1831
01:44:16,881 --> 01:44:19,460
hang out with the mass. I wars and
like see how they live and like,

1832
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:22,160
obviously you pay them and they give you
a tour and a little bit of it's fake.

1833
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,590
But there's like sanctions,
like in the Serengeti,

1834
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:28,970
they can't go around killing like lions
and stuff so they have to eat like

1835
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:32,810
normal, like they can't do it. Like you
have to be a super rural tribe to do that.

1836
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:34,490
Like a lot of them,
even though they live in that land,

1837
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:38,360
they're not allowed to kill the animals
cause so the ones that are super rural,

1838
01:44:38,361 --> 01:44:41,570
they are allowed to,
there's no one like regulating that.

1839
01:44:41,571 --> 01:44:44,850
But like closer to like where like
the capitals or wherever we were,

1840
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:49,340
we're more tourists go wow. They're not
allowed to do. There's a great story,

1841
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:53,330
not a great story, but a fascinating,
a terrible story. Terrible story.

1842
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:57,950
There was a guy who was on safari and he
was in the shower and two lions came in

1843
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:02,190
and killed them and dragged him out
of the shower. Wow. That is terrible.

1844
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:06,140
Fucking imagine taking a
shower. What? You know what man?

1845
01:45:06,141 --> 01:45:08,180
He's on some safari on a hunting safari.
It was,

1846
01:45:08,181 --> 01:45:11,900
we saw that movie hangover movie
hangover when he walked into the,

1847
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:16,890
there's a tiger in the bathroom. Yeah,
it's totally the same time. Totally is.

1848
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,370
You say, Hey, what are you
doing there? And then they go,

1849
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:24,290
you gotta be real calm about, hey,
what are you doing there? That guy,

1850
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:28,190
that's the guy that's seen a lot of
bears. That's so funny. That was me.

1851
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:33,340
You would see dripping from the pis coming
out of my ankles long for the fucking

1852
01:45:33,651 --> 01:45:38,180
bear. Got to where he was. I would be
ranting. I was a on that bear's head. Jo,

1853
01:45:38,181 --> 01:45:42,200
have you seen these helmets
that these motorcycle jacket
guys? Uh, where nowadays,

1854
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:42,950
like my friend,

1855
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:47,030
he took off his helmet and it had like
this big glass part over it and he was

1856
01:45:47,031 --> 01:45:50,060
just put it up and they had like the
sunglass thing that it goes, you know,

1857
01:45:50,061 --> 01:45:50,870
it comes down,

1858
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:55,190
it opens that up and he's just
blaring his iPhone music and I'm like,

1859
01:45:55,191 --> 01:45:58,970
what is that? He, the whole thing is like
a Bluetooth Stereo cone. Like he says,

1860
01:45:58,971 --> 01:46:02,210
he puts it on God. Then what? What
happens if he can't hear fucking

1861
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:07,880
thing? It's like, he's like, it's like
being in Tron. He's like, you're just,

1862
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:10,970
that guy is crazy. Yeah, it's
a helmet. It's cutting out.

1863
01:46:10,971 --> 01:46:14,120
One of his sense is I took a photo of it.
That's the legal,

1864
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:16,490
their iPod on your
earphones on and your car.

1865
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:18,810
So I can't believe that would be legal.
Yeah.

1866
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,210
Doesn't make any sense because first
of all, you have to wear a seatbelt,

1867
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:25,250
but fucking motorcycles don't have
any seat belts. It's impossible.

1868
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,940
Should check why that's the
worst thing that could happen.

1869
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:33,700
And it's stuck on the bike. Is that things
rolling and tumbling and fuck. Yeah.

1870
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:38,570
Better. If you can slide. If you can lay
the bike down and you just skid, you know,

1871
01:46:38,571 --> 01:46:41,210
if you have the right clothing on,
if you know how to ride a bike,

1872
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:43,260
maybe like a CD, it
could be tethered, doc.

1873
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:46,070
You don't lose it would you just don't
want to get run over by your own bike and

1874
01:46:46,071 --> 01:46:50,190
pinned underneath it. Smashed and have
it fall on top of you a bunch of times.

1875
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:53,190
Over and over. Yeah, put down a hill.

1876
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:55,920
Motorcycle accidents are some scary shit,
man.

1877
01:46:56,040 --> 01:47:00,150
It's like trine and see this the same
Bluetooth thing that a answer calls turn

1878
01:47:00,151 --> 01:47:03,660
up the volume. That's so insane. Cause
take your hand off the fucking motorcycle,

1879
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:07,500
right. Handles and presses. Stupid Button.
Fiddle with it on the side of your head.

1880
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,010
Guarantee you someone's going to die
because they're trying to make a call and

1881
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:14,400
it's fucking piece of shit and
I ain't ringing. Oh my God,

1882
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:17,340
that's a horrible idea.
That's ridiculous.

1883
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,270
People are crazy motherfuckers.
You know it has to be a trip though.

1884
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:25,520
The one like 120 miles an hour while
you're blaring led Zepplin and your high

1885
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:29,040
high on se survive.
It must be the shit.

1886
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:32,820
But I mean you've got to be a reckless
motherfucker to want to do that.

1887
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:35,820
That's like only appeals
to people with Toxoplasma.

1888
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,670
That's like a hundred percent
toxoplasma activity. What's that?

1889
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:43,680
What's that cat parasite thing?
You ever heard of this fucking,

1890
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:45,600
we talk about it way
too much of the podcast.

1891
01:47:45,601 --> 01:47:47,820
I apologize everybody who
has to hear this again,

1892
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:52,290
but there's a crazy cat parasite that
affects human beings and makes them more

1893
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:54,270
reckless and makes him reckless.

1894
01:47:54,271 --> 01:47:58,720
It makes a women more sexually promiscuous
and make some more, more planning.

1895
01:47:58,721 --> 01:47:59,850
I would get it from cats.

1896
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:05,280
People get it from touching cat feces
or being around fields where cats and

1897
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,590
something happens and they
touch the, the, you know,

1898
01:48:07,591 --> 01:48:12,340
the cat feces in a field and
she get it from eating cat.
Yes. She can get it. Yeah,

1899
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,600
definitely. And you have to,
especially a cat that shit's outside.

1900
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:17,820
Those are the cats that are dangerous.
And this is what happens.

1901
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:20,640
A rat gets it and it affects the rat.

1902
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:24,810
And what it makes the rat do is it makes
the rat sexually attracted to the smell

1903
01:48:24,811 --> 01:48:25,740
of cat piss.

1904
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:30,060
So the rat start following where the
cats live and like want to be around the

1905
01:48:30,061 --> 01:48:32,430
cats so that it could easily get killed.

1906
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:35,910
And then they would transfer it to the
cat and the cat's transfer it to people.

1907
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:41,680
It's really sad. Yeah. And
people transferred back to
rats. It for recreation, not

1908
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,700
possible to cure. Yes. But here's
where it gets crazy. Huge whore.

1909
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,770
Well for women and makes you do that.

1910
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:53,000
And for men it makes you much more
aggressive and reckless. And it's,

1911
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:55,260
they say it slows your
reaction time down too.

1912
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:58,020
So it was just like a bunch of juice
heads and hookers that was like in Miami

1913
01:48:58,021 --> 01:49:02,670
nightclub. It's like Brazil. Brazil
is 66% infected with toxoplasma.

1914
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:06,810
Very good look like literally. And
Yeah, the love to fucking love to fight.

1915
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:09,600
I mean it literally defines the culture.
I don't know if they were doing that.

1916
01:49:09,601 --> 01:49:13,510
Anyway, this is a thing that's
been around for a long time. Yeah.

1917
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:15,910
Well that's one of the things.

1918
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:20,100
It's connected to places where people
have a lot of wild cats. Wow. Yeah.

1919
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:23,790
It's directly connected and it is an
incurable parasite that changes human

1920
01:49:23,791 --> 01:49:27,030
behavior and it's a fact.
It's not a conspiracy theory.

1921
01:49:27,031 --> 01:49:30,870
This is a legitimate mainstream fact.
It's so strange.

1922
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:35,310
I know people that don't have that,
that act that way. So you might have,

1923
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:38,370
it might have. So it could be a learned
behavior after people that have,

1924
01:49:38,371 --> 01:49:41,730
there's a whole lot of factors in cash.
Baggery that's a good question.

1925
01:49:41,731 --> 01:49:42,300
I don't know.

1926
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:44,940
I don't know if he could pass to kids
illegal think somehow or another they

1927
01:49:44,941 --> 01:49:48,750
would have to get cat shit. If you want
your kid make the football team, why?

1928
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:49,990
Don't know if it works that way.

1929
01:49:49,991 --> 01:49:53,800
But one of the things they found out
within men was that the, there was a, um,

1930
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:58,540
a disproportionate amount of people,
um, like when they had, um, uh,

1931
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:01,120
soccer teams that would
compete in the World Cup.

1932
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:05,920
The teams that made it to the finals all
had high rates of Toxoplasma in their

1933
01:50:05,921 --> 01:50:10,840
countries. And they think that this,
the recklessness of this bacteria,

1934
01:50:10,841 --> 01:50:13,630
like what it does,
it makes you like disregard like a,

1935
01:50:13,631 --> 01:50:15,340
your safety and do reckless shit.

1936
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:18,920
I get disproportionate number of people
who crash it on motorcycles are infected

1937
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,080
with toxo plasma.
And so they,

1938
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:24,610
they connect it to the connected
it to successful soccer teams.

1939
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:26,230
And there's like a real debate about this.

1940
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:29,020
And it may be one of the reasons why
these teams are so successful at soccer.

1941
01:50:29,021 --> 01:50:32,590
They're so aggressive and crazy as it
because they're infected by Toxoplasma.

1942
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,830
Because a lot of, um, a lot
of athletes from Brazil,

1943
01:50:35,831 --> 01:50:38,380
a lot of athletes from a lot of
south American countries, poor area,

1944
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:43,260
a lot of wildcats are 50 or 50
million Americans are in fact it.

1945
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:47,350
Wow. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. It's the
current piece, which is like an alien.

1946
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:51,310
It's like an alien that's
rewiring our brains. That's
awesome. It's fucking crazy.

1947
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:55,360
Pretty soon we're going to start making
pyramids. Watch. That's what it is.

1948
01:50:55,361 --> 01:50:59,560
Imagine it was like some kind of
thing that gets you all, well,

1949
01:50:59,561 --> 01:51:03,460
if there's a little parasite,
parasites evolve, right? If
you believe in evolution,

1950
01:51:03,461 --> 01:51:07,120
you believe they weren't exactly this
way the whole time they became what they

1951
01:51:07,121 --> 01:51:07,570
are now.

1952
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:10,870
Everything became what it is now and
evolve from something to something else.

1953
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:14,050
Something new parasite that
evolves. I mean HIV, right.

1954
01:51:14,051 --> 01:51:15,130
When remember when aids came around,

1955
01:51:15,131 --> 01:51:17,920
there was something that came and
there's just some new shit. Yeah.

1956
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:25,150
You hear about that guy that got
cured with aids. You got stem cells.

1957
01:51:25,151 --> 01:51:27,550
These stem cells and then cured is HIV.
It disappeared.

1958
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,190
Where Jamba juice at?
Jamba juice. The good idea.

1959
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:36,730
And how come this isn't in the news? Uh,
it is. Yeah, it isn't. It isn't like damn.

1960
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:39,640
It's really recent. Like a month
ago. Three weeks ago. Yeah.

1961
01:51:39,641 --> 01:51:43,060
He's actually been cured of HIV using
stem cells like it was, I don't know.

1962
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,170
I don't know the details on it,

1963
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:47,920
but it's pretty much been accepted that
they figured out how it slacking on your

1964
01:51:47,921 --> 01:51:48,760
aids research.

1965
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:52,950
There's a cure for cancer and it's
in Mexico at a clinic give you,

1966
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:57,520
they give you weed and
what isn't. Yeah. There's,

1967
01:51:57,521 --> 01:51:59,800
there's some things that they're willing
to do in Mexico, they'd probably work.

1968
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:02,530
There's a lot of people that have
said that, um, blood transfusions,

1969
01:52:02,531 --> 01:52:06,790
like full blood transfusions and,
and other treatments they do to blood.

1970
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,160
It was a bunch of different treatments
that are willing to do in Mexico.

1971
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:12,700
I think I'd be willing to die before I'd
be willing to let a Mexican doctor with

1972
01:52:12,701 --> 01:52:14,170
no sterilization putting a needle in me.

1973
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,460
I know dudes have gone to Mexico for
surgery because my many fighters,

1974
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:23,530
no MMA fighters, they're
um, they're cheap.

1975
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:26,740
Are you friends with a bunch
of MMA fighters? Like I know
that some of them, yeah.

1976
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:31,080
Yeah. Cool. Train. Yeah. Train. Yeah.

1977
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:34,240
How do they feel about getting
hit in the face so much? Well,

1978
01:52:34,241 --> 01:52:36,760
I'm the smart ones know that it's just a,

1979
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:39,130
you got to limit the amount
of times you get hit.

1980
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:42,250
It's very important to use defense first.
It'd be very smart about why,

1981
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:45,560
but you know, they also know that there's
some flights we're just getting nailed,

1982
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:47,190
you know,
it's just nothing you can do about it.

1983
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,680
Then you're talking about
about football earlier.

1984
01:52:48,681 --> 01:52:52,220
I mean I don't think like octagon fighting
has been and all that stuff has been

1985
01:52:52,221 --> 01:52:54,080
around or as popular as long as football.

1986
01:52:54,081 --> 01:52:56,240
So are they going to be the
same as football players?

1987
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,880
Like are they going to end up with poor
Gehrig's disease and depends on their

1988
01:52:58,881 --> 01:53:02,000
style.
It depends on when they get out.

1989
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:05,120
Depends on how much punishment they take
at the end of their career because the

1990
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:07,220
end of the career is where
guys get really beat up.

1991
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:10,460
That's what happened with Muhammad Ali
happens with a lot of fighters say the

1992
01:53:10,461 --> 01:53:12,980
reaction time slows. They don't
know when to get out of the game.

1993
01:53:12,981 --> 01:53:14,930
And then they take some fights
that they probably shouldn't take.

1994
01:53:14,931 --> 01:53:15,740
And then they get some,

1995
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:18,530
they get some serious injuries
and they don't know when to quit.

1996
01:53:18,531 --> 01:53:21,530
And they keep going. And those are the
guys that wind up in real big trouble,

1997
01:53:21,531 --> 01:53:23,210
in my opinion,
is a Lou Gehrig's disease.

1998
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:26,410
It doesn't mean it's a Nate and
it just triggers later, you know,

1999
01:53:26,411 --> 01:53:30,200
Louis Lou Gehrig's disease can,
it can be triggered later.

2000
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:34,370
It can be something that just happens to
you, but it also can be trauma induced.

2001
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:37,400
Okay. So it can be, you know, there's,
there's a bunch of different ways,

2002
01:53:37,401 --> 01:53:40,200
like Stephen Hawking's has Lou
Gehrig's disease and I don't,

2003
01:53:40,210 --> 01:53:42,290
I don't think that he was,
he might've been,

2004
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:44,260
I might've played soccer or
something like that. Who knows.

2005
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:48,800
I'm a fighter before he found the books
before he found all that study. And then,

2006
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:50,270
but um,

2007
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:54,700
w what happens is when guys get a
lot of repeated brain injuries there,

2008
01:53:54,701 --> 01:53:59,630
their brains start producing like
defective proteins and they're,

2009
01:53:59,631 --> 01:53:59,901
they're,

2010
01:53:59,901 --> 01:54:03,500
they're literally their body just like
eventually just shuts down and just stops

2011
01:54:03,501 --> 01:54:07,910
working. It starts like misfiring
left and right. It could just really,

2012
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:10,520
really creepy how come on I watch and,
and they fighting,

2013
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:13,310
they look like they take
breaks simultaneously.

2014
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,650
Like when they're like in this headline,

2015
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:17,030
it looks like they're almost taking
a rest. Is that like a code? Like,

2016
01:54:17,031 --> 01:54:20,450
I'm going to take a two second breather,
right? Don't hit me while I'm doing this.

2017
01:54:20,451 --> 01:54:23,660
Well, if you're tired and you sense it,
the other guy's tired and he's not moving,

2018
01:54:23,661 --> 01:54:24,490
you might do that.

2019
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:27,140
It might take a little break then
wouldn't it as an as a killer?

2020
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:29,190
Wouldn't it be like that was when we go,
ugh.

2021
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:34,460
But you might be willing to forego that
just for a couple seconds of recovery if

2022
01:54:34,461 --> 01:54:36,340
you think you're going to make
another big explosion. Right?

2023
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:39,030
You met something timed out, you
know, you're like, all right,

2024
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,540
does a minute and a half left in this
round? I'm taking this mother fucker down,

2025
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:45,200
but right now I'm gonna tell you a little
break. Do they ever talk to each other?

2026
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,520
Sometimes we talked shifts.
Oh,

2027
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:51,390
sometimes the one time that was the
weirdest one was his dude war machines

2028
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,790
fighting this Guy Jay Rock and uh,

2029
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:57,200
Jay Rock and war machine became really
good friends on the ultimate fighter.

2030
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,780
And then they had a fight each
other. I mean, really good friends.

2031
01:54:59,781 --> 01:55:01,520
And it was a fucking war,

2032
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:05,180
a bloody horrible war where they were
talking to each other while I was going.

2033
01:55:05,181 --> 01:55:08,180
I'm like, fuck man. It fucking
hurt. Like, yeah, sorry dude.

2034
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:11,690
Like saying shit like that while while
they're fighting, it was really crazy.

2035
01:55:11,691 --> 01:55:14,810
And then it's a mind fuck. And yeah, and
then at the end when it was all over,

2036
01:55:14,811 --> 01:55:17,690
they were super emotional and crying
and hugging each other. It was,

2037
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:20,330
it was hockey player raising
fight each other. I mean, I guess,

2038
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:21,440
I don't think it was like this,

2039
01:55:21,470 --> 01:55:24,890
not like 15 fucking minutes of beaten the
shit out of each other is not the same

2040
01:55:24,891 --> 01:55:28,300
thing. Those hockey fights, they can't
get that traction, you know? And it was a,

2041
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:32,660
it was a vicious fight in an ended with
a brutal Tko and there's was like crazy.

2042
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:36,020
Like it was, it was so charged with
emotion, you know? And then when he,

2043
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,760
when I interviewed him
after the fight was over,

2044
01:55:37,761 --> 01:55:40,700
he was crying and talking about how
hard it was and what they were saying to

2045
01:55:40,701 --> 01:55:44,280
each other, why they were in there. And
I was like, Whoa, that's got, oh yeah,

2046
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:47,120
that's fucked up. You know? If
it was like a thousand years ago,

2047
01:55:47,121 --> 01:55:50,910
you had to kill him, right? Yeah.
That's what happened. Right.

2048
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:53,940
That's what they used to make them do
in those fucking, those Roman cuts.

2049
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:00,180
It's us 500 years from now, the new
room. I think Americans just like Rome,

2050
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:04,710
it's crazy. They're sort of not the
same buildup, same decline lap bands.

2051
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:09,150
That was the beginning of the end.
You fucking fat cunt, stop eating.

2052
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:12,390
Just get your shit together.
You have to be 50 pounds overweight.

2053
01:56:12,391 --> 01:56:14,490
Do you think they give it to you if you
were like, you want to lose 10 pounds?

2054
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,850
I thought about that. I've got like
some problem areas and I was like,

2055
01:56:17,851 --> 01:56:19,710
maybe I just get a lap
band like a small one.

2056
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:23,010
You were guaranteed you're not the
first person to think this a little bit.

2057
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:27,990
Did a lot of girls like sleep talk about
that though. Is it jokes? I know. No, no,

2058
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:31,140
that girls do talk about that on the
back dated girls that actually talk about

2059
01:56:31,141 --> 01:56:33,200
that shit all the time.
Like I'm going to go in and get the car.

2060
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:36,960
There's a girl that I dated a long time
ago whose best friend got the light bow

2061
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:39,980
and she did not need the [inaudible].
She did not need the light. Oh,

2062
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:42,000
she just needed to work out a little bit.
The girl did.

2063
01:56:42,001 --> 01:56:46,380
It didn't work out at this rather than
she got ruined man. They lumpy deer up,

2064
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:49,250
doesn't it? I could be wrong
about this one after they do it.

2065
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:52,350
Don't you kind of have no control over
wearing that you made how they do it.

2066
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,870
They just don't. They
don't. You have a hunch.

2067
01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:57,510
No control over where your fat
cells grow back. I don't know.

2068
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:01,970
Replacing one problem here with another.
So you could get huge fat arms. No,

2069
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:06,870
but he kept no blood or huge bite
or a huge buck like a spider.

2070
01:57:06,871 --> 01:57:11,820
But like you know, spiders have huge,
oh yeah. Don't let them do that.

2071
01:57:11,821 --> 01:57:14,940
Don't let them suck fat out of your
people if you're willing to turn to that.

2072
01:57:14,941 --> 01:57:17,580
Like I can understand if you're
older and it's a serious problem,

2073
01:57:17,581 --> 01:57:18,570
you've been struggling all your life,

2074
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:21,330
but if you're selling like 21 year
old girl that works at Hooters,

2075
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:23,790
just hit the gym for an hour.
You know,

2076
01:57:23,791 --> 01:57:27,930
I was watching this thing online about
these two French brothers who are twins

2077
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:31,950
who became plastic surgery
junkies and they're deformed now.

2078
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:36,870
Have you seen those places? Yeah. Pull
it up. Brian. A French famous twins,

2079
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:41,010
plastic surgery now awful.
Just write French famous twins,

2080
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:45,930
plastic surgery nightmare.
They were stars of some television show,

2081
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:46,321
you know,

2082
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:50,370
I guess back in the eighties or so and
now they're like 50 and they look like

2083
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:54,120
they look like monsters.
Like these poor guys,

2084
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:59,170
like they've got some sort of a
psychological defense. I got there.

2085
01:57:59,190 --> 01:58:02,430
Kind of like the cat
people. Yeah, exactly.

2086
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:06,990
They have all sorts of facial implants
and they have all sorts of fillers in

2087
01:58:06,991 --> 01:58:09,570
their face and their heads are deformed.
It is.

2088
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:13,980
It's so Uber does and that's what they
used to look like. They look fine. Yeah.

2089
01:58:13,981 --> 01:58:16,890
He's a little weird looking
but not like he is now.

2090
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:20,100
Looks like that mask from
screen. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

2091
01:58:20,101 --> 01:58:23,190
It looks like I'm the kid from masks,
that movie mask.

2092
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:26,400
They both have pouty
lips before and after.

2093
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:33,040
I know what it's not that given how they
look before that Beverly Hills show to

2094
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:37,660
that one bitch that has the crazy
lip and it's like the housewives

2095
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:42,100
large mouth anyway though.
Yeah, but she's got crafty

2096
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,940
shit going on with her lips. Somebody
should have told her like, hey, I ain't,

2097
01:58:44,941 --> 01:58:47,700
you know, that doesn't make you look
any better. That's it. Pretty easy.

2098
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:52,780
It's really the problem I think with
when you do that is your face. It has,

2099
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:55,460
whether you're a symmetrical or not,
your face as a certain symmetry to it.

2100
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,840
Anything you do to any part of it,
you have to bounce out.

2101
01:58:58,841 --> 01:59:01,510
The rest of the more you try to
balance it, the worse it gets. Well,

2102
01:59:01,511 --> 01:59:03,130
there's a mathematical principle to it.

2103
01:59:03,131 --> 01:59:07,060
It's called the FIBONACCI Fibonacci
sequence and then it works on faces like

2104
01:59:07,061 --> 01:59:08,770
talking, when someone gets
a nose job, you're like,

2105
01:59:08,771 --> 01:59:13,390
what the fuck is going on when your head
that's like supposed to be this big,

2106
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:16,790
this is the way, you know there's a grand
design for it. Sure sounds that way.

2107
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:20,140
There's that one show. I don't, I
can't watch it because it upsets me.

2108
01:59:20,190 --> 01:59:24,220
Bridal plasty Oh, I haven't seen it.
It's addicting. You would you like it?

2109
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:28,150
What is it? Explain it to me. They go
through, they go through challenges.

2110
01:59:28,151 --> 01:59:31,570
They each girls or is engaged and I don't
know who's marrying these crazy people.

2111
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:32,830
I don't know who would,

2112
01:59:32,831 --> 01:59:36,910
but each girl was engaged and they do
different challenges in order to win

2113
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:40,630
plastic surgery procedures all leading
up to your big day and you can win

2114
01:59:40,631 --> 01:59:43,240
bouquets. You can win nose jobs,
light bulb, whatever you want.

2115
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:46,950
So basically her husband's marrying a
crazy doll that looks nothing like you

2116
01:59:46,951 --> 01:59:47,560
know,

2117
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:52,560
God that remember that show on Fox
where they used to work them all?

2118
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:56,380
My God, that was insane. But those
people were really awful looking.

2119
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:58,840
Yeah they were.
But I mean fuck you know,

2120
01:59:58,841 --> 02:00:02,080
you're getting them on a slippery slope
with some people. That was good shit.

2121
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:03,410
Like to fix her teeth and you know,

2122
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:06,520
you don't get to be manager at the at
and t store if you don't look your best.

2123
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:09,880
When you look good you get to be manager.
That's when it happens.

2124
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:12,580
That's when it goes down. What do you,
if you're at the 18 store, how do you,

2125
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:16,150
how do you explain to people that
the iPhone just to fucking drops off

2126
02:00:16,151 --> 02:00:16,990
everywhere?
What would you say?

2127
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:19,840
What did I say if you were
working with at and t store?

2128
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:25,510
Well, I have no idea. I never
really thought about it.

2129
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:29,470
I would probably say it's, I
mean they're all, I don't know,

2130
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:34,930
but we're adding towers all the time.
Why are you asking me this all the time?

2131
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:38,710
If you went to the att store and the
there was like a sexy woman and CEO was

2132
02:00:38,711 --> 02:00:42,010
talking to you and telling you and
trying to calm you down from the issue,

2133
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:44,170
do you think you'd be more
likely to just let it go?

2134
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:48,290
Do you think you would get smitten?
I think you would.

2135
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:52,750
I think he lives in his like laughing
the guy, we're hot. I'd be like, yeah,

2136
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:55,300
I don't want you to think I'm
crazy. Really? You would do that.

2137
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:59,740
So if there was like some fucking
handsome Clark Kent Looking Motherfucker,

2138
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:04,630
you would be more willing to listen to
their corporate bullshit about why your

2139
02:01:04,631 --> 02:01:07,510
phone keeps dropping off. Beat me
if you were hot or not. Really.

2140
02:01:08,190 --> 02:01:10,930
Just a light beating.
Choking. Just so like,

2141
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:15,610
I'll like throttling half throttle.
Yeah.

2142
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,440
Let's play a game called fake rape

2143
02:01:20,830 --> 02:01:24,070
girls like that.
I'm just now thinking about law and order.

2144
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:25,330
Svu episodes are about,

2145
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:29,680
there's a guy in Oklahoma
that got arrested recently
because he shot his wife or

2146
02:01:29,681 --> 02:01:33,280
his girlfriend. There was some
sort of a, a, a, a sex thing.

2147
02:01:33,650 --> 02:01:36,550
Like he would hold the gun up to
her head while he's banging her. Oh,

2148
02:01:36,551 --> 02:01:39,290
and it accidentally went off because
he thought it was blanks. No,

2149
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:42,620
because he accidentally shot her in the
head. Yeah. She said something stupid.

2150
02:01:42,621 --> 02:01:45,760
He just came,
oh fuck you.

2151
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:49,220
And then call the cops and
said it was a mistake again.

2152
02:01:49,221 --> 02:01:51,350
This made a stupid and there's
no place for him in society.

2153
02:01:51,351 --> 02:01:53,990
If you're willing to put a loaded gun to
someone's head while you have sex with

2154
02:01:53,991 --> 02:01:58,370
them, knock it till you
track girl. You never know.

2155
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:01,790
Some people are little gangster shit do
that while Scarface is playing in the

2156
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:06,410
background. Damn. That's some
people like to live on the edge,

2157
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:09,480
you know? And I mean I don't have
to go to jail for that. It wasn't,

2158
02:02:09,490 --> 02:02:13,340
it was an accident. Yeah. He goes to jail
for being retarded. He has to go to jail.

2159
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:16,400
That's where I belong. Yeah.
You shoot somebody in the
head, you got to go to jail.

2160
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:20,290
Yeah. There's not many circumstances
where it's okay. Well totally.

2161
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:22,130
If they could prove that
he came after he shot her,

2162
02:02:22,131 --> 02:02:26,060
then he definitely goes to
jail. I don't think, can't RB

2163
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:29,480
carbing taste at it,

2164
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:35,810
but it had great benefits.
This lube was shut into a dead man.

2165
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:42,770
Lot of pineapple. Guy Bends his knees.
He's touching his fingers to it.

2166
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:44,780
No one's talking to wait for the results.

2167
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:50,360
Who's dead?

2168
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:55,100
Who did with the Jackie later into
them with that cat poop disease.

2169
02:02:55,790 --> 02:02:58,000
Toxoplasma taste funny.

2170
02:02:58,010 --> 02:03:01,210
If I could've thought of the name of the
disease versus asking you acting out,

2171
02:03:01,211 --> 02:03:04,100
tasting seaman, be careful
with your dog. I'm telling you.

2172
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:08,030
Don't let them get their toxo plasma.
She doesn't go outside to her brother.

2173
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:10,400
She doesn't. She have her
yard. She goes outside.

2174
02:03:10,401 --> 02:03:14,440
But just make sure she's on a ride. Other
people's cats that go outside? No. Yeah,

2175
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:20,690
she is not good. Where in the garage? Um,

2176
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:25,330
don't tell me what part of the country
is it, but are there wraps? They're here.

2177
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:29,750
Here. Are there rats in your
neighborhood? No, I got rats.

2178
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:35,360
The rats are there. You just don't
know. There's lots everywhere.

2179
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:39,650
Let's just bet on who she's probably
going to start fucking you and your sleep.

2180
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:46,980
Well, she's more of an
affection, love, hug kind of dog.

2181
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:50,900
Don't let her out to PE. She'll get
excited and start holding my arm. Really

2182
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:56,450
tell you that she has to pee once a
month if I like really push it and don't

2183
02:03:56,451 --> 02:04:00,440
want her out cause I'm doing something.
How strange she does it to like,

2184
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:03,110
like she gets so excited and worked up
and weave and then she'll just be like,

2185
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:05,840
how do you a workout when
you go on the road with her?

2186
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:09,080
I don't work out on the road. No,
no, no that's not what you mean.

2187
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:11,840
How do you work it out? Like when you
go on the road to take it with you?

2188
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:16,040
Because I was on the road so much,
I was like I need,

2189
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:17,510
I need something he commanded.

2190
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:20,720
So I got her and she and she travels
with you on a plane. She's like this,

2191
02:04:20,721 --> 02:04:25,380
she's silent. That's awesome. I
want to travel with being on stage.

2192
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,520
You're on stage.
The other comics.

2193
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,890
Oh that's cool. And she's a
really good girl. That's nice.

2194
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:37,290
Do you have a cool little friend?
Cause she could have been crazy.

2195
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,840
And when you bring her on a plane,
he just put her in between your seat.

2196
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:41,430
Is that how you doing it or my feet go.

2197
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:45,010
What if people are allergic to
dogs now round you fuck them.

2198
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:47,510
She sat sneaker on,

2199
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,450
but for the most part I pay for
her and if you're allergic will,

2200
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:54,720
you'll set nigger on my bag that I have
for it looks like a duffle bag and it's

2201
02:04:54,721 --> 02:04:58,110
got a mesh side like she can breathe.
I'll throw my coat over and just walk on.

2202
02:04:58,290 --> 02:05:01,440
The people that check your ticket or
not the same as the people security and

2203
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:04,710
northern St people to gate. I figured
that out. So you just walk on.

2204
02:05:04,730 --> 02:05:07,880
They don't want to know. If you don't
do that then what do you have to do?

2205
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:12,600
Pay 100 bucks or a hundred it depends.
Hundred 50 doesn't really the scheme.

2206
02:05:12,610 --> 02:05:15,300
The laser, you know, it's a great
scheme. When I moved out here,

2207
02:05:15,301 --> 02:05:18,870
I had to move my cats out and they
lost my cats for like two hours.

2208
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:21,420
Like they didn't let me have it with me.

2209
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,200
I had to put it into like under
the thing under the thing.

2210
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:27,470
I would never do that ever again and then
I was thinking about traveling with or

2211
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:31,010
bring my dog to Ohio when I
went back and they s besides,

2212
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:32,890
besides it being so expensive they had,

2213
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,430
the vet told me that it's
really bad for the dogs,

2214
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:39,990
the air pressure under or in
the cabinet under the thing.

2215
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:44,930
I bet. I bet it's cold. It's cold on the
floor where she goes up a little blank.

2216
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:46,380
It's really,
really cold down there.

2217
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:49,410
There's that creepy feeling when you get
close to the window and you realize how

2218
02:05:49,411 --> 02:05:50,310
cold it is out there and

2219
02:05:53,010 --> 02:05:56,280
coming back from Canada was a trip
because we were, we were almost stranded.

2220
02:05:56,281 --> 02:05:59,490
We came so close to me and stranded.
The snow was just starting to start.

2221
02:05:59,491 --> 02:06:03,750
A blizzard was hitting's recently and if
we had been an hour later we would have

2222
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:07,650
been stuck in Canada for days. I'm
sure. No, this was a different one.

2223
02:06:07,651 --> 02:06:11,250
This was a recent one that's Macho
Montreal. Montreal's beautiful city.

2224
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:17,460
Canada itself was amazing country. It's
gorgeous and Canadians are really nice.

2225
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:21,060
The nicest fucking people. A lot of crap
for Americans. I dated Canadian recently.

2226
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:24,840
This is why I have all this to say.
They're very nice and super masculine.

2227
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:29,130
Not Fatty at all. Nice.
So Canadians out the,

2228
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:33,960
just want to let you know. No, we're
done. I'm just saying more what happened,

2229
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:35,310
but he's just giving Ya.

2230
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:38,290
They do say she's giving you a thumbs
up on your product. I think for,

2231
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:42,180
it's always easy to make fun of
Canada, but great country. Nice people.

2232
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:45,500
Very friendly. Yeah. But it's not
easy to make fun of Canada. It's me.

2233
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:48,550
Easy to make fun of how fucking cold it
is in some spots, but like, you know,

2234
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:50,760
as far as like, like the people
there and they're slipping.

2235
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:55,530
I had some of the nicest fucking
people ever live above this country,

2236
02:06:55,531 --> 02:06:59,010
filled with homicidal
maniacs, you know, Michigan.

2237
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:03,810
How about that dude? Did you see
those Garrett living above Mexico?

2238
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:07,950
Do you see those photos of Michigan? Was
it you that posted it? That shit's scary.

2239
02:07:07,951 --> 02:07:12,420
Like a Michigan decline. A Michigan in
photos. It's a, it's on Joe's Twitter.

2240
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:14,710
Amazing photo of somebody tweeted it.
I retired.

2241
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:18,060
It's all these photos of like
ancient buildings and you know,

2242
02:07:18,150 --> 02:07:19,890
been around Michigan's,
it's like the 17,

2243
02:07:19,891 --> 02:07:23,700
18 hundreds all fallen apart and abandoned
now because the economy is falling

2244
02:07:23,701 --> 02:07:26,850
apart.
Like abandoned library filled with books,

2245
02:07:26,851 --> 02:07:30,900
abandoned police headquarter with
all the photos here. Detroit,

2246
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:35,130
Michigan in general. I think it was
all Detroit, Detroit, those towns.

2247
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:36,483
I was actually,

2248
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:40,750
I was in Upper Michigan recently.
Second time in a year. I'm not bragging.

2249
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:45,760
Give a fuck. I don't know. Fuck
time travel up to northern Michigan.

2250
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:47,800
It's such another world up there.
It looks,

2251
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:49,510
if you took a picture
and took out the cars,

2252
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:53,080
you wouldn't be able to tell me what
decade it was. I agree to all of that.

2253
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:56,560
Once for a, did a college and
all of that, Michigan, who was,

2254
02:07:56,561 --> 02:07:58,690
you know where all of that
is to middle of nowhere.

2255
02:07:58,691 --> 02:08:02,520
They gave me terrible directions to drive
there for, there's no gps back then.

2256
02:08:02,521 --> 02:08:03,880
It's back in the golden days,

2257
02:08:03,881 --> 02:08:08,730
a comedy and I had to drive to this
fucking college and stand on top of two.

2258
02:08:08,790 --> 02:08:09,430
Um,

2259
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:14,410
there were like a cafeteria tables that
was the stand and one of them had a mic

2260
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:17,480
on one end and a speaker
on the other accounts.

2261
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:20,320
And there was another speaker that was
on the other table and I can go back and

2262
02:08:20,321 --> 02:08:24,130
forth in between the two tables if I paid
attention for then step on a crack and

2263
02:08:24,131 --> 02:08:26,740
punch through and fall.
I'm not kidding.

2264
02:08:26,741 --> 02:08:31,380
It was fucking most ridiculous
thing ever. And then, uh,

2265
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:33,040
there's no opening act.
Of course it's just me.

2266
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:36,880
So I go onstage and immediately start
getting heckled and they're all football

2267
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:39,610
players. It's a football college.
So it's like all these animals.

2268
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:42,040
Well I start to like give these guys shit.
They were like,

2269
02:08:42,041 --> 02:08:43,900
it was good natured heckling with,
you know,

2270
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:48,330
a lot of faggot talk and stuff like
that. So I go to the guy, you know, I,

2271
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:52,300
I go, whatever. I said I, you know,
I've made fun of them. And the,

2272
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:54,700
the guy who ran the college
came up to me and said,

2273
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:57,550
I just want to let you know
that we are not allowing swears.

2274
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:01,030
You are not allowed to swear.
I was like, this is ridiculous.

2275
02:09:01,031 --> 02:09:04,120
These guys are allowed to swear you
fucking faggot. We love to yell at you.

2276
02:09:04,121 --> 02:09:07,300
Fucking faggot at me. And so then I
turned it around and said something about,

2277
02:09:07,301 --> 02:09:09,400
you know,
you guys are old enough to go to war.

2278
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:11,260
You're old enough to die for your country,
right?

2279
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:14,530
But this guy right here says that,
I can't swear in front of you.

2280
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:17,320
Somehow know that you can't
handle it and then give a fuck.

2281
02:09:19,370 --> 02:09:22,750
It's fucking crazy. And I
was joking around by, I go,

2282
02:09:22,751 --> 02:09:26,500
let's fucking trashed this place.
And I'll bunch it.

2283
02:09:26,501 --> 02:09:31,210
Dude screamed and one dude stood up and
picked up a chair and then the guy came

2284
02:09:31,211 --> 02:09:34,210
up to the table and he goes, listen,
listen, listen, do whatever you want.

2285
02:09:34,211 --> 02:09:35,410
We'll deal with the consequences later.

2286
02:09:35,411 --> 02:09:38,590
You perform your normal act as
you normally do. And I'm like, oh,

2287
02:09:38,591 --> 02:09:41,520
can you see how I could swear now we can
swear. Calm down. Everybody calm down.

2288
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:45,640
They were like ready to fight.
I was half kidding.

2289
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:49,900
But I was like really instigating.
I was really instigating because you know,

2290
02:09:50,110 --> 02:09:52,150
they were boards and they were in the
middle of nowhere and this guy was

2291
02:09:52,151 --> 02:09:54,340
annoying as fuck. And I
was going, look, you know,

2292
02:09:54,341 --> 02:09:57,970
I just came here to entertain you guys.
Never comedy show. That was the thing.

2293
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,550
They used to sell you,
they'll sell you to anyone.

2294
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:03,310
All this is like Barry Katz as agency.

2295
02:10:03,311 --> 02:10:06,280
It was New York entertainment and they
would just fucking sell you, whoever.

2296
02:10:06,281 --> 02:10:08,380
They could sell you to any colleges.

2297
02:10:08,381 --> 02:10:10,570
They would just sell you two and then he
would deal with it once you get there.

2298
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:13,900
And I did a Naca show and they got to
see that I was dirty and like everybody

2299
02:10:13,901 --> 02:10:16,570
had, you know, they said,
well if you do, you know,

2300
02:10:16,571 --> 02:10:17,800
Naca and they know that you're dirty,

2301
02:10:17,801 --> 02:10:19,810
then it will limit the amount of
colleges that you go to. But I was like,

2302
02:10:19,811 --> 02:10:24,250
I can't make a fake second act right.
You know, and, and just to do it,

2303
02:10:24,251 --> 02:10:26,410
to do colleges.
So they knew I was dirty.

2304
02:10:26,411 --> 02:10:29,230
So somehow or another got sold
at this college that didn't know,

2305
02:10:29,231 --> 02:10:32,830
but they were the most savage of all
the colleges I've ever done ever.

2306
02:10:32,831 --> 02:10:34,420
And they didn't want me
to switch the one guide.

2307
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:35,810
It's not the college.
I think it was,

2308
02:10:35,870 --> 02:10:38,840
it was their policy because they had
all these fucking animals living in the

2309
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:42,380
middle of Michigan. You know, we want to
keep him to keep him calm, keep him calm.

2310
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:46,130
I didn't know need for swears so
many colleges the other last year.

2311
02:10:46,131 --> 02:10:49,070
And the thing about colleges is
like if comedy club you can go,

2312
02:10:49,071 --> 02:10:51,380
you can see what this, you couldn't ask
your friends with the stages is like,

2313
02:10:51,381 --> 02:10:54,260
cause some colleges you have no clue
what it's going to be like. You don't,

2314
02:10:54,261 --> 02:10:57,230
if you're gonna be in a theater, an
amphitheater outside in the parking lot,

2315
02:10:57,231 --> 02:10:59,450
a cafeteria,
you don't know and you get there,

2316
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:02,570
you just hope it's going to be decent.
Did a college wrestling Canada,

2317
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:05,550
it was weird. I hadn't done one
in a long time and it was like uh,

2318
02:11:05,780 --> 02:11:07,880
adults and college kids mixing together.

2319
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:10,850
It's always weird when they like come
wandering it from the community. Yeah,

2320
02:11:10,851 --> 02:11:15,020
you can be 18 or you know, you
can, you know, 18 and above.
It was fine, but it was,

2321
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:17,810
it's very strange because a lot
of college people, you know,

2322
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:21,530
you forget when you're 30 years old,
you're 40 years old or whatever.

2323
02:11:21,531 --> 02:11:24,920
Even if you lived all this life,
these kids haven't lived at all.

2324
02:11:24,921 --> 02:11:29,780
It's tricky because you can't talk about
dating as you would normally or jobs or

2325
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:32,930
sex cause it's just not, they
don't know that yet. Some do,

2326
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:35,450
but you're dealing with a
huge percentage that don't,

2327
02:11:35,451 --> 02:11:39,500
I mean there's hip kids in every level
of high school and every level of college

2328
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:41,720
that would make great audience
members in any comedy club.

2329
02:11:41,721 --> 02:11:45,110
There's kids that are 14 that get
us such as, yes, you're right.

2330
02:11:45,111 --> 02:11:47,420
It was such a small percentage.
But in college, man,

2331
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:51,620
you'd be surprised that the number from
14 to college is not that different.

2332
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:55,040
There are a lot of them the same. They're
like little kids. Some of them are hip,

2333
02:11:55,041 --> 02:11:57,890
so I don't know what's going on in the
world. Some of them, you know? No, but,

2334
02:11:57,891 --> 02:11:59,970
and another thing they like
to do at colleges is elected.

2335
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:03,320
Go PC on you and fucking point out when
you're being racist or point out when

2336
02:12:03,321 --> 02:12:06,500
you're being sexist. You know what
though? I think they're smarter.

2337
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,140
I enjoy college has because
it gives me a chance.

2338
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:10,760
You're not placating Joe public.

2339
02:12:10,761 --> 02:12:14,150
These are kids that are very close to
the realm of academia that we'll get a

2340
02:12:14,151 --> 02:12:18,170
reference that we'll get something
about school or they're so close or they

2341
02:12:18,171 --> 02:12:21,380
remember it and it's a nice exercise.
Yeah,

2342
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:24,590
I think it's because it's easy to get a
car if you're in the middle of nowhere

2343
02:12:24,591 --> 02:12:26,810
and you get a bunch of like,
I don't want to try not to offend anyone,

2344
02:12:26,811 --> 02:12:29,810
but like normal guys that this is
like they're doing it on Friday night.

2345
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:34,220
We're going to get drunk, see the comedian
and go, fuck. It's a little bit easier.

2346
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:37,520
It's a cake walk. You could, while
they're trying to have fun too,

2347
02:12:37,710 --> 02:12:39,530
we're trying to have fun,
just trying to have a good time.

2348
02:12:39,531 --> 02:12:40,670
There's something to be said for that.

2349
02:12:40,671 --> 02:12:43,670
I know a lot of idiots that are a lot
of fun to hang out with and they don't

2350
02:12:43,671 --> 02:12:47,760
want to think about the moral and fucking
wiki leaks, but you know, have a chat,

2351
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:49,600
have a jack and coke with them.

2352
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:53,720
We get a couple of pounds in was like
you give each other a few high fives in

2353
02:12:53,721 --> 02:12:55,160
there. Good company. You know,

2354
02:12:55,161 --> 02:12:57,530
there's a lot of people that aren't
very deep thinkers that I enjoy hanging

2355
02:12:57,531 --> 02:13:01,250
around with, but I don't know what
you're saying. There's a wedding ring,

2356
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:03,680
Brian.
Shut the fuck up.

2357
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:12,290
Don't get it. He's a mess. Oh
dare you. It's a wedding ring.

2358
02:13:12,291 --> 02:13:16,080
He's making a wedding ring out of
the court. But why Brian, that was,

2359
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:19,490
he's laying off what you were just
talking about and I was acting like I sit

2360
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:23,840
down me. Oh, so marriage. Have
you ever seen the wonderful
whites of West Virginia?

2361
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:26,210
It's a must say.
Oh,

2362
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:30,890
we'll give you a copy of the DVD as you
leave is a documentary on this family

2363
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:33,000
that lives in West Virginia.

2364
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:35,730
It is one of the craziest fucking
things you've ever seen in your life.

2365
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:40,060
This wild family that just starts
oxycontin and goes in and out of jail and

2366
02:13:40,330 --> 02:13:43,740
everybody's all, you have
to get everything I'm doing
tonight and watch that.

2367
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,620
Fabulous. It's fabulous.
They are. They are.

2368
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:49,950
And there's don't skip the behind the
scenes interviews too cause the long in

2369
02:13:49,951 --> 02:13:51,960
depth interviews with each of
each of the people that they,

2370
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:55,770
they do the show with our fucking fabulous
as well on my iPod or listened to all

2371
02:13:55,771 --> 02:13:56,604
work out.
Fuck it.

2372
02:13:56,730 --> 02:14:00,060
I'm sure you can buy it on iTunes and
listen to on my iPod on Bob Guarantee you.

2373
02:14:00,510 --> 02:14:03,570
It's just genius though, man. It's
just, this family is just completely,

2374
02:14:03,571 --> 02:14:06,000
totally insane. And they live
in West Virginia and they just,

2375
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:10,430
it was just like ancestors after ancestor
generation after generation fucking

2376
02:14:10,540 --> 02:14:15,090
criminals, criminal, just straight
criminals. I mean they're just crazy.

2377
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:19,800
They're there and they're all like
famous in that town for being nuts. Yeah.

2378
02:14:19,801 --> 02:14:22,470
So they had an interview all like
different sheriffs and all these different

2379
02:14:22,471 --> 02:14:25,170
towns folk and all these different people
that know them and then they all say

2380
02:14:25,171 --> 02:14:29,380
the same thing. These people are just
crazy, wild and good for nothing.

2381
02:14:29,381 --> 02:14:34,290
And none of them gonna amount to nothing.
It's one old lady. She goes and they go,

2382
02:14:34,291 --> 02:14:36,540
what do you want? What do you want
to happen when he dies? She goes,

2383
02:14:36,541 --> 02:14:40,200
when I dare fucking,
I want you to blow.

2384
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:44,970
We'd smoke in buffet says
snort pills off my head.

2385
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:47,190
Let's have a fucking party.

2386
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:51,780
It's uncomfortable when people
talk that way. I don't know man.

2387
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:53,940
It's pretty fucking awesome.
I wanted to hang out with her.

2388
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:58,680
I wanted to go drink it with her. That's
all I thought of when she said that.

2389
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:02,230
When she said, how are you going to die?
I want, I'm going to boast. Weeds. Moon.

2390
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:07,560
Yes. Snort pills off my head. I'm like,
I want to fucking hang out with his lady.

2391
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:10,890
That awful Mazda Road House.
It's like a terrible,

2392
02:15:10,891 --> 02:15:13,120
that is so fake like that.

2393
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:17,360
This is a carnival fake reality
show called Mas roadhouse
on like TLC group. No,

2394
02:15:17,370 --> 02:15:22,170
it's better. It's on true TV, TV,
TV, but it's true TV. It's network.

2395
02:15:22,171 --> 02:15:25,230
It's a network that sounds like it's real,
but everything on it.

2396
02:15:25,231 --> 02:15:30,210
It's like a spray. So shitty on
there. It's like this bar in Dallas,

2397
02:15:30,211 --> 02:15:34,370
but the mom, she talks like
this. I don't give a fuck,

2398
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:38,190
and she's like this old lady and it's
scripted, but she's still like that.

2399
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,710
All those scripted reality
shows they're fucking up, man.

2400
02:15:40,711 --> 02:15:42,210
You just need to follow
those people like they did.

2401
02:15:42,211 --> 02:15:45,690
But the show with the whites of West
Virginia, there's no scripted reality man.

2402
02:15:45,691 --> 02:15:50,520
They just followed him for a year and in
a year they got just gold, gold, gold,

2403
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:52,890
engraved. They all died at the end. No,

2404
02:15:52,891 --> 02:15:55,800
you want to keep them alive and come
up with a cart to go and make it.

2405
02:15:55,801 --> 02:16:00,270
Three d three d. What would happen? You'd
eat, how would they use it? Through me,

2406
02:16:00,271 --> 02:16:04,770
my school over here. Cherry
flavor. You've got to watch.

2407
02:16:04,771 --> 02:16:08,250
It's pretty full.
Most Johnny Knoxville produced it.

2408
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:10,950
Apparently he found out about
it and had to be a part of this.

2409
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:13,950
He just had to have to let people know.
I saw him the other day.

2410
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:18,390
What did you think? And you think,
whoa, Johnny. It was everything to him.

2411
02:16:18,510 --> 02:16:22,590
Just think you won't even sign. Yeah, no,
he didn't. No, he didn't look healthy.

2412
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:25,740
Really. I can't imagine someone that does
that for a living would look healthy.

2413
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:29,350
Debt to get fucked up by that ball.
Shit. That shit. That is ridiculous.

2414
02:16:29,351 --> 02:16:32,980
I can't believe you did that.
Okay, so crazy. Yeah, he's
crazy. They're all crazy.

2415
02:16:32,981 --> 02:16:36,160
They're so crazy. I mean crazy. You
easily could have died from that,

2416
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:39,660
from anything they do.
The boldo fucking Amen.

2417
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:45,270
You got work hit you when you cut
your goddamn blind fold on Shit,

2418
02:16:45,641 --> 02:16:49,900
man. You're a movie star. Do you know
your movies? I know you want to be legit,

2419
02:16:49,901 --> 02:16:50,980
but fuck man.

2420
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:54,360
I mean how many bones is he broken
his entire course of doing that show?

2421
02:16:55,570 --> 02:16:59,730
Would that help look into in general,
does that help? Yeah, it's probably me.

2422
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:04,060
Would you rather take a beating trunk?
Fuck yeah. You're numb when you're drunk.

2423
02:17:04,061 --> 02:17:04,730
US,
man.

2424
02:17:04,730 --> 02:17:08,560
I think maybe if I was sober I might
be able to move a little bit better and

2425
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:11,050
some of the punishment rather be silver.

2426
02:17:11,130 --> 02:17:12,660
That's what we're going to take a beating.
That's why,

2427
02:17:12,661 --> 02:17:14,950
but you're not going to do
much to fight off a bowl.

2428
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:18,190
That's why a lot of the people in the
titanic that survived because they were

2429
02:17:18,191 --> 02:17:22,090
drunk and wailing or warm.
What the fuck are you talking about?

2430
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:25,870
The water kills you almost instantly.
You're making shit survive. That dude.

2431
02:17:25,871 --> 02:17:28,270
Only the people that didn't go in
the water. No, no, no. The window.

2432
02:17:28,271 --> 02:17:32,050
It's no people in the water survived.
I don't know about that man.

2433
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:33,530
Really quite drunk drive.

2434
02:17:33,531 --> 02:17:36,400
I saw the ones that survive because
there's so much more relaxed.

2435
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:39,580
We should look that up because I'm pretty
sure that was even a premise in the

2436
02:17:39,581 --> 02:17:41,710
movie was that Leonardo Dicaprio.
Dot.

2437
02:17:41,711 --> 02:17:46,090
Cause he was in the water and he left her
on the route. Yeah, that's what it was.

2438
02:17:46,091 --> 02:17:48,220
You fucking queer.
You should've had a shot.

2439
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,380
He shouldn't have snapped me at the back.

2440
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:53,070
You shouldn't have snapped me at the bio.
You still be alive.

2441
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:58,060
Did you know like 98% of the women
survived the titanic because women were

2442
02:17:58,061 --> 02:18:02,280
allowed. Sorry. Wow.

2443
02:18:02,290 --> 02:18:05,140
I mean you think like a lot of people die.
You didn't know that.

2444
02:18:05,470 --> 02:18:09,640
Did you see that cruise ship in
Antarctica that got fucked up last week?

2445
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:10,660
Did you see that?

2446
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:15,850
It got hit by a 35 foot wave and it's
smashed the window of the boat and leaked

2447
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:17,920
all over the electronics to electronics.

2448
02:18:17,921 --> 02:18:20,080
I'll short it out and they
couldn't drive the boat.

2449
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:23,830
Who's new loads?
We're fucked.

2450
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:28,060
They had no power and they creep in on
like an a some sort of a backup engine or

2451
02:18:28,061 --> 02:18:29,830
whatever the fuck they had to do.
But they like,

2452
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:32,230
they had a creep in that
they have the video of this,

2453
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:36,520
this boat getting hit by waves.
Oh it is fucking terrifying.

2454
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:39,070
It's like a cork in a Jacuzzi.

2455
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:41,980
Is Bobbin just completely out of control.

2456
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:46,180
I did a semester at sea last year
of college and so it's a giant,

2457
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:49,150
it's an old cruise ship
that they've converted.

2458
02:18:49,151 --> 02:18:51,660
It's like they strip it down and it's a,
it's a college basically.

2459
02:18:51,661 --> 02:18:54,880
And you go around the world. What?
It's crazy. Oh, what's it called?

2460
02:18:55,050 --> 02:18:57,920
The program's called semester at sea
and our ship was the SSE universe.

2461
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:02,290
Holy Shit. So you lived in a
boat for a year, four months.

2462
02:19:02,291 --> 02:19:03,400
Four to five months I think.

2463
02:19:03,490 --> 02:19:06,940
And so you went to all these crazy
countries and you're on, you know,

2464
02:19:06,941 --> 02:19:09,970
you're crossing these huge
oceans for like days at a time,

2465
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:11,560
but the group that went after us,

2466
02:19:11,561 --> 02:19:14,500
like there's a certain degree that your
boat can't go unless we're in the Earl

2467
02:19:14,501 --> 02:19:16,750
said, oh, cap size, and they have
footage. They were all in the news.

2468
02:19:16,751 --> 02:19:20,020
They were caught like the storm and
there's footage of like all the kids books

2469
02:19:20,021 --> 02:19:23,430
just sliding. And they were like one
degree off from capsizing hold on.

2470
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:27,590
600 kids on this thing. Oh my. They
were this close. Arbs was fine,

2471
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:32,600
but I was like, wow. Yeah, it was
off. Brian, pull that video up,

2472
02:19:32,601 --> 02:19:36,230
see if you can find it. It was on
my Twitter, but it's a cruise ship.

2473
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:39,770
Antarctica hit by monster waves,
but there's a,

2474
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:42,710
when they were trying to rescue people
off the boat, they got video of it.

2475
02:19:42,711 --> 02:19:45,680
Like one another belt came in
close. No, no, no. Nobody's,

2476
02:19:45,730 --> 02:19:46,910
nobody's screaming or anything like that.

2477
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:52,280
No one's Bolton got a bullet hole
in her head. Right. Cruise ship,

2478
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:54,920
wave Antarctica. But in Antarctica,
and it'd be really recent.

2479
02:19:54,921 --> 02:19:59,390
It's a December article or December
video that's a fucking tripping.

2480
02:19:59,810 --> 02:20:02,990
It's so terrifying.
This fucking boat.

2481
02:20:02,991 --> 02:20:07,010
It's just bobbing back and forth. It makes
you realize like you're dealing with,

2482
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:09,950
you know,
like you're insanely deep water there,

2483
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:15,200
Blaine, as a race, a large wave slammed
into an Antarctic cruise ship with Ada,

2484
02:20:15,210 --> 02:20:18,450
the American passengers and 77 board,

2485
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:22,360
but the ship's crew overcame minor
damage and was heading safely back to its

2486
02:20:22,361 --> 02:20:24,100
shedding.
Old Port on Wednesday,

2487
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:29,220
the vessels operator said the called
Dhea to declare an emergency on Tuesday

2488
02:20:29,560 --> 02:20:34,300
reporting it had suffered engine damage
and we'd heavy season 55 miles per hour.

2489
02:20:34,301 --> 02:20:38,800
90 key Ph wines we need was northeast
of the South Shetland islands and about

2490
02:20:38,801 --> 02:20:42,910
500 miles,
845 kilometers from our shore here.

2491
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,340
The Argentine navy said in our statement,

2492
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:49,930
the International Association of
Antarctica Tour Operators issued statement

2493
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:50,770
saying the wave,

2494
02:20:50,770 --> 02:20:54,490
the technical Dhea to cause that broken
bridges window in some electrical

2495
02:20:54,491 --> 02:20:55,324
malfunction.

2496
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:59,230
Kemp and knock out some communications
and kill this guy and engine performance.

2497
02:20:59,410 --> 02:21:00,670
Anyway,
you get to see the whole

2498
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:04,560
legion, Stephen Hawkin. You don't need.
Yeah, guy. But how, how crazy is that?

2499
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:06,910
I'm imagine that's terrifying.
That boat. Oh my God. I mean,

2500
02:21:06,930 --> 02:21:11,700
look how far it goes up. Wayne's
are so huge. It's so scary.

2501
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:14,190
And that's nothing.
There's been waves higher than that.

2502
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:16,380
There was a wave that hit Alaska.
Um,

2503
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:19,380
someone was just telling me
about this and it was in a,

2504
02:21:19,390 --> 02:21:23,700
I believe it was in the 1950s some
fucking wave. I should look this up.

2505
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:28,500
Some wave. There was a thousand feet
high. Something fell like a shelf,

2506
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:32,310
like a volcanic shelf or
you know, something off a
mountain fell into the water,

2507
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:35,880
caused this monster wave
that popped up from it.

2508
02:21:36,030 --> 02:21:39,540
And for everything from a thousand feet
down in this area where it hit is just

2509
02:21:39,541 --> 02:21:42,960
dead. There's just nothing there.
Trees gone. Everything gone.

2510
02:21:43,320 --> 02:21:48,030
A thousand feet of water. Wrap your head
around that Shit, man. Can't impossible.

2511
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:53,130
Sorry to hear how I can't quantify things.

2512
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,850
There's a fucked up video online. We
talked about this on the podcast before.

2513
02:21:56,851 --> 02:21:59,840
These kids at 900 feet above this a,

2514
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:04,080
there's Russian kids are walking on
these beams. 900 feet above this forest.

2515
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:06,540
I can't even look at Shit like that.

2516
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:10,290
I look at anything where like when I
was doing fear factor and we'd be on

2517
02:22:10,291 --> 02:22:13,440
buildings and people would have to like
do some crazy fucking stone where they

2518
02:22:13,441 --> 02:22:16,740
had to like walk across some beam or
rope or something like that across two

2519
02:22:16,741 --> 02:22:20,740
buildings. Just looking over the edge.
Your whole body. Just tangles. Well,

2520
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:24,690
I may have a normal life. Not,
not a crazy one where I, I start.

2521
02:22:25,070 --> 02:22:26,340
It's hard hyperventilating,

2522
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:29,120
but my body just, everything is telling
me to get the fuck away from the ledge.

2523
02:22:30,270 --> 02:22:32,100
Unless you need the money.
Yeah.

2524
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:35,280
Well unless you know you were in a harness
and all that other good stuff. Yeah.

2525
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,500
Obviously when I'm standing
there directing the show,

2526
02:22:37,501 --> 02:22:40,080
there's no harness on me obviously.

2527
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:44,340
What the fuck are we talking about?
Nothing.

2528
02:22:45,150 --> 02:22:50,130
Basically the end of this show has
reached because we run out of steam,

2529
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:52,690
but two hours in. It's hot
as fuck in here too. Is it?

2530
02:22:52,910 --> 02:22:57,660
That's just you and her together.
I think it's chemistry. I smell it.

2531
02:22:57,810 --> 02:23:00,780
It's in the air. What?
Britney spears perfume.

2532
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:04,650
Is that what it is due or Brittany Spears
perfume to you. That's kind of cool.

2533
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,600
Do you wear it to be ironic or
do you like the way it smells?

2534
02:23:06,601 --> 02:23:09,780
I love the way it smells.
Really. What does it smell like?

2535
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:14,190
Have you had to describe it? So
it's kind of like a lotion, like uh,

2536
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:18,120
like uh oh the lotion. Cinnamon Lotion.
Britney spears is like a vanilla fruity,

2537
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:23,550
like clean stripper. You know that
perfume angel? Yeah, that's, it's gross.

2538
02:23:23,551 --> 02:23:27,450
Right? So it was on one of my
shelves from like a long time ago.

2539
02:23:27,451 --> 02:23:30,380
Somebody left it there. What
is angel? It's a perfume angel.

2540
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:33,870
It's every woman's worn out at
some point in her life. Blue Star.

2541
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:36,300
Is it like the female version of Dzhokhar?
Yeah,

2542
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:40,740
but it's in this star and it's not like
one of those bottles that stand up.

2543
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:43,350
It's like the most retarded
shaped bottle ever. Anyways,

2544
02:23:43,351 --> 02:23:46,110
I went to go grab something off the shelf
in my bathroom and I didn't even know

2545
02:23:46,111 --> 02:23:48,810
it was there.
I fell down and broke in my bathroom.

2546
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:53,310
My fucking house smells like my
grandmother times a thousand. It's awful.

2547
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:58,980
It's don't go away. It's so gay. It's
horrible. All perfumes. Creepy. Yeah.

2548
02:24:00,390 --> 02:24:02,850
Passion of mine. Like mine. It's my MMA.

2549
02:24:03,330 --> 02:24:08,010
I love perfume and smells and lotions.
Real loud. Girls are so strange.

2550
02:24:08,130 --> 02:24:12,390
I think smells. I smelled good and at all
times. That's a Texas thing too though.

2551
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:16,170
Texas women know how to be women.
You know how to girly? Yeah.

2552
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:19,020
They know how to grill it up.
You know? It's not like Wyoming.

2553
02:24:19,021 --> 02:24:23,730
Women take a hit on women in Wyoming.
A few in Wyoming does a few coyotes,

2554
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:28,220
mountain lions and shit.
There's mountain lions and shit.

2555
02:24:28,310 --> 02:24:32,280
But the grapefruit I think is a, not
an aphrodisiac, but men are attracted.

2556
02:24:32,281 --> 02:24:35,670
This melon grapefruit. Really
Vanilla too. But grapefruits,

2557
02:24:35,671 --> 02:24:37,770
the one that does it but just
doesn't have great for dinner.

2558
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:40,170
Do you like perfume when girls
wear a perfume? Brian? Yeah,

2559
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:44,250
but there's a certain kind
of, yeah, so that's good.

2560
02:24:44,310 --> 02:24:46,720
I don't like the perfume.
The perfume. Me, you know,

2561
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,330
like the kinds of perfume right now.

2562
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:52,380
I like don't you are a hair
perfume and then I have a project.

2563
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:55,140
It's like my own thing and I do it.
Even if I'm going to be by myself all day.

2564
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:59,580
Whoa. It's smell right here.
Don't be shy. Don't be weird.

2565
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:03,600
That's good. That's very
mellow. It's not flowery.

2566
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:08,160
Smells like food. Okay, so
you're a true kind of sore.

2567
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:12,510
You know what you'd be doing
very seriously. So when
you smell a stinky girl,

2568
02:25:12,511 --> 02:25:15,000
that's like over perfume and
is that offensive to, you know,

2569
02:25:15,001 --> 02:25:17,980
I just don't want to be here. You don't
want to be here. You feel bad for her.

2570
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:20,970
Cause everybody's body chemistry
works with different smells.

2571
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,920
Like it just depends on who you are.

2572
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:25,170
Some that you could love the way it
smells in the bottle and then on you,

2573
02:25:25,171 --> 02:25:27,820
it either doesn't last or smells bad.
And so it just depends.

2574
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:31,030
Only thing I ever do is I put on deodorant
so other people don't get offended.

2575
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:36,150
You should get your photo. Timberlake's
Timberlake's is exit pretty good? No.

2576
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:39,700
What does that Justin Timberlake,
Timberlake, Cologne. I'm not wearing,

2577
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:43,340
just missed it.
I split some shit and land or armed.

2578
02:25:43,380 --> 02:25:46,480
And then chocolate one,
the chocolate one.

2579
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:50,560
I went to college with this kid who was
repugnant by every definition and he was

2580
02:25:50,561 --> 02:25:54,340
an awful person and he was fat and he was
gross and he sweat a lot. But when he,

2581
02:25:54,350 --> 02:25:56,530
when he's wondering why he would come
and we'd have these meetings for this

2582
02:25:56,531 --> 02:25:59,380
conduct your Bros and when he would
come into meetings and I hated this kid,

2583
02:25:59,381 --> 02:26:03,710
I would find myself scooting closer
because he would wear acts. Whoa.

2584
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:07,160
They have one that's called chocolate
paradise I think. Recommended.

2585
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:11,020
I think you're a freak about this. Like
good smells. I think you're afraid.

2586
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:14,050
Amazing sense of smell on it.
That's it. It's very rare.

2587
02:26:14,051 --> 02:26:16,210
I don't think I understand
what you're saying,

2588
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:19,930
but I don't think dude should a
plan for someone like, you know,

2589
02:26:19,990 --> 02:26:23,080
I think it's a very rare attraction
to smells. You have very rare.

2590
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:27,880
Do you get super fan and when dudes
fart like a friend or like a boy,

2591
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:29,680
then my boyfriend,
like a boy that you like.

2592
02:26:30,220 --> 02:26:35,220
Every boyfriend I've had has not done
it in front of me cause he knows about

2593
02:26:35,651 --> 02:26:39,100
your smelter. Super courteous
about it. I'm not even sure.

2594
02:26:39,101 --> 02:26:43,040
Like the last one we dated for a year.
He'd always leave. Never hotbox to, no,

2595
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:45,570
no one would ever do that
to me that I was serious.

2596
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:48,460
The kind of guy that would do Brian,
you're off the list.

2597
02:26:48,461 --> 02:26:53,461
Brian's a hotbox or from the 80s he was
hot boxing back before I even had a name

2598
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:56,500
back when it was an oven. Actually I
have a bit about that whole office.

2599
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:58,750
Ford is when every time
I get in a relationship,

2600
02:26:58,751 --> 02:27:01,360
like this last girl I dated from Texas,
from Houston,

2601
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:04,660
we had like a really a good relationship
and then she started doing these little

2602
02:27:04,661 --> 02:27:06,940
things that made it not romantic and more.

2603
02:27:06,941 --> 02:27:10,090
One of the things to steer asleep
blew a fart on me and goes,

2604
02:27:10,091 --> 02:27:12,040
do you want breakfast in bed? And
she goes, there's your eggs bitch.

2605
02:27:12,041 --> 02:27:15,940
And she blew a fart on me. And I'm like,
really? Did have that really did happen.

2606
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:18,760
Yeah, I did that in my ag.
That's, and that's true.

2607
02:27:18,761 --> 02:27:22,400
And then that just kills a relationship.
Girls don't ever look at it.

2608
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:23,583
Almost throwing up

2609
02:27:24,010 --> 02:27:25,180
part.
I'd done that like for sure.

2610
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:28,630
I'm foreign it on accident and then
it's like I'm saying like there's things

2611
02:27:28,631 --> 02:27:33,460
that happen, but to deliberately
suffocate someone. Right. That's gross.

2612
02:27:33,461 --> 02:27:38,450
She how rude. How rude. Houston
girls, man, they're there. Hillbilly.

2613
02:27:39,010 --> 02:27:41,620
He'll be part of my state.
You can find some good ones.

2614
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:44,810
Good ones everywhere fellow. You just
attract a certain type. I did it.

2615
02:27:44,811 --> 02:27:47,490
I got to do something about that. You
got to do something about that. Toby.

2616
02:27:47,570 --> 02:27:51,700
Blaming Texas. Well, lobby blaming
Houston for years has been Texas.

2617
02:27:51,730 --> 02:27:54,700
You could figure it out, bro.
You can get better. It's over.

2618
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,770
Do you do that to your wife? No. No Way.

2619
02:27:56,820 --> 02:28:00,990
You guys who don't Fart in front of
each other. I mean accidentally. Yeah.

2620
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,320
You wouldn't be like,
Hey, come here. No, no.

2621
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:06,190
I don't know when he wants a
smaller farts. Farts are horrible.

2622
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:11,000
There's no need for that. I eat too much.
Me are okay by the way. Someone's far.

2623
02:28:11,001 --> 02:28:13,480
It's in my little daughter far.
It's aren't that you like your own parts.

2624
02:28:13,481 --> 02:28:16,930
Doesn't eat much. She's a little girl. She
needs a lot. You'd be amazed. Her logs,

2625
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:21,200
she drops logs a little or the dog shit
in the potty. I see these logs. I'm like,

2626
02:28:21,201 --> 02:28:22,070
there's no way.
And now she

2627
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:25,940
calls it logs. I told you cause it's
your daughter, but they're huge logs.

2628
02:28:25,970 --> 02:28:29,680
If you didn't know her, you'd
be like, that's awful. If
I didn't know. Yeah, yeah,

2629
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:30,830
of course I have to pick this.

2630
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:33,380
The thing is that the parties are
ridiculous because what it is is a little

2631
02:28:33,381 --> 02:28:36,170
plastic bucket on the bottom.
That's that your baby shits in.

2632
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:39,920
So you have this like advanced
civilization where people have toilets and

2633
02:28:39,921 --> 02:28:41,870
running water,
but you don't use it for little babies.

2634
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:45,770
They have to shift it a little box
because you have to be what you were with

2635
02:28:45,771 --> 02:28:48,290
them all the time anyway.
So it's just a minor inconvenience.

2636
02:28:48,291 --> 02:28:50,660
You just dump it in the toilet
and all that. But, but it's,

2637
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:52,610
they can't climb up to
the hook the toilet, yet.

2638
02:28:52,611 --> 02:28:55,370
They're not really designed for that
yet and they can't hold themselves up or

2639
02:28:55,371 --> 02:28:57,080
they're falling. Right. So I get her,

2640
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:59,780
she's got like a little thing that sits
on top of the toilet. But then again,

2641
02:28:59,781 --> 02:29:04,610
you've got to pick her up. But she
drops these logs to like human sized.

2642
02:29:04,611 --> 02:29:08,270
I mean, if it was my poop, it would
be as big as my chest. I mean,

2643
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:11,450
it doesn't even make any
sense that there's so much
shit comes out of her little

2644
02:29:11,451 --> 02:29:15,770
body. No, you gotta take the
famous photo of her pooping.

2645
02:29:15,771 --> 02:29:18,260
Now you see the baby. That's
a good one for you. Well,

2646
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:21,860
that's something that everyone did as it
gets in on your, um, your Twitter, uh,

2647
02:29:21,870 --> 02:29:24,530
used to be, I don't have it anymore.
Let me holding my penthouse.

2648
