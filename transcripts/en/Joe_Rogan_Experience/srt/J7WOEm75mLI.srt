1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,800
Drive by day Joe Rogan podcast by night,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,963
all day.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,960
That's the other thing.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,090
Guy Mma in combat sports.

5
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,360
The means the use of social media total.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,911
Really good.

7
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:10,810
So cool man.

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,070
Unless you're,

9
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,520
unless you're Ronda
Rousey's Nunez fight are

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,930
so many fucking people.

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,970
You know what those mean?

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,950
What do you think she's coming back?

13
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:24,371
No,

14
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,204
I don't think she is.

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,740
I mean I don't think,

16
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't think,

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,050
well if she does,

18
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,860
she should come back
in a calculated manner.

19
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,010
Like don't just rush in and
fight for the title like she did.

20
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,090
I think that's crazy.

21
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,081
Taking a year off,

22
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:38,920
getting head kick,

23
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:39,754
knocked out,

24
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,271
you know?

25
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,104
Where's your head out?

26
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,610
And was she 100% committed to this as
far as like training for the entire time

27
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:50,620
off or did she just get in really good
shape over the last few months and had

28
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:51,850
she been training at all before then?

29
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,061
I mean,

30
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:54,070
you'd have to ask her and
answer all those questions,

31
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,650
but if she doesn't want to be fighting,

32
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,150
she shouldn't be fighting,

33
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:58,890
you know?

34
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,910
But you don't shouting from the beginning.

35
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,930
He had movement head movement,

36
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,640
so I assumed they worked
on the hip movement.

37
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:04,870
I just think depression,

38
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:08,510
the way she comes to the angry face
and all that shuts her down and,

39
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:10,060
and you know it's too much pressure.

40
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,040
A whole Hollywood career writes on it.

41
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,480
I mean that's not going to happen now.

42
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:13,860
Right,

43
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,111
right.

44
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:16,270
I mean because buddy the road too,

45
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,830
we talked about no footwork.

46
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,823
No,

47
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,850
but that's what nurses can do to you.

48
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:22,300
I would,

49
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,030
I like to see a Rhonda
with a smile on her face.

50
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:25,864
Go to the ring,

51
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,400
being relaxed and calm,

52
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,420
send her away,

53
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,620
go to a Duane Ludwig for a year and
have some smokers because you can still

54
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,580
legally do that.

55
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,590
And other clubs just striking,

56
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:36,220
you know,

57
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,680
she's just get in that moment
that to see where your wet.

58
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,850
I think in training,

59
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:41,320
this is the problem that everybody has.

60
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:41,981
You know,

61
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,450
in training you always do good.

62
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,530
A lot of guys do good.

63
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:45,520
But you know as well as I do,

64
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,440
there's these gym guys are
really good in training.

65
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,670
They can do it on a pressure.

66
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:51,910
So if she's been boxing and working on
a striking and she's been hitting people

67
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:52,121
left,

68
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:52,511
they're right there.

69
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:53,770
They got some good people coming in.

70
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:54,311
I heard that she,

71
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:59,140
that works out to eva with Exa boxing
champions or jammies and doing well

72
00:01:59,141 --> 00:01:59,974
against them.

73
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,940
But then again,

74
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,660
you know that that's a
nice safe environment,

75
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:08,410
bringing it under pressure with all
the crap she had on her shoulders.

76
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,060
The is also a notation of the way Nunez
is a very dangerous punch sought in

77
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:15,970
Strikeforce men right away,

78
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,240
right away her kicks or punches.

79
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,320
She kicks and punches so fucking hard
and she has long arms and she puts you on

80
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:25,530
the end of these long punches and cheat.

81
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:28,470
Dinged Rhonda very early in the fight
and you could tell she was rock.

82
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,570
She goes right back into the home fight.

83
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,070
That's right.

84
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,800
Thank habitat and noon is
also leans all the way over.

85
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,200
So it's hard to take her down,

86
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:35,900
you know,

87
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,500
and run the show you,

88
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,150
they'll show,

89
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,470
you know,

90
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,181
maybe she's doing it.

91
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,620
I'm just saying what I don't see,

92
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:39,921
you know,

93
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:43,340
maybe start wrestling over as well tell
because a girl like that with so much

94
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:43,970
talent,

95
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,500
she'll pick that up so fast.

96
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,340
But if she suddenly
shoots for a singer or,

97
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,070
but

98
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,090
you'd already been rocked.

99
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:53,930
So I think that because
remember she shucked her off
early clenches always upper

100
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,120
body couch and she always
reaches him with the left arm.

101
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,910
You know Greg Jackson,

102
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,390
I talked about it after the Holm fight
that day had seen every single one of her

103
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:01,960
fights.

104
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,920
She comes at you,

105
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,720
she grew up that left arm extended,

106
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,310
tries to get ahold of
girls with the left arm,

107
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,061
hip tosses them,

108
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,841
gets them on the ground,

109
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,940
armbars him and they
just were so prepared.

110
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,000
What is it that was going to say?

111
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,750
Interesting that whole shift from MMA,

112
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,960
from boxing demo may just
trained for Ronda Rousey fight.

113
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:20,220
Cordy car brand members says a
kickbox kickboxing and boxing champ.

114
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,440
But I'm saying in terms of her,

115
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,091
Emma May prep,

116
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:23,710
the goal was Ronda Rousey,

117
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:23,981
right.

118
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,770
And now with Cody Garbrandt he
talked about in high school,

119
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,611
Dominick Cruz.

120
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,630
And you think you wonder,

121
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:29,070
well,

122
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,270
the,

123
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,190
the laser focus,

124
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:30,371
right?

125
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:30,851
The television,

126
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,380
obviously you have to work on everything,

127
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,890
but if that's your target and
you see what he did to cruise,

128
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,251
I,

129
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,084
it's,

130
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,271
well,

131
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,140
there's a lot of fighters.

132
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,240
Okay.
