1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,880
Doo,
Doo,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,430
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Yes.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,140
You said you were in Seattle last night.
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,150
What were you doing?
So we'll stand up comedy,

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,630
cough it out someplace.
Kurt cobain and Nirvana played.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,930
Whoa.
Yeah,

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,600
absolutely.
I mean,

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,520
he wasn't there,
you know.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,080
I know,
but it's cool being in those,

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,340
I'm mean saying that doing these like a
lot of these theaters is like doing like

11
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,060
a,
like a functional museum.

12
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,660
Yeah,
yeah,

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,830
yeah.
The fillmore fillmore for sure.

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,880
Yeah.
With all those pictures in there.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,740
Dude,
I took a bunch of film of the,

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,430
we were in the dressing room apparently
that's like one of the first places that

17
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,490
the led's lepen the led Zeppelin
led Zeppelin played really when they

18
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:43,480
first came to America.
Yeah.

19
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,990
That's cool.
I don't know if it's the first or one of

20
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,790
the first,
but uh,

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,180
yeah man.
I mean that is like as museum,

22
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,630
like is he Florida ceiling too with the
pictures and they're all over all the

23
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,464
way over.

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,810
Yeah.
It's a big ass place,

25
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,400
man.
It's not like,

26
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,300
I mean,
as far as like,

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,160
it's not that big.
It's like 450 people,

28
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,560
but I mean,
as far as like what it stands for,

29
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,860
like there's a few places like that.
Um,

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,000
the Chicago theater is definitely like
that.

31
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,500
You're just walking around that place
like,

32
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,150
whoa.
He had the look of it.

33
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,500
Yeah.
There's a bunch of them that are like

34
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,900
just so old that it's a,
it's kind of weird that they let people

35
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,870
just fucking run around on stage and
tell Dick Jokes in them.

36
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,770
They're close.
Where the first tour.

37
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,050
That makes sense.
I was,

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,350
hey,
go see everybody's takes place in Denver

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,870
first.
They went straight to Denver.

40
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,760
They knew not west,
not east coast.

41
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,850
They knew that's the spot.
Yeah.

42
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,090
Why fuck around.
How long do they went to New York?

43
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,650
Good question.
Six years eve.

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,910
Oh Damn.
1969.

45
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,940
Do you know that their lawsuit is going
on right now for stealing one stairway

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,600
to heaven?
No.

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,620
Right way,
right against who?

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,720
Who's too.
They still from?

49
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,740
It was a band.
It,

50
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,690
Bill Burr was the one that turned me
onto this shit.

51
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,710
Bill Burke called me up.
He,

52
00:01:58,711 --> 00:01:59,730
because you're not going to fucking
believe it.

53
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,340
They were all fucking thieves.
They called,

54
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:04,770
they stole.
He calls me up and he sends me this a

55
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,730
youtube video to listen to and I go,
Holy Shit.

56
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,540
Like today I couldn't be a bigger led
Zeppelin for sure.

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,700
I'd love led Zeppelin.
I mean they're like do like a whole lot

58
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,610
of love is like my get high and sit back
with headphones.

59
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,280
Song,
you know old black people like it too.

60
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,140
Oh yeah.
Cause before they played hip hop on the

61
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,210
radio.
That's right.

62
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,500
They had I guess with whatsapp with,
that's all they had.

63
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,420
Soldiers went back,
pull shit,

64
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:32,100
white people music.
They were hiding.

65
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,860
Robert Johnson stealing all his music.
Led Zeppelin,

66
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,010
singer claims,
foggy memory and stairway to heaven

67
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:39,180
lawsuit.
Well,

68
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,890
I mean that's fair.
It's 50 years ago.

69
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,750
I mean that's,
boy,

70
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,130
I can barely remember shit 10 years ago.
How is this guy supposed to remember

71
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,740
shit 50 years ago?
Yeah,

72
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,260
but there's no way,
if I stole stairway to heaven,

73
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,070
I bet I'd fuck him.
Let me hear the boat.

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,430
Can we hear both of them?
We can't do it.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,760
Can we play it word zoo for stealing it
for us and not have it on the youtube or

76
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,440
what'll get,
just get us pulled from the youtube.

77
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,360
I can keep it off of youtube.
Yeah,

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,770
I can keep it off for you too.
Okay.

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,760
Okay.
So,

80
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,220
uh,
we'll listen to it and we'll be able to

81
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:09,990
talk to you.

82
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,600
And you want first the original side,
that side by side.

83
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:18,070
I've already heard the story that
everybody knows what stairway sounds

84
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:21,340
like.
Good song go up and down and speed.

85
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,590
And these pants.
This band opened for them.

86
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,130
Yeah.
So it doesn't look good.

87
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,410
Yeah.
It doesn't look good at all.

88
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,730
And this is it cause it possible.
This parent was like stole it from led

89
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,110
Zeppelin.
No,

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,520
no.
Apparently it's not because they

91
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:41,521
recorded it several years before they
tore it led Zepplin well sums it up.

92
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,650
Yeah.
I think they were cornered it like two

93
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,160
years before Zeplin did theirs.
If it's just like four chords,

94
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,110
they played the middle of the song.
Oh Wow.

95
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,260
What?
This is the original God.

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,033
Let's hear it.

97
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,820
It's God damn so close.
Well and another argument that someone

98
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,990
said,
they're called spirit.

99
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,290
It's the name of the song.
Is Taurus the best of spiritual?

100
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,070
It's a little bit better.
Wow.

101
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,050
Yeah,
it's God damn.

102
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,720
It's really close.
But someone said no,

103
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:22,090
I don't know shit about music and I know
you don't either.

104
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:25,090
Right.
This is the led Zeppelin version.

105
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,190
We know that.
Yeah.

106
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,560
We know that.
It sounds so sandler,

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,800
but someone you don't know shit about
music.

108
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,920
Like you don't play musical instruments.
I don't know either someone to Jamie,

109
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,400
you might know this.
Someone said that the music is like a

110
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,240
very common commonly use series of chord
progression.

111
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,970
I don't know the exact,
it was only three chords.

112
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,560
As I said,
he's only three chords and rock and

113
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,560
roll.
Right.

114
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,820
I don't know what that means but there's
still a lot of times songs,

115
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,920
blues scale is probably what it is or
it's a form of interest.

116
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,030
They said that dad has been using many
songs before.

117
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,923
Is that true?

118
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,220
I don't know cause they're foggy there
old.

119
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,490
Once you hit like 60 you just pretend
you're old as fuck and you don't know

120
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,080
what's going on anymore.
That's a really good day.

121
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,290
What happened?
But I don't even know he had,

122
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,470
he had like legit Alzheimer's.
Yeah,

123
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,170
but looking back,
he really didn't remember.

124
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,101
We should have been like,
oh,

125
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,000
you didn't get pills,
man.

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,270
Not believing it was a cover up.
I should've like,

127
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,163
oh,
always cry.

128
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,870
Cry for help.
He's telling the world they can't

129
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,400
remember things.
I wonder like they're really close to

130
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,280
cure and that,
you know really they're injecting

131
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:34,570
people's brains with stem cells and
fixing all kinds of weird shit that's

132
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,310
going wrong.
How is that stem cell?

133
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:37,710
I've been thinking about,
you asked me about,

134
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,610
I've been thinking about it.
It's crazy.

135
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,420
So you heal like wolverine.
It's very strange.

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,830
So,
okay,

137
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,760
we'll it,
how far away are you going to grow your

138
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,300
Dick,
Ari?

139
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,560
Not My Dick.
My hair.

140
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,240
What about hey,
why that?

141
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,540
Why can't it stay there?
We'll probably have something for that

142
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,590
soon.
I Dunno man.

143
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,990
I'll never go back to here again.
How can I shoot back up?

144
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,060
I like having a shaved head.
It's so easy,

145
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,240
so I got a good head for it.
I look better with a shaved head than I

146
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,190
did around,
especially with the hair that I had

147
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:10,020
left.
It was just all sad hair,

148
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,780
sad,
sick hair,

149
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:15,950
coffin dying people.
It's like having a cancer patient living

150
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,220
on your head.
Does that though?

151
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,280
Yeah,
it's over.

152
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,810
It's over.
I come on shorter.

153
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
I like it,
man.

154
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,611
I like having it.
Sure.

155
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,960
Yeah,
it's bullshit.

156
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,700
It's like it was a waste of my energy.
Her shaved head.

157
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,570
If you have a flat back,
that's the worst kind of head.

158
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:36,140
It's like a laptop hedge that somebody
with would a shovel in the back of your

159
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,520
head just looks like a laptop.

160
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,010
Is Flowering a book?
It was a lot of dudes that have whacked

161
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:44,390
domes,
I feel for them,

162
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,690
but you know what men did.
This doesn't look good with Harry either

163
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,290
heads.
Weird heads are weird heads we need to

164
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,810
do is get one of them like a head,
like a fake,

165
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,910
but they just put it in your head and
plants.

166
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,990
That's a girl's like,
I'm like,

167
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,210
why is it will soften the back.
That's probably totally a good idea.

168
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,220
Probably most people aren't touching
your hood.

169
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,421
Well,
you could always say,

170
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,980
yeah,
I was in a motorcycle accident.

171
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,140
I last guys,
he turned me on me mind you just had a a

172
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,340
but put in the back of your head like a
fake it,

173
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,040
but it feels like like a rotting apple
consistency of it.

174
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,440
We were laughing at this,
right?

175
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,150
They do that to Chin's put double chins
and they put a fake Chin and people,

176
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,700
it's super common.

177
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,280
What do you mean?
They put a fake Chin on people?

178
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,560
Who does that?
Plastic surgeons,

179
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,730
I think they go in through the door,
like the lip area where the teeth are

180
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,470
and they shove like an implant in your
Chin because some people have a very

181
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,870
small chance,
like the Chin is tucked up in their neck

182
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,960
and they,
they feel like it's unattractive people.

183
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,050
It's weird.
He's chinless is bothering him.

184
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,730
No,
he makes jokes about it and that's good.

185
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,870
Yeah,
that's good.

186
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,120
Some people don't want to look around
about it,

187
00:07:56,121 --> 00:08:00,470
so they get a piece of plastic screwed
into their chin.

188
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,570
They will take it to the next level and
then go to log.

189
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,250
They do at the back of their head.
That's what I'm saying.

190
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:08,240
Dudes with a flat back of the head flat
back around that shit out man.

191
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,010
Look like a normal dude.
I'm not against that.

192
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,790
I guess a not against that.
If they can make it feel like a skull

193
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,580
back there instead of just fucking
bench.

194
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,330
If it gets loose stretch Armstrong.
Oh yeah.

195
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,920
It starts leaking out.
What if you're banging a girl and she

196
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,120
grabbed your head and she pops it
losing.

197
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,700
She thinks she broke your skull.

198
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:33,010
Big Way to go to Goldie.
Crazy bitch.

199
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,360
What might happen to your head?
You did something which they get some

200
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:47,090
fucking wallboard screws.
Tighten that bitch down.

201
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,440
That's wholesale like replacements seem
weird.

202
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,310
Putting a fucking plastic plate on the
back of your head is not.

203
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,270
I guarantee you there's a plastic
surgeon out there right now running to a

204
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:04,020
notepad and writing this shit down and
he's going to offer it to dudes with

205
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,970
flatheads.
Are you a flat back?

206
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,040
You have to convince somebody.
They have a flood head.

207
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,110
Did your parents never buy you a pillow
until you were old enough to complain as

208
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,300
the back of your head flat like a table?
Well,

209
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,820
flat back,
no more

210
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,090
thanks to Dr. Crooked Heimer doctrine
quicker and himer specializes in making

211
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:28,050
your fucking mutant alien wrote looking
head.

212
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,850
Did you think you're fun?
You're not,

213
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,590
you're not fine.
You're not fine.

214
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,160
No.
How about those weird ancient cultures

215
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:38,850
that used to flatten heads on purpose?
[inaudible]

216
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,000
you ever seen those Peruvian James Peru,
I believe?

217
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,400
Yeah.
Well they think the Egyptian thing was

218
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,160
that implants and the launch of they
could have fucked with the shape of

219
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:48,780
their head,
but they also could have been like

220
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,060
inbreeding because apparently like two
ton common had a series of like,

221
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,500
well we'll go to two ton common next
Jamie.

222
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,440
Um,
no,

223
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,150
go to these like,
well you see that guy,

224
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:03,100
the baby up there where they're
stretching the baby's head out so that

225
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,640
the black and white one right next to
add Jamie?

226
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,500
No,
be their photo.

227
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,050
The actual photo go up and up the photo.
Yeah,

228
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,670
that one.
Oh,

229
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:15,840
that's like that's an actual baby where
they're distorting this young baby's

230
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:20,841
head while it's soft with pressure by
these chords and they tighten it down.

231
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,340
And this is modern times because this is
from,

232
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,150
yeah,
I mean this is obviously from a,

233
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,213
yeah,
it's crazy.

234
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,260
It's crazy.
Wow.

235
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,660
Yeah.
So they can make them look like aliens

236
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,740
or they take it off [inaudible] wow.
It can totally like fuck the shape of

237
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,790
your head up forever.
And then that's what your head shaped

238
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,570
like now because it's all done when
you're a baby and your head is really,

239
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:50,571
so your brain goes into that dude,
you're fucked or you love it.

240
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,390
You know we're here might be your shit.
But if you look at like the images of

241
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:55,710
like ancient Egypt,
like right there,

242
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:59,370
he just clicked on that one like this.
They think that that was maybe part of

243
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:04,371
the practice that they were doing to
differentiate them from the rest of the

244
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,600
people.
So there was that.

245
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,260
But to 10 common apparently had a series
of issues.

246
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,650
He had like a,
some degenerative issues.

247
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,510
They think that he might not have been
healthy.

248
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,940
See if they like whatever.
Try to save him.

249
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,361
No,
not,

250
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,620
don't,
don't Google head shape.

251
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,870
T just go with um,
uh,

252
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,710
medical issues to tongue common medical
issues along that.

253
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,750
Ladies and a in Thailand.
Oh really?

254
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,770
Whoa.
Bigger and bigger than they can't take

255
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,120
them off because there was a kind of
wobbly.

256
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,640
Yes.
He looked like he had a cane and shit.

257
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,440
He was,
his body was all fucked up.

258
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,050
It's like,
why does it say he has breasts?

259
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,680
Why'd they give him breasts?
Ooh,

260
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,880
visit page,
please.

261
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,300
So we're looking at King Tut had
feminine hips.

262
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,500
Feral suffered from several afflictions
because his parents were brother and

263
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,810
sister.
Oh,

264
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,390
whoa.
Reading Good Leslie through on these

265
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,440
ads.
Whoa.

266
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,690
Oh,
game of thrones type shits on Friday

267
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:12,160
about the human face.
Kingtones list of ailments isn't the

268
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:16,690
result of ancient Egyptian curse.
The researchers were able to point out a

269
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,850
more scientific culprit.
Incest,

270
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,590
Albert Zinc scientific director of the
institute of Mummies and the ice man in

271
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:28,591
Italy used genetic fingerprinting and
tests on mitochondrial DNA to determine

272
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:32,380
the king.
Tut's parents were without a shadow of a

273
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,000
doubt,
brother and sister.

274
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,180
Fuck,
here's his list of things.

275
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,170
Oh yeah.
Rule out club was the curse.

276
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,200
No curse.
Just rolled it out.

277
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,633
Finally.
Anchor.

278
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,850
How crazy is nature,
man?

279
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,370
He had a prominent overbite.
Pronounced overbite,

280
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,830
Feminine Hips,
Club Foot.

281
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,570
Wow.
Workforce lose bones in his foot.

282
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,640
Jesus Christ,
loose bones in his foot.

283
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,070
Lose your los.
You're not supposed to fuck your brother

284
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,320
or sister home.
Not supposed to fuck your brother or

285
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,800
sister.
They worked out pretty good and game of

286
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,300
thrones worked out well.
Not really.

287
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,950
That one.
One evil popped up.

288
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,060
Yeah,
but his body was all right.

289
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,070
The girl was fine.
They made the girl fine.

290
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,310
She had had poisoned.
She was the only one that was fine.

291
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,630
This new one's a pussy.
God,

292
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,400
he's such a pussy.
Such a pussy.

293
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,800
It makes me angry.
It's almost like,

294
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,140
it's almost like they listened to the,
the um,

295
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,490
the protest against them from afar.
Whatever liberal.

296
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,251
I'm like,
okay,

297
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,240
fine.
This is what you want.

298
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,360
This is what kind of coverage you want.
We can do nothing.

299
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,770
Fine.
Enjoy this for three seasons.

300
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,600
You know,
it doesn't make sense though.

301
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,670
It's super hard to imagine someone
abandoning their mom when they're that

302
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:43,420
much of a pussy.

303
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,300
That's the most ridiculous aspect about
it.

304
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,080
Yeah.
Because that's one thing that puts these

305
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:48,940
want is they want to be around their
mommy.

306
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,430
Right?
You need your mom for support.

307
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,050
So like all the sudden he's so strong,
but uh,

308
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,500
who's in his ear?
The only chick was ever given out the

309
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,180
post to him.
That's that pussy.

310
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,630
So strong,
so strong.

311
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,750
And she's pretty and she knows the fuck
she's doing and she's got a gay brother,

312
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:05,890
so you know,
she's a freak to,

313
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,780
this guy's in America.
Killed all those guys.

314
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,970
Killed their girlfriend's ex husband,
her husband.

315
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:11,230
Right.
That's like a normal thing.

316
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:13,930
What was that girl's name?
What's that jail.

317
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,760
She tasted like a student in high school
and then made the student kill her hug.

318
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,351
Oh yeah,
yeah,

319
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:19,711
yeah,
yeah,

320
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:21,220
yeah.
God Damn it.

321
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,590
That was,
there's been a bunch of them that not

322
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,030
met laterno right.

323
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,760
The Turner was just the one that Pam
Smart?

324
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,920
No,
you sure?

325
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,290
No,
I think it's Pam smart.

326
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,210
I think she was the one who paid the
high school cause she went to jail.

327
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,400
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

328
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,510
You can't do that.
I mean,

329
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,120
I bet there's a bunch of others.
They really can't do that.

330
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:42,610
It's really just now.
Well people have definitely gotten away

331
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:46,840
with it for every like dumbed chick who
hired two 15 year olds.

332
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,020
There's a smart lady who hired an actual
assassin.

333
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,030
Right.
I'll,

334
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,710
did you ever go down the block Talia?
Uh,

335
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,410
youtube tools?
Yeah,

336
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:55,280
I did.
I have.

337
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,170
Oh,
I watched a whole special one of those

338
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:58,060
crime.
Watch them,

339
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,730
watch them laugh.
I think it's so casual.

340
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,740
Like you want to go for donuts,
good donuts plates over the hair.

341
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,100
Like as they're just finished this,
you're going to kill my husband.

342
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,933
That,
yeah.

343
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,640
And the way they say it too,
like I just can't go through the

344
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:11,840
divorce.
It's just,

345
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,190
it's almost like easier than letting
them know I don't love you anymore.

346
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,690
For some people it is.
For some people that actually becomes

347
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,030
what they want to do instead,
they're like,

348
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,400
I don't want to go through this divorce.
I don't like this guy.

349
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll just fucking whack 'em
shut off.

350
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,650
Yeah,
they just didn't want to do it anymore

351
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,060
because if you think about it,
right,

352
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,390
you got to get divorced.
This dude,

353
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,910
what if he gets mad at beats you up?
What is,

354
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:40,230
he denies your money.
What if?

355
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,680
What if he fucking kicks you out on the
street?

356
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,380
If you don't care about them at all,
then yeah,

357
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:46,880
that's the easier way to go,
Joe.

358
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:50,060
There's just some people out there that
are just fucking nuts.

359
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,840
They're just fucking nuts and if you run
into those people,

360
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,180
you gotta you gotta fucking problem.

361
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,160
You got a fucking problem.
They're just fucking nuts.

362
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,100
And if you marry one of those people and
you live in one of those people for a

363
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,660
long time,
then you try to break up with them.

364
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,520
You've got to fucking problems.
What are you get to do?

365
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,310
What are you going to do?
You some lady from Nebraska just once be

366
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:09,170
on our own.
Just wants to be free.

367
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,730
She,
the,

368
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,350
the clutches of her father held it down
when she was young and now she's got

369
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,740
this fucking asshole,
this man that she's like legally

370
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,170
obligated and he says he's gonna kill
her if she leaves.

371
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah.
No,

372
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,230
I don't think so.
Bitch.

373
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,870
Dalia Dippolito,
she was calling the guy in afterwards

374
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,120
when she found out it was still alive.
She was like,

375
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:28,010
mark,
get inher mark,

376
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,150
come help me.
And he's like,

377
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,940
I can't,
and you tried to have me killed.

378
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,710
Stop.
Don't believe that.

379
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,850
He was like,
they showed me.

380
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,350
He goes,
that's fake.

381
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,260
He was almost still swaying to go back
to her.

382
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,410
Oh my God.
It was almost like,

383
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,110
what?
And he's like,

384
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,090
I can't help anyway.
They have you tried to hide someone to

385
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,490
kill me.
It's out of my hands.

386
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,860
They have you on camera,
bitch.

387
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,730
Yeah.
The power that brings you back in.

388
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,540
And they're such good actresses when
they find out,

389
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,860
they find when they supposedly find out
that her husband got killed.

390
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,753
Well,
they're insane.

391
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

392
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,330
I mean he's a lot of people out there
that are getting people whacked or

393
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,750
completely fucking insane.
They can shut off.

394
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,340
Oh yeah,
they're just disconnected.

395
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,240
I wonder if you meant from the truth
when,

396
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,290
if you met them,
she would feel that one of you feel that

397
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,880
vibe if you were talking to them.

398
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,410
I think it's just compartmentalizing.
It might be you shut that door and then

399
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:24,920
let it in as if it's new information.
There's also people that have killed

400
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:28,550
people before and it gets easier.
Like that story Jamie that you were

401
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:31,820
telling me about,
that they suspected some seal stabbed

402
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:35,780
some guy after a fight.
They got in a fight and then afterwards,

403
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,610
uh,
all have to pull a guy's name up.

404
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,230
I don't know.
Who knows if it's even true?

405
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,030
He stabbed him.
Yeah,

406
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:44,240
he stabbed him cause they're the blood
lust and well they got in a fight

407
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:47,570
apparently and then afterwards they
arrested him because the guy got stabbed

408
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,580
somewhere and died and they think it
might be connected,

409
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,330
but you got to imagine it.
Just forget about this story,

410
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,650
which I don't know what happened.
Right.

411
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,270
I'm trying to be fair as fuck,
but a guy who you teach how to kill

412
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:03,480
people who you hired,
killed people and ordered to kill

413
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,790
people.
It's probably used to fucking killing

414
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,660
people.
Right.

415
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,880
And some people aren't and they might
say something crazy like,

416
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,770
I'll fucking kill you bitch.
I'm gonna see you on the street.

417
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:13,140
I'm going to kill you.
And they say that to a navy seal.

418
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,820
And he goes,
Oh really?

419
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,671
Yeah.
It's like,

420
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,380
okay,
well I'm gonna remember that.

421
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,490
And then he waits to get outside of that
building and say,

422
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,250
hey dude,
I don't really want you to kill me so

423
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:25,590
I'm going to kill you and he fucking
kills you.

424
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,650
So like who knows what happened?
But I would assume that if a dude gets

425
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,750
super used to killing people and really
good at it,

426
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,320
that's not the kind of fuck with,
yeah,

427
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,130
I'm not going to pull it up,
but I just googled it again.

428
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,710
His lawyer,
he might not have done it.

429
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,820
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

430
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,930
There you go.
I heard this thing on her right now,

431
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,360
man.
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,520
But I'm just going to say,
people that get in bar fights,

433
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,890
they have a lot of fucking people that
hate him.

434
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,790
It could easily be a coincidence.
The reason to that up the fight is what

435
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,910
they're saying is that he detained them
on the pier for allegedly taking

436
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:58,230
pictures of underage girls.

437
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,460
So it's like,
Oh,

438
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,710
oh Jesus Christ.
Well,

439
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,280
maybe.
Yeah.

440
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,510
Okay,
well there you go.

441
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,400
There might be a lot of people that
wanted to kill that guy.

442
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,833
Yeah.
You,

443
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,760
if you're taking pictures of underage
girls,

444
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:11,280
you didn't,
you haven't like led an awesome pristine

445
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:13,950
life and then one day you're like,
you know what man?

446
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,830
Oh,
that's what I wanted to tell you to hear

447
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,780
the shit they found it Michael Jackson's
place.

448
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,670
Oh wait,
hold on.

449
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,600
Let me think of what it could be first.
Yeah,

450
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,330
I mean definitely under our child porn.
Um,

451
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,590
maybe a body,
no.

452
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,790
Oh,
just go ahead with her.

453
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,900
I look
like a whole underground ranch,

454
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:37,320
like another whole play area for when
the apocalypse comes,

455
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,590
that kind of thing.
Or possibly even a,

456
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,990
some unreleased tapes of music.
They never

457
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,030
would if they found a cash.
Let's be honest here.

458
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,390
They found a cache of photos of Michael
Jackson getting his dick sucked by boys

459
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,520
and right next to that cash was one of
the best God damn albums at Michael's

460
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,354
ever put out.

461
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,670
And what if the music companies,
the ones that found it,

462
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,240
wait and they get together,
they have a little music meeting.

463
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,760
When we going to be here this week,
we've got two options.

464
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,000
Either everybody assumes that he fucks
him kids,

465
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,180
but there's no proof.
So we forgive him and we buy his music

466
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,330
or we let these photos kit out and we
ruined the legacy of one of the greatest

467
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:22,050
artists of all time.
It would you look,

468
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:24,000
we're not going to save these kids from
sucking his deck.

469
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,530
They sucked his dick.
It's gone.

470
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,650
It's water under the bridge.
It would be a greater crime if we get to

471
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,820
loose this music to the public that burn
like a Jew.

472
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,560
We burn these dirty photos.
They're going to cost money.

473
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:37,050
They're going to take food out of the
mouths of your children.

474
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,970
These photos.
That's not fair.

475
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,530
My children to do anything.

476
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,820
Not Fair.
Your kids didn't do anything.

477
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,500
My children didn't come onto a
superstar.

478
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,270
Sal,
your kids are good kids.

479
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,510
They deserve the best education can
point.

480
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,560
We can't sink this ship.
It's got a door in these fucking

481
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:53,470
pictures.
You probably have a furnace going 24,

482
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:57,270
seven at any major record label just in
case something like that comes up and

483
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,700
get chuck a hard drive in there.
What did they fine?

484
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,030
They found photos of um,
adult bodies with kids' faces engaged in

485
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:10,900
pornographic acts.
Like weird.

486
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,570
I'm weird.
Pornography allegedly.

487
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:17,050
This is all allegedly who allege it
cause I haven't seen it and I don't

488
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:17,860
know.
I don't know what's,

489
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,431
yeah,
pull up.

490
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:23,410
Pull up one of the articles so we can,
well it's what's animal mutilation to

491
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,090
right.
And uh,

492
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,610
he had photos of that very good photos
of,

493
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,110
I might have some of that too.

494
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,900
Um,
among the items found were pictures of

495
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:34,480
adult binds with children's face is
super imposed on them.

496
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:37,120
Sexy pictures of his nephews in their
underwear.

497
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,250
Pictures of bleeding children,
the animals,

498
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:42,280
including a photo of a child holding
what looks like a goose bludgeoned to

499
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:44,590
death diaries.
Audio tapes,

500
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:47,380
video tastes,
prescription drugs to treat sex

501
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:50,410
addiction.
One inside of claim that Michael Jackson

502
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:54,460
had a book called room to play,
which included a picture of Jon Benet

503
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,200
Ramsey look alike with a noose around
her neck.

504
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,810
But that's,
but what does that one insider,

505
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,660
whoever that insider or is like?
I never trust that.

506
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,940
When I read that catch,
you can't show the pictures we're

507
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:07,780
talking about because other stuff.
Well then how am I supposed to form

508
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,700
just,
it's hard to form an opinion.

509
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,603
Yeah,
but that,

510
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,220
that,
that term one insider sensitize it just

511
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,960
all right.
It could be one liar.

512
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,600
Well,
it,

513
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,400
the problem is like when you say
something like that one insight or what

514
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:24,800
that tells me is you either don't have
enough backup up,

515
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,530
up,
up,

516
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,310
up.
Right.

517
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,930
I know.
No other way other way down.

518
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,210
Yeah.
Uh,

519
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,580
okay.
Ron Zone and a former Santa Barbara da

520
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,840
was on the prosecution team.
Told radar.

521
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,763
Okay.
And then,

522
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:36,971
well,
okay,

523
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,770
well that guy,
he's saying something.

524
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,280
He's saying a lot of this stuff was used
desensitize the children he added,

525
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:46,300
we identified five different boys who
all made allegations of sexual abuse.

526
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,480
There's not much question in my mind
that Michael was guilty of.

527
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,310
Child molestation.
Whoo.

528
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,260
That's heavy.
Yeah,

529
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,810
we kind of that.
Yeah,

530
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,230
but that's also a guy who can never
prove it.

531
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:57,520
So maybe he's still like,
see,

532
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:01,090
but what's the weird shit is like the
house looks great and his Mugshot,

533
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,320
he looks really different.
That's Skelton.

534
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,060
Michael.
Well,

535
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:11,650
he looks like some sort of a creation
that's barely a human anymore.

536
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,700
Whatever he's done to his face,
he looks like Cgi of like two years ago.

537
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,350
So strange.
Well,

538
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:20,530
you know what it looks like claymation
maybe like a claymation.

539
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:21,920
I was just gonna say that.
Yeah,

540
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,410
like some sort of a,
uh,

541
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,160
like an artistic representation of the
psalm one.

542
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,050
Not an actual someone.
Yeah.

543
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,280
Like if you ever seen that Barbie Lady,
the Russian Barbie Lady,

544
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,360
no,
dude,

545
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,750
this girl spent like $100,000 on surgery
to turn herself into a real life Barbie.

546
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,140
So she doesn't look like a person.
Her.

547
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,460
She had her,
her like her widened and shit.

548
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,990
That's her.
Yeah.

549
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,090
Dude,
that wasn't a real person,

550
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:50,610
but it's a real person.
Fucking waste.

551
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,520
Go back to that.
It's just we got,

552
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,290
there's a little issue that is not a
real person.

553
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:54,920
It is dude.

554
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,701
It is.
Yeah.

555
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:59,270
There's a bunch of film of her actually.
Make sure that's true.

556
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,090
That's what I've seen the drawing.
I've seen a at least one toe but didn't

557
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:06,050
show that had her on and she can walk
fine.

558
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,650
Well they're all saying a person that
shape couldn't walk.

559
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,320
Well you can.
Yeah.

560
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,480
Just most people could never be that
shape.

561
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,390
Will they put course it's on.
They smashed their body down,

562
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:21,740
but look like her.
Her eyes with the [inaudible] logo logo.

563
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,910
It's weird man.
Like right there.

564
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,890
Like that's,
that's a perfect example.

565
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,970
That one photo that does not look real.
Who,

566
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,780
first of all,
that's how old this shit I,

567
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,260
this is like ruins the purpose of this
by them taking these photos with filters

568
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,600
because I could look like Barbie to it
filters.

569
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,190
You know,
you should show this like in a raw,

570
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,540
gritty,
close up.

571
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,740
I want to see her video of her talking.
Exactly.

572
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,160
Well,
that's what she used to look like,

573
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,900
and that's what she looks like now.
Wow.

574
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,100
You know what?
She was hot.

575
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,480
She was pretty,
yeah,

576
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,770
she's pretty.
She was like,

577
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,140
she's ethnic looking and she looked,
she looked hot.

578
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:59,870
She looks redneck hot to me.
That's what I like.

579
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,120
Yeah.
Barefoot drunk.

580
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,070
No Way.
Crazy.

581
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,591
Yeah.
That's,

582
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:07,890
look at these eyes.
Sleep.

583
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,480
Why Water?
Look at her eyes and the whole thing is

584
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,720
so strange.
Now that doesn't look too filtered,

585
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,040
but it's definitely filtered.
Right.

586
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,550
She'll look Makena.
Yeah,

587
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,301
right.
That's going to be,

588
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,670
you're fucked all of the future.
That's pretty,

589
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:24,230
that's close enough that I would go for
that.

590
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,370
Oh,
you would definitely go for it.

591
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:26,540
Sure.
That's common.

592
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,640
That's coming on,
or percent.

593
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,040
Hundred percent.
Hundred percent.

594
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,660
They'll that'll be in one of the first
versions of commercial artificial

595
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:37,754
intelligence.

596
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,110
It'll just have drives every industry
that it was more than porn,

597
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:42,950
my friend.
Yeah.

598
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,190
That's some sort of a prostitutional
loophole.

599
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,100
No,
I mean people are already using those

600
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,420
flashlights.
Oh yeah.

601
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,920
Wouldn't know.
Oh yeah.

602
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:53,890
Real feeling.
Humanity.

603
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,490
Yeah,
that'd be way better.

604
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,840
Oh fuck yeah,
dude.

605
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,540
They're probably gonna figure out a way
to have megan have actual skin.

606
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,313
Yeah.
Yeah.

607
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,060
I mean they can make skin in a lab.
They figured out how to make skin.

608
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,130
So if they make skin,
are they really?

609
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,120
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

610
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,310
So I can make actual skin on a fuck
doll.

611
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,203
Yeah.

612
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,720
They can reproduce like little things
like,

613
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,360
um,
they've reproduced a person's bladder or

614
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:21,110
a woman got bladder cancer and they
recreate it or bladder with stem cells

615
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,950
and put it back in her body.
What do you mean they can't use it to

616
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:25,980
make hair?
They're going to,

617
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,740
they're going to figure it out
eventually.

618
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,173
But,
um,

619
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,081
the,
uh,

620
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:35,240
the Oregon thing there,
they're going to figure that out too.

621
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,700
They're going to be able to replace
hearts and livers and all kinds of

622
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,370
different things and make them all in a
lab and then put them in your body.

623
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,950
It's going to be real weird,
but they're definitely gonna be able to

624
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,810
make it a skin.
Did you feel the heart beating while

625
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,840
you're fucking a woman maybe shows now
heartbeat,

626
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,410
bro?
No.

627
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,690
I mean,
can they make that one was the one that

628
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:53,100
doesn't have rp?
It does.

629
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,160
When it does happen for sure.
Definitely have to beat a human before

630
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:56,641
they're like,
oh no,

631
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,290
you can't.
You have to ask permission from now.

632
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,310
Well,
you know what,

633
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,600
man,
I think it's going to slip under the

634
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:02,740
radar.
I'm not cause Hussein's at heart with

635
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,521
they have to go.
Who could?

636
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,300
It could give permission for this shit.
That's it.

637
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,460
He gets into almost like these God
realm.

638
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,640
Yeah.
What point did you get a live well,

639
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,590
if you,
if you keep going right,

640
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,090
if you take whatever sort of a robots
they have now,

641
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,380
they have some kind of goofy looking
robots know mostly just torsos and they

642
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:25,140
talk and some of the bodies move pretty
decent.

643
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,680
If you just go a hundred years from now,
do you have any idea how crazy,

644
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,750
whatever the fuck they have now,
it's going to be in a hundred years.

645
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,370
It's going to be impossible for us to
imagine because there's inventions that

646
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,130
you need to have before the big
inventions and those,

647
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,980
they haven't even been about this.

648
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,810
There's going to be some leaps in the
understanding of the very nature of the

649
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:52,230
universe itself and they're going to be
able to change all sorts of stuff that

650
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:55,650
they do.
And life itself is also going to be on

651
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:56,850
that list.
They're going to make it,

652
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,481
man,
they're gonna,

653
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:00,150
they're gonna make it.
And even if they make it like a fuck

654
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:03,570
doll that it has like a limited brain
that it's only good for like fuck

655
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:05,430
activities.
You can have it as a friend.

656
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,180
You just come home and this thing has
some sort of an artificial brain that

657
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:13,290
wants to suck Dick and that's all it is.
She and Joey wants to succeed cars.

658
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,210
She's not,
she's not a skank.

659
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:17,550
She's not running out fucking everybody
else.

660
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,000
She just wants to wait for you to fuck
the shit out of her and you're at work.

661
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,660
Oh like that.

662
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,490
And you're looking,
you're looking at your watch.

663
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,770
Like,
I can't wait to get home,

664
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:25,923
man.
Shit.

665
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,050
Well,
how come that's not okay.

666
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:29,700
It's not a real person.
How come that's not okay,

667
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:32,400
but xbox is okay,
what can we just go home and kill?

668
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:36,270
People can wait,
go home and fucking gun people down

669
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,760
online.
How that women are going to protest the

670
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,130
fuck out of those fuck dolls.
Of course they will not.

671
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,010
They are not happy with that idea.
Especially when they give them away with

672
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:47,250
an oil change and get a free fuck doll.
I wonder if they had like a shelf life

673
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:50,280
in the beginning.
Like they deteriorate like a person die

674
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:54,240
job like three,
four weeks when women go the other way

675
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:55,680
with it too.
But yeah.

676
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,480
Fuck those.
Just ramming them the whole night.

677
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,220
Yeah,
sure.

678
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,830
Absolutely.
Sub would so some women who don't like

679
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:02,670
Dick,
is that what you're saying?

680
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,930
No,
they don't like guys.

681
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,360
There's tired dude.
Yeah.

682
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,080
Get pounded all night and not have to
deal with.

683
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah,
for sure.

684
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,630
Oh,
so they would just hire some guy builds

685
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,240
on robot stuff.
Sure.

686
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,980
Yeah.
It's definitely gonna happen for some

687
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,800
women.
Slowly there we got a pudgy belly behind

688
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:17,540
it.
They like,

689
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,690
well,
you know what the problem is going to

690
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,940
be.
There's not just that people don't just

691
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:24,720
have a desire to fuck.
They also have a desire for a deep

692
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,910
connection with somebody.
Yeah,

693
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:27,270
sure.
You don't get that.

694
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,120
You don't get that.
That would be a negative.

695
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,090
So it's people going to go crazy.
They're going to be sad and crying.

696
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:35,940
Almost like the same way.
People who live entirely online or

697
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:39,300
completely socially fuck that.
They said that about chat rooms 20 years

698
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:40,134
ago.

699
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,310
Look around,
if you,

700
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,920
if you really do take it into
consideration,

701
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,680
I mean,
oh man,

702
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,650
I'm just going to be sad people.
Yeah.

703
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:53,750
You would be like,
I'm just,

704
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,450
you know,
people will have a porn addiction and

705
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:56,620
even read those guys.
Oh yeah.

706
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,290
They're like,
I had to stop or it was getting crazy.

707
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,250
I couldn't concentrate on anything.
Yeah.

708
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,710
Well that's what they're saying.
Michael Jackson had some sort of a sex

709
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:07,510
addiction.
Jesus dark too.

710
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:09,130
Super Dark,
like midnight.

711
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,660
It's just spooky that that guy was doing
that to these kids while he was the

712
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:18,970
biggest star in the world.
I mean,

713
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,510
we all know it's true.
What did people still going?

714
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,220
No,
cause they don't want to,

715
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,020
they don't want to believe.
Come on.

716
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,810
There's an elementary school near in
Hollywood,

717
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,250
uh,
the,

718
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:33,010
the auditorium for the school,
as did Michael Jackson Auditorium.

719
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,510
Feel free to change that one.
At least auditorium.

720
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,000
That's Jamie's version of for sure it's
free.

721
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,510
Oh,
it's so true.

722
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,150
God,
how weird that many allegations.

723
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,420
It's always a hundred percent guilty if
they're saying that they have all this

724
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:55,900
stuff that's just,
it's weird stuff too,

725
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,420
man.
The mutilated animals and shit.

726
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,850
Like what's,
and if people still be like,

727
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,760
he did everything but he did everything,
but he just liked to cuddle with them at

728
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,240
night.
Didn't do anything creepy to them.

729
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,630
He looked at pictures,
but that's not an actions.

730
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,400
Well,
if you take a kid's head,

731
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,500
here's the thing.
That might be the only way he could

732
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,740
legally possess child pornography.
And for what?

733
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,090
That might be the only way he could have
legally possessed child pornography.

734
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,570
He was taking a photo.
No,

735
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:23,230
taking a photo of a kid's head and
putting it on an adult's body.

736
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,810
We're two adults are having sex,
which is apparently what he did.

737
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:27,820
He's impose the photos or had someone do
it.

738
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,180
That might be like a legal loophole that
allows you to watch child porn.

739
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,620
Oh,
you know what I'm saying?

740
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,990
Yeah.
Well you could have that and you know,

741
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,700
he's a really good job of it.
But yeah,

742
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:40,720
for sure.
I know what I'm saying.

743
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,360
I want to watch,
I don't know if there's any loopholes

744
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,330
for child porn,
but it's not child porn.

745
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,700
I've a guy of a little boy's face.
No,

746
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:50,440
I think,
I think you might have a point though,

747
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,910
because I think I read something
recently about they were taking God damn

748
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,590
it.
What was the,

749
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,490
they were saying,
oh,

750
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:00,050
it was about,
it had to do with anime and had to do an

751
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,950
animated stuff and they were,
um,

752
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,933
there were,
there were,

753
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,080
it was pretty explicitly saying that
even animated child pornography,

754
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,400
like if you did like CGI child,
that's Toronto.

755
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,520
Yes.
Yes.

756
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,270
Wow.

757
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,650
Really?
Yeah.

758
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,820
Right.
What does it sound like?

759
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,270
Fosters it urge.
What if they're like little animate baby

760
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,800
pandas?
It seems like a release in urge to let

761
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:26,080
them jerk off.
It's hard because you know what,

762
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm with you and no one gets hurt in
them.

763
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:32,641
And I feel like a hypocrite because I've
always resisted the pornography equals

764
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,680
rape of women because I just don't think
it,

765
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,010
but then again,
it doesn't do that to me.

766
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,710
Just because it doesn't do that to me,
doesn't mean it can't foster that in

767
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,270
somebody.
But it's one of those things where like,

768
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:44,960
okay,
look,

769
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,260
if you eat a whole bottle of aspirin,
you could fucking die.

770
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,110
Should we only sell aspirin one at a
time to prevent death?

771
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,940
You do.
Should you have to go to the store and

772
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:56,000
buy one aspirin or should I fucking
trust you with a hundred Aspen in here?

773
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,631
I said,
trust me,

774
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:57,710
I trust you.
Right?

775
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,890
So that's gotta be the same way with
porn because for a lot of us,

776
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,410
you watch porn,
you just watching two people have sex.

777
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,060
You get excited,
you jerk off,

778
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,010
you feel better.
You move on with your life,

779
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,440
you're taking care of a biological need.
It doesn't,

780
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,160
it doesn't foster some fucking need to
rape in a normal person.

781
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,150
I haven't had sex in two weeks.
I like how you bend down when you say

782
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:17,660
that.
You're like,

783
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,120
oh
yeah,

784
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,973
start thinking,

785
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,470
not getting lazy,
not wash up.

786
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Sure.
There's been an update as of today,

787
00:33:26,581 --> 00:33:30,720
since probably maybe since we've been
doing podcasts that say a Michael

788
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,400
Jackson's estate reached out to vanity
fair,

789
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,920
um,
and said everything in these reports,

790
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:38,130
including what the county of Santa
Barbara calls content that appears to be

791
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:40,380
obtained off the internet or through
unknown sources.

792
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:42,900
It's false.
Of course they would be that guy.

793
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:45,870
Just tell it to get him because he never
saw it's one website that started

794
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:46,830
reporting all this.
So

795
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,280
that could be called be bullshit.
Yeah,

796
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,600
totally.
It could be bullshit.

797
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,010
You know what?
I'm going to throw out the evidence of

798
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:53,060
that guy,
the former Da,

799
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,560
cause he's definitely got an ax to
grind.

800
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,860
He's not impartial.
He could be a,

801
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,940
yeah.
Upset that he didn't nab that guy.

802
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,550
Yeah.
So he's just talking about it now.

803
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:00,951
No,
it was,

804
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,540
man,
it's when you read everything,

805
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,920
start out.
Here's the thing,

806
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:04,820
right?
If you know,

807
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,960
like if you knew that guy was guilty and
you couldn't do anything about it,

808
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,270
you couldn't get them and you were a
former dea,

809
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,210
you would fucking go to great lengths.
Fuck him.

810
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,310
Fuck his legacy.
I know we did that shit.

811
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,430
You remember that during the Mark
Furhman days?

812
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,950
Would they be accused Mark Furhman a
planting evidence?

813
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,450
I think they're pretty sure he did.
Right?

814
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,540
Dante?
Pretty sure he planted evidence like you

815
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:27,500
planted blood or something

816
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,850
done that.
A documentary that,

817
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:30,770
I haven't watched it all yet,
but they were saying something about it.

818
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:34,160
He showed up with a baseball bat and
some crazy shit and had to like talk him

819
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:35,840
away from having a baseball bat.
Oh,

820
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:36,651
Jay did?
No,

821
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:37,580
no.
Mark Furhman did.

822
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,130
I think he showed up somewhere with a
baseball bat at night when the three

823
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:44,170
detectives and he was one of the shots.
He had a bat with them like he was going

824
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:46,310
to feed them Oj or some shit.
They're like,

825
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,860
are you sure you don't have that story
screwed up?

826
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:51,440
I thought I'll look bad.
I look up again.

827
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,210
No,
Oj was looking at him.

828
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,040
It wouldn't have come out of the house
because he sold out or something.

829
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,350
So Mark Furman was out of his house with
a baseball bat.

830
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,810
He's a loose cannon ready to beat.
Ogf.

831
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,770
But why would a cop have a baseball bat?
Don't you have a gun?

832
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,310
Guns are better to use,
but you just want to beat the guy maybe.

833
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,010
Yup.
Intimidation factor.

834
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,540
Maybe he's not going to use it.
Just like maybe he's into that walking

835
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,374
tall movie.

836
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,970
Oh,
Jay did have mark furhman had to pull

837
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,680
out a baton on Oj Simpson to get him to
drop a baseball bat.

838
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,060
Battered Nicole when called police.
So that was before that happened.

839
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,370
How dare you make me so roping shooting
holes.

840
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,623
How dare you.

841
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,260
It's um,
it's that we can do a hunting podcasts.

842
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,190
Oh,
shooting holes.

843
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,900
Yeah.
Holding dear.

844
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,580
But the point was they think that mark
and planted evidence though.

845
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,660
So like,
yeah,

846
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,400
if he did though,
that's what they said.

847
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,720
Well,
someone said he did.

848
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,540
Right.
I don't know if they prove that to the

849
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,430
prosecutor.
He kept telling the press for sure or

850
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:48,630
not the prosecutors.
There's a fence.

851
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,640
Yeah,
I mean,

852
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,513
you know,
they just,

853
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,770
there was something 30 for 30 no,
I did not.

854
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,120
I heard it's awesome though.
Yeah.

855
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,720
I haven't watched it yet.
Oh yeah.

856
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,540
Ada.
Yeah.

857
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,760
Sorry.
We washed it and talk shit and have

858
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:03,810
everybody online get angry.
Hopefully the best documentary ever

859
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:04,760
made.
Wow.

860
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,230
Like be out for a month before you
decide that it's the best thing.

861
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:13,500
I was a bit shorter at Sundance and
everyone watched the whole thing there

862
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:16,320
and then it's got two words for you.
Grizzly man.

863
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,250
Good movie.
Everybody stop man.

864
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,060
Yeah.
This,

865
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,380
but if the guy planted evidence,
my point wasn't,

866
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,140
he knew that Oj did it right.
If Oj had beat up his girlfriend before

867
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:31,320
his wife before and he had a baseball
bat and they had to talk him down and

868
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,060
you know,
but he was his football star and

869
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:36,120
everybody kept it under wraps.
If he fucking knew that the guy did it

870
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,010
like he,
the guy was like close to doing it in a

871
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:40,200
couple of times and never did it like
this with the baseball bat.

872
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,530
Yeah.
I wonder what that fucking thought

873
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:45,840
process is or I'm just going to take one
of these gloves.

874
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,720
Dip in a little bit of blood.
Chuck it in his fucking bushes.

875
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,310
Yeah.
Fuck him.

876
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,110
Fuck him.
I know he did it.

877
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,150
Hey guys,
I found something over here.

878
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,620
Holy Shit,
we got it.

879
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,640
It's the glove.

880
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,860
It's got her blood on it quickly in the
bag.

881
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,530
Zip it tight.
Take it over to the lab.

882
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,960
Tested positive for Nicole's blood.
We got them.

883
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,940
Wait,
got 'em the glove didn't fit.

884
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,680
You must acquit.
How?

885
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,440
How did it not fit?
Cause his big ass hands and he just went

886
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:12,030
like,
it wasn't really not his glove spread

887
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,530
here.
Just try not to get along and if you

888
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,990
wash it as ridiculous,
if you want to put a pair of gloves on,

889
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:18,000
you go like this.
If you open your fingers,

890
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:22,270
you're doing them to articulate your
fingers into the holes that you don't

891
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,680
fucking palm a basketball like when,
you know what I mean?

892
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:28,830
Like that's what he was doing.
That was another glove on to plastic

893
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,140
glove underneath.
Did he?

894
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,630
I think so.
Oh that's even more.

895
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,630
I don't know.
Let's let's show a video of it.

896
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh my God.
Just one of the most preposterous

897
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:38,720
moments in history.
They interrupted my,

898
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,340
some sort of social,
that sociology class in college and let

899
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:42,840
one,
but this lady listen on the radio.

900
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,420
Oh yeah,
you're right.

901
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,171
Well,
by the way,

902
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,290
it fits great.
See this a don't know food.

903
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,810
Look at it,
but he's got rubber gloves on underneath

904
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,811
and he's pretending he can't get it in.
It fits great for those rubber gloves.

905
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,543
Look at that

906
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,720
fifth grade.
No,

907
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,290
that's a little off.
It's a little off on,

908
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,470
I can see what he's say.
Kingdom over the knuckle.

909
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,140
One 64 eight through the right hand
glove.

910
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,723
All right.

911
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,151
He's like,
I can't,

912
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:15,830
I can't do it.
He looks like he's pretending like he's

913
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:18,290
trying to get them on.
It doesn't look as preposterous as I

914
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:19,124
remember.

915
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,050
Okay.

916
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,550
What I remember it me Ma Fatty Bravo's
here.

917
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:25,600
He'd have me convinced me.
I'm telling you bro,

918
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,570
it's his son.
Okay,

919
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,790
let me see these gloves.
Oj pull him up.

920
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,950
He's pulling out.
He's actually legitimate and he's try.

921
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,080
He's trying,
but he does have rubber gloves,

922
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,990
our needs,
but I think

923
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,290
of those are a pair of no idea.
It's a big difference.

924
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,180
If you have a pair of Italian racing
gloves,

925
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,190
those are those are those the thin
little,

926
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,330
yeah,
but that's the point.

927
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,890
Oh,
versus Italian racing gloves.

928
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:48,010
They fit right over your skin there for
racing.

929
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,310
That's what those are.
Those are like,

930
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:55,020
and Martin Ran Quebec,
the people on the glove company,

931
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:56,920
we're like,
can we use this?

932
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,090
This is good for us.
Well,

933
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,540
so it's just like leak it brash and when
I actually don't want to promote it,

934
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,940
that would be a great billboard board at
the time.

935
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,220
Half Mondavi gloves,
you know you've seen them.

936
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,590
Well that's what Joey Dee and said they
were doing in New York after len bias

937
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:15,890
died.
They were selling sodas,

938
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,710
coke.
They'll just,

939
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,460
this shit that killed been buyers,
dog,

940
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,570
get over and get some of this.
That's what joy said about the

941
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,570
everybody's soda.

942
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,970
Everything is like,
I want that good shot.

943
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,380
Give me this shit.
You Still Freddy Soto,

944
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,520
God's hundred a hold back on Joey's go
to move when someone dies.

945
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,400
That's to use them.
They get better drugs

946
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,890
and use their memory.
No,

947
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,880
we'll do job joke about it.
Saying that he wants that.

948
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,240
It's only good stuff if you found,
yeah.

949
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:46,090
If there was,
if there was a drug that you could buy,

950
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,790
they'd killed a guy.
Like say if there's a guy like len buys

951
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:52,750
today and cocaine was legal and uh,
this guy was buying pepsi.

952
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:54,160
Cocaine,
sorry,

953
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,740
Pepsi.
I don't mean nothing by that until it's

954
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:57,580
too,
um,

955
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,780
and the,
if they,

956
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,480
they died,
do you think the sales would go up?

957
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,650
Oh,
for sure.

958
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,880
Right?
100%.

959
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Yeah.
Yeah,

960
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,963
yeah,
for sure.

961
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,220
For sure.
It killed somebody famous like that.

962
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:13,120
If you got mike's Mike's coke dude,
it's Mike's coke is just the Mike's coke

963
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,290
to kill the basketball player.

964
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,290
Dude.
It's the shit to the,

965
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,980
if I,
if I saw some weed that keeps give in a

966
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,300
panic attack,
I would be like,

967
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:19,590
no,
no,

968
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:19,781
no,
no.

969
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:21,760
Let me try.
People were using it as a bragging

970
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:23,580
right.
What's his name?

971
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,610
Don't say his name.
Paulo.

972
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,120
Oh,
did he make do of course.

973
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:29,771
And he was like,
all right.

974
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:30,760
It was too much for me.
I was like,

975
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,280
saved me that.
We'd need to save that for me.

976
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,160
I'll be home soon.
It was over the winter.

977
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,970
I was like,
I won't be all I need to try that.

978
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,190
He's,
what is he doing the edibles before he

979
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:40,450
goes to bed?
I don't know.

980
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,920
A lot of people like that.
Yeah,

981
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,460
just relaxing thing for they go to bed.
It's real popular with the kids these

982
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:47,380
days.
Sleep the whole night.

983
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,960
Yeah,
but you can fucking,

984
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,550
you could go on a bad ride.

985
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,190
Definitely going a bad ride.
You gotta be careful.

986
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,120
[inaudible] went to the hospital.
I had crazy dreams about being on

987
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,780
slippery rooftops.
Ooh,

988
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,290
really?
Yeah.

989
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,040
That'll be interesting,
Trish.

990
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,570
Edible dreams are slippery.
They got scary rooftops.

991
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,540
Slippery rooftops always falling off the
edge.

992
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,900
Near the edge.
Ooh.

993
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,110
Scary.
Why am I up here?

994
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,950
Well,
I've been up here.

995
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,870
You're never your dream.
Like what am I even doing here?

996
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:19,270
I come to places.
I got up here and what am I doing on a

997
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,920
roof?
Yeah.

998
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,610
That was every scene in a Momento,
not my mento inception.

999
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,391
Oh yeah.
It was like,

1000
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:26,224
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1001
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,050
When did I get here?
Oh fuck.

1002
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,140
That movie was very weird.
It was so good though.

1003
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,590
How do you wash it twice?
No,

1004
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,260
I need to watch

1005
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,680
it.
Yeah.

1006
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,400
I,
uh,

1007
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,650
I enjoyed it,
but I didn't enjoy it as much as a lot

1008
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:42,290
of people enjoyed it.
I thought it was just it.

1009
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,040
Got It.
Here's the deal.

1010
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,040
It had me talking for two weeks after.
You know what the problem is?

1011
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,120
A good movie.
Yeah.

1012
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,980
Well,
it's definitely a pretty provocative

1013
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,120
movie and fucking amazingly well done.
But the problem's not,

1014
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:58,121
not even with the movie itself,
but with the idea of it is when your

1015
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:03,881
reality that you're creating whatever
this dream state that they're putting

1016
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,180
these people into it,
right.

1017
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,460
If the reality they're creating is that
convincing?

1018
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,640
Like how is it any different?
Like what you like,

1019
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,980
don't enjoy this.
This isn't even real.

1020
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,740
Well,
it's exactly the same thing.

1021
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,360
It's real.
I get enjoyment out of it.

1022
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,403
Yeah.
It's not like,

1023
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,840
like if you bought a 50 that was right.
Yeah.

1024
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:21,691
His wife was like,
no,

1025
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:22,550
no,
I'm staying here.

1026
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,413
Yeah.
This is great.

1027
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,890
Yeah.
Why not?

1028
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,590
Why wouldn't you stay?
Where the fuck are you gonna go?

1029
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:29,510
You're gonna go to the real world or
want to go to the world war.

1030
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:31,760
I could touch it.
I can put it on a scale.

1031
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,990
Oh wait.
His wife wasn't real.

1032
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,990
One of them was a real draw for fun,
just as real.

1033
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:37,400
And he made,
he remade his wife.

1034
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,630
That's your tardy.
Perfect.

1035
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,390
Perfect.
Like why were you complaining about what

1036
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:43,340
you need to be in the real world?
You Pussy.

1037
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,580
It's the same exact world.
It feels exactly the same.

1038
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,120
You're going through it the same way.
You get the smell,

1039
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,090
dude.
Have you ever tried to quit something

1040
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,100
like carbs or cigarettes or anything
like that?

1041
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,140
Yes.
And coffee and you dream about the thing

1042
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,030
of quit.
Um,

1043
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,600
probably I've had dreams about
cigarettes and I wake up with a negative

1044
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:03,434
feel like,
fuck,

1045
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,560
I got to have smoked again and it takes
me like 20 or 30 minutes.

1046
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,480
Like get the feeling out of me.
Like,

1047
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,320
no,
it's just a dream.

1048
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:12,720
But the feeling remains.
You're a weird one when he came through

1049
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,860
the cigarette thing.
But you're a weird one in that,

1050
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:17,300
um,
you know,

1051
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,070
when you describe it,
you're,

1052
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:23,780
you have a very honest way of describing
the addiction to cigarettes and that,

1053
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:25,880
uh,
you're a smart dude so you know exactly

1054
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:27,220
what's going on.
Excellent.

1055
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,730
What do you mean?
But you know what's going on?

1056
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,850
Like the weirdness of this,
the addiction to cigarettes.

1057
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:33,230
It's weird.
So when you quit,

1058
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,680
when you quit and you would talk about
like this desire,

1059
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,530
even though you intellectualize the fact
that it's chemical addiction,

1060
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,490
but your,
your way of describing it is very honest

1061
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:44,750
in the way that it's like,
oh,

1062
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:45,600
okay.
It's like you're a,

1063
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:48,050
it's like a demon.
Like you can't get around it.

1064
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,770
Like it'll over.

1065
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,603
It'll fuck you.
Like

1066
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:56,170
come back to me,
climbs into your breath.

1067
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,660
Ah,
I mean you again,

1068
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,360
moving around.
Your lungs

1069
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,550
feel so good.
I was in Thailand for years and moved

1070
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:11,780
from a cigarette.
I've had a cigar too,

1071
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:12,800
but you know,
it was a quick,

1072
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,200
you know,
you don't really have heroin.

1073
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:18,520
We were in a zoo late at night.
PDC had a cigarette.

1074
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:18,981
I was like,
you know,

1075
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,750
this feels fucking right.
Warm Out,

1076
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:21,800
you know?
Yeah.

1077
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,260
Let me have one.
I smoked like two or three quarters of

1078
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,540
it had a,
I was like,

1079
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:26,961
okay,
cool.

1080
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:28,910
I'm done,
and then the next day I was like,

1081
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:29,763
oh,
I want a cigarette.

1082
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,010
It was right back in,
just like you were saying,

1083
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,800
just like that outcome that's exactly
gets in there again.

1084
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:35,401
I had to be like,
no,

1085
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:35,890
no,

1086
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,770
no,
no,

1087
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,180
no.
I made a mistake last night.

1088
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,000
Smart people smoked cigarette.
No,

1089
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:43,950
we should not have done that again.
Get no

1090
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,440
better when I'm relaxing or just coming
for a second,

1091
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:52,210
but then you got to go,
oh my God,

1092
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,390
I don't,
we shouldn't do that.

1093
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,500
Oh,
come on,

1094
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:59,970
man.
Today.

1095
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,310
This is the last time.
That was the last time.

1096
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,370
No more after this though.
All right.

1097
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:06,943
Say it.

1098
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,770
Yeah,
man.

1099
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:12,750
You just get back on the ride.
You want to Ah,

1100
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,460
fuck it,
and then your red big Jay and his

1101
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:17,500
girlfriend started smoking again.
They're like,

1102
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:19,030
no,
we just did it in the weekend in Philly.

1103
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:19,421
I'm like,
no,

1104
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:20,260
you're smoking again.
Like,

1105
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:20,591
no,
we're,

1106
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:21,370
we're quitting.
I'm like,

1107
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,140
oh no,
you already saying what we're going to

1108
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,550
know.
You've already fully committed to

1109
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:27,460
smoking and it's been like a year and
now they're still smoking.

1110
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,871
Um,
you know,

1111
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:33,310
they say it has that nicotine has new
tropic properties to it.

1112
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,420
Just like a,
like Alpha brain or neuro one has the

1113
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,770
checkbook was,
I mean it's like a mental stimulant in

1114
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:45,820
the salary increases memory increases
cognitive function.

1115
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,560
It's not a stimulant.
Like um,

1116
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,030
a lot of writers write on it,
right?

1117
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,830
Oh yeah.
A lot of writers do.

1118
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,820
And you know what I started doing
because of Joey Diaz,

1119
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,710
I'll just get one of those blue
cigarette things and I'll suck on them

1120
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:57,580
before a show.

1121
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,260
Nicotine.
Yeah.

1122
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,730
Cause it's not negative.
No,

1123
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:03,940
it's not nicotine.
You have to worry about nicotine is

1124
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:05,920
actually,
it actually has health benefits.

1125
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,560
Nicotine's was addictive.
It's,

1126
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,213
I don't know,
man.

1127
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,960
It doesn't,
it doesn't work like that with me.

1128
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,330
Don't you?
To crave the ecigarette more.

1129
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,300
No,
I'm,

1130
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,310
I might not have one for a month and
then sometimes I like to suck on them

1131
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:21,010
before a show.
You're in a ring a tech now you're

1132
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,710
probably doesn't react to wait tables.
They be though.

1133
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,730
I think it does.
Yeah,

1134
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:26,080
I guess so.
Nicotine,

1135
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:28,180
I guess it would would.
Yeah.

1136
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,220
Well I've,
I smoked a cigarette the other day with

1137
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:31,320
the duck.
Stan hope.

1138
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,140
No Way.
Really.

1139
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,990
I didn't smoke a cigarette,
but I took a hit of his cigarette and I

1140
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:37,880
took a hit of Tony Hinchcliffe cigarette
once before I went on stage.

1141
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,280
Just good.
It feels good to you.

1142
00:46:39,281 --> 00:46:40,114
A little buzz.

1143
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,060
So I just want one hit but that,
um,

1144
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,250
I remember that blows off a cigarette.
Remember that?

1145
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,620
Oh Man,
I'm woozy for a little bit because if

1146
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:50,290
you don't smoke and you take a hit off
of a cigarette,

1147
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:53,680
it definitely gives you like a weird
little buzz was the carcinogen to,

1148
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,100
yeah.
But I think there's also some sort of

1149
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,740
stimulating factor of all those
different chemicals.

1150
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,440
The FDA kindly allows them to put into
that shit.

1151
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,780
So what's the addicted then?
What's the good thing that gets you

1152
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,190
addicted?
There's a lot of factors.

1153
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:11,490
One of it is smoking of the cigarette.
Like the nicotine in that form is

1154
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:15,970
apparently more addictive in some
strange way.

1155
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,330
Maybe it's because of the delivery
method is more powerful and potent.

1156
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,140
Maybe it's because of all the other
chemical.

1157
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,320
You see that inside or movie with
Russell Crowe.

1158
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:23,950
Did you ever see that?

1159
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,570
I know what you're talking about though.
Good fucking movie.

1160
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,580
If it's factual,
I'm not sure if it is,

1161
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:30,490
but I think it is cause you got to have
your ducks in a row when you make a

1162
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:34,270
Goddamn Expo's a movie with Russell
Crowe about the cigarette industry.

1163
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,100
It's got to sound right.
Most likely.

1164
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:37,780
If they didn't,
I mean otherwise it wouldn't be

1165
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:40,270
available anymore.
They would do or remove it from itunes

1166
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:42,880
and all that shit.
But it's essentially Russell Crowe,

1167
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:46,090
if you haven't seen it,
is a super scientist that they have

1168
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,360
engineered the cigarettes to make them
more addictive than he testifies about

1169
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:51,910
it and they go to his house and they
scare him and they threatened them and

1170
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:52,610
all that.
It's,

1171
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,070
it's creepy.
It's fucking creepy.

1172
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,800
Um,
so apparently it's true though.

1173
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,770
There are a bunch of different
chemicals,

1174
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:03,760
like hundreds of them that they allow
these companies to put it into

1175
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,210
cigarettes that altered the flavor
profile and all sorts of other different

1176
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:09,850
things to do,
but it also makes them more addictive.

1177
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,150
And he outlined them in the movie and
explains how they engineered it.

1178
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,360
So that's why when you've taken a hit
off those things,

1179
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:19,840
it's different than a cigar or different
than a lot of other ways that you're

1180
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:23,380
getting tobacco.
But even like chewing tobacco was

1181
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:25,360
addictive.
People get addicted to that shit.

1182
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,950
Like in their mouths can get addictive,
but it's soaking jerking off.

1183
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,680
So kind of different though.
That's like mental addiction,

1184
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,140
soaking coffee.
Coffee can be addicted to coffee for

1185
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:38,170
sure.
Busted Nicotine does not cause

1186
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:41,770
addiction.
They ain't go e health forum just as

1187
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:46,510
about as in you to take cat.
Nicotine by itself is only a mild

1188
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:47,450
central,
uh,

1189
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,920
central system stimulant.
Similar to caffeine has very mild

1190
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:53,830
addictive properties.
Also much like caffeine.

1191
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:58,150
Well,
I know for a fact the caffeine is pretty

1192
00:48:58,151 --> 00:48:59,120
fucking addictive.
Yeah.

1193
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,870
You have the trolls.
Have enough caffeine headaches when you

1194
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:03,060
quit that's like,
yeah,

1195
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,400
that's all.

1196
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,270
It was a quick seat cushions.
I was going way too hard.

1197
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,330
Um,
at one point in time writing where I

1198
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:10,990
would,
uh,

1199
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,990
make a pot a fucking coffee and I would
down that shit at like 9:00 PM and write

1200
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:18,880
till five,
six o'clock in the morning,

1201
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:23,320
just jacked out of my mind on coughing.
And when I tried to quit that I had a

1202
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:25,420
problem.
I had headaches.

1203
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,760
Like my head was like,
oh,

1204
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,760
like I was my brain,
my body was like,

1205
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,260
it's going to,
you're going to have to deal with a

1206
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:37,261
ridiculous amount of stimulants over the
course of like seven hours or I gear up.

1207
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:42,010
And then once I shut the fucking fun
farm down there,

1208
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:42,761
we're like,
hey,

1209
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:44,830
where's all got used to the,
come on Bro.

1210
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,410
Headaches.
How long do the headaches last for a

1211
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,600
couple of days to started drinking
coffee.

1212
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:51,380
I'm no
sure.

1213
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,340
I never,
never drank it like that again.

1214
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,220
I'll never drink more than a couple of
cups a day,

1215
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,800
but I thought it was bad for you at one
point in time,

1216
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:01,580
which has also been debunked.
Tiffin.

1217
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,190
Yeah.
No coffee itself.

1218
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,710
Oh,
coffee itself is not bad for you and

1219
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:10,000
caffeine in the form of coffee.
It's not necessarily bad for you either,

1220
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:13,450
but it's like one of those things where
you can fuck it up if you just go too

1221
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:15,400
hard.
So like what I was doing when I was

1222
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:16,420
writing,
when I was drinking,

1223
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,770
like literally pots of that shit.
Probably like overwhelming my adrenals

1224
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,100
and to get that late night starbucks in
Sacramento.

1225
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,360
Oh yeah.
And sleep like babies.

1226
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,650
What?
It's going bedtime.

1227
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,050
Just write them out.
It doesn't make sense.

1228
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,230
Tate loves coffee so good.
I never gotten to that shit.

1229
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:35,750
It's delicious.
It makes me feel good

1230
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,280
taste.
I don't want people stopping kids.

1231
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,750
Yeah,
I dunno.

1232
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,290
Well it's um,
there's also like a lot of other ways

1233
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,000
that you can get caffeine.
You know,

1234
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,050
you can get caffeine and rebase.
No,

1235
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,600
you can get it in other ways.
Yeah.

1236
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:51,330
Coke,
Coke,

1237
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:56,330
Cola,
tea tea's Yerba [inaudible] I think so.

1238
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,400
It's good stuff.
I have to believe I have,

1239
00:50:58,401 --> 00:50:59,990
it's like a stimulant,
sort of a tea,

1240
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,690
like ginger.
There's a lot of those things,

1241
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:05,720
man.
It's a lot of groovy ass stimulants that

1242
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,310
you could purchase anywhere else.
A stimulant.

1243
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,680
Ari Shapiro at the commerce
Thursday night.

1244
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:16,920
How
dare you work it in like that.

1245
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,000
I'm doing my hour.
Only time in la.

1246
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:21,650
I'm doing it.
So come tomorrow and I get

1247
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:26,420
tickets@arishaffir.com and a house is
only 10 bucks.

1248
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,300
I have like 80 more seats.
I don't want to fill up Jesus.

1249
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,200
Sorry up again.
What does put the wings out?

1250
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:33,230
If not,
but it should be fun.

1251
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,150
But I knew I was going really well.
It should be fun.

1252
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:35,671
We'll,
I'll,

1253
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:36,950
I'll tweet it to.
Okay,

1254
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:38,460
cool.
Thanks Gloria.

1255
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,330
I need an opener.
I can't,

1256
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,760
okay.
So uh,

1257
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:45,370
what the fuck's going on man?
Um,

1258
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,780
what's the latest?
I don't know.

1259
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,820
I went to,
Bonnaroo is really fun.

1260
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,010
Yeah,
it's really fun.

1261
00:51:51,011 --> 00:51:52,340
Where is bond or is like tennis.
Tennis.

1262
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,540
Yeah,
Manchester.

1263
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,920
Tennessee.
Nashville.

1264
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:56,330
Yeah.
Like an hour away.

1265
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,040
How big is Tennessee?
Like if you drive through the whole

1266
00:51:58,041 --> 00:51:59,540
thing?
It was a full day.

1267
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,090
We stopped in Nashville and then we
stopped at Memphis the next night,

1268
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,600
like 10 hours.
Whoa.

1269
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,760
10 hours through Nashville.
Think so.

1270
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,320
Wow.
I would drive until the sun went down

1271
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:10,154
there.
We were just stuff.

1272
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,480
See,
I always think of states like

1273
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,210
Massachusetts.
If you drive 10 hours,

1274
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:15,530
you're not in Massachusetts anymore.
Right,

1275
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:16,280
right,
right.

1276
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,830
In any direction.
Tennessee's really long.

1277
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,790
Yeah.
It's big ass long ass hot states.

1278
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,350
The wiener dog of states is,
it can I got so hmm.

1279
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,330
Based on his length and height.
So,

1280
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:28,430
uh,
Bonnaroo had uh,

1281
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,710
there you,
you did some weird shells like you do

1282
00:52:30,711 --> 00:52:32,390
that one,
two 30 in the morning show that we were

1283
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:34,400
talking about.
It was great.

1284
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,010
That's hilarious.
I just spread it word of mouth a little

1285
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:38,870
bit on twitter last minute.
I was like,

1286
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:41,510
I'm finding out when I get there I'm
finding out where it's going to be when

1287
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,580
wow.
I took a sharpie.

1288
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,440
Everyone on people's hands.
I run into them like,

1289
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:47,100
what are you doing?
I was doing a show where I'm like a

1290
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:49,820
Chrysalis bar and I was like,
say back to him it Christmas barn.

1291
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,983
All right,
what time?

1292
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,180
And then I write are riding on people's
arms.

1293
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,760
Xmas barn two 30 Friday.
Well,

1294
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,920
for people don't understand why he did
that.

1295
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,980
Everybody was fucked up on drugs.
We kind of had to do that.

1296
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,560
Everybody's fucked up at that point.
Or just super tired.

1297
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:06,080
Even drunk.
But you usually drugs.

1298
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,190
That's true.
It's a drug.

1299
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,790
It's a drug festival.
But drunk is a drug we fucked up in

1300
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:15,791
classification of drugs in this country
as a new breeding is any of those sort

1301
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:16,820
of thing.
It's a drug.

1302
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:20,270
But somehow or another,
we've found ourselves in this position

1303
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:22,670
where most people are in denial that
they do drugs.

1304
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:23,660
Why they drank.
Yeah.

1305
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,710
And then you're gonna put mushroom
heroin in the same category growers

1306
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,290
category.
Come on.

1307
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,610
It's hilarious.
Come on.

1308
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,910
But we've been hoodwinked by Booz.
God.

1309
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:38,100
Damn it.
Not that I don't like booze.

1310
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,330
I enjoy it.
It's so much more sexist.

1311
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,240
Socially acceptable.
It's crazy.

1312
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:44,130
Way More drunk driving.
Oh yeah.

1313
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,420
Way More everything here.
What,

1314
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:47,940
uh,
what's his name said in Canada should

1315
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:48,774
go?
Yeah.

1316
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:51,030
What'd he say?
He's the first guy to take the stance on

1317
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:54,150
this where instead of saying the other
side always takes,

1318
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,040
we've got to protect children,
children are going to get it.

1319
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,590
You know,
and the only defense against that is

1320
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:00,870
like,
well it's got benefits to sick people

1321
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,090
and stuff like that.
It's not really a defense of their

1322
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:03,960
argument.
Right.

1323
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,100
Trudeau is like,
Candida has like I think like top five

1324
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,770
instance of underage people getting
marijuana.

1325
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,830
It's like really bad there.
He's like we're already not protecting

1326
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:17,790
them cause let's regulate it so that we
can protect kids cause he goes,

1327
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,440
look,
I think it should be legal but I also

1328
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,390
see there's,
there's problems with people getting it

1329
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,920
when they're developing when the mine is
developing.

1330
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,500
I agree.
So let's do what we can keep it out of

1331
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:28,020
their hands.
Which is legalization regularization

1332
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,370
regulation,
regulation,

1333
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,880
regulation like alcohol.
If alcohol was fully illegal and you

1334
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:36,240
just get it from mafia guys,
14 year old would have the same access

1335
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:38,310
as 34 year olds.
That's a very good point.

1336
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,820
That's probably the best point for it.
Yeah.

1337
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:43,380
Because cats are going to find some cool
22 year old.

1338
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,220
That's the only way they can get it.
That 22 year olds taking a big chance.

1339
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:49,110
He's days.
It's a giant felony.

1340
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,340
Really?
Yeah.

1341
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:54,660
When we were kids it wasn't nothing or
fake id or stealing from your dad always

1342
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:57,510
sold booze.
You would wait outside the liquor store

1343
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:00,960
and buy booze for you.
You tell him to give him 20 bucks.

1344
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,610
They didn't give him a feeling of
surcharge than the price of them.

1345
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,440
Whatever.
Yeah.

1346
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,290
Just tell the guy will give you 20 bucks
if you go and uh,

1347
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,590
get a fucking one may or may not view
drive throughs and they just give it to

1348
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,880
us.
When we were at 17,

1349
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:12,750
18 years old.
Yeah.

1350
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,370
They didn't give a fuck.
They didn't,

1351
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:16,890
especially in Ohio,
that trying to get you drunk.

1352
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:18,690
So stay.
Yeah,

1353
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,580
exactly.
I get somebody pregnant.

1354
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:21,590
We can't lose.
Yeah.

1355
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,580
That was another,
we need to keep you around.

1356
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:26,520
So if getting your drunk,
just how we do it.

1357
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,170
Yeah.
It's weird that we have this one drug we

1358
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:32,530
give a pass to.
Yeah.

1359
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,370
And it's the one is the most destructive
to your health.

1360
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,200
It's,
it's fucking bananas.

1361
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,180
It really is.
You get into fights.

1362
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:44,400
What's the problem is it's existed for
so long and it hasn't changed yet.

1363
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,870
In spite of all we know.
So like more recently this Nixon thing

1364
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:53,871
came out where they admitted that the
whole reason why they instituted this

1365
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:59,601
war on drugs is to try to break up the
civil rights movement and to try it.

1366
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:02,610
Yep.
And to try to break up the anti war

1367
00:56:02,611 --> 00:56:03,600
movement.
How?

1368
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,330
Because they knew that the people
involved in the civil rights movement.

1369
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:08,080
We're doing dry rot.
Yeah.

1370
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,870
Tammy or fast Jamie.
He's the best,

1371
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,120
uh,
the civil rights movement and the

1372
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:15,060
antiwar movement.
We're doing marijuana.

1373
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,050
So they decided there are always the
way.

1374
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,360
Yeah.
That was the way to go after them to

1375
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:24,040
break up those organizations by
arresting their members for

1376
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,590
drug related crimes,
locking him up in jail.

1377
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,430
Really interesting.
Stop Line.

1378
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,590
Yeah.
So that means,

1379
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:32,020
but it's a fact.
So it's one of those things where,

1380
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,110
you know,
you'd hear like an Alex Jones type guy

1381
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:36,340
talk about it,
you know,

1382
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,860
don't believe it.
No,

1383
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,340
it's actual proof.
Right.

1384
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,340
Then you see something like this and you
know that is exactly how they are still

1385
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:43,420
stuck in your head of like,
yeah,

1386
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:44,500
but they're different.
Well,

1387
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,060
you know that there was a wikileaks,
uh,

1388
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,910
um,
thing that facebook has apparently

1389
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,370
centering.
See that?

1390
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,590
That was another one of the things that
I wanted to talk to you about.

1391
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,490
What they're saying that there was all
this Hillary Clinton emails at Facebook

1392
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:00,550
is censoring that they don't want to get
out,

1393
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,770
that wikileaks is trying to print and
then facebook says we won't let you

1394
00:57:03,771 --> 00:57:04,601
retweet that.
I don't know.

1395
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:05,620
I'm not,
I'm not sure what,

1396
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,570
how they stop something like that.

1397
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,450
Or what about this leak?
About about some Hillary Clinton stuff.

1398
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,620
What are the,
um,

1399
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,500
the packers said he gave it to us.
Right.

1400
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:17,080
But the problem is like you have to
trust the hacker.

1401
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:17,441
No,
no,

1402
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,480
you don't trust the Hatcher who has
Julian assange.

1403
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,490
That's who trusts.
Cause he's never let us down.

1404
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,310
He's only putting out stuff that's real.
He sounds like a good team.

1405
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,230
I'm just saying his word is,
I will put out real shit.

1406
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,980
Only keep that up so I get to take a
look at it.

1407
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,020
You know,
do your facebook stop censoring or

1408
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:33,610
Hillary Clinton email release?
No,

1409
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:36,790
really stop it.
There is no technical issue,

1410
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,130
Huh?
Oh Wow.

1411
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,170
Hmm.
And wiki leaks.

1412
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,530
Wiki leaks is putting that up on twitter
with a photograph of it.

1413
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,030
This is interesting.
So they see,

1414
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,360
the problem is when you're getting
something from a guy who hacked into

1415
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:55,090
her,
her email server,

1416
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,750
how is it not possible that he could
trick them?

1417
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:04,090
He's so fucking smart that he can get
into her email server trick to Hillary

1418
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,720
Clinton.
Like they got into her email to get this

1419
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:10,330
stuff right.
I mean this is what they're saying.

1420
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,380
So how do we know?
I mean you could do that,

1421
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,940
can make it look like he did it too.
Can make it look like,

1422
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:22,480
say that again.
Someone who can hack into a server that

1423
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:26,440
just tell me if I'm right or a mom,
but there's not the only person that

1424
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:28,990
that was claimed.
I've hacked the servery Russian hackers

1425
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,810
as of yesterday.
I think I saw the same say they're in

1426
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:33,960
there right now.
So there's a gang of different people

1427
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,710
have hacked it.
I think once you get that,

1428
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,810
the issue is she was like,
don't worry about it.

1429
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,940
I have this secret server on my own for
no,

1430
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:40,680
no reason.
You don't have to,

1431
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,800
you don't need to know.

1432
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:46,150
30,000,
322 emails pulled from a private account

1433
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:49,360
she was using during her tenure as
secretary of state.

1434
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,120
You know,
I had this guy in here who,

1435
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:55,500
uh,
was a cia guy know and um,

1436
00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:00,100
he said pretty flat out if he had done
any things that she did,

1437
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:05,101
he'd be in jail.
Who that the CIA guy was telling me that

1438
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:10,240
he did any of the things that she did
with this email server should be in

1439
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:11,710
jail.
Wow.

1440
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,420
Yeah.
It's kind of Mike Baker.

1441
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,450
Very a very interesting guy.
Yeah.

1442
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:18,160
They're talking about with an Africa at
a diner and it's like,

1443
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:20,110
no,
the people doing the indicting are her

1444
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:22,070
buddies.
Like they're not to indict or especially

1445
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,560
not till after she,
if she loses then maybe,

1446
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,290
but not beforehand.
This is all coming out like right now.

1447
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:27,831
Right.
It's,

1448
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:31,110
it looks like she's going to be the
nominee for the Democrats and it looks

1449
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:33,020
like this is the part at home where
people start going,

1450
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,150
oh,
I fucking hate you when you talk about

1451
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:37,490
politics because you know,
no shit.

1452
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,500
You're right.
The politics behind and come Thursday

1453
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:40,920
night to the comics for 9:00 PM.
Okay.

1454
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,560
How did you get tickets are already the
great.com or go to the comedy store.com.

1455
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,650
Interesting.
Bring her friend,

1456
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,540
um,
does the terrible time for this stuff to

1457
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,160
come out because there's no other
option.

1458
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,860
Like it would have to be Bernie Sanders.
That's the only other option.

1459
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,230
Like are either,
she would like have to be in debt.

1460
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,470
I had to come out like a month and a
half or two weeks ago and they don't

1461
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:00,950
know.

1462
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,680
Like when people look at it,
they don't know whether or not Bernie

1463
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:06,250
can win.
Like people are pretty sure that Hillary

1464
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,380
is going to win because you can get a
lot of women.

1465
01:00:08,381 --> 01:00:10,370
They're going to vote on her just
because she's a woman.

1466
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,370
I think they don't want it to look that
Bernie does better against sanders.

1467
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,440
I'm we getting started trump than
hillary does against trump.

1468
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,380
By the police.
Who are these polls?

1469
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,090
Who's taking them?
I don't know who these fucking people.

1470
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,223
Yeah,
I dunno.

1471
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,030
I don't just look at sports.
Fet here's,

1472
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,580
Jamie had a really good point.
It's a very good point.

1473
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,000
He said,
how come you see all this hype for

1474
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:32,870
Bernie Sanders and you don't see any
hype for Clinton and yet Clinton's still

1475
01:00:32,871 --> 01:00:34,890
wins these,
well,

1476
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,660
a lot of friction because you had to
have changed from an independent to a

1477
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:42,260
Democrat like months ago and then when
it's time to vote,

1478
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:43,810
you're like,
well I can't vote in the primary cause

1479
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,653
I'm an independent.

1480
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,190
No,
they're both Democrats.

1481
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,770
How many Hillary?
The primaries?

1482
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,350
I'm second in the primary,
so then it's too late for them to vote

1483
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,090
in the primary.
Okay,

1484
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:54,680
so they didn't register in time.
That's what you're saying?

1485
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,850
No,
they had to be registered as

1486
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:56,684
independent.
Right.

1487
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:57,801
And then they're like,
oh no,

1488
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,540
you can't,
even though they're going to vote

1489
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,880
Democrat,
why do they have to be registered as

1490
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:02,840
independent?
No,

1491
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:04,340
they are not following you.
It was all these people that are

1492
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:05,800
registered independent.
Some people,

1493
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,710
Democrat,
Republican,

1494
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:09,560
independent advice to people who are
registered as independent couldn't vote

1495
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:10,880
in the Democratic primary.
Oh,

1496
01:01:10,881 --> 01:01:11,714
okay.
I understand.

1497
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,870
That's fucking stupid.
Yeah,

1498
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,240
so that's one of the reasons why you see
more support than that.

1499
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,910
He's actually getting,
my point was more like,

1500
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:19,990
well,
you don't see it very are.

1501
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I don't very many hillary like bumper
stickers and signs and online support.

1502
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,360
That's what Santa more,
no,

1503
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,040
dude.
It's like joining Costco.

1504
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:32,330
You're joining a club to join the
Democrat club and that's how you get to

1505
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,970
vote in the Democratic primaries.
It's fucking ridiculous.

1506
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,330
How come he can't just vote?
How come I registered voter can't just

1507
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:40,010
vote.
You have to be a registered Democrat to

1508
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:41,630
vote for the primary.
Yes,

1509
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,770
you should be able to go independent
slash Democrat should be able to do

1510
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:48,050
whatever the fuck you want.
Most people don't vote in these

1511
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:50,480
primaries that have been happening,
which is the issue.

1512
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,700
This is madness.
We're just picking our candidates.

1513
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,930
None of it matters.
So we're all just voting on who gets the

1514
01:01:56,931 --> 01:01:59,000
paycheck.
But what a better way to control the

1515
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:03,470
system by making you,
you have to be a registered member of

1516
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:05,690
the party in order to vote in the
primaries.

1517
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:07,190
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

1518
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,900
If that's true,
but I don't want to keep going.

1519
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,860
It's often not true.
Some states it's state to state.

1520
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:12,340
It literally matters depending on where
you are.

1521
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:15,380
Let's say like a tea party guy and like
you're an independent that beside the

1522
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:19,650
also good buddy guy go drown.
You couldn't vote for the Republican

1523
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:21,270
primary if you're like,
I would definitely go for trump.

1524
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,180
You couldn't do that either.
But that's not as I think problematic.

1525
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,310
I think the tea party started off with a
good idea,

1526
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,160
but somewhere along the line the morons
took over.

1527
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,480
Yeah.
And the first of all,

1528
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:32,400
calling it the tea party.
Hey guys.

1529
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,710
Okay.
How about a new name?

1530
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,040
Why do you call yourself the wallets?
A historical precedent.

1531
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,890
The face sat when they threw the tea
into the ocean to protest Great Britain.

1532
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:48,891
You will mot tax or tariff os fuck up
the tea party and occupy the same thing

1533
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,340
you guys have Sarah Pailin sober.
Sarah Palin's,

1534
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:54,450
your cow,
right lips.

1535
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,330
They let people talk for them.
There were like two down the people,

1536
01:02:57,331 --> 01:03:00,100
they should have talked for dummies in.
Well they,

1537
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,070
she know.
It becomes like a business.

1538
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,500
Sort of like a,
if you're like one of those bitchy

1539
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:06,840
housewives and everybody knows you as
the bitchy housewife,

1540
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:07,681
I'll put more.
Yeah,

1541
01:03:07,681 --> 01:03:09,330
you got to ramp it up.
That's what you do now.

1542
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:12,750
You gotta throw drinks at bitches,
like claws leaves off.

1543
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,080
That must be tiring.
It's exhausting to be that lady.

1544
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,550
Hey,
that's probably off work.

1545
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:21,000
It's probably like the sheep dog and the
coyote born in Sam morning,

1546
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,580
Ralph,
and they go off to the other

1547
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:23,010
conversation.

1548
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:24,720
Conversations go.
Excuse me one second.

1549
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:26,750
I have to fill this.
Hold on a sec.

1550
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,860
What'd you say,
bitch?

1551
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:29,461
Okay.
I'm sorry.

1552
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:31,320
Where were we?
So I think that's what happens.

1553
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,161
I think they,
uh,

1554
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:34,410
they take on a role,
you know,

1555
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,950
and they just get caught up in it.
Don't vote.

1556
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,350
It's pointless or bought a home,
stay home.

1557
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:47,050
It just seems like this way has got to
fucking meltdown in front of our face

1558
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:50,190
until we come up with a better way.
Sure.

1559
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:51,930
It seems like it,
it's so dumb.

1560
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:56,931
This is like some colonial feather
writing fucking parchment bullshit.

1561
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,560
The rich people get money from the
corporations and the rich people keeping

1562
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:05,960
the ones deciding how the elections go.
Yeah.

1563
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:10,350
So they're going to decide to make it a
little more favor towards them.

1564
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:13,050
Yeah.
And you have to register for a party to

1565
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:13,884
vote in the primary.

1566
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:18,030
Why?
That's what I can't do that while you're

1567
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:19,230
voting,
this is stupid.

1568
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:24,030
I'm Democrat fucking gross it primaries
or like a club that you have to belong

1569
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:27,000
to and that's how you pick presidents.
And by the way,

1570
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:31,050
when you become a registered Democrat,
like that's like being a fucking raiders

1571
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:31,860
fan.
The team.

1572
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,470
Why can't I feel like I'll see what
people have to offer and I'm not,

1573
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:38,100
not saying anything bad about the
raiders fan base in sports.

1574
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:40,830
That's what I heard.
There's stabby a row savvy.

1575
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,280
They're one step below ICP fans.
Stabby stabby Oh,

1576
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,450
they're so glad they're not coming to
la.

1577
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,730
So glad.
What are they going to Vegas?

1578
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,170
Vegas 17 burn with him.
Whoa.

1579
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,650
You're very good at vegas is garbage
too.

1580
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,480
Oh dear you.
How about that?

1581
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,600
We'll see another fucking woman dancing
in a cage on a ceiling.

1582
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,950
You don't think that's hot.
So edge to it.

1583
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,480
There's nothing to that.
Gee,

1584
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,550
it's all such fake.
She's got glitter on her ass.

1585
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,820
She,
it's all like,

1586
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,980
this is how party seems like they'd be
in movies.

1587
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:15,420
Right?
Well,

1588
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,640
it's also a gang of people on Molly.
Oh yeah.

1589
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:21,010
That's mostly what you're handling.
Your handle and the,

1590
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,660
I mean,
this is when you're going to these

1591
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:25,180
fucking clubs.
It's not a surprise why they all have

1592
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:26,810
glow sticks.
Oh,

1593
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:30,190
poor tripping balls.
LCD sounds as it was so good on molly.

1594
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,380
What's LCD?
Soundsystem is bad,

1595
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:35,170
but they use the lights so fucking good.
They sing that song.

1596
01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:37,480
Daft punk is playing at my house.
Remember that?

1597
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,610
No minor hit.
They have a couple of minor hits,

1598
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:41,650
but man,
they blue pearl jam out of the water.

1599
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,520
Really?
Yeah.

1600
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,320
It probably was just fine.
Just fine.

1601
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,240
Jeremiah hasn't ever done any drugs and
he thought LCD soundsystem it's better

1602
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:50,650
to wow.
Interesting.

1603
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,150
Well said.
They had a real show.

1604
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,620
Yeah,
they go for it.

1605
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,830
They're not just playing to their fans.
You can't really compete with that.

1606
01:05:56,831 --> 01:06:00,010
If you just someone who plays your hits
and you'd like to talk about politics in

1607
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:03,760
between the song and fucking fucking
veteran three speeches and he brought

1608
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:05,890
his daughter out and made us all happy
birthday to her.

1609
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,270
Not good dude.
The whole light show was just them up

1610
01:06:09,271 --> 01:06:14,271
close playing be booth to
booth to maybe you could do that pearl

1611
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:20,140
jam show Eddie.
It doesn't bother her show.

1612
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:23,380
10% of us know what you are.
That's right.

1613
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,200
When some fans,
that's actually super important.

1614
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:26,980
Right?
Yeah.

1615
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,710
That's a good way to look to it.
To hand them coast off their fame and

1616
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:30,610
the other half like,
oh,

1617
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:33,040
people don't know me here.
Oh yeah,

1618
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,930
let's go for it.
Slayer last year.

1619
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,630
They fucking destroyed.
That's a good point.

1620
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:38,464
Yeah,
I would,

1621
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,390
you know that and that,
that goes with comedy too,

1622
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,070
man.
That goes with everything.

1623
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,720
Yeah.
I saw bill burr on that,

1624
01:06:43,721 --> 01:06:44,650
uh,
on that.

1625
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:46,390
Um,
it was like a comedy central,

1626
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:49,540
like year in review kind of thing.
They had those flex period four years.

1627
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:51,400
He did five minutes there and he was
like,

1628
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:53,140
okay,
you guys aren't my fans yet.

1629
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:54,550
This was like six,
seven years ago.

1630
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,443
I remember that.

1631
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,320
Oh,
that was Dane.

1632
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:59,681
No,
it was a different one.

1633
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:01,900
But it was,
bill was in this like politically

1634
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:04,960
correct sort of group of people and they
weren't accepting it and he had a hammer

1635
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:06,570
at home.
Yeah.

1636
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,970
When fans don't know you,
that's what they have these festivals.

1637
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:11,320
Some people go,
I've got Chris Stapleton.

1638
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:13,450
We were just sending their lawn.
He came on.

1639
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:14,770
I was like,
this guy is good as shit.

1640
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,770
He's a bad motherfucker.
I've listened to that CD,

1641
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,300
whatever you want to call it.
An album.

1642
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,850
I guess we can call him albums again.
Yeah.

1643
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:21,980
Oh,
that's cool.

1644
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:25,300
Sounds better than CD.
It's not a compact disc.

1645
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:27,250
So what is it?
It's [inaudible] album.

1646
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,820
We go back to album.
So his new album or the album that I

1647
01:07:30,821 --> 01:07:32,260
have,
I think it's only one know.

1648
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,780
I think he only has one out is fucking
incredible.

1649
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,150
It's really good.

1650
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,570
Yeah.
Amazing stuff.

1651
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,910
Yeah,
it was so mellow and nice and a lot.

1652
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,280
I told you about the time that um,
uh,

1653
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,080
stone temple pilots played a Dana
White's birthday party and they go,

1654
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,550
they went for it,
mashed it,

1655
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,630
they smashed it all the way to that
might've been a crazy junkie out of his

1656
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:55,090
fucking mind.
All sorts of personal problems and all

1657
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:57,820
that jazz.
But knowing that 200 people there less,

1658
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,330
maybe 200 but there were scattered all
throughout this.

1659
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,570
We got to get people to get closer
towards the stage and kind of get

1660
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:07,360
excited about the fact that it's fucking
stone temple pilots,

1661
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:10,300
pilots.
That guy could have been in a football

1662
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:13,540
stadium filled with people.
He would have done the exact same show.

1663
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:15,560
That's how strong it was.
You put up a video of it.

1664
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,543
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1665
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,320
I know way.
Oh yeah.

1666
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,600
This is Dana White's surprise.
[inaudible] behind him?

1667
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:22,683
No.
What's going on?

1668
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,673
Oh,
that's right.

1669
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,060
Goodness.
Where is that?

1670
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,610
Um,
that was that.

1671
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:35,750
I don't remember what it was.

1672
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,830
And then stone temple pilots is in the
video.

1673
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,150
You don't get no,
no,

1674
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,370
that's just a surprise.
It was awesome.

1675
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,370
That's nice and all but oh,
okay.

1676
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:51,380
I thought maybe the video I definitely
had,

1677
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,300
but the sound was so loud.
It was,

1678
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,770
it was useless.
Oh right.

1679
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,540
Cause those was my shitty iphone video.
You know,

1680
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,420
it's like six years ago to six years
ago,

1681
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:00,050
I said,
you can't,

1682
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,820
you can't replicate that kind of sound
into an iphone,

1683
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:03,860
but when you're there at the thing,
it was just noise.

1684
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,740
But
he couldn't even understand what the

1685
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:08,540
fuck it was saying.
But um,

1686
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:13,570
my point being that guy was all for it.
He went for it more than you could ever

1687
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:18,020
have hoped.
Like he just fucking cranked it out.

1688
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,670
Yeah.
It was amazing.

1689
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,130
And it made me want to maybe want to go
home.

1690
01:09:22,131 --> 01:09:24,080
I can go do better and go right.
Yeah.

1691
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,240
Go write some jokes,
go next time.

1692
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:28,100
Be Better on stage.
And to do.

1693
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:29,060
You can go both ways.
I saw,

1694
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,400
I saw a smashing pumpkins at rock and
the rage when the air.

1695
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:33,980
Yeah,
garbage.

1696
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,960
Garbage.
I mean terrible.

1697
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,980
It's just billy corgan and then he gets
a fucking Asian Bass player and a

1698
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:42,920
fucking female blonde,
whatever the fuck she plays.

1699
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,890
Isn't he though?
Like a serious republican now?

1700
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,760
Yeah.
He might even be like a,

1701
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,450
I'm just making things up now.

1702
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,520
It changes some of the lyrics of a song.
God is empty.

1703
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:56,270
Just like,
ew.

1704
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:57,103
Whoa.
Yeah.

1705
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,130
Is that what he says?
Yeah.

1706
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,750
Now he plays his old songs and double
time.

1707
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,930
It's just fucking awful.
Then you see all the hands go for it and

1708
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:03,830
you're like,
oh right.

1709
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

1710
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:06,860
He tried to get rid of him.
Smashing pumpkins.

1711
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:10,730
Billy corgan praises trump.
He's fucking up the political class.

1712
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,200
Well,
dots,

1713
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,900
you know I've probably said that to
sorta true.

1714
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:17,150
Yeah.
I mean he's definitely doing that

1715
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,300
slam social justice warrior as well.
If that was a video of an actual body

1716
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:24,150
slam.
Well

1717
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:30,170
show watch philly corn gorgon going for
it.

1718
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:31,370
Yeah.
I don't know.

1719
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:33,440
I don't.
Why did I feel like he's conservative?

1720
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,790
He went south.
He might be,

1721
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,920
I think he got Christian diddy.
I think so.

1722
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:38,750
Come on.
I think that's why I changed those

1723
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:43,430
lyrics will appear that before he was
dating courtney love before she put out

1724
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:45,180
that that banging album.

1725
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:46,790
That one really good album,
right?

1726
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,170
No,
no.

1727
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:51,200
The one really good one was was Kurt
cobain and then the other one,

1728
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:53,900
he got ahold of her and then Gavin
Rossdale got ahold of her too,

1729
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:55,830
so they have three totally all banged
her.

1730
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,140
Well.
Yeah.

1731
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:00,270
You think so?
I think to get that haven't did what you

1732
01:11:00,271 --> 01:11:01,390
sure?
No.

1733
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,700
Am I wrong?
Yeah,

1734
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,110
but before that time,
I don't know.

1735
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,770
Why don't you google it?
Just a question.

1736
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,350
Hey Gavin.
Rossdale I might be dead wrong.

1737
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,790
It might just be billy corgan.
Gavin Rossdale.

1738
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:16,440
That does sound wrong.
Now that I think about it.

1739
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,870
Well,
she definitely was a bang and Ed Norton

1740
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:20,460
before it was the hulk.
Really?

1741
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,960
Yeah.
She was banging at Norton,

1742
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,940
allegedly.
It.

1743
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:26,550
She was such a fun wreck just throwing
around like thrift stores and

1744
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:29,160
Philadelphia just like she was at her
height.

1745
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:30,300
She was such a wreck.

1746
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,720
She was crazy.
You see that documentary that thinks

1747
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:34,530
that she,
uh,

1748
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,480
she had Kurt cobain killed,
uh,

1749
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,450
with the recreation's we were talking
about like,

1750
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,580
I can't trust us a movie with
recreation's.

1751
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:43,710
Like you weren't there.
You don't know what was said in near

1752
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:46,800
just recently because what happened was
you went over to her.

1753
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:48,380
She said,
do it Kurt,

1754
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,841
do it.
Oh,

1755
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:50,160
you can't do it.
I'll do it for you.

1756
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,030
Oh yeah.
She claimed on an interview on Howard

1757
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:56,300
stern that she had an affair with him
with,

1758
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:59,460
with Cat Rasa.
The wrong,

1759
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:01,651
you're wrong.
Twice,

1760
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,570
Jamie.
How he helped me with that album though.

1761
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,600
How dare you?
That was probably Billy Corrigan.

1762
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:09,060
Yeah.
How about you google things first before

1763
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:13,890
you accused Ari of being wrong?
I saw him that same rock on the range.

1764
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,110
He was greg.
Kevin,

1765
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,890
yeah.
With Bush went and played.

1766
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:20,850
Hey Jude into the crowd and went and
went around to just have to like what

1767
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:21,684
you're doing right.

1768
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,960
And you'll win everybody over just a end
to right.

1769
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,590
Just get really into the stuff you make.
If it's good.

1770
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:33,620
Some rockers after a while they just get
beaten down by the pressure and fans and

1771
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:39,390
negativity and all that jazz.
And then the intoxicating sound of the,

1772
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,570
the,
there were the true lovers of your work

1773
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:47,370
and know they pull you in,
lavish you with praise and get your face

1774
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:49,500
tattooed on their ass.
And I'm not seeing,

1775
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:52,290
you know,
just stopped producing good stuff can

1776
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,990
happen to anybody.
Yeah.

1777
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,090
And it wasn't like project was bad.
They would just good.

1778
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,650
Yeah.
And I was positive.

1779
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:00,960
I told bigJ would end up not coming.
I was like,

1780
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:04,140
I guarantee you a band that's like that
for 25 years they're going to kill it.

1781
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:07,230
But uh,
apparently stone still kill it.

1782
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:10,680
This don's deal.
Apparently Mick Jagger is still a bad

1783
01:13:10,681 --> 01:13:13,080
motherfucker and he works out every day.

1784
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,550
He does like Yoga and lifts weights and
does all kinds of crazy shit to keep his

1785
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:21,770
body in shape so he can fucking bang it
out for like an hour and a half show or

1786
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,960
two hour show.
Mccardy runs around the whole time.

1787
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,850
Really?
The guy from iron maiden runs around the

1788
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:27,780
whole time.
Wow.

1789
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,630
Yeah.
Cause Mccartney's older.

1790
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,960
Let me see if there's a video of a,
of Mick Jagger,

1791
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:37,440
a recent video of Mick Jagger on stage.
It's just the opposite.

1792
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,150
He was like,
socks bunny could be worse than ojs

1793
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,650
glove.
It's like,

1794
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,280
yeah,
maybe,

1795
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,990
but I wouldn't get a figure.
He's,

1796
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:54,020
how old is Mick Jagger?
65 I'd say that at 67 67 I'll be 65 one

1797
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:57,660
day.
She has the right when I might go with

1798
01:13:57,661 --> 01:13:59,100
70.
Oh really?

1799
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:04,130
Yeah.
What am above 70 72 72 last year and

1800
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,690
concert.
Yeah.

1801
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,730
Now check this out.
When you watch him,

1802
01:14:08,731 --> 01:14:11,040
I'm telling you man,
for a guy who,

1803
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,033
wow,

1804
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,650
dude,
my grandfather was like that,

1805
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,510
that gay a phase that he went through
with,

1806
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:17,770
uh,
what's his name that just died?

1807
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:21,220
That's always looking for though.
Yeah.

1808
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:22,900
Yeah.
He's always looked like trans,

1809
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:25,900
never got fat.
I mean he stayed skinny all these years,

1810
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,690
but that's amazing.
I still running around.

1811
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,520
Yeah.
And he's got a lot of energy and it's

1812
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:32,280
kind of camel.
Oh Jesus,

1813
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:33,770
that bald.
What the fuck?

1814
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:36,580
And he did not give a fuck.
They didn't give a fuck.

1815
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,840
Well,
he's still Mick Jagger.

1816
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:40,380
You know,
that's amazing thing about a rockstar.

1817
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:42,760
Rockstars are the same.
They're the same guy.

1818
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:47,050
It's Mick Jagger at 72 he's shuffling.
Yeah,

1819
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:49,000
he's doing everything.
He's strutting.

1820
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:52,390
But here's the thing,
he's moving loose and relaxed.

1821
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,460
It's not moving like a seven year old
guy.

1822
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:58,670
He's got a lot of energy.
Apparently.

1823
01:14:58,671 --> 01:15:01,280
He's just a fan.
A fanatic about working out.

1824
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,040
Works out every day.
This is according to Brian Count though.

1825
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:04,970
He couldn't might've made that up.

1826
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,143
You never know.

1827
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:09,800
Well,
people say it works out every day.

1828
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:10,760
That's all.
It wasn't matching.

1829
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:13,010
So exaggeration for,
he works out like four times a week.

1830
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,850
Yeah.
I don't think working out every day is

1831
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,120
mart.
Right.

1832
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,560
Cause the mill and do that.
Well I eat a lot of people.

1833
01:15:18,561 --> 01:15:20,720
Definitely do.
I just don't think it's the move.

1834
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:24,230
I think your body responds better when
you give it a little breaks.

1835
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:24,711
Yeah,
right.

1836
01:15:24,711 --> 01:15:26,060
Rebuild one day.
So I've heard,

1837
01:15:26,061 --> 01:15:27,700
yeah,
but I think the,

1838
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,570
but what is also important is you build
up a certain level like with Mick Jagger

1839
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:35,450
and then you maintain that.
That's very critical that you maintain

1840
01:15:35,451 --> 01:15:39,170
that level because once you dip,
like you just can't get it back.

1841
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,180
It's hard.
It's super hard to get it back.

1842
01:15:41,181 --> 01:15:42,620
We,
you're fucking 72 man,

1843
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:43,483
come on.
So yeah.

1844
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,160
You know,
they'll also bone start to break and

1845
01:15:46,161 --> 01:15:50,120
then this guy on the podcast earlier,
Shane Dorian,

1846
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,440
big,
big wave surfer.

1847
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,640
Great Guy.
Really interesting.

1848
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:53,930
Cool Dude.
Really Fun.

1849
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:55,820
But he was talking about hurting his
back.

1850
01:15:55,821 --> 01:16:00,380
He's 43 he took five months off of
working out because he was busy

1851
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:02,780
traveling and then tried to go back and
with a light workout.

1852
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:04,400
So light workout,
five months off.

1853
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,260
Fucked his backup.
Well,

1854
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,430
yeah,
it happens man.

1855
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,500
Get old as fuck.
You got to maintain.

1856
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,980
Remember that marriage children where a
peggy got a personal trainer?

1857
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,390
No,
get fuck them.

1858
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,280
No,
she made me eat bon bons until he died.

1859
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,660
Oh.
What does it say here is there is,

1860
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,570
this is a supposedly as workout.
Okay.

1861
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:24,650
He trains five to six days a week at
this workout's emphasize stamina and

1862
01:16:24,651 --> 01:16:29,651
balance leading up to a tour.
Mick Jagger runs eight miles a day,

1863
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:34,720
including sprints.
What he also swims kickbox is in cycles.

1864
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:39,560
This would explain his ability to sing
and move continuously during a concert

1865
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:42,020
without sounding short.
Wow.

1866
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:45,680
He does some resistant training to
maintain his balance and his posture.

1867
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:50,860
He takes ballet lessons,
what and performs yoga and pilates on

1868
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,330
stage.
I did not witness any hesitancy in his

1869
01:16:53,331 --> 01:16:56,810
movements and he still moves with a
certain amount of fluidity.

1870
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,810
Grace,
he's been known to cover 12 miles on

1871
01:16:59,811 --> 01:17:01,370
stage while he's dancing.
It's drawing.

1872
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,930
Wow.
Sorry.

1873
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:04,610
A concert.
No one's measuring that.

1874
01:17:04,611 --> 01:17:05,610
They're guessing.
Yeah,

1875
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,350
I
12 miles.

1876
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:10,010
Fuck you,
but how

1877
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,600
about fuck you.
Wait a minute.

1878
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,120
That's horse shit.
It takes three hours to run a fucking

1879
01:17:14,121 --> 01:17:15,610
marathon.
Okay.

1880
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,680
It says on here,
it says at that pace you'd be able to do

1881
01:17:17,681 --> 01:17:20,290
a marathon and just under four hours if
calculated.

1882
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:20,540
Correct.

1883
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,070
That's not true.
That's not true.

1884
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:24,410
He's stopping.
A lot of it is not moving at all.

1885
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,110
Total horseshit.
How dare you.

1886
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:32,290
But also our concert before our concert,
they don't put off for 12 miles out of

1887
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,450
here.
There's no way.

1888
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,530
Oh yeah.
Two hours.

1889
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:38,480
Three hours.
They got greedy.

1890
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,870
They went too far.
He said like four miles or five miles.

1891
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:44,810
Thanks Ed.
Even we were misread this thing even

1892
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:47,300
says,
I find this hard to believe though for

1893
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:50,810
two hour concert it means he's moving at
least six miles an hour when you clearly

1894
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:53,420
doesn't run the entire show.
So right there.

1895
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,240
So someone who did it was more just a
meme or something.

1896
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,770
Must have just put it up to add it.
I don't know.

1897
01:17:57,771 --> 01:17:59,450
It's just as he's been known to run that
far.

1898
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,640
We don't know about all the rest of that
stuff either.

1899
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,280
That shit too.
Right.

1900
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:07,220
Could all be bullshit.
That documentary we saw,

1901
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,930
but then it showed like intentionally
stuff that was just proven.

1902
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,460
Then you were like,
fuck this then.

1903
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:12,533
None of it.
Yeah,

1904
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,520
all of it.
Well all of those things,

1905
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:15,840
man.
He's a big foot,

1906
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,200
all that shit.
Big Foot Ufo shows all that stuff.

1907
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:20,880
Oh yeah.
That was like a lot of different,

1908
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,140
um,
conspiracies,

1909
01:18:22,141 --> 01:18:22,974
right?
Yeah,

1910
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:24,360
yeah.
These whatever legends,

1911
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:27,900
legends,
but went to Loch ness.

1912
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:28,770
Did you?
Yeah.

1913
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:32,310
They think they know what that is.
They think that's a big ass fish like a

1914
01:18:32,311 --> 01:18:33,480
sturgeon.
Really?

1915
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,660
Yeah.
That's what they think like to,

1916
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,860
as people left.
Yeah.

1917
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:39,510
There's a bunch of different
explanations.

1918
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:42,630
Some people think it might be some sort
of a giant landlock catfish.

1919
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:43,860
Some people think,
uh,

1920
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:44,830
might be something else.

1921
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,450
A giant lake.
Yeah.

1922
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:47,550
I mean,
it's not like,

1923
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,301
right.
I mean,

1924
01:18:48,301 --> 01:18:49,230
it's like a great,
like,

1925
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:50,820
yeah.
It's just massive.

1926
01:18:50,821 --> 01:18:52,230
And this boat,
big boats on it,

1927
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,130
you know?
Yeah.

1928
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,680
Like ships,
you know that she'll river monsters.

1929
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,650
We've seen that show.
Um,

1930
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,890
it's that guy.
Um,

1931
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:03,390
he's just English dude travels all over
the world and catches fish like crazy

1932
01:19:03,391 --> 01:19:08,391
fucking giant paranas and lying and fish
fish with giant ass fucking crazy teeth.

1933
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

1934
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:11,550
You saw that?
Yeah.

1935
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,590
I forget what he,
where he caught that thing.

1936
01:19:13,591 --> 01:19:16,050
I believe it was in the Congo.
You remember this stuff in Maryland when

1937
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:18,360
somebody brought it back from China,
it was that there was a snake fish and

1938
01:19:18,361 --> 01:19:21,240
it comes out of ponds.
Go on land for a while to find another

1939
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:23,130
pond.
All the waters around it were

1940
01:19:23,131 --> 01:19:25,110
contaminated.
That's a Gar.

1941
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,160
Wow.
Um,

1942
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,010
but yeah,
so Jeremy Wade is his name anyway.

1943
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:29,641
Um,
there was,

1944
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:32,670
uh,
an animal in Lake champlain and they

1945
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:36,210
would call it champ and like,
it's like some sort of another kind of

1946
01:19:36,211 --> 01:19:40,830
dinosaur thing,
but they found sturgeon in that lake and

1947
01:19:40,831 --> 01:19:42,360
so they're pretty sure that that's
really a big,

1948
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:46,680
enormous sturgeon get,
they look like a goddamn submarine.

1949
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:51,120
They're huge.
And so they had a video of a sturgeon

1950
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:54,530
swimming through the water that they
took like from like a drone or a

1951
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:56,040
helicopter,
something from above it.

1952
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,740
And it looks like a God damn monster.
Really?

1953
01:19:58,741 --> 01:19:59,200
Gee.
Yeah.

1954
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,070
When you see a sturgeon from above,
that's about surgeons.

1955
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:07,160
Is this it
never reaching

1956
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:13,060
the,
I don't remember what he blues.

1957
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,391
It must've,
yeah,

1958
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:17,460
it seems like it.
Yeah,

1959
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,140
it was probably,
let's see this thing.

1960
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,160
Yeah,
it's definitely Moody Blues.

1961
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:21,810
Was it good and Moody Blues?
Yeah.

1962
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,820
I never was into him.
God Damn Dinosaur.

1963
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,431
Wait,
let's see.

1964
01:20:26,431 --> 01:20:28,130
In skin.
That looks like a dinosaur.

1965
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,150
It's huge dude.
And by the way,

1966
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,520
that's not even like the biggest one
ever caught.

1967
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,090
They can size of a man.
Yeah.

1968
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,240
Oh way bigger.
How'd or Halibut is crazy.

1969
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:37,320
Fuck.
He jumped in the water.

1970
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,080
Oh my God.
That when you get a perspective,

1971
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,360
wow.
How big is that?

1972
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,520
12 feet long.
It was just size of him.

1973
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,040
Yeah.
So if it was dark out and you saw it in

1974
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:50,160
the water and you were in a boat,
you would shit your pants and say

1975
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:53,380
there's a monster in that water.
So that thing has,

1976
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,260
that thing exists and he caught that.

1977
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,010
It's super possible that there could be
some thing that's super similar to that.

1978
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,370
The somebody overhearing you in a bar
like,

1979
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:03,990
dude,
I'm telling you this thing is massive.

1980
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:06,060
It was a monster.
And then you went to the bathroom and

1981
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,770
you just spread that.
It could be,

1982
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:11,070
but it definitely could be.
You see something like that,

1983
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:13,410
like what's the most recent explanation?
Look at this.

1984
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:14,950
Look at the size of the sturgeon he
calls.

1985
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,120
That's the size of a person.
Yeah.

1986
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:21,270
She got her halibut or they that size.
Huge big ones are hundreds of pounds

1987
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:22,920
bigger than people.
Whoa.

1988
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,190
I think it like a world record.
Halibut's like 300 pounds or something

1989
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:31,080
crazy.
I've seen people catch hundred pound

1990
01:21:31,081 --> 01:21:34,410
ones on TV and they have to pull it into
the boat and it's just like,

1991
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:35,250
what?
Look,

1992
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,280
what the fuck is it to do you?
You caught a table.

1993
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,190
Look at that one.
But God is insane.

1994
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:48,420
It may be the biggest Pacific halibut
ever caught back up to the one that was

1995
01:21:48,421 --> 01:21:49,430
the biggest one.
That one,

1996
01:21:49,431 --> 01:21:52,200
that one.
I go to the visit the page with the

1997
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:54,600
fucking says,
I think of the size of that thing.

1998
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,820
We're looking at this lame.
Yeah,

1999
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:58,680
it's in Seattle.
They caught that fucker.

2000
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,760
Eight foot,
two inch.

2001
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:04,790
Oh my God.
Was estimated at 533 pounds for a

2002
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:07,290
fucking halibut dude.
We eat like kings.

2003
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:09,270
Those are the things you have to fish
for like two hours,

2004
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:11,100
right.
If like keep on the line to keep wearing

2005
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:13,230
them down.
Where I'm down for those they take

2006
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:15,420
forever.
I never caught anything that big,

2007
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:17,860
but I caught a Marlin once really?
Well,

2008
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,460
not a big one either.
It was like a 70 pound one.

2009
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,020
That was a fun fifth and trip.
I'm going up there.

2010
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:25,230
Fuck yeah,
there was a great time the time before.

2011
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:27,240
It was like five,
six years before that attended before or

2012
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,841
something.
I don't know.

2013
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:28,740
Whatever.
Um,

2014
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,200
we went salmon fishing.
Devon went halibut fishing,

2015
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:33,450
but the water was too choppy because of
the wind,

2016
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,890
so he couldn't,
couldn't the line all the way.

2017
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,260
The bottom we just gave up and went in.
Yeah.

2018
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,870
Hallo.
Bid is the best tasting though,

2019
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,110
in I opinion.
Yeah.

2020
01:22:41,111 --> 01:22:44,130
And when you bake halibut with like some
butter and a little bit of garlic.

2021
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,870
I liked like the river,
the river and lake fishes.

2022
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,640
Well they don't taste as good.
Oh really?

2023
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:52,950
Sometimes.
I mean I think the,

2024
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:56,850
the fish that are in the ocean or more
hardy and I think they're more durable

2025
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:58,290
too.
Like they don't like,

2026
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,230
they don't get nasty as quick.
It seems like this doesn't make any

2027
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,310
sense,
but this is what I'm saying.

2028
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:05,040
Like the,
the difference in the taste between

2029
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,100
catching them and cooking

2030
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,560
them like on the shore,
like a trout or something like that

2031
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:11,130
versus a tuna.
When you gave,

2032
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,960
you know you can cook it like a couple
hours later and I'll still be all right.

2033
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:15,890
Well I heard that's what I heard about
those brain,

2034
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,970
rainbow trout and stuff like that.
We'll make stuff.

2035
01:23:17,971 --> 01:23:20,340
It's like they're better fresher.
Oh yeah.

2036
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:21,161
In a way.
Like kill it.

2037
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:23,770
Eat it right now.
Rainbow Trout tastes really good.

2038
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,960
If you cook it right on the shore,
right on the shore,

2039
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:29,080
catch it and then you cook it right away
and started.

2040
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,060
Yeah,
I'm about to kill us by the fucker.

2041
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,030
Get that hot grease going.
You know how the best way to cook them

2042
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:35,530
too.
How Bacon Grease.

2043
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,050
Yeah.
A little bit of corn flour.

2044
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,410
Just a little bit.
Just gently or flour,

2045
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,330
you know,
just chat links,

2046
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:43,230
upper teeth of bates and put it on the
pan.

2047
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:44,560
Damn.
Bacon Grease.

2048
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,770
Woo Boy.
Fry it up real quick.

2049
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:50,260
Flip that bitch.
Get some lemon on that motherfucker.

2050
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:54,220
Woo.
You're doing it all like in a cast iron

2051
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:59,221
frying pan overlooking a river.
Feeling like some sort of a pioneer,

2052
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,840
some sort of a day.
That'd be fun as fuck.

2053
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,360
Fuck yeah,
we gotta do another fishing trip,

2054
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:05,200
dude.
Yeah.

2055
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,620
And then I'll be way more free.
Yeah,

2056
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:09,640
man,
I'm free now.

2057
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,240
I don't have a joke in my hand.
Free.

2058
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,040
Nice.
Beautiful.

2059
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:16,900
Um,
but like,

2060
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:18,790
um,
we should go somewhere else to work

2061
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:21,640
Saskatchewan catch northern pike.
Ever seen those things?

2062
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:23,140
Oh really?
Pointy ones.

2063
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,310
They're like a monster.
It's like a fucking dinosaur.

2064
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:26,410
Cool.
That'd be cool.

2065
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,450
They tasted it to do out of the way
enough.

2066
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:30,460
Yeah.
We could find nobody around us.

2067
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:34,330
Well,
when I was in on that deep all over us

2068
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:38,140
and just so you know what else to you
get one of those therma sells.

2069
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,240
You ever seen a thermostat like northern
pike?

2070
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:41,650
Nicey Nice.
Yeah,

2071
01:24:41,651 --> 01:24:43,270
they have big ass teeth,
man.

2072
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,830
Hey,
would you ever do that catfish hunting

2073
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:47,860
where you just
pull it up?

2074
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:49,060
No,
I like my fingers,

2075
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:51,250
dude.
Those guys fuck up sometimes to get a

2076
01:24:51,251 --> 01:24:53,920
snapping turtle frog.
Oh Jesus.

2077
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,880
These are big ass.
These are big fish.

2078
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:01,570
Wow.
There's a certain type that they call a

2079
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:03,560
muscular lunge.
It's not a,

2080
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,610
it's not a regular northern pike.
It's called a Musky and they're much

2081
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:10,270
smarter and much larger and they eat
ducks.

2082
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,120
Well,
why don't you check out?

2083
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:17,140
Well,
fuck that.

2084
01:25:17,141 --> 01:25:18,490
Frogs face,
dude.

2085
01:25:18,491 --> 01:25:21,370
Good games or photography is amazing.
That is amazing.

2086
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:25,030
They sacrificed that frog.
They got saved them open.

2087
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:26,800
Why didn't they save him from that
beast?

2088
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,490
I think they got frogs just frozen on
that.

2089
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,830
Go full screen on that.
Oh my gosh,

2090
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,890
it's teeth,
dude.

2091
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:38,610
Now imagine if that was as big as that
cow flying through the air as mouth

2092
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:41,950
opening up right above here.
That was going to get you that frog is

2093
01:25:41,951 --> 01:25:45,820
done.
Look how big his mouth is in comparison

2094
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:50,821
to his body to
frog is that is a little reptile brain.

2095
01:25:52,421 --> 01:25:55,370
Can't fuck with the mammal brain.
What's the top thing?

2096
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:58,090
Especially flying mammals.
Yeah.

2097
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,700
Boy,
if there were flying mammals back in the

2098
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,260
day,
thank God our ancestors wiped all those

2099
01:26:03,261 --> 01:26:05,780
fuck heads off and that would be an
unfair advantage.

2100
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,440
Oh yeah.
But then you had only things live that

2101
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:10,580
we could kill with our hands.
Yeah.

2102
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,120
Or they wouldn't kill us.
Well,

2103
01:26:12,121 --> 01:26:14,720
can eagle might be able to kill you?
But I like my chances.

2104
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:16,760
Yeah.
It didn't bother anybody though.

2105
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,940
But they might fly off with the baby
number.

2106
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:22,370
That fake baby video.
That looks so good.

2107
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,830
So good.
I think those guys got work off that

2108
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:25,281
like,
yes,

2109
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:26,114
it's fake.
We faked it.

2110
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,730
Please hire us to do fun shit like this.
Oh,

2111
01:26:28,731 --> 01:26:30,500
honestly,
I think it was a contest.

2112
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,000
Oh really?
I'm pretty sure.

2113
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:33,320
Oh yeah,
thanks.

2114
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:34,880
I might be right.
Yeah.

2115
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:38,660
It looks so good.
The shadowing snatches kid and it's at

2116
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,520
shot so well at first it just filming
the bay.

2117
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,780
They're filming the Eagle.
Yeah.

2118
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:48,270
And your swoops down.
Grabs the kid and flies off in the

2119
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,760
Chinese after out.
And they even went to the ground with

2120
01:26:50,761 --> 01:26:52,320
the camera.
That's so good.

2121
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:57,740
Oh my God.
Joe Perry made a fake bigfoot video.

2122
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:58,961
Really?
Yeah.

2123
01:26:58,961 --> 01:27:01,370
Joe Perry from aerosmith.
Really?

2124
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,970
Let's see if he,
I don't know if he put it up.

2125
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:08,330
See if you find Joe Perry's big foot
video on one.

2126
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,870
Put a dude in a Ghillie suit and have
them wander around through the woods and

2127
01:27:10,871 --> 01:27:14,200
they filmed it was the climate is real.
No,

2128
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:16,660
Joe Perry is an interesting guy,
man.

2129
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:23,340
See this tape that we took got lost for
about a week with all the hubbub of,

2130
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,300
uh,
travel and stuff.

2131
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:30,660
And then we followed it and this is what
we saw and this is what happened.

2132
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,890
He's so Boston it out.
Just think of it what you think,

2133
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,090
you know,
uh,

2134
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,760
upscale blown away by it.
But uh,

2135
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:43,270
uh,
it was pretty scary.

2136
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:44,104
Afternoon.

2137
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,220
I go to the,
go to the,

2138
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,013
Oh,
here it is

2139
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:53,990
so ridiculous.
Like it's,

2140
01:27:53,991 --> 01:27:56,930
if someone will be filming him just
sitting there in the sun

2141
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:01,660
field and it's got like a little cookout
going on,

2142
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:06,780
how he set it up so good.
But I just love the fact they're filming

2143
01:28:07,001 --> 01:28:08,680
for no fucking reason.
It's filming God.

2144
01:28:08,681 --> 01:28:09,514
His phone.
Yeah,

2145
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,380
no big deal.
Just happened to be filming.

2146
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,060
Look,
I'm moving around a little so you know

2147
01:28:13,061 --> 01:28:15,820
it's real.
I skip had this long video.

2148
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,910
Yeah.
What is that?

2149
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,910
Did you hear that?
Nope.

2150
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,570
Yeah,
I think it would just mark,

2151
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:30,940
see if you can find it.
If you could find that.

2152
01:28:30,941 --> 01:28:33,750
We can't go to the spoiler alert.
We know we just get along for sure.

2153
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:34,880
So let's,
let's,

2154
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:41,020
I know what the setup,
is it going to be up here behind him?

2155
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:42,250
I Dunno.
Well,

2156
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,870
I'll be right here.
Be ready for sure.

2157
01:28:43,871 --> 01:28:44,950
Put your shirt on,
dude.

2158
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,420
No,
the sun's out.

2159
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,100
No,
that sounded growls.

2160
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,440
You had a growl.
Okay.

2161
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:56,441
They're in the woods or anything yet.
Worst acting.

2162
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:08,440
What is it?
That

2163
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:15,900
big
and it was black and he was fucking

2164
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,670
bullshit about sasquatch and all that
shit.

2165
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:32,560
Bullshit about sasquatch.
He made a Blair witch bigfoot movie on

2166
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:38,990
his tour bus.
How board is he?

2167
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,140
Sorry,
I sorry.

2168
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:46,300
I saw,
Hey Sarit Boston people will add extra

2169
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:49,180
ours that aren't necessary and remove
other ones.

2170
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:51,060
I saw it.
You know why?

2171
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,950
Why don't have to say the word garbage
because that's what they are.

2172
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:55,570
Ooh,
how dare you.

2173
01:29:55,571 --> 01:29:57,510
But what when you performed there,
you enjoy them though?

2174
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:58,070
No,
no.

2175
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:59,400
Right,
but the ones that aren't garbage,

2176
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:01,990
most of them are garbage.
Come on,

2177
01:30:01,991 --> 01:30:03,280
dude.
Boston people.

2178
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:08,110
How rude.
This is a really dumb video and you can

2179
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,480
take it down.
Enough is enough.

2180
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:11,071
Yeah,
yeah,

2181
01:30:11,071 --> 01:30:11,671
yeah.
We don't watch.

2182
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:14,290
The rest is so it's so unnecessary.
They get bored,

2183
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:17,200
man.
That was just there for their friends.

2184
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,860
Yeah.
It wasn't really done youtube.

2185
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:24,490
Jamie just found it this just trying to
get them a viral video going on.

2186
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,590
Jamie made it.
It was like dude from aerosmith.

2187
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,980
It's not the main guy I talked to you
about,

2188
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:33,340
about everybody opportunity bobcat
goldthwait bleeds in bigfoot.

2189
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:34,151
Really?
Yeah.

2190
01:30:34,151 --> 01:30:36,960
We discussed this on the movie horror
movie.

2191
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:38,890
Really good movie.
Yeah,

2192
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:41,020
it's fun.
It's like a Blair witch type.

2193
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:46,930
I saw him as a apple store getting my
phone fixed back when I had one and he

2194
01:30:46,931 --> 01:30:49,060
was just giving a talk there about the
movie.

2195
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,380
Just randomly.
He must've edited it on a movie or

2196
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,400
something or I don't know.
They just had them as like final cut

2197
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:55,481
probably.
Right.

2198
01:30:55,481 --> 01:30:56,710
I was going to ask when when they said
heat,

2199
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:59,230
who's coming out?
He's supposed to do it.

2200
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:02,590
He was a director.
I've put it together.

2201
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,443
No.
Oh,

2202
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,370
he was director of one.
Yeah.

2203
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:08,170
Yeah,
the Willow Willow Creek movie.

2204
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,370
Willow Creek.
Yeah.

2205
01:31:09,371 --> 01:31:10,390
It's really good,
man.

2206
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,960
It's a,
I saw seen from it.

2207
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,940
Looked like you saw it.
Yeah,

2208
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,050
I saw it.
That's cool.

2209
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,100
Yeah.
I was like,

2210
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:16,810
wow.
Like you made a fucking horror movie,

2211
01:31:16,811 --> 01:31:18,700
man.
It just became a full director like

2212
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:19,750
years and years ago.

2213
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,583
Right.
Decades.

2214
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,530
Well,
he's just a very smart dude and he could

2215
01:31:23,531 --> 01:31:26,170
kind of do anything he wants.
He just wants,

2216
01:31:26,171 --> 01:31:27,550
he,
my mom is not a dude.

2217
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:30,820
Fuck Bro.
Why don't your concert on the smart

2218
01:31:30,821 --> 01:31:31,900
part?
Um,

2219
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,100
he's,
um,

2220
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:34,210
you know,
he could do whatever he wants.

2221
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:36,610
He just has to set his mind to it.
Then he just does it.

2222
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,340
It's not shocking to me that he does it
harm movie,

2223
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:41,200
you know,
he could kind of do any kind of movie.

2224
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,810
Did you see a call me lucky?
No.

2225
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:47,290
It's a documentary that he did about
Barry crimmins.

2226
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:48,870
He had heard about it.
Yeah.

2227
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:49,893
Really.
Um,

2228
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,220
influential Boston's standup comedian,
like one of the most important guys in

2229
01:31:54,221 --> 01:31:59,080
the early days of Boston and was
brutally molested when he was a kid by

2230
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,520
babysitters boyfriend,

2231
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,040

2232
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:07,900
well she like watched the door,
like that kind of shit really bad.

2233
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:10,480
Yeah.
And his sister saved his life.

2234
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,700
She came down and he's unconscious.
Like he would,

2235
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:16,330
he would shove his head and the couch so
he couldn't breathe.

2236
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:19,600
Like you couldn't scream and the guy
would fuck him and he'd be like

2237
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:23,320
literally black out from getting fucked
with his face and a pencil.

2238
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:25,510
Horrific,
horrific documentary,

2239
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:29,440
but really well done and really
fascinating and really open.

2240
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:33,490
And the way barry crimmins talks about
like getting over it and you know,

2241
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:35,650
and,
and then all the people that love Barry

2242
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:40,651
and talk about what a massive influence
he had on standup in Boston during the

2243
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,510
early days of Boston.
And then a lot of the people that he

2244
01:32:43,511 --> 01:32:46,270
knew,
like all his life did not know about the

2245
01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:47,830
story,
you know,

2246
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:52,300
and he wanted to kind of put it out in
this documentary form and it's so well

2247
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:52,690
done.

2248
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:55,300
I can't recommend it enough.
It's called call me lucky.

2249
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,660
Bobcat is a bad motherfucker.
He really is.

2250
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,890
He good.
You know,

2251
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,990
he's nice.
He can do whatever he wants.

2252
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:03,910
And he's a good dude too.
He's a good dude.

2253
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,760
And he's a UFC fan.
Do you know,

2254
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:07,643
do you know the,
um,

2255
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:09,520
the black cards thing?
What's up?

2256
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:10,640
The black cards,
John Jay,

2257
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:13,180
the block cards and Lita Ford or their
managers line them up.

2258
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:17,550
So it's not if you guys become a woman.
I mean just said bend over every and you

2259
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,580
just fucking what?
What'd you hear the manager come on Jay,

2260
01:33:21,581 --> 01:33:24,110
I guess could be not true,
but he's under that kind of,

2261
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,660
he was like,
wait a minute.

2262
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,950
So when they were 14 watts,
they're manager fucked him on when there

2263
01:33:28,951 --> 01:33:31,660
were the runaways.
Come on ladies,

2264
01:33:31,661 --> 01:33:33,280
become women.
Something like that.

2265
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:34,210
Really?
Yeah.

2266
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:36,760
I think it was in some,
like one of those documentaries lead a

2267
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:38,230
or one of them talking about it.

2268
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:39,243
I know.
Well,

2269
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,110
you know what,
it's shocking,

2270
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:43,750
but I don't,
I wouldn't say I'm surprised he's a real

2271
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:45,550
piece of shit manager.
They hood and just,

2272
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:50,530
but would you be surprised that like
some crazy show biz manager would fuck

2273
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:51,370
his clients?
Oh yeah.

2274
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:53,920
And keep them as clients to oh for sure.
Right.

2275
01:33:53,921 --> 01:33:55,360
The right guy,
the right crazy guy.

2276
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:59,140
100% right.
And it wasn't like we had a lot of

2277
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:01,570
leverage when they were just signing
with some other,

2278
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:03,190
had done anything.
They couldn't do shit.

2279
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:05,260
But I'm thinking about it.
What do you know that you got to go to

2280
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:06,730
TMZ,
we're going to go,

2281
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,200
yeah,
they just sucked it up.

2282
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:11,260
Just know where to go.
Look what's happening with that.

2283
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:12,040
Uh,
what does that,

2284
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,710
that singer girl's name,
who wants to get out of her contract?

2285
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:15,710
Catia.
Cassia.

2286
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:16,710
Kesha.
Kesha.

2287
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:19,300
Like it hurt.
I mean who knows what the truth is

2288
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:21,220
behind that story or what's really going
on.

2289
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:25,000
But it's kind of a similar thing like,
or producer was having sex with her

2290
01:34:25,001 --> 01:34:27,380
apparently,
and she said he was raped her or this is

2291
01:34:27,381 --> 01:34:28,230
not what she said.
Like,

2292
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:32,140
isn't that like what the accusation is?
But meanwhile she's tied into a contract

2293
01:34:32,141 --> 01:34:34,240
with this dude.
So she can't make music unless she makes

2294
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:35,170
it with him.
Yeah.

2295
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:38,230
That's crazy.
Like that's crazy.

2296
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:39,850
If it's true.
Yeah.

2297
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,350
The judge was in a tough spot on that
one.

2298
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,630
What do you do there?
Cause he's like,

2299
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:44,950
okay,
you have a contract,

2300
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,440
but if nothing happens then you have to
honor your contract.

2301
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:50,140
Right.
And there's no proof of this.

2302
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:52,030
If it's true,
that's horrible.

2303
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,440
But either way,
there's no proof of it.

2304
01:34:53,441 --> 01:34:55,930
So we can't just go on.
You were saying alleging this cause then

2305
01:34:55,931 --> 01:34:56,830
everyone would just say,
well,

2306
01:34:56,831 --> 01:34:58,040
right out of my contract,
please.

2307
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,630
Right.
Um,

2308
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,960
so he's like,
I'm,

2309
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,600
unless I have a proof of something,
I can't,

2310
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:06,200
there's nothing I can do like right by
like contract law.

2311
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,900
Yeah.
That's a pretty heinous crime.

2312
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:10,010
Yeah,
for sure.

2313
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,750
I mean he's denying it too,
but yeah.

2314
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:15,620
Yeah he's definitely denying it.
But it's one of those really heinous

2315
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:16,850
crimes where you gotta go,
Ooh,

2316
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:20,780
how do you find out who the fuck told
the truth?

2317
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,300
It's so,
it's such a hard crime to prove.

2318
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:27,020
Well,
especially when they get really upset

2319
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:29,030
about it.
Cause it's like so hard to prove it.

2320
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,420
Well that's,
it also sets it up for like this thing

2321
01:35:32,421 --> 01:35:34,240
we never supposed to question a victim.
Yeah.

2322
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:36,230
Well Dad,
you can't say never.

2323
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:38,510
Right?
Like you definitely shouldn't

2324
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:40,660
automatically question the victim.
Yeah.

2325
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:43,880
But if something seems goofy,
you should not question the victim.

2326
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:47,960
Like people lie.
I know people that have had false rape

2327
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:49,630
accusations.
I know as a curse.

2328
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,690
I was going through it in New York and
everybody in his level,

2329
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,760
like we know she's crazy and that's not,
that's just not a thing.

2330
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:57,320
Did it can happen.
They're telling her like,

2331
01:35:57,321 --> 01:35:58,490
stop saying this.
You know,

2332
01:35:58,491 --> 01:36:02,150
it wasn't,
it can happen just like there can be

2333
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:04,970
crazy men,
there can be crazy women.

2334
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:08,900
There's this crazy people.
There's people that will absolutely

2335
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:11,300
fucking make up a story.
Yeah.

2336
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:13,220
And the second is if you don't know
about it or if you're like,

2337
01:36:13,221 --> 01:36:16,080
well how David you,
because you're not going to be yes.

2338
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:21,280
So becomes one of those things where
it's like the person who is

2339
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:26,630
accused of doing it is also being
victimized.

2340
01:36:26,631 --> 01:36:29,330
Yeah.
So we're supposed to ignore that victim

2341
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:33,030
and concentrate.
The problems are based on this idea of

2342
01:36:33,031 --> 01:36:36,470
lexical better a thousand men,
a thousand guilty men go free than one

2343
01:36:36,471 --> 01:36:39,080
innocent man go to prison.
Yeah.

2344
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:41,450
That right.
People don't really like to apply that

2345
01:36:41,451 --> 01:36:42,710
to ripe.
No,

2346
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:44,300
no.
Well it's,

2347
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:47,090
it's one of those weird ones that you
can't look at it objectively.

2348
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:50,300
Yeah.
Internet maybe mobs they do now that

2349
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,930
wasn't internet mobs.
The mob justice that's in response to

2350
01:36:53,931 --> 01:36:56,300
women not finding justice through the
legal system.

2351
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:57,201
Right.
So they were like,

2352
01:36:57,201 --> 01:36:59,300
well let's just fucking ruined his life.
Let's call his mom,

2353
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:01,460
let's do these things and get really
fuck up his life.

2354
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:03,230
Well,
we know that's true too.

2355
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,290
Right.
You know,

2356
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:07,400
I mean,
we know that people have done horrible

2357
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:08,920
shit and gotten away with,
yeah.

2358
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:10,790
So then it's like,
well let's you know,

2359
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,220
and there might be an occasional like
innocent man or,

2360
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:15,230
or or,
or North Carolina Lacrosse team.

2361
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:18,310
Duke Lacrosse team is there.
I know the rape is bad on,

2362
01:37:18,311 --> 01:37:22,160
I'm bringing that up,
but is there anything on her on her side

2363
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:24,530
about like you signed a bad contract,
sorry.

2364
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:27,140
Like you should maybe like at the
beginning of it,

2365
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:28,070
you know,
but I don't,

2366
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,590
I don't think the contract has anything
to do with her getting raped.

2367
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,200
I think if she could do it that that's
what she's doing and miss cause she

2368
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:35,690
can't supposedly make music because of
the contracts.

2369
01:37:35,691 --> 01:37:37,880
You guys with that guy.
That's why her career's supposedly

2370
01:37:37,881 --> 01:37:38,910
ruined right now.
Yeah.

2371
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,780
Well because the record industry has a
long history of that just bearing

2372
01:37:41,781 --> 01:37:42,920
people.
Yeah.

2373
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,800
But hold on.
We already kind of covered this.

2374
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,260
He,
she can't leave and make music because

2375
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:51,170
he has run the contract even though she
says he raped her.

2376
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:56,040
I thought she or interpretation I,
she was saying that she

2377
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,510
was raped in order to probably get out
of this contract to break the contract.

2378
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,870
She was raped to break the contract.
She's saying she was raped in order to

2379
01:38:03,871 --> 01:38:07,080
get away from this guy who has been the
accusation.

2380
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:07,680
Right.
Yeah.

2381
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,010
And I'm just saying like,

2382
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,160
uh,

2383
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,960
it's like,
not that you shouldn't be bringing up

2384
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:13,770
the rape,
but she's,

2385
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:16,290
if she's making it up,
this would be a good thing to make up to

2386
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,060
get you out of a contract.
It's sort of,

2387
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:20,040
I'm sort of saying that,
I mean honestly,

2388
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:22,470
if you had an eight and eight contract
in the UFC,

2389
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,840
you know,
and then some other company offered you

2390
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:26,990
50,000.
It was a fight when you go to six flags

2391
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,070
contract and be like,
so you got to pretend you got raped.

2392
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,120
I mean,
it would work.

2393
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:31,880
That's why I just don't know.
What do you say?

2394
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:32,840
What do you say?
Oh,

2395
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,810
how dare you not let him go?
I don't know how,

2396
01:38:34,811 --> 01:38:36,180
why?
Don't know what it is you would say to

2397
01:38:36,181 --> 01:38:38,820
get out of your contract,
but you'd have to make up something to

2398
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:41,550
get out of it.
Not that I'm saying she his side assess,

2399
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,280
sort of asking.
I'm asking.

2400
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:45,210
Sorry.
Okay.

2401
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:46,930
Okay.

2402
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,110
Um,
house.

2403
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:49,623
Yeah.

2404
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,670
I didn't mean it that way.
I just thought was such an electric

2405
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,290
subject.
You say like one word wrong.

2406
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:55,760
It's like,
wait,

2407
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,593
no,
wait.

2408
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:01,250
It's entirely possible that either one
of them could not be telling the truth.

2409
01:39:01,251 --> 01:39:01,940
You're right.
Yeah.

2410
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,020
We don't know.
I don't know her.

2411
01:39:03,021 --> 01:39:05,030
I've never even heard her voice.
I never heard her talk.

2412
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:07,670
I don't have know anything about her.
So all I'm,

2413
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,110
all I'm seeing is that she went to court
and tried to get free and they wouldn't

2414
01:39:12,111 --> 01:39:15,560
let her free and they,
the guy still wandering around.

2415
01:39:15,561 --> 01:39:18,530
So they're not prosecuting him for any
sort of sexual offense.

2416
01:39:18,531 --> 01:39:19,110
Right.

2417
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:20,050
As far as I've read.
Yeah.

2418
01:39:20,051 --> 01:39:22,470
And I just,
we signed a contract to sign one,

2419
01:39:22,471 --> 01:39:23,304
right?
Or No.

2420
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,140
I mean

2421
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:27,700
he's obviously got some sort of a
contract with her and that's,

2422
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,950
but see,
here's another thing,

2423
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:33,730
if I had a contract with someone and
they falsely accused me of rape,

2424
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:36,340
I think I'd fucking let them go.
I got to watch it.

2425
01:39:36,341 --> 01:39:38,540
And what would it be tied into a
contract with them.

2426
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:42,400
But if the,
the idea of if in any way,

2427
01:39:42,401 --> 01:39:45,490
shape or form,
she's telling the truth of forcing her

2428
01:39:45,491 --> 01:39:46,930
to work with somebody,
it's horrible.

2429
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:47,823
Yeah.
Yeah.

2430
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,590
See,
but that's not what the judge was doing.

2431
01:39:50,591 --> 01:39:51,850
The judge is just ruling on the
contract.

2432
01:39:51,851 --> 01:39:55,180
Law contracts are fucking weird man.
Like think of it as a comic.

2433
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,320
Think of like you as a comic,
like what have you had a contract to do

2434
01:39:59,321 --> 01:40:03,300
your stand up and like you had some guys
six months in front.

2435
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:07,990
It was like a producer that made you go
on the road and you had a pact with him

2436
01:40:07,991 --> 01:40:10,720
and he made you do his jokes and he
would,

2437
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:13,870
he would help you write your act and you
couldn't do comedy without them.

2438
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:18,250
I would just stop doing competence.
That's crazy.

2439
01:40:18,370 --> 01:40:20,260
That in the music business happens all
the time.

2440
01:40:20,261 --> 01:40:23,170
That was the prince thing.
That's why Gerad turned down a new girl.

2441
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:25,480
What does that mean?
Draw comical.

2442
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,800
What's new girl?
He was that show new girl with a

2443
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:31,570
whatever his name is Zoe deschanel.
I don't know who that is.

2444
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:34,630
It's like a spin on fussing.
You're acting like you're not giving me

2445
01:40:34,631 --> 01:40:35,830
enough information.
Show you,

2446
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,390
I don't know what you're fucking talking
about.

2447
01:40:37,391 --> 01:40:40,090
TV Show Sitcom on Fox.
It's been off like seven or eight years.

2448
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:43,000
It's got zooey deschanel in it or one of
the [inaudible] twins.

2449
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:45,580
And what did they try to do with drug?
He tested for it.

2450
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,740
Right.
And then they really liked him and then

2451
01:40:47,741 --> 01:40:50,680
he just disappeared because he saw a
seven year contract and he was like,

2452
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,573
ah,
I don't,

2453
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:53,470
I don't want to get locked into this
thing for years.

2454
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:57,160
Wow.
Now has own set of seven year contract.

2455
01:40:57,161 --> 01:40:58,570
He balked at it.
He like disappeared.

2456
01:40:58,760 --> 01:40:59,830
Hung out in a starbucks.
Tony.

2457
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:01,140
Good for him.
Yeah.

2458
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,620
And he was sleeping on couches at the
time.

2459
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:05,080
He's got balls.
He didn't have a place to live.

2460
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:07,960
Smart man.
Seven years and he wanted his own show.

2461
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,890
I'll long ass fucking time folks.
Yeah,

2462
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,480
seven years.
And what if the direction of the show

2463
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:14,890
becomes more corny?
Oh yeah,

2464
01:41:14,891 --> 01:41:15,800
for sure.
Is that,

2465
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:17,170
that you can do,
if you walk away,

2466
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:21,190
you'll never work here again.
What doing bad sitcoms is a horrible

2467
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:25,450
feeling.
It's horrible that I was on that Fox

2468
01:41:25,451 --> 01:41:27,310
show that was terrible hardball.
Yeah,

2469
01:41:27,311 --> 01:41:28,570
it was terrible.
There was some,

2470
01:41:28,571 --> 01:41:30,580
some,
some episodes where it was just

2471
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,860
unbelievably,
do you feel like you're supposed to have

2472
01:41:32,861 --> 01:41:34,900
to do it or something?
Like feel like a whore.

2473
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,270
You feel like,
uh,

2474
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,070
you feel like,
you know,

2475
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:41,590
you just feel gross when you say these
lines.

2476
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:45,670
Cause you know they're bad and you know
that the show is bad and you know that

2477
01:41:45,671 --> 01:41:46,504
this is,
uh,

2478
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:51,260
the exact opposite of the way you feel
when you're doing stand up at a club or

2479
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:52,030
something.
Good.

2480
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:53,170
Well,
do you mean you're doing stand up at a

2481
01:41:53,171 --> 01:41:56,470
club?
If you're doing your best and it doesn't

2482
01:41:56,471 --> 01:41:57,430
work out,
at least,

2483
01:41:57,431 --> 01:41:58,920
you know,
you could fix it and you could figure it

2484
01:41:58,921 --> 01:41:59,830
out.
How to make it funny again,

2485
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,920
when you're doing these shows and it's
bad.

2486
01:42:02,921 --> 01:42:06,760
They tell you it's good and they make
you keep going and so you're doing this.

2487
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:08,620
Yeah.
And they'll put a billboard up there and

2488
01:42:08,621 --> 01:42:09,400
they'd be like,
show you where the,

2489
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,960
they've raised in the ratings,
but you know,

2490
01:42:10,961 --> 01:42:12,550
it's terrible.
So who cares?

2491
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:15,290
I had to work with kids and work with
this kid.

2492
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:18,880
He was on the set and she had no,
she was fine.

2493
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:21,610
What my point was,
she was a barrel.

2494
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:23,230
Nice kid.
Fuck her.

2495
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,810
He's a nice boy too.
It was a nice young fellow and a nice

2496
01:42:25,811 --> 01:42:28,660
young girl that were on the show and one
time they were very fine,

2497
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:31,360
fine folks.
But my point being,

2498
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:34,240
they were really young,
they had tutors and shit and they could

2499
01:42:34,241 --> 01:42:36,580
only work a certain hour amount of hours
in the day.

2500
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,880
What you expose your child to that?
Well I had a conversation with one of

2501
01:42:39,881 --> 01:42:40,690
them about it.
Yeah.

2502
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:43,480
Yeah.
And it was just trying to figure out

2503
01:42:43,481 --> 01:42:45,400
like what,
what is the idea behind it and they,

2504
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:47,710
you know,
they were kind of saying got to strike

2505
01:42:47,711 --> 01:42:50,680
while the iron is hot and when it's a,
you know,

2506
01:42:50,681 --> 01:42:53,980
you have an opportunity right now to
secure a lot of money and okay.

2507
01:42:53,981 --> 01:42:56,020
That's for their Hollywood career.
Okay.

2508
01:42:56,180 --> 01:43:00,940
And like them as children,
as human beings who that's just another

2509
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:02,710
of 50 industries you can work in.

2510
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:03,730
Yeah.
Why?

2511
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:06,280
Why you fucking up like,
okay,

2512
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:10,360
chances are you'll barely ever book
anything and you'll just get filled with

2513
01:43:10,361 --> 01:43:11,800
this.
Like Mommy's not proud of me.

2514
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,510
She couldn't take me to the things I
don't book.

2515
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:14,650
Oh,
and by the way,

2516
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:17,380
if they've booked two out of 50 things,
that's still really high percentage,

2517
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:19,060
which is you're getting rejected 48
times.

2518
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:22,270
That's amazing percentage.
Most people don't get to things.

2519
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:24,400
So constant rejection.
Yeah,

2520
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,470
and then if you get it like finally I
get their love,

2521
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:28,540
that's me.
And then what?

2522
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:30,310
And then what if you book everything?
What if you nail stuff?

2523
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:32,360
What's the best case scenario that way
it,

2524
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,210
what is the best case scenario and what
else?

2525
01:43:34,211 --> 01:43:37,250
At 24 if you're lucky,
you get super sensitive.

2526
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:38,920
Everybody loves you.
River Phoenix,

2527
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:42,520
they are all whacked crazy except Jodie
foster.

2528
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,980
She seems to be okay.
She seems like she pulled us really out

2529
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:49,150
of it was the outlier outliers.
Everybody else's fucking crazy.

2530
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,550
They're all whacked up on funding,
never get told the truth.

2531
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:57,560
And you don't grow up your,
your grow up period.

2532
01:43:57,561 --> 01:44:00,050
It's supposed to be this struggle.
You never get that struggle.

2533
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:02,250
You don't have to win over friends and
everybody learned how to,

2534
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:05,000
everywhere you go,
they know who you are and they love you.

2535
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:08,630
Thank locking bananas.
That doesn't make any sense and you're

2536
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:11,530
going to have kids at that.
That's a best case scenario is that

2537
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:12,800
thing.
Dude,

2538
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:16,040
I know several child's robots or low or
midgets.

2539
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:17,670
It shouldn't be.
It shouldn't be illegal if you don't

2540
01:44:17,671 --> 01:44:18,920
sell for child stars.
Yeah.

2541
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:20,030
Several.
Oh yeah,

2542
01:44:20,031 --> 01:44:21,770
the one here.
I know a couple of them.

2543
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:24,650
I know several of them did not quite
right.

2544
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:25,910
Oh,
the day camping.

2545
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:28,040
They're also actors.
So part of it too.

2546
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:29,660
Yeah,
we're still in it.

2547
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:31,580
The garbage because of that.
Yeah.

2548
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:36,581
I think there's just something weird
about developing your personality and

2549
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:40,730
your body going through puberty,
puberty,

2550
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:44,600
puberty and all that shit while you're
famous.

2551
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:47,840
That's how it sounds crazy.
Yeah.

2552
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:50,900
Well it's not good for you.
Can't be.

2553
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:52,100
Can't be.
Where's the,

2554
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:53,900
what's like,
what's important for everybody?

2555
01:44:53,901 --> 01:44:58,220
Like what's important like for a guy
like you or a guy like joey or Dunkin to

2556
01:44:58,230 --> 01:44:59,540
anybody that I know.
That's interesting.

2557
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:02,720
There was a lot of like stress in the
early years,

2558
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,910
there was a lot of struggle,
you know,

2559
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,940
was how much rubber friends went up,
you know,

2560
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:10,670
fans and friends and like just like
learn how to cope with no money,

2561
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:12,810
just build character.
That's what's built the characters,

2562
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:16,190
right.
Also there's like a certain amount of

2563
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:19,660
appreciation for whatever success you do
attain because you're always going to

2564
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:22,280
remember being poor and fucked up and
sad.

2565
01:45:22,281 --> 01:45:26,360
And if you were a waitress for a while,
the enjoy being a movie star a lot more

2566
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:28,630
than just some child star.
Hope we can fuck.

2567
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,410
Yeah.
I mean not saying that the child star

2568
01:45:31,411 --> 01:45:33,980
can't form some sort of an
understanding,

2569
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:36,230
not saying it's not possible.
Let's go against you.

2570
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:38,620
The odds are strongly against you.
My friends out,

2571
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,830
somebody,
one of those award shows,

2572
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:42,290
he just got into one of those workshops.
You said one of those,

2573
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:43,880
uh,
American pie ladies,

2574
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:46,040
you know,
like Tara Reid or something like that.

2575
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:48,200
If somebody pulled up in a,
in a Honda,

2576
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:49,220
you know,
was in ballet and she goes,

2577
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:51,280
Oh,
who brought the Honda?

2578
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,290
Like it was like the lowest thing she
could think of.

2579
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:57,860
One of the American pie girl said that,
wow.

2580
01:45:58,690 --> 01:46:00,400
It's just like,
all right,

2581
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:02,060
you guys are never gonna relate to
actual people.

2582
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:03,600
That's so weird.
Yeah.

2583
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:06,590
Yeah.
I had some lady mocked me once because I

2584
01:46:06,591 --> 01:46:11,591
had an Acura Nsx really mocked me in
front of a restaurant for having a fake

2585
01:46:11,841 --> 01:46:13,540
Ferrari too.

2586
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,010
To lower car.
Yeah.

2587
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:17,750
$90,000 car.
It's a fucking great car.

2588
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:19,340
To this day,
I still wish I had it.

2589
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:21,260
I should've never ever had you have
that.

2590
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,010
Oh,
it was fucking beautiful Honda toys into

2591
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:27,120
the store and you're like,
hey guys,

2592
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,260
let's take a look at this first.
Let me play the sound system loud

2593
01:46:30,261 --> 01:46:32,190
enough.
They'll hear it in the showroom and

2594
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:33,043
that,
uh,

2595
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:35,960
show you the puck and bootleg video
machine I have.

2596
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:38,720
You can watch full Bruce Lee videos
while you're driving.

2597
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:42,530
And that was the infinity.
He could watch game of death as you were

2598
01:46:42,531 --> 01:46:43,670
driving.
I'm like,

2599
01:46:43,671 --> 01:46:44,271
wait,
is that legal?

2600
01:46:44,271 --> 01:46:46,820
I was like,
all of a sudden a switch.

2601
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:49,830
That's special switch.
I could flipped over.

2602
01:46:49,831 --> 01:46:54,800
Like cannonball run license plates,
everybody.

2603
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:56,760
That's what you do when you get that
fear factor money.

2604
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:58,470
Yeah.
You would come with that and marijuana

2605
01:46:58,471 --> 01:47:01,630
lemonade before there were dispenser is
that it's like what?

2606
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,640
What is,
what is this?

2607
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:08,240
I was ahead of the curve when it came to
marijuana drinkables I used to buy

2608
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:12,840
bottles of this marijuana wine.
It was like a soda or a co,

2609
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:15,840
call it marijuana wine,
but it was like a soda that contains

2610
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:18,570
wheat in it.
Come on and it was fucking

2611
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:20,730
preposterously strong.
Really?

2612
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:23,270
Oh my God.
I say it's pretty good and it tasted

2613
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,620
pretty good.
So you drink a whole glass of it and you

2614
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:29,470
just go on a site buyer role.
Ry.

2615
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:34,440
Tornado of emotions just turns you
through the air.

2616
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:37,600
Takes you to another place.
Yeah.

2617
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:39,530
Oh my God.
It's so brutal.

2618
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,910
So power and no one had tolerance for it
back then.

2619
01:47:42,570 --> 01:47:45,540
Now we that we didn't understand that it
was a different drug yet.

2620
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,370
I was five years before that.
Banana bread.

2621
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,780
Yeah.
Nobody understood.

2622
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:50,950
Even to this day,
most people don't understand how I

2623
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,240
watched.

2624
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,041
It's different.
Yeah.

2625
01:47:52,041 --> 01:47:53,700
When you smoke it,
you get the thc,

2626
01:47:53,701 --> 01:47:55,650
but when you eat it,
it becomes a totally different

2627
01:47:55,651 --> 01:47:57,600
psychoactive substances.
Like,

2628
01:47:57,730 --> 01:47:58,740
I dunno one Brownie.
I'm like,

2629
01:47:58,741 --> 01:47:59,150
no,
no,

2630
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:01,410
that's not.
If you do a dosage,

2631
01:48:01,411 --> 01:48:04,560
that can be so varied because those
barbarians,

2632
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:06,690
it live on the east coast.
They don't have fucking regulation.

2633
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,150
It's like saying one pill.
Like what?

2634
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,270
Milligram?
Yeah.

2635
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,100
Dude.
Have you seen this?

2636
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:15,000
No.
No.

2637
01:48:15,001 --> 01:48:16,560
It's a breath spray,
bro.

2638
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:17,730
Yeah.
Let me see what this one,

2639
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:19,140
this one.
This is the,

2640
01:48:19,141 --> 01:48:20,640
uh,
this is the one 75.

2641
01:48:20,641 --> 01:48:22,830
This is very light.
175 milligrams.

2642
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:23,601
Yeah,
John.

2643
01:48:23,601 --> 01:48:25,620
And how many sprays is 170.
Let's see.

2644
01:48:25,621 --> 01:48:26,760
Light at all.
Here's the problem.

2645
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:29,610
This is one 75.
This is a thousand.

2646
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,020
Oh,
the whole for the whole bought the whole

2647
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:31,950
bottle.
Oh,

2648
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:35,880
that's not a very good at between.
All you have to do is pop that cap.

2649
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:36,840
Right.
Squeeze that,

2650
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:38,670
twist it,
throw that bitch down.

2651
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,860
Tastes good.
Had to take a second.

2652
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,690
1,000 milligrams.
You're bar.

2653
01:48:43,691 --> 01:48:45,900
Find that if you don't have a tolerance,
even if you're Joey Diaz,

2654
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:47,510
you're gone.
I think that Joe.

2655
01:48:47,570 --> 01:48:48,720
Nope.
He takes a thousand.

2656
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:52,470
That's not true because he sees stars,
the lead tech nine 50 Joey's,

2657
01:48:52,471 --> 01:48:54,660
I've seen joey eat two of those stars at
death and what?

2658
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:57,970
It all started death two.
That's 500 that's close dude.

2659
01:48:57,990 --> 01:48:58,890
He gave me,
what am I taping?

2660
01:48:58,891 --> 01:49:00,780
It does not happen to everyone is here
and I was like,

2661
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:01,620
ah,
I can't have joy.

2662
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:04,400
I eat a corner and it got me,
you know something as small ones like

2663
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:05,280
still get ya.
Yeah.

2664
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,980
I was okay for my story.
It halfway through and then it was like,

2665
01:49:07,981 --> 01:49:09,720
fuck.
Did you ever have one of those lows?

2666
01:49:09,721 --> 01:49:12,720
Harmane states gummies.
The gummy bears go start models.

2667
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:14,220
Yeah.
Let's go me from Montrose.

2668
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:18,240
Those gummy bears are fucking insane.
They should be illegal to those guys

2669
01:49:18,241 --> 01:49:20,760
come to the punchline and stuff like you
want to smoke.

2670
01:49:20,761 --> 01:49:21,720
Sure.
And then you're just,

2671
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:26,610
you just see a fire going carry torches
as the regular.

2672
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:32,090
That's your like car pipe full towards
giant once more before the UFC the other

2673
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:35,030
day.
But James,

2674
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,830
you apparently beat Jamie apparently
doesn't feel it.

2675
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,060
Yeah,
it doesn't affect me.

2676
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:42,510
Thin people know it.
Here's my theory,

2677
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:45,780
because I've heard this a lot a lot of
times is people with really low fat.

2678
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:49,450
It binds to fat if they don't have
anything for it to bind on.

2679
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:51,120
No,
no.

2680
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:53,350
The people I've seen lower fat than me
though,

2681
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:54,184
probably.
Yeah,

2682
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:56,190
he's meaty.
Yeah,

2683
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:57,400
that's muscle,
not fat.

2684
01:49:57,460 --> 01:49:58,810
There's fat in there though.
Come on,

2685
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:00,280
son,
shredded.

2686
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:04,810
How dare you?
I don't know.

2687
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:06,773
All right,
good point.

2688
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:10,720
I'm not lighter than I've ever been.
I'm not sure where one 90 well,

2689
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:12,100
I'm lighter than I'd been in a long
time,

2690
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:16,970
which means I have lower costs more than
me and I'm so much fatter than look at

2691
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:18,330
chimpanzee.
Yeah.

2692
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:23,170
I'm short and fucked up looking
like a muscle filled with helium.

2693
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:27,160
It's just thick.
It's just all bones and muscle,

2694
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,140
you know?
But my point being,

2695
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,510
yeah,
I get blasted.

2696
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:32,943
Like when I eat,
I get,

2697
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:35,920
it does nothing to do with body fat.
It doesn't change with me back.

2698
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:36,840
But smooth,
fatty,

2699
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:37,511
uh,
I dunno.

2700
01:50:37,511 --> 01:50:39,100
I Dunno.
I guess much fatty foods,

2701
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:41,010
people I've seen that happen to,
that doesn't,

2702
01:50:41,011 --> 01:50:42,850
it doesn't hit him.
It's always real thin,

2703
01:50:42,851 --> 01:50:45,130
real small people.
But when you're talking about like fatty

2704
01:50:45,131 --> 01:50:46,840
foods,
people think of fatty foods like things

2705
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:50,650
that make you fat or fat itself.
I eat more fat.

2706
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,330
Yeah,
but it doesn't make you fat.

2707
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:55,300
Your body starts burning that fat to
take it.

2708
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:57,670
I know sometimes when you eat a slice of
pizza after you get high,

2709
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:00,130
it kicks it up again.
Really?

2710
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,480
Yeah,
for sure.

2711
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,960
Did they sound like mangoes?
Oranges?

2712
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,510
People used to,
we used to drink orange juice,

2713
01:51:05,511 --> 01:51:07,330
so it's for acid or mushrooms.
The same thing.

2714
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:08,171
Same thought,
I guess,

2715
01:51:08,171 --> 01:51:10,810
but I don't know.
I thought it was a god.

2716
01:51:10,811 --> 01:51:14,230
I want to say mangoes.
Like someone said that mangoes enhance

2717
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:15,640
your high,
get joy deals on the phone.

2718
01:51:15,641 --> 01:51:19,810
I've heard that with mangoes.
Mangoes go to Jamaica called fucking

2719
01:51:19,811 --> 01:51:21,670
coconuts.
You're on with what?

2720
01:51:21,671 --> 01:51:24,790
I had to Jra.
So 100% true.

2721
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,270
What are the mangoes?
Increase the effects of consuming

2722
01:51:28,271 --> 01:51:29,960
marijuana.
There you go to smoking more.

2723
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:37,320
Leave your fruit at home.
Pussy Ari wants candy and more pot.

2724
01:51:38,190 --> 01:51:41,140
I fuck off punks.
I gotta slow down.

2725
01:51:41,470 --> 01:51:46,090
Do you deem del Ray got the diabetes?
What got the candy?

2726
01:51:46,091 --> 01:51:47,960
Diabetes.
Watts?

2727
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:49,390
Yeah,
he's reversed it already.

2728
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:52,270
But he told his doctors and lethargic
and whenever he goes,

2729
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,710
Oh yeah man,
I think I know what that is.

2730
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,390
And he said he got,
not from candy,

2731
01:51:55,391 --> 01:51:57,760
he eats a lot of candy,
but from those a tortilla shells and

2732
01:51:57,761 --> 01:52:00,910
shit like that,
what turned to fat pizza,

2733
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:04,540
stuff that turns to sugar in your body.
So he's just eating way too many carbs.

2734
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:06,270
Yeah.
Sugar and cart ride.

2735
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,170
No,
I'm Sam Harris,

2736
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:11,650
the neuroscientists,
atheist character.

2737
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:14,590
Really great podcast guest.
He um,

2738
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:19,680
went vegan and his blood lipids are all
fucked up because he's consuming so many

2739
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:22,180
carbs,
like somebody pastas and breads and

2740
01:52:22,181 --> 01:52:25,630
things along those lines.
And that sort of breaks it down and in

2741
01:52:25,631 --> 01:52:26,620
his body to sugar.

2742
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:30,610
So if he looks up your blood lipids,
you gotta be real careful with that.

2743
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:32,390
If you're gonna do like,
he just,

2744
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:34,720
yeah,
if you're gonna do like a carbohydrate

2745
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:38,080
rich diet,
really got to mix up a lot of green

2746
01:52:38,081 --> 01:52:40,630
leafy vegetables.
And if you're going to get fats,

2747
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:45,010
you should get them from like you got to
use like coconut oil and coconut butter

2748
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:46,670
and things along those lines to keep
everything.

2749
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:48,530
Yeah.
I'm just going to try to stop eating as

2750
01:52:48,531 --> 01:52:49,970
much candy.
Don't eat candy.

2751
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:53,750
I don't need any sugar.
I don't eat any sugar unless it's like

2752
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:59,220
ribs less than something like less than
a certain basting on ribs kind of sugar.

2753
01:53:00,491 --> 01:53:01,101
You're like,
come on.

2754
01:53:01,101 --> 01:53:03,930
That doesn't count.
It does count count,

2755
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,280
but it does in the way your body
processes food.

2756
01:53:07,281 --> 01:53:10,340
That's where it gets winter.
Mostly meat than candy.

2757
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:12,410
Let's go.
But it doesn't matter.

2758
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:14,420
Your body doesn't know about that.
Mostly Meat Shit.

2759
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:15,500
Your body knows.
Oh,

2760
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:19,280
I just took in 51 grams of sugar from
barbecue sauce.

2761
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,050
It doesn't know.
A matter of fact,

2762
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:24,380
your body doesn't know when you're
taking in sugar from fruit.

2763
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:27,400
I can take it binds with the,
with the fiber that's in the,

2764
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:29,180
if your actual fruit helps,
if you eat it,

2765
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:30,980
but if you're drinking like orange
juice,

2766
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:34,700
like that,
sugar is the same as sugar from Coca

2767
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:35,533
Cola.
Damn.

2768
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,510
Your body doesn't know what the fuck it
is.

2769
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:42,350
If you drink a good giant ass 20 ounce
glass of orange juice,

2770
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:46,670
your body's just simply not designed to
have that much sugar come out of an

2771
01:53:46,671 --> 01:53:50,810
orange like that's like fucking nine
oranges with no fiber.

2772
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,750
So wax your body.
I was probably better for you cause he's

2773
01:53:53,751 --> 01:53:56,660
all vitamin seen it.
There's no caffeine and he's probably

2774
01:53:56,661 --> 01:53:59,330
better for you than a 20 ounce Coca
Cola.

2775
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,350
But the sugar amount process doesn't
matter if it's processed or not.

2776
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,430
All right,
let me ask you this.

2777
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:05,600
I've got to pick and I put it in the
spring.

2778
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:07,010
Bottled water.
I just whip your dick out bro.

2779
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,230
Okay.
Guess how much sugar that's small enough

2780
01:54:09,231 --> 01:54:11,000
for that?
Don't piss all over my floor.

2781
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,200
Yeah,
you can do it in there.

2782
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:15,020
Just,
just corn hole that we have to go soon

2783
01:54:15,021 --> 01:54:17,180
anyway because a,
I've got to get something somewhere.

2784
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:20,240
He's got a p if folks don't put a camera
on him because that's rude.

2785
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:21,650
I'm like,
there he goes.

2786
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,480
Don't put a camera on them.
We don't want to lose our users.

2787
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:28,630
How much sugar is and uh,
last night we put the camera nearest

2788
01:54:28,631 --> 01:54:30,040
Dick or the,
uh,

2789
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:33,590
make a first folks,
that's the first time anybody's peed on

2790
01:54:33,591 --> 01:54:35,330
the pocket.
Don't take a photo of his dick.

2791
01:54:35,331 --> 01:54:39,020
It's blocked by the cup of,
it's just if you guys stay taking a

2792
01:54:39,021 --> 01:54:40,060
photo of you,
Dick Brown.

2793
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:41,960
Oh,
that's a full Kombucha.

2794
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,690
Definitely don't drink that.
You're going to piss in the pickles too,

2795
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:47,720
bro.
How'd you cut off stream for sure.

2796
01:54:47,721 --> 01:54:49,260
You dribbling on my carpet.
Oh,

2797
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:51,280
I fully,
fully pinch,

2798
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:54,100
I believe pinched dude,
that's a lot of pain.

2799
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:57,860
Will be at the comedy store tomorrow
night.

2800
01:54:57,861 --> 01:54:59,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
go to Ari,

2801
01:54:59,111 --> 01:55:01,520
the great.com and you can buy tickets.
Uh,

2802
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:05,600
tell them that you heard him pee on the
Joe Rogan experience and you will get

2803
01:55:05,601 --> 01:55:07,700
absolutely nothing off your ticket price
already.

2804
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:09,740
10 Bucks Cock suckers.
It's only 10 bucks.

2805
01:55:09,790 --> 01:55:10,970
Folks.
We got pissed here.

2806
01:55:10,971 --> 01:55:15,020
If you want it,
we gotta put it on Ebay for poachers.

2807
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:18,950
We're gonna um,
stop poaching in Africa.

2808
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:22,390
That's a you're juice.
Put out some Jupiter.

2809
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,730
We're going to stop the poaching with
Ari's pissed.

2810
01:55:24,990 --> 01:55:25,760
Hey,
by the way,

2811
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:26,720
can I say this?
Yes,

2812
01:55:26,721 --> 01:55:29,270
you can.
I'm going to Edinburgh and all the UK

2813
01:55:29,271 --> 01:55:30,320
people listened to you say bro.

2814
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:35,420
Edinburgh and Bruh Bruh Bruh.
So it tells people in an h in there,

2815
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:39,260
I don't see it that way.
They also have rules against big knives

2816
01:55:39,261 --> 01:55:41,090
because they got stabby there too.
It's dot.

2817
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:42,860
Yeah.
They have no knowledge at all bars.

2818
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,830
I'm doing my hour this hour that I'm
doing it tomorrow,

2819
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,690
the comedy store and then I'm going to
record and October at cap city.

2820
01:55:48,691 --> 01:55:51,090
I'm doing this hour.
It's not a British hour.

2821
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,310
This is what an American hour looks
like.

2822
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:58,140
Oh fuck your themes or spotlights and
your chairs to sit and get series at the

2823
01:55:58,141 --> 01:55:59,580
end.
We don't do that here.

2824
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:03,090
What happens over there?
A few people won this award by doing

2825
01:56:03,091 --> 01:56:05,640
this like full circle thing.
Trying to like,

2826
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:07,260
that's when I realized,
you know,

2827
01:56:07,261 --> 01:56:10,590
I was just like,
then they all started trying to emulate

2828
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:11,910
that.
We don't do that here.

2829
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:14,070
Well,
so that's my hour.

2830
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:16,560
Okay,
so you're doing American standup comedy.

2831
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,460
My right?
Yes.

2832
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:22,550
American standup comedy 2016 yes.
That is the best style at the hive.

2833
01:56:22,561 --> 01:56:24,990
Six 30 every day.
25 straight days.

2834
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:28,260
Wow.
Maybe 22 that's increased as insane.

2835
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:30,570
How many people were in the place?
I don't know.

2836
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:34,290
It's hopefully more of you have friends
that are going to tell them about it.

2837
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,990
How many did see this place?
Seats about one 20 oh,

2838
01:56:36,991 --> 01:56:37,890
that's perfect.
Yeah,

2839
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:40,230
but you got to fill up a Monday,
Tuesday,

2840
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:41,063
Wednesday.
It's not going to happen.

2841
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,370
Right,
but you'll have a good time anyway.

2842
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,550
I learned a lot from this thing.
Hey Man,

2843
01:56:44,551 --> 01:56:47,190
those fucking,
sometimes it'll shows with 10 people or

2844
01:56:47,191 --> 01:56:48,430
the best shows ever.
Yeah,

2845
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,060
for sure.
I love this thing or the shows with 50

2846
01:56:51,061 --> 01:56:52,260
people.
Sometimes the best show ever.

2847
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,480
Also the Scottish people that don't get
your references,

2848
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:57,480
twist it around.
You've got to figure out how to make it

2849
01:56:57,481 --> 01:56:57,960
dance.

2850
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:59,640
Yeah.
It's pay what you want.

2851
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,010
Whoa.
What do you know communist?

2852
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,670
I'm a little bit of a coach because for
certain things that people over the

2853
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:05,820
attribute there,
Edinburgh,

2854
01:57:05,821 --> 01:57:06,600
it's so weird,
man.

2855
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,250
Even the big guys,
they come outside up.

2856
01:57:08,251 --> 01:57:09,240
There was like,
I got a bucket.

2857
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:11,210
It's just like part of it.
Whoa.

2858
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:14,490
A of just to fully free shows and look
if you enjoyed it,

2859
01:57:14,491 --> 01:57:16,410
pay me.
And then the great shows it fill up,

2860
01:57:16,411 --> 01:57:18,570
get more money.
That is a great idea.

2861
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:21,240
It doesn't feel like begging because
everyone is doing it there.

2862
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:23,490
That's it.
Yeah.

2863
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:28,140
That's like very fair.
If I get out of here,

2864
01:57:28,141 --> 01:57:30,090
don't worry about it.
If he really liked me,

2865
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:32,850
support a couple of fucking pounds,
you get way higher percentage.

2866
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:36,000
So less money.
But like people can't afford it.

2867
01:57:36,001 --> 01:57:36,980
Can't afford it.
Okay.

2868
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:41,010
And then they might be a bit good she
had and people can feel free tickets in

2869
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:41,844
America.

2870
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:43,800
I don't know if it would work over here
like that.

2871
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:45,450
Yeah,
but they're right cause they were crazy.

2872
01:57:45,451 --> 01:57:48,540
No screen right there.
You tell them,

2873
01:57:48,570 --> 01:57:49,980
hey you didn't pay,
get the fuck out.

2874
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:51,870
And they just leave.
I don't want to be here.

2875
01:57:51,871 --> 01:57:54,750
I'll just go.
But when you comp people in America,

2876
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:57,030
oftentimes you get like a less
enthusiastic,

2877
01:57:57,031 --> 01:57:57,990
for sure.
For sure.

2878
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:01,490
It's just an American idea though.
They do treat it more like theater there

2879
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:03,900
twat.
Yeah.

2880
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:05,460
Our folks,
we gotta get the fuck out of here.

2881
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:07,140
That's it for the week.
Watch.

2882
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:09,990
This is not happening.
When I was only on Youtube.

2883
01:58:09,991 --> 01:58:10,824
Now,

2884
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:13,680

2885
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,540
This is not happening.

tomorrow night's the stork and comedy

2887
01:58:19,081 --> 01:58:21,340

That's it.

2888
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,010
Throws the stories this week.
It's a good one.

2889
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:25,110
Watch that.
This is the uncut one's on youtube.

2890
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:26,091
All right.
Sorry.

2891
01:58:26,091 --> 01:58:26,924
Sorry.
Sorry.

2892
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:28,830
I love these slots as Biz.

2893
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:39,510
Okay.
