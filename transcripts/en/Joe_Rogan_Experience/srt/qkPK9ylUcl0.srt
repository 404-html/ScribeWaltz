00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello Freak bitches,
but I feel a lot better at doing this.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,810
I'm going to do to Kilimanjaro by the
way,

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:09,360
on a bad foot.
Oh yeah man.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,870
And a challenge.
I have a friend of mine who went to

5
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:14,400
Bolivia.
He filmed a.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,560
He has a television show called
mediator.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,710
His name's Steven Rinella.
He's a professional hunter and he went

8
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:24,711
to Bolivia and he lived with the Toumani
for a couple of weeks and he brought

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,170
them shoes like,
hey,

10
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:26,641
you know,
hey,

11
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,620
try these shoes on that.
They didn't want to have nothing to do

12
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,930
with those shoes,
like stupid things out of here because

13
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,870
those people walk barefoot everywhere
and their feet.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,210
He said their feet don't look at
anybody's feet.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,550
He's like,
they're all splayed out like their toes

16
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,650
are splayed out and there's like a
thick,

17
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:45,390
thick padding underneath where they're
basically have their own shoes,

18
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,690
like the calluses and the bottom of
their feet act as shoes.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,150
That doesn't sound too attractive for me
to,

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,220
to have to attract abby,
to have feet like a heart and know what

21
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:05,570
I do is using my mind.
So you don't want to have like callouses

22
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:08,640
on the bottom of your feet.
I got very soft baby feet.

23
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,140
So you really.
Yeah,

24
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:10,621
yeah,
yeah.

25
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:15,621
My wife always does a self defeating
man,

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,780
man.
So you are going to do this barefoot.

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,280
Are you going to wear shoes at least?
No,

28
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:24,551
no,
no,

29
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:29,220
no.
Nothing like that exists to go once

30
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,420
again,
mind over matter.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,690
Well,
what about frostbite at?

32
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,970
I did the half marathon,
barefoot.

33
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,120
You did beyond the polar circle at
temperatures even far more below than

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,050
the,
of my joy.

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,810
Is it?
Do you think that's possible?

36
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,230
There's any benefit from the fact that
you're walking so much or running and

37
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:54,090
then your body is heating up and maybe
that has a positive effect on your skin?

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,810
Um,
the thing is I'm very able to,

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,840
uh,
to go way to tap into the hormonal

40
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:05,300
system creating a adrenaline.
You know,

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,790
this fact where people are sometimes
refer to,

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,390
they lift up and mother because the
child is underneath that actually is the

43
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,720
mind staring directly into the reptilian
mode.

44
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,130
That reptilian brain,
which is the primitive brain and that

45
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,390
you have direct access to pure
adrenaline,

46
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,570
makes you able to do almost
inconceivable feet and accomplish it

47
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,370
only any to write trigger.
Now because I have been so much into the

48
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:40,740
cold,
cold is cold.

49
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,890
Is there a real force impact upon you?
So you need to learn how to connect

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,420
within with your mind and you breathing
into the brainstem,

51
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,620
into this adrenaline to withstand this
force.

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,700
The cold impact.
I've learned it.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,240
So you're tapping in your brain,
you're causing your body to produce more

54
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:05,290
adrenaline and you're focusing on the
areas of your body that are contacting

55
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,030
the snow,
like you're focusing on the bottom of

56
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,630
your feet.

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,680
Yes,
yes.

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,080
And it works.
You know,

59
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,210
I'm still able to look around how nice
their sunset or the sunrise and and be.

60
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,660
So there is a margin even there,
right?

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We just need to go back to belief and
belief there in means the

62
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:30,511
neurotransmitters and the neurons.
Those have sick notes and say churches.

63
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,970
So if you charge your,
your buddy,

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,620
then if you're able to influence up to
DNA level,

65
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,270
and we have proven this already,
but the aisle six,

66
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,160
enter,
locating those,

67
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,800
uh,
connected to safe inflammation,

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,500
we could not find it off.
We could not suppress the side against

69
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,870
the flammatory markers.
And we showed very effectively not me,

70
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:03,871
only a whole group of persons which are
trained just in four days to be able to

71
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,020
go into the DNA and create the right
chemistry consciously by breathing and

72
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:15,721
using the mind to fend off flammatory
markers a cost by say a bacteria inside.

73
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,880
So we are actually able to tap into the
deepest of ours,

74
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,710
create,
have control over adrenaline's trestle

75
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,350
and go up to not only in the deepest
part of the brain,

76
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,610
but also in the DNA.
