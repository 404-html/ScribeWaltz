1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,093
Okay.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,403
Hello?

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,811
We're live.
Oh,

4
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:14,571
we are live right now.
Yes,

5
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:15,480
we live.
Brian,

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,230
what are you doing over there?
Nothing.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,603
Fixing some shit on my phone.
I woke up today and my safari app is 

8
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:24,430
just missing from my phone and that's 
not an app you can download from the APP

9
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,960
store.
So it's like how the fuck do you,

10
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:28,180
like you say you woke up and this 
happened,

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,150
but do you really remember last night?
Yeah,

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,820
except I didn't eat last night.
Yeah,

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,043
I doubt.
I doubt you remember the last few hours 

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,230
I did.
I have this problem lately.

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,710
How fucked up was he?
No,

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,230
he was getting liquored up and I saw 
him.

17
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,950
You were getting looked at like for like
eight weren't,

18
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:43,784
you know,
I didn't start drinking until after I 

19
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:45,484
got off stage and stuff.
But I did a thing where I woke up and I 

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,000
tell people like,
oh yeah,

21
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,010
I'll do your podcast,
but I don't write it down.

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,460
And then like I was in bed and somebody 
said,

23
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,294
hey,
I'll see you at the laugh factory in 40 

24
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,030
minutes and I'm like,
what?

25
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,610
You got to remind me?
Or something.

26
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,600
That's,
by the way,

27
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,110
that exact same thing happened when you 
did my podcast.

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,600
Just give response,
Brian,

29
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,140
let's not,
let's not write it off to one night.

30
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,470
Why don't you use the calendar feature 
in your phone?

31
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,360
I do,
but I only do it for his shows.

32
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,220
It seems like by like little things like
podcasts,

33
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:13,130
stuff.
I never really always,

34
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,290
that's not a little thing.

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,393
Well,
I always think that people would like 

36
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,450
remind me,
you know,

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,920
like not 40 minutes before,
be like,

38
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,820
Hey,
I'll see you tomorrow.

39
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:22,210
And I'm like,
okay.

40
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:22,960
Oh yeah,
that.

41
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,793
Okay,
cool.

42
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,950
Yeah.
Okay.

43
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,923
But then I,
after that I had another one that I 

44
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,093
completely forgot about,
so then I had to go to the comedy show 

45
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:30,934
last night.
So I think bread is making an excellent 

46
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:33,394
point.
They shouldn't write it off to other 

47
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,150
people.
No,

48
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,710
it's totally me.
You should keep a calendar though.

49
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:39,700
It's totally me,
Brian.

50
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,220
I don't think of podcasts is a little 
thing at all.

51
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,810
Like if I'm going to do some of these 
podcasts,

52
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:44,770
that's a big deal.
No,

53
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,604
no.
But when you're like at a comedy clubs 

54
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,980
stoned and someone goes,
hey,

55
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:49,960
you should do my podcast next Monday.
Yeah,

56
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:52,090
I've done that.
That's a different animal.

57
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,990
You got to ask people.

58
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,823
I'm like an email or a text,
like asking someone in person unless 

59
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,090
you,
unless you're both sober,

60
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,413
you know.
And another problem I have is when 

61
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:03,670
people give me their numbers,
I don't save it in my phone.

62
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,710
And they said when they text me like a 
month later,

63
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,341
I'm like,
oh fuck.

64
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:09,030
Who is this guy that's texting?
I do this to you.

65
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,050
I don't know if you know I do this to 
everyone.

66
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,303
Everyone.
I always write burt at the end of my 

67
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,133
texts because I'm like,
I don't know if they got a new phone 

68
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,500
because I just want them to know,
hey,

69
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:18,334
this is Bert.
I always wondered why he did that cause 

70
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,524
I don't cause I don't eat it

71
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,370
totally yours Bert.
Yeah,

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,250
it's a little odd,
but there's,

73
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,110
you know,

74
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,830
see sometimes people do weird things 
like,

75
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:39,664
do you ever get an email from someone 
and they have like a tag line and their 

76
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:46,801
email sent for my silly iphone,
excuse the voice darling things.

77
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,830
Jesus Christ.
We really needed to do this

78
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,813
Hashtag.
Like if you ever do your own Hashtag 

79
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,670
[inaudible]

80
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,560
well the guy uh,
um,

81
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,820
Dominic Monaghan,

82
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,360
really nice car.
Yeah.

83
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,630
Like on a lot,
but

84
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,200
that'd be instagram posts he makes,
he puts Hashtag be curious.

85
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,620
Oh Hey,
how about if I don't want to be curious,

86
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,563
check.
Cool.

87
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,340
Can I just fucking vege out over here?
That's done.

88
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,330
But the curiosity is what got me to your
instagram.

89
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,253
Yeah.
So he dumps sometimes like to put my 

90
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,040
feet up and have a beer and not thinking
about shit.

91
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm not always interested in being 
curious.

92
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,580
Be Sad.
Hashtag be sad.

93
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,630
He saw he's got some

94
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,763
travel channel show about like he's 
traveling all over the world and seeing 

95
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:42,450
all these weird animals and he's like,
he's got a genuine passion for it.

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,250
The wild things with dom,
it's on travel to you.

97
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,690
He loves insects.
Matt,

98
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,970
we had some deep conversations about 
ants.

99
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,800
Really?
Dude,

100
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,920
seriously in the ants.
Well I am too in a way.

101
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,001
You know,
not like him.

102
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:54,834
I don't know as much,
but I've watched quite a few 

103
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:59,550
documentaries on it and it's like when I
watch them and like this is amazing.

104
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,540
They,
they,

105
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,523
they just know how to go places.
They're all like in the same row and 

106
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:06,690
we're trying to figure out how they do 
it.

107
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:07,524
It's by pheromones and shit and then you
see these super complex civilizations 

108
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,420
that they build underground,
especially those leaf cutter ants.

109
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,263
Have you seen that shit dude?
Leafcutter ants are so sophisticated 

110
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,913
that they've,
they've engineered some sort of like 

111
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,334
ventilation system so they could bring 
leaves down into their crazy house and 

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
they'll ferment,
they'll,

113
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,753
these leaves will ferment in these like 
bowls that they've dug into the ground 

114
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,163
and there's a pipe above it that's like 
an air pipe that they've tunneled up 

115
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:43,020
through the surface just to allow the 
gases to escape.

116
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,010
No explanation whatsoever.
How they all know how to do this.

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,310
No explanation how they ever figured it 
out.

118
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,090
I mean it's super complicated.
They've been programmed that way.

119
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,021
Yeah.
I mean,

120
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,070
something's going on,
man.

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,620
Have you ever seen when they pour cement
into these things?

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,660
Oh yes.
I have seen this too.

123
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,760
We pull,
can you pull that up?

124
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,594
I want to think they pulled posy melanin
and then they pull it out and it looks 

125
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,590
like an art project.
Yeah.

126
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,460
Well it's this giant labyrinth of 
tunnels and there it is.

127
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,170
Yeah.
Go look at that.

128
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,090
God Damn.
Wow.

129
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:16,680
That's so cool.
I mean,

130
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:19,770
how were they all communicating together
to figure this out?

131
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,930
This is,
that's not one is it?

132
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,520
What does that,
that's an a Wa wasp masterson.

133
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,790
What is that?
Whoa.

134
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,920
An ant queen.
Um,

135
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,330
go to that.
The leaf cutter ant,

136
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,164
there was a video of it,
I think you find it and they showed how 

137
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:36,264
they did it,
how they poured the water in or the 

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
concrete in rather,
which is kind of rude,

139
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,940
I think about it.
How many ants that's an ant.

140
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,650
Genocide were just saying,
oh,

141
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,450
amazing.
Hashtag be curious.

142
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,383
Yeah.
Sadly dialed in because we're talking 

143
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,640
about and see what they do in here.
Yeah.

144
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,870
They're pouring it into this whole,
I mean this is like,

145
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,030
that looks like either pouring molten 
metal.

146
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,980
Is that metal?
Aluminum?

147
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:03,330
I'm pretty sure how rude I know.
Got All these.

148
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,720
All these answers are like,
what the fuck dude?

149
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,210
What the fuck my family's in there,
my fucking kids,

150
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,200
dude.
What the fuck?

151
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,740
Look at the ants.
Just like freaking out around the edge.

152
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,743
So they pour this molten aluminum in and
fill the whole thing and then this 

153
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,450
serial killer asshole.
What a spatula.

154
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,313
He's got a little spatula.
It's designed to sound like guess is 

155
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,230
that a gal or a dude?
It's hard to tell.

156
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,353
Might be a man Bun,
but whoever it is is gentlemen or a 

157
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,900
woman is going to go in there and dig 
the whole thing out now and it's a piece

158
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,950
of art.
Wow.

159
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,420
That's actually a pretty dope piece of 
art.

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Finished casting 21 inches wide hunting 
big 14.5

161
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,930
inches high and it weighs three pounds.
Wow.

162
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,340
And Aster Harvester ant casting brought 
to you by,

163
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,293
so it's an oh aunt caster.com.
So it's a company that murders ants for 

164
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,830
you.
That's real big.

165
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,480
Gives a fuck if you kill ants.
It is one of the weirdest things,

166
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,650
dude.
You could,

167
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,603
you could kill an ant on your pants and 
brush it to the ground in any 

168
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,890
respectable office and nobody freaks 
out.

169
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,720
Yeah,
yeah.

170
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,580
No one says,
where'd you kill bees these days?

171
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,830
People get pissed.
They get pissed and they should.

172
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,660
Yeah,
we don't have any many bees,

173
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,300
you know,
running out and bees and we want to keep

174
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,850
our cell phones and we want to keep 
pesticide.

175
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,370
So we'd had a piece in pests and cell 
phones and petrified connect.

176
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,130
Well,
I'm not a bee expert,

177
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,053
I should just say that off the bat,
but what I've read is that they're 

178
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,754
pretty sure that bees are affected by 
cell phone signals and some sort of a 

179
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,020
negative way.

180
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,020
And it interferes with their ability to 
communicate with each other up.

181
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,870
Or there's another possible thought is 
that they might be hearing this,

182
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,080
the sound of the cell phone signal all 
the time,

183
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,153
and it's just driving them nuts.
It's just interfering or intruding in 

184
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:57,240
their life.
The cell phone service,

185
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,190
the frequencies are making b's autistics
so they can't talk to each other.

186
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,350
That's why autism or up is up.
Awesome.

187
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,010
Big Autism epidemic interviews.
When we were on fear factor,

188
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,800
we did,
we had this instant we were up in um,

189
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,240
or they're going to say you did it with 
autistic.

190
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,540
He's autistic fuckers lied to them,
you know,

191
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,210
um,
they had this um,

192
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,270
this stumbling recovering people in bees
and so we're on this ranch and uh,

193
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,133
they had these people and they would 
stand there like leaning up against a 

194
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:28,460
pole and this guy would come over with 
these and just coat them with bs,

195
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,420
like scoop it on them.

196
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,610
They had a stand with a bs on him for a 
certain amount of time.

197
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,473
I don't remember how,
maybe they had to like unlock locks or 

198
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,590
something stupid.
But while this was going on,

199
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,770
this local colony of bees showed up.
So it was like a b gang meeting.

200
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,840
Like they had to have a meeting and we 
had leave.

201
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,480
Like the guy who's the bee guy goes,
okay,

202
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,403
here's the situation.
There is a local colony that just came 

203
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:56,670
to investigate why my colonies here,
we have to let them work this out.

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
And I was like,
what?

205
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,100
Like what are you talking about?
And so we,

206
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,910
we,
we had to all leave the set.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,810
So we all left the set and we went over 
like by these trailers that they had set

208
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:07,644
up and we kind of watched these bees 
just fly around each other should oh 

209
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,200
yeah.
And they had to figure each other out.

210
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,120
They had to figure out like,
what are you guys doing here?

211
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,220
Oh we're filming a show.
Oh what did we watch it?

212
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,930
And then they had like,
they had a talk,

213
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,520
like they had to have a meeting and we 
don't,

214
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,840
we're not moving in,
we don't live here.

215
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:25,770
We live like down there in that thing.
I mean obviously they didn't use English

216
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,813
but somehow or another they communicated
whatever they needed to and like 20 

217
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,580
minutes later.
So we were allowed to go back to work.

218
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,310
Or they're dead bees on the ground when 
you got over there?

219
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,121
No,
I don't think so.

220
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,640
It's hard to find them.
I mean if there were just finding a dead

221
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:39,580
being on the ground,
but I mean like if there were,

222
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,883
there'll be more than one you'd imagine 
like maybe like 30 dead bees on the 

223
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,130
ground,
like 300,

224
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,013
300 bees,
the movie 300 fucking xerxes victims 

225
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:52,420
everywhere.
Have you ever driven through a,

226
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,780
uh,
a big flock of fluff,

227
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,650
fluff or bs?
Oh,

228
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,800
oh,
swarm of bees.

229
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,740
No,
I live in through like spock,

230
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:00,800
spock snack,
all of the windshield,

231
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,950
uh,
over by NBC in Burbank.

232
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,960
You know,
that like right off Alameda,

233
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:06,794
that back road I was driving through one
time I had my windows down and all of a 

234
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:14,660
sudden thought maybe a thousand bees 
just flying around and all in the car.

235
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:15,500
And I was like,
mother,

236
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,873
wow.

237
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,520
I just kept driving and I just sped up.
And I was like,

238
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,380
and they came in and out of the car 
pretty quickly,

239
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,300
but it was,
I drove right through them.

240
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,370
And that same thing happened in front of
our house.

241
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,960
In front of our house.
There's a dead,

242
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,143
uh,
like elm tree or something or a walnut 

243
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:30,980
tree.
It was a walnut grove.

244
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,173
And it's all hollowed out.
And there were like a thousand bees 

245
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,534
living inside that and my daughter's 
terrified of bees and our neighbor just 

246
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:39,494
went in and put like a song,
like a towel in the top and just lock 

247
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,890
them in and had them die.
What I mean,

248
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:47,180
fucker,
he's a dick.

249
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,700
Jesus Christ.
Did you ever see the,

250
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:50,990
um,
there was a guy,

251
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:54,190
I think it was long island that found 
this mega

252
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,063
colony in his attic.
He went up in his attic and it was 

253
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:01,280
either aunts or I use either a bees or 
wasps.

254
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,460
I don't know what,
I don't remember which one it was,

255
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:08,930
but what I remember is this fucking guy 
was up in his attic and it was like,

256
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:09,764
Holy Shit,
we're talking about something as big as 

257
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:17,021
this table is an enormous,
enormous bee colony in his attic.

258
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,730
They just had found a way through that 
says,

259
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:20,810
fuck,
it's warm in here.

260
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,740
Let's,
let's keep,

261
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,573
and he just never went up there.
And so they just kept building this 

262
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:25,844
goddamn thing.

263
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,130
So it was this huge shelter that's 
they've got,

264
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,200
uh,
Africa is a video of a Jamie,

265
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:35,410
if you could find it.
They are africanized bees in business.

266
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,630
Oddly enough,
like all over that.

267
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,150
I saw that online one time.
Literally the,

268
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:41,890
those are the killer bees.
Those are the bad ones.

269
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,770
And they got dudes that,
I think it was a TV show now that I said

270
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,570
that sounds like I fucking read 
something.

271
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,523
But it was a reality show about a guy 
who would just get rid of Ackford 

272
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,120
africanized bees.
Those are the scary ones.

273
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,523
Yeah.
Remember when you were a kid and 

274
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,960
everyone was scared of African killer 
bees,

275
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,970
quicksand.
The killer bees.

276
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,620
Then we've talked about this,
I think before her quicksand go,

277
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:05,080
they turn into porn,
quicksand,

278
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,230
bs.
I mean,

279
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:09,190
I thought there was a bunch of shit that
was going to get me the Russians,

280
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,500
Russia,
Russia.

281
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,980
Tell me about it.
And when you were a kid,

282
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
fuck yeah,
I thought the bomb was going to happen.

283
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,903
He's fucking kids today.
They don't know these fucking kids 

284
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,180
today.
Let me tell you something.

285
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,460
Last night.
Joey Diaz is on stage at the hall.

286
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,563
I'm not going to do is bid at all.
I don't even know if it's a bit or it's 

287
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:24,994
him talking because quite honestly I 
watched him smoke maybe 10 cup fulls of 

288
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:33,160
Hash on vine before he came there.
But he was doing this bit,

289
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:33,994
I'm in the back just kind of watching 
him and he's doing this bit about 

290
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,890
watching two dogs.
Fuck,

291
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,570
but you don't don't,
you're not going to do it.

292
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,540
But what was happening was there were 
these two,

293
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,403
I'm going to say gay hipsters,
they a man bonds and they were just 

294
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:49,060
looking at each other.
They're like shaking their head going,

295
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,793
that's not true.

296
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,140
And I was like,
Oh man,

297
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,213
like our kids are so far removed from 
like the stray dogs fucking in your 

298
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:00,310
front yard that these guys think that 
dogs,

299
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,173
you just adopt them.
And they like the throw almost 

300
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:07,450
genetically made in laboratories that 
they don't just fuck on the streets like

301
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,040
that.
It was so interesting to watch these two

302
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:09,874
kids just go like,
well that's sort of true premise of 

303
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:13,810
Joey's bit that,
you know,

304
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,040
you don't see that anymore.
Yeah,

305
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,320
no,
but it was watching these kids just look

306
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,480
each other and just shake their head.
And I was like,

307
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,220
who the,
like I remember watching,

308
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,300
I remember seeing that when I was a kid.
Yeah.

309
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,580
He always pit.
It's so funny,

310
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,370
Dude.
He was hilarious last night.

311
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,263
Tuesday night at the store too.
He was on fire Tuesday night at the 

312
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:31,654
store.
He was on fire and he just gets off 

313
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:33,250
stage.

314
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,083
He's like,
bye.

315
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
I'll go.
I thought we were going to hang out.

316
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,920
No,
fuck that cock sucker.

317
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,763
I got to go.
I'll see how I'll come over your house 

318
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:41,860
for girl scout cookies.
I got to go.

319
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,900
Yeah.
It's pretty funny and crazy.

320
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:45,160
What happened at Lee?
Uh,

321
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,800
being like,
out of everyone that we know,

322
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:49,390
all the Comedians,
Lee,

323
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:50,224
his,
a assistant on his podcast is banned 

324
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:53,541
from that.
That,

325
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,550
that,
that hotel,

326
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,890
the uh,
uh,

327
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,390
silver point.
What is it?

328
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,680
South Pointe,
south point banned for life.

329
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,040
What hotel he was given out.
Um,

330
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,730
allegedly he gave his star to somebody.
Should we tell the story?

331
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,990
I don't know if we don't know if 
allegedly gave a star.

332
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,870
Probably shouldn't tell his story.
He was starting out.

333
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,250
This was a story there.
He's on it.

334
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,680
It's on his Paris or in his podcast.
You?

335
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,551
No,
no.

336
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:19,090
Let me tell you something.

337
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,923
Joey.
Joey came about the guy who makes our 

338
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,044
tee shirts.
He gave us his phone number online and 

339
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:26,254
he called me.
He goes,

340
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,300
do you ever do business with that cock 
sucker again?

341
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,240
I'll fucking kill you.
I was like,

342
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,470
Joey,
I already have a shirt order.

343
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,460
And he's like,
cancel it.

344
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,563
Cancel it to mirror him.
So I think I had to go through a new 

345
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,010
people to get money and my shirts.
Fuck yeah.

346
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,510
Cause you think you want to fuck with 
Joey?

347
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,120
What was it about?
Nothing.

348
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,220
Fucking nothing.
Sometimes like I don't,

349
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,590
I mean I don't know what it was like,
but joy wouldn't tell me.

350
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,453
He was like,
ah,

351
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,260
fuck him.
It had to be something.

352
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,123
It's,
it's,

353
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,130
Oh,

354
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,390
I would assume.
Oh yeah.

355
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,690
Joey has been on a tear lately.
Hasn't been,

356
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,710
well,
Joey doesn't give a fuck if he,

357
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,070
if he thinks you're a piece of shit,
he wants to know what are these?

358
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,590
This is the new shirts from the time I 
fought the bear.

359
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,360
Can you see it?
No.

360
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,760
It says marshmallow.
What is it?

361
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,260
I don't get to bear the bear face and it
says marshmallow in it.

362
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,430
Oh,
now I get it.

363
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah.
So I thought a bear,

364
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,220
I've told you the story before,
but I got,

365
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,800
I got one for all you guys and there's 
an extra one leftover.

366
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,270
I shouldn't put them right in front of 
us.

367
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,104
That's going to be distracting.
So this guy's a new guy that made your 

368
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:28,430
shirts.
Yeah.

369
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,920
You couldn't do it with the guy that 
Joe,

370
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:31,920
he hates tillys.
Hmm.

371
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,940
Joey's loyal man.
But it was the one thing about that guy.

372
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,870
He's definitely that.
Yeah.

373
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Joey's a is very passionate.
I don't know what happened,

374
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,490
but he's great if you're great to him.
Yeah,

375
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,191
yeah.
He's great.

376
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:48,070
If you great to him.
But if you fuck them over,

377
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,190
if you achler cunt,
he comes down and comes down hard.

378
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,620
He'll call you on it first.
And have you ever,

379
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,550
has he ever called you on something you 
did like just been joined?

380
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,590
I had been remarkably friendly forever.
Oh,

381
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,653
remarkably.
Like even if we got upset at each other 

382
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:05,600
for anything,
it was very,

383
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:06,640
very minor.
Yeah.

384
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:07,474
And it's usually,
cause he had any food yet or if he's 

385
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:10,934
gotten upset at anything,
like the mass he ever got was when I 

386
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:16,910
couldn't figure out where we should eat 
in Austin landed,

387
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,660
we landed and we're driving and like,
where do you,

388
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:22,100
where do you guys want to go?
Fucking five,

389
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,420
five,
somewhere.

390
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,310
You got that fucking phone in your 
pocket,

391
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,020
take the fucking phone out of your 
pocket.

392
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,170
She just quite jump up and call 
somebody.

393
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,370
And he was in,
he was like the worst.

394
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,353
Uh,
he was in the worst health of all the 

395
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,110
time that I've known him.
He was real big then,

396
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,310
like real heavy.
And He,

397
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,290
um,
you know,

398
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:46,250
it's just when you get like that,
I don't know what it is that,

399
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,290
that blood sugar spike thing where you 
just fucking need to eat right now.

400
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,490
You're,
you're freaking out.

401
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,130
He gets there,
he gets to that spot.

402
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,740
Oh he got it.
He got on me one time cause uh,

403
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,790
he called me and I didn't answer and 
they called again.

404
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,160
I didn't answer and he called a third 
time and I still didn't answer.

405
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,350
And then they started calling 
aggressively when I was like,

406
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:09,951
oh.
And I was like,

407
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:10,610
oh,
something's wrong.

408
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,350
So I pick up the phone and he goes,
no,

409
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,390
no,
we're fucking friends.

410
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,520
If I call,
that means I need to talk to you.

411
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,220
You pick up your fucking phone ward off 
fucking friends.

412
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,730
Do you understand that I'm having like 
flashbacks?

413
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:24,620
And he talked like that and I go and I 
just,

414
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,630
I was like,
but I just didn't know not I just,

415
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,900
I call you see my name,
you fucking call me back.

416
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,510
How crazy he is with the fucking 
voicemails.

417
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,900
He can't leave a voicemail.
You can't leave it.

418
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,300
You call me,
you call me.

419
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,830
I go,
what will come on joey go.

420
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:42,710
Why do you want everybody else to follow
these rules?

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,280
These rules don't make sense if it's so 
easy to just text you a message.

422
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:50,100
Say Hey brother showed tonight is at 10 
why isn't that

423
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
okay,
why isn't that okay because I'm 

424
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,450
insecure.
I want to talk to you,

425
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,284
want to look you in the eyes like a man.
He going to fucking tell me something 

426
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,940
and the next best thing is talking to 
you on the phone.

427
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,913
It's hard to argue with that.
No more voicemail APP is an APP that 

428
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:04,884
kills voicemail so cars have to text you
and I'm pretty sure you could just turn 

429
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,250
off voicemail.
Just let it fill up fucking APP.

430
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,490
I just slipped that bitch fill up.
Let me tell you something.

431
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,730
I never checked those things.
Joey's been to every Easter at my house,

432
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,020
every Christmas Eve,
every Christmas dinner for the past ever

433
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:25,240
since I've known him because that 
because that and that it's,

434
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,900
it's interesting cause it's helped 
blossom a part of my personality because

435
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:31,670
I'm really fucking,
I got intimacy issues like I don't like,

436
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,210
I like to be friends to people,
but my phone calls,

437
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,200
we're usually pretty short.

438
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,093
I don't want to bother people.
I'm just afraid people bother people 

439
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,320
being considerate.
But Joey is one of those guys,

440
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,060
like the first,
I think we have first Easter.

441
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:42,894
We invited to him,
him to him and my dad got along really 

442
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,110
fine.
He gave my dad my dad,

443
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:49,670
marijuana and fucking I was there.
Yeah,

444
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,100
I edible medical marijuana and Dosim or 
did he tell him when he was doing,

445
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,590
Kevin offered him,
offered him some popcorn.

446
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,903
You know Joey is just pop Mr k take some
of this and it's fucking edible 

447
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:00,654
marijuana.
My Dad eats something and my dad is 

448
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:03,660
like,
and I go,

449
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:04,710
dad,
that's edible marijuana.

450
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:05,670
And he goes,
no buddy,

451
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:06,540
it's popcorn.
I go,

452
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:06,880
no,
that.

453
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,960
How old's your dad?
67 right now probably.

454
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,240
And what was he doing back when pop was 
kicking?

455
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,710
He tried it a couple times,
but he wasn't like he was a runner so he

456
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:17,544
didn't do it.

457
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,773
And then Joey just starts laughing.
Mr Is going deep motherfuckers this and 

458
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,940
so I go,
I go over,

459
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:24,361
I go,
Joe,

460
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:25,650
did you just give him marijuana?
He goes,

461
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,311
he took it.
No,

462
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,630
I didn't give it to him.
He took it.

463
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,620
So I can't even fucking person expects 
no 69 year old guy to know what the fuck

464
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,920
pop popcorn is the most 20 year old kids
all across the country.

465
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:45,600
Don't know it popped popcorn is joe.
There's a picture I have of my dad.

466
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,033
I'm not even lying with his hand into 
his mouth like this and joey with that 

467
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:55,461
big joey like fucking laughing and,
and I,

468
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:59,190
and then immediately I was like,
my dad's like,

469
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:00,660
well what do I do?
And I was like,

470
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,550
and Joey's like,
you're going with him dog.

471
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,570
Just hey me some on my wife's losing her
fucking mind.

472
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,523
Now everyone's on edibles on Easter 
morning in fucking all the kids are 

473
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,610
Easter egg hunting.

474
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,680
I go into the man cave,
I locked the doors.

475
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,140
We're podcasting cocksuckers turns on my
black ass and equipment.

476
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,760
We do probably my most epic podcast 
ever.

477
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,710
Wow.
Of just joey.

478
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,544
Just,
oh,

479
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,920
but he's like,
but I'll tell you what.

480
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,630
Your Dad had fun though,
right?

481
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,493
My Dad had a blast.
You want to know the really best part 

482
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,470
that night.
We all leave day.

483
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:37,620
Everyone leaves that night.
Me and my dad sat in my seven,

484
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,454
went to my sister's house set outside,
had a cigar and my dad is always had a 

485
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:42,570
problem,
my lifestyle and he just,

486
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,480
and we're both higher than Giraffe,
pussy and he's like,

487
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,553
he's like,
buddy,

488
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,750
I want to tell you why I bother you 
about your lifestyle.

489
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,920
My father reminded me so much of you,
my father died when he was 42 from blood

490
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,990
pressure issues and I,
and I've,

491
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,150
and I've never been one to hound you,
but you need to go to it.

492
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,160
I want you to go to a cardiologist,
get a ct scan,

493
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,470
I want you to get the full comprehensive
thing right now.

494
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,790
And I was like,
and he goes,

495
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,690
I said,
if I did that,

496
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:05,950
would that make you feel comfortable?
And he goes,

497
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,620
that would change my life.
And I was like,

498
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,450
why do we have to be high to have this 
conversation?

499
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,090
And I,
so the fucking next month I went in,

500
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,190
I got a full fucking comprehensive 
overview.

501
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,600
Totally fine.
High blood pressure,

502
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,890
but totally fine.
My Dad is like my,

503
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,783
my,
I'm bound me fucking around when I say 

504
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:21,634
this.
My Dad loves Joey Diaz because of that 

505
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:24,790
moment,
because he got,

506
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,683
he got my dad,
a very uptight guy to a place where you 

507
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:27,874
could kind of connect with me and talk 
to me for the first time like that and 

508
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:31,691
go,
you know you're drinking.

509
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,950
I don't know if you do drugs on the 
road.

510
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,510
I don't know what you do.
And My,

511
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:35,344
and we just had a great conversation and
every fucking family event we ever had 

512
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,090
at my dad's at my dad's like,
did you call Joey?

513
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,760
Just fucking loves.
He loves his daughter.

514
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,020
Yeah.
Like my dad loves joey.

515
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,460
Really?
Literally.

516
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,030
Everybody knows joey loves joey.
Oh yeah.

517
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,910
Oh my kids fucking love him.
Yeah.

518
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,410
Oh,
he calls [inaudible] El Diablo.

519
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,220
When he goes off,
man,

520
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,640
you just gotta back away like that John 
Copper rule thing.

521
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,403
Hey,
a cap rule was asking me to get involve 

522
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,680
and I'm like,
you're on your own dude.

523
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,600
You're on your own.
Yeah.

524
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,970
I don't know what happened.
I was outside of that.

525
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,730
I wasn't at the store.
All this shit was going down.

526
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:12,160
I don't know what cap rule.
Oh,

527
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:16,760
did that piss joe off so much,
but joey's insistent,

528
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,760
you know?
Yeah.

529
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,000
I didn't want to hear it.
I'm like,

530
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,350
why?
Just going to work this out?

531
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,740
Just watching it on twitter was insane.
Every three seconds.

532
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,160
If it was you and him,
I would have to get involved,

533
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,971
but I have to go,
okay,

534
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:30,980
what happened?
What the fuck is going on?

535
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,020
But with cat,
I don't know capra role that well.

536
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:33,950
I just know him like,
Hey,

537
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:36,230
what's up man?
How much you're on your own.

538
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,373
Sorry Dude.
I don't know what to tell you of one 

539
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,550
guy's my brother and the other guy 
barely.

540
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,930
I barely know you.
I mean,

541
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,720
I know you like hi,
but like we never hang out.

542
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,100
I don't,
I don't know what's going on.

543
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,960
I don't know what you did,
but joey,

544
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,130
when he gets this thought in his head 
that you're the enemy,

545
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,610
you know he fucking,
he doesn't let it go.

546
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,260
Like if I,
if,

547
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,260
if he saw Tommy today,
like Tommy from the old comedy store,

548
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,860
he would spit in his face.
Like he would get fucking crazy.

549
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,520
Yeah,
he,

550
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,480
he,
he's just,

551
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,660
he's the real deal.
Like would you sleep what you get?

552
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,763
There's no act is no,
and that's when Joey really became joey 

553
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:19,970
on stage because Joey was always the 
funniest guy in the parking lot.

554
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,390
And then he would go on stage and I 
don't know what it is man.

555
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,550
He just couldn't figure out,
you know,

556
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:28,160
those tense moments.
Like I was watching someone last night,

557
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,270
there was just starting doing comedy and
choose doing a set and I could tell like

558
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,420
she's got potential but she just can't 
get comfortable up there.

559
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,230
She can't be herself.
You know,

560
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,440
there's like this something,
these thoughts,

561
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,710
this,
this like compression that's holding you

562
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:43,850
back.
Joe.

563
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,990
We had that and one day he didn't have 
it anymore.

564
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,853
I mean it was crazy and we had been 
friends for like a couple of years and 

565
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:54,160
he just wasn't doing well.
Like,

566
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,200
cause he wasn't doing well on stage and 
then all the sudden he was murdering.

567
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,360
Like,
I've never seen anything like it before.

568
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,194
It was like a switch flipped and as a 
different person out there and he was 

569
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:08,474
the same guy from the parking lot.
Does it matter who the fuck's in the 

570
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,720
crowd?
It didn't matter.

571
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,703
He would say shit you like,
how the fuck did you just say a racist 

572
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,000
shit?
And you know,

573
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,600
it was just the most ridiculous shit and
really fucking funny.

574
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,400
All of a sudden I outta nowhere

575
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,150
he was,
he was inspirational last night.

576
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,490
Like I watched him in the back.
I know Joey,

577
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,640
I know Joe really well.
Like I mean like,

578
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,920
but men,
I'll watch him and I was like,

579
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:36,770
that's the same voice.
You're doing the same voice.

580
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,080
You call me on the phone with his 
onstage and you're not.

581
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:40,820
And I didn't feel like anything was a 
bit,

582
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,400
I felt like it was really morphed into 
him.

583
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,680
I was just uncle joey talking to your 
cock sock as well.

584
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,530
He's real dedicated right now.
You know,

585
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,640
he's,
he's out there huffing it every night.

586
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,710
He's putting in a lot of sets or dude,
he calls me up.

587
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,640
He goes,
Dude Ha.

588
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,523
And every fucking Wednesday night.
It's fucking five minutes from your 

589
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:56,030
house.
Cock sucker.

590
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,380
I'll pick you up.
I go there.

591
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,030
I went there last night.
It's amazing.

592
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,290
I did it.
I had a great time,

593
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:00,670
man.

594
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,860
Ron and the owners are so fucking cool.
Jack,

595
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,671
Jack,
really,

596
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,310
really juniors.
His son runs the Wednesday night workout

597
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,200
and it's just,
it was,

598
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,360
I mean,
I,

599
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm telling you,
man,

600
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,320
I you,
I've told you this,

601
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,050
we've had this conversation a lot.
I'll say it out loud.

602
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:15,884
Um,
I'm,

603
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,470
when you get back in to stand up.
Oh,

604
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:19,304
it's like,
it's like working out when you do you 

605
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:21,154
ever,
I don't know.

606
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,780
I'm not saying this only to joe now.
Right now you ever workout so much where

607
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,570
when you sit down and you can feel your 
abs tighten up,

608
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:27,800
you're like,
I feel good man.

609
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,720
I'm in good shape right now.
Like that's what,

610
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:32,860
when you're doing standup like that,
like all the fucking time you're back.

611
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,070
It's nice and tight.
Yeah.

612
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,290
And I'm in fucking hard core fucking 
standup mode.

613
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,430
Nice.
I love it,

614
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:42,440
man.
I love it so much.

615
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,490
But we were talking about this,
that you do that show so much that maybe

616
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:49,370
it's reached the point where the show 
was kind of getting in the way.

617
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,900
It's,
I didn't realize it.

618
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,580
And you had said that to me at one 
point.

619
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,280
You'd said a couple of things to me that
we're a little heavy that I couldn't,

620
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,250
that I couldn't wrap my head around.
And I think it was man,

621
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,411
no,
I think it was,

622
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:02,480
cause I wasn't doing standup.
I didn't understand what I was trying to

623
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:03,390
do.
But you,

624
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,140
you get into production mode.
Well what did I say that was heavy?

625
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,213
One thing you said,
the two things you said is he stopped 

626
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,250
doing that show.
You need to get back on stage.

627
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,730
You're too good of a comic to fucking 
not be doing standup like all the time.

628
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,713
And then the other thing you said was 
you've gotta be looking at this show 

629
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:18,260
you're doing and you need to be writing 
about this on stage.

630
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,540
The problem is I couldn't write about 
what I was doing.

631
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,493
I didn't know how to write about these 
activities because I wasn't a standup 

632
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,760
mode.
I was in production mode.

633
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,020
Right?
Like what times are called time?

634
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,560
What Time's the flight leaves?
How much time do we need?

635
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,503
Crazy.
You live such an adventurous life and 

636
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:34,190
yet you don't talk about it on stage and
you're all over the world.

637
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,340
Oh Dude.
I,

638
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,413
I just now,
just this past week and I'm gearing up 

639
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,050
to do my hour.
I got to say this before I forget.

640
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,143
Uh,
I am taping my hour special for 

641
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:46,920
showtime,
April 1st at the Irvine Improv.

642
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,990
If you'd like to get tickets,
you can go to my twitter feed.

643
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,123
You can get a link right there or go to 
the Irvine Improv two shows Friday 

644
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,490
night.
Um,

645
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,510
uh,
seven 30 and eight.

646
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,320
They have Lao half hour set,
seven 30 and eight.

647
00:26:59,370 --> 00:26:59,971
Oh,
I'm sorry.

648
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:00,241
No,
no,

649
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:00,751
no.
I'm sorry.

650
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:01,584
I'm,
I'm fucked up.

651
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,480
No,
seven 30 and 10 or whatever.

652
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:04,314
Seven 30 to 10.

653
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,930
That's a quick 10 minute special.
You're releasing your special on vine.

654
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,793
Yeah.
So go to go to the urban and probably 

655
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,890
get tickets because I'd like to sell it 
out.

656
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:16,800
I'd like to have a packed room and it's 
like a 500 seat or why wouldn't you like

657
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,190
to have an empty?
I'd like to,

658
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,390
I'd like to sell it out.
I would like to show to be successful,

659
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:25,890
so please laugh.
Oh fuck it.

660
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:26,724
Yeah.
They Irvine in probes this shit to the 

661
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,130
new places.
Really excellent.

662
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,500
Callen filmed his thing there.
Really?

663
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,363
Yeah,
it's great.

664
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,190
I opened for him.
It's a suite.

665
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,660
It's a real nice setup man.
It's,

666
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,050
it looks beautiful.
Yeah,

667
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,900
I've done it a couple of times on 
Tuesday too.

668
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,480
They were fun Tuesday night there.
I think I did a weekend there.

669
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:43,890
Wants to,
it's great.

670
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,650
Yeah.
The new Irvine Improv's fucking smoking.

671
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,770
It's perfect.
And I,

672
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,000
I kept looking at like,
I mean all these shows,

673
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,920
I mean so easy to see specials on 
Netflix,

674
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,113
but like everything looked for me,
looked a little cookie cutter where it 

675
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,470
was like everything was done,
like a certain type of thing.

676
00:27:58,471 --> 00:27:59,670
I was like,
I don't do theaters.

677
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,460
It makes sense that you are,
bill would do a theater show.

678
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,190
I don't know.
What do,

679
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,030
what do I ever do if I'm not doing 
theaters anymore for a specials?

680
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:06,820
I,
yeah,

681
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,653
she did theater theaters.
If I'm in a place like vegas or if I 

682
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,610
want to go to a town for one night,
we'll do it.

683
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,444
Theater.
But yeah.

684
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,323
Arenas,
nationals,

685
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,580
hockey arena with the ice.

686
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,930
No,
I can't skate at all man.

687
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,750
It would be a lot of shitty movement.
Who did you say that to us?

688
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,480
Action.
Bronson Action Bronson.

689
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,990
That is the funniest goddamn interview 
when you're docking and you just,

690
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:34,740
he's like talking like he's being,
he's totally action Bronson and that and

691
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:36,060
you just go,
I can't skate.

692
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,020
I laughed hysterically.
Fuck is serious.

693
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,010
Oh,
you're not skiing on Pluto.

694
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,620
We were so high during that interview.
It was so ridiculous.

695
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:48,720
And he kept going.
He smoked it like a cigarette.

696
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:49,620
Yeah,
he kept going.

697
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:50,454
He does that all day.
He's just constantly going here like a 

698
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,900
fucking,
like you ever see those when those Cuban

699
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,070
cigar rollers,
the role,

700
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:58,560
like there's fucking stack of the day.
Yeah.

701
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,270
That's what he had with him.
Like just stack of blunt.

702
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,163
He's,
I'm telling you that I've forgotten 19 

703
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,453
million things to talk to you about,
but like that Viceland I'm fucking 

704
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,460
fascinated.

705
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,110
Viceland is great.
The show's great.

706
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,190
His,
uh,

707
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,600
his show is excellent too.
Fuck,

708
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,490
that's delicious.
I watch that.

709
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,780
I found that at the beach one weekend 
and I watched all of them back.

710
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,230
Actually,
food shows are great,

711
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,940
but the way he does it,
it's real.

712
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,970
It's not,
it's not like I'm here at the dot,

713
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:24,451
dot,
dot,

714
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:25,080
dot,
dot.

715
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,370
And we're ready to,
you know,

716
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,690
I did that for when we did reshot birth 
to conquer.

717
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:32,850
And I'm not,
I'm not saying I stole from action,

718
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:33,900
John Bronson,
but like,

719
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,000
after watching enough content,
I was like,

720
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,520
I don't need the intros.
I don't need any of this shit.

721
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,010
Just give me the action.
Right.

722
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,943
So when we did birth,
it's not gonna air for a little maybe 

723
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:43,810
ever,
I don't know until June.

724
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,243
But,
uh,

725
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,250
it,
there's no intros.

726
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,770
None of that's just real.
And that's the way it,

727
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,040
that's the way content should be done.

728
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,020
Yeah.
Maybe a short introduction,

729
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,020
like staring at the camera like you 
would if your friends were there.

730
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,100
Yeah,
yeah.

731
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,400
Instead of this super polished 
professional thing,

732
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,903
I,
the problem with your show is it's a 

733
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,410
great show.
You love doing it,

734
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,840
but you take months away from stand up.
Yeah.

735
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,020
And that's,
that's just,

736
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,570
that's just too much for guys.
Funny as you,

737
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,920
it doesn't make any sense.
I don't think I saw that until I started

738
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,860
getting back on stage and going like,
oh fuck man.

739
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,694
You know what?
What happens when you don't do it all 

740
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,640
the time is you don't work on your 
jokes.

741
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,800
You don't take that bit,
you know,

742
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:28,120
like you can't,
yeah.

743
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,260
You just do it one time.
You're like,

744
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,280
it worked.
I'm good.

745
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,230
You Go,
the only way you could really do standup

746
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,113
is it do it all the time.
And to do it in front of audiences all 

747
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:35,200
the time.

748
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,400
Like that's how they,
the bits have to come together.

749
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,550
They can't do it on your own need.
People.

750
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,110
You gotta be in that zone.
I'm bill.

751
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:44,290
Bill and I,
Bill was talking to me about it.

752
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,480
Um,
and I had said something like,

753
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:47,290
man,
I gotta go,

754
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,180
I gotta go knock the rust off.
And I was like,

755
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,190
well,
what was I telling you on stage?

756
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:51,790
He's like,
last Sunday I went,

757
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:52,624
hold on.
I've spent like months off stage and he 

758
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:55,991
was like,
he was like,

759
00:30:55,991 --> 00:31:00,340
how can you do that once is rough.
If I take a week off,

760
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:01,930
I don't like it.
If I take two weeks off,

761
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:04,480
it feels like I can take a week off.
If I'm going on vacation,

762
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,351
I'll say,
okay,

763
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:08,950
I'm going on vacation.
I'm not thinking about shit when I go on

764
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:09,784
vacation.
I am making a concerted effort to just 

765
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:13,000
pay attention to entertainment.

766
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,093
Like,
like I watch movies or I'll read a book 

767
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,080
or,
uh,

768
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,913
maybe I'll check twitter real quick to 
see if anything wacky is going on the 

769
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,460
world.
And that's it.

770
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,320
Like very little,
very little.

771
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,780
I don't want to take anything.
I don't want to talk about business.

772
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,643
I don't give a fuck.
I just just want to hang out and chill 

773
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,200
so I can do that.
But when I'm like,

774
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:33,034
if I take a week off and I just haven't 
done stand up and then I get back on 

775
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,680
stage again,
I feel like I got to get the,

776
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
the engine cranking again.
Yeah.

777
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,730
So the longest I've ever taken off from 
surgery,

778
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,811
I think,
uh,

779
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:45,340
when I,
when I twisted my knee,

780
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:47,110
I took maybe a month off or something 
like that.

781
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,353
Yeah.
After acl surgery may be a little more 

782
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,520
than a month.
It gets weird.

783
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,013
It does.

784
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,640
And you lose money.
For me,

785
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:56,830
I ride a lot.
I read a lot and like onstage,

786
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,783
so I lose material.
So all those like tags and I lose like 

787
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:02,830
big chunks where I go one day,
I'm all of a sudden I'm like,

788
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,551
oh wait,
whatever happened.

789
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:04,384
That fucking joke.
Is it travel channel cool with you not 

790
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:08,860
doing that show or do they want to keep 
doing it?

791
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,670
Do you,
uh,

792
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,503
I don't know.
You're doing birth to conquer for them 

793
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:12,310
as well,
right?

794
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,230
Uh,
right now we're doing two shows,

795
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:15,064
but I'm not doing anything.
I was kind of understood I was going to 

796
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:17,824
take a little bit of a sabbatical right 
to focus on stand up and my agents were 

797
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:23,080
reached out and they're like,
you know,

798
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:25,090
technically I don't have to work all the
time.

799
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:27,520
I was just doing it because I wanted 
money when they were and they were like,

800
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:28,354
we're cool with just the base of the 
deal and then give him the time to do 

801
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:32,554
stand up.

802
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,390
And then I got back and stand up and I 
was like,

803
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,190
I started going like,
okay,

804
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:37,024
I can't,
I can't do the show the way I normally 

805
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:39,290
do.
I can't just go and go,

806
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,124
all right,
let's two weeks go to fucking 

807
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,530
Micronesia.
Right.

808
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,480
Like I was like,
I need to be,

809
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,760
I need to be on stage at every,
every week.

810
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,070
I need to and but for me,
you know,

811
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,790
the store at the store and like some of 
the smaller clubs,

812
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,240
I like doing an hour.
I like working the hour.

813
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,240
So I liked being in,
in a,

814
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,630
on the road fucking Thursday,
Friday,

815
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,463
Saturday.
Why don't you do a show if you're going 

816
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,010
to do a show for them,
a show that involved stand up.

817
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,030
I mean it's the damn travel channel.
How about you do a show where you go and

818
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:10,970
you do stand up on the road and then you
go out to places?

819
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,060
Sort of like a Dave attell used to have 
like insomniac.

820
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,380
Yeah,
that kind of a thing.

821
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,223
Just visiting places and then come up 
with shit to do and those places that 

822
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:20,300
you visit,
we may,

823
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,800
we can do both.
We made,

824
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,733
I don't need,
the network's changed direction so we 

825
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:25,490
don't know exactly what's going to 
happen with any,

826
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,970
anyone really except was really the,
I candidly,

827
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:29,804
I think everyone knows us,
but the network kind of did like a 

828
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:32,924
cleaning house and moved everyone to 
Knoxville and left Chevy Chase Maryland 

829
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,050
and there's a new president and the new 
Svp,

830
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,670
Knoxville,
Tennessee.

831
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,400
That's where scripts is headquartered.
Scripts.

832
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,940
Scripts owns travel channel.
They own diy.

833
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,990
Hobb used to know this shit.
You're saying that like,

834
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,570
no,
everyone knows this check.

835
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Come on.
Joe Didn't know the words out.

836
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,590
Scram word is this.
They'd been my boss for six years.

837
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:00,290
I can't imagine anyone doesn't.
You're such an industry guy,

838
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,600
but Knoxville,
Tennessee.

839
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,700
What the fuck is that place like?
I was pretty cool.

840
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,650
Yeah.
They,

841
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,483
the old colony club is right around the 
corner from where scripts headquarters 

842
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,090
is.
What comic comes down.

843
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,280
Oh,
it's broken down now.

844
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,810
It's like just some beat up and just got
the,

845
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:18,470
like the theoretically like the chuckle 
hut sig signature on the thing.

846
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,780
Is it not exist in any more that 
existed.

847
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:21,980
But man,
I gotta be honest with you.

848
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,160
If I had an extra chunk of change,
I'd fucking open it.

849
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:29,420
Cause I love those little box comedy 
clubs that,

850
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,670
you know,
like the punchline Atlanta.

851
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,563
Yeah.
Ponch on Atlanta was such a great 

852
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:34,920
fucking club.
Wait,

853
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,870
that's not open anymore.
No,

854
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,753
it's closed.
When under gene meet member Jamie from 

855
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:39,620
the punchline.

856
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,660
He's going to get me that piece of,
uh,

857
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,880
there was a piece of wallboard that 
says,

858
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,220
quit trying to be Hicks.
Yeah.

859
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,850
Somebody wrote it.
And graffiti.

860
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,460
I love that fucking thing.
I have a photo of that.

861
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

862
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,510
I always thought that was hilarious.
That was a great fucking club.

863
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,060
What took its place down there?
Well,

864
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,850
they had parking issues.
If you remember,

865
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,480
they always had parking issues and uh,
I don't know if they lost their lease.

866
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:04,640
I don't know what happened,
but I guess the reopening,

867
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,650
they're gonna open up a new one 
somewhere else.

868
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,100
If I'm not mistaken,
they might've already reopened.

869
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,963
Say,
gave me an offer for the weekend before 

870
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:12,344
my special and that's good.
But I think right now they're like in 

871
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:15,290
limbo.
Okay.

872
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,200
They have the laughing skull there too.
Great.

873
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,420
Is there this weekend?
Really?

874
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,290
Yeah.
Fitzsimmons is going there this weekend.

875
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,540
I don't think he's ever been there 
before.

876
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,160
We were talking to him about how awesome
it is.

877
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,520
And then there's,
um,

878
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,890
the Improv now,
right?

879
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,783
Yeah.
Probably supposed to be pretty good 

880
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:30,110
there too.
I've done that one too.

881
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:30,831
That's good.
As seats.

882
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:32,480
A lot more.
How many people?

883
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,790
A lot.
It's probably,

884
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,010
I'm probably three 20.
Okay.

885
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,510
He's out there.
Do a lot of big club's now.

886
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,560
Like,
um,

887
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,393
they're doing like the 500 cedars,
like those kind of like the new Irvine 

888
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:45,980
Improv is 500 plus seats.
Columbus.

889
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,950
Funnybone.
Yeah.

890
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,073
Funny Bone.
We're talking about that last night I'm 

891
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:53,850
doing a call and said to work show March
17th there I told you about these.

892
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,280
I go in and do radio.
I drink and then do like an 11:00

893
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,390
AM show.
Oh really?

894
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,150
They've sold out everywhere.
I've never had them not sell out.

895
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,460
So they're like,
they're funny shit,

896
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,623
but it's a,
it's like 11 to him showing everyone 

897
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:07,440
just calls in sick to work and get 
fucking blitzed.

898
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,450
So it's Saint Patty's Day.
It's true.

899
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,410
He's like it fucking insane.
They're insane.

900
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,540
What does your dad worried about with 
your lifestyle?

901
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,570
That's weird,
dude.

902
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,880
In the why you would be worried about 
your drink dialed in.

903
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:21,714
I got,
but I can lighten up my party and I 

904
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,320
don't party as hard as people think 
you're,

905
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,830
he's my canary now.
Like that's a perfect canary,

906
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,890
right?
I'm not,

907
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:30,750
I'm not anyone.
He doesn't smoke cigarettes.

908
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,370
Yeah,
it's true.

909
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,530
How much do you weigh right now?
Uh,

910
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:39,531
two oh seven six six five eight Oh,
you are?

911
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,131
Yeah.
Oh,

912
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,470
I thought you,
you're six foot six foot.

913
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,640
Yeah.
Perth's barely paying attention to you.

914
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,330
He's like,
he's over there somewhere.

915
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,340
You know that guy.
Well,

916
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,990
congrats on your weight loss.
Thanks man.

917
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:57,750
I mean it's two 28 January 1st so it's,
it's falling off.

918
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,043
Oh,
that's 96 November 30th and you two 55 

919
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,070
no,
two 30 really?

920
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,050
Would you do no bread?
Yeah.

921
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,033
That's a big no fucking bread.
Isn't that an amazing cut out bread and 

922
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,160
you will lose a lot of weight.
I mean,

923
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,390
and I've been having beer like it's not 
like carbs,

924
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,760
but just no fucking bread.
So crazy.

925
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,650
Have you ever thought about what it'd be
like if you cut it all out?

926
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,150
All carbs?
Yeah,

927
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,720
I think I'd be a boring as fuck.
Oh,

928
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,610
I think it'd be boring.
Just ay man.

929
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,390
Ay I read.
Makes you awesome.

930
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,540
No,
but I think the thing,

931
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,090
I think the thing about like the thing I
like about my personality,

932
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:37,290
well the thing I like about life I like 
about life is just going is,

933
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,420
is impulse.
I love impulse.

934
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,280
I love,
I love,

935
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,230
I know it's tough.
When you're on a diet,

936
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,290
you'd be shocked when you've been 
groomed on this lifestyle,

937
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,540
how often you just go to the fridge and 
open it.

938
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,670
Cause that's what mpulse provides is 
like how often you go to get a snack and

939
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,351
like wait,
oh fuck,

940
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,940
I can't snack like in.
So it's,

941
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,330
it's interesting to pull that part of 
your personality back.

942
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,580
Then the last part of my personality is 
like,

943
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,060
I don't know if like a good opportunity 
shows up and someone wants to do a shot,

944
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,923
I wanna be able to do a shot.
So like I think that cutting out all 

945
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,880
carbs together,
we'll just be tough for me.

946
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,640
What about just [inaudible] out beer and
just doing like vodka or something?

947
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:13,500
Cause this isn't a beer way worse for 
you then.

948
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,393
I did that.
I did that during this whole time I've 

949
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,430
cut out beer entirely,
but uh,

950
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,230
definitely a lot.
A lot of calories,

951
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,243
a lot of calories.
I was doing like I was kinda slow roll 

952
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:25,620
in wine mostly and then do a little 
rolling wine.

953
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:26,454
Yeah.
Is that another expression that I'm not 

954
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,790
aware of?
I see a slow wine roller.

955
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,730
Brian,
sometimes when I have a box of wine that

956
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:35,690
I carry rounds,
I'm a slow modeling wine is the

957
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,100
best inventions in the rooms as you buy 
it from Napa drive up there.

958
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,710
When I drink wine I would always drink 
like,

959
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,900
like as if it's a normal beverage.
Like it's,

960
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,450
so that's the best way to get drunk.
When we were doing so on,

961
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,160
but we were doing trip flip on the road,
uh,

962
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,990
the last season I was,
I was going through like a box of wine a

963
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:02,990
night and I was like,
why do we have any wine?

964
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,093
Do we see if we have any one young guy?
I was going through a box of wine at 

965
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:12,430
night and then I told my buddy Paul,
I go,

966
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,181
he goes,
I go,

967
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:14,350
man,
I gotta be honest with you.

968
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,990
A box of wine at night.
I think that's my,

969
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,980
that's my limit.
I will not,

970
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,110
I'm going to try to stay under that and 
I'll be healthy.

971
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,640
He goes to the store,
a lot of wine.

972
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,420
I go,
yeah,

973
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,700
like on paper.
And he goes to bottles is a lot.

974
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,290
They go,
these are two bottles.

975
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,153
Okay.
I think it's more than to wait the 

976
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,651
fucking minute.
You,

977
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,710
you really just said a box of wine at 
night.

978
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:36,544
It's not that much.
I hit was under the impression it was 

979
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:38,644
one bottle of wine.
So I'm sitting there going like bottle 

980
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:41,944
of wine by yourself.
You don't think that's a lot of alcohol 

981
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,050
and it's not a Bach one.
Ivanhoe.

982
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,740
I've had this conversation with doctor 
drew.

983
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,490
I don't see a bottle of wine.
There's a lot of alcohol.

984
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:52,324
Personally,
I've had this conversation with doctor 

985
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,580
because everyone always says the same 
thing.

986
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:59,770
You're fucking say prefacing it with 
that.

987
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,023
I look at wine,
there's a little differently then like 

988
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,530
unrealistic.
If you said,

989
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,393
if you said to me,
what would you rather have a 12 pack of 

990
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:08,471
beer,
uh,

991
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:13,210
bought a bottle of wine or a bottle of 
vodka I got by one's grown up.

992
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,043
You sit back.
Yeah,

993
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,480
maybe like one.
Yeah,

994
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,860
I like the flavor,
the taste,

995
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:20,950
but I can't imagine if I drank a bottle 
a day,

996
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,580
I wouldn't be freaking out.
This is a big conversation to have man.

997
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,910
Like people get upset if one person 
expects other people to be healthy.

998
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,883
You know,
you get upset if you try to impose your 

999
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,030
healthiness on them.
Like if people were working out and they

1000
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:38,920
have a friend that doesn't work out,
come on,

1001
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,230
let's get to the gym,
go to the gym.

1002
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,210
Me People don't want to hear that shit.
Never do.

1003
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,690
And it's a fine line.
You dance when you're on a podcast where

1004
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:50,170
you want to talk about like fitness and 
fitness goals you're doing and then give

1005
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:51,004
advice to friends.
Like maybe try like this because people 

1006
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:53,824
will get upset cause it,
we all know that we probably should be 

1007
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:02,020
eating better and we all like say one 
day I'm going to really fucking do this.

1008
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:02,883
One day I'm going to start blending 
vegetables in the morning and stop 

1009
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:08,170
eating honey nut cheerios with fucking 
chocolate milk.

1010
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,620
You know?
Listen gentlemen,

1011
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,020
anyone that is a fan of mine right now 
that listening to my podcast is,

1012
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,910
knows what back exactly what I'm going 
to tell you.

1013
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,590
Hello Gentlemen.
Cheers.

1014
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,223
By the way.
I can I tell you there's two different 

1015
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:21,844
kinds of boxes of wine typically,
and there's a smaller one and the more 

1016
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,064
normal one,
like their friend Xero or whatever it's 

1017
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:29,650
called.
Oh this is delicious.

1018
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,630
The smaller ones,
smaller bottling,

1019
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,190
the smaller ones,
four bottles of wine.

1020
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,390
The typical box of wine is six and two 
thirds of the bottles.

1021
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,130
I was on the road,
I was in Africa.

1022
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,103
I don't know what it was.
The road you were drinking four bottles 

1023
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:44,211
of wine at night?
No,

1024
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,490
it wasn't drinking four bottles.
I don't look like a pirate.

1025
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,950
The other thing I'll say is that I 
drink,

1026
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,560
usually when I have my bottle of wine,
I have it on the treadmill.

1027
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,110
So what the fuck did you just say?
I drink.

1028
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,510
You drink a bottle of wine while you're 
on the treadmill?

1029
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,320
Yeah.
All right bro.

1030
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,550
You need to go to someone.
Know this.

1031
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,603
Listen,
you can't drink wine on the fucking 

1032
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:05,900
treadmill because it's you smoked pot 
and go to Jujitsu.

1033
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,550
That is a totally different thing.
Leaning Bullshit.

1034
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:10,384
Why?
Same Bullshit.

1035
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,540
Cause it does.
First of all,

1036
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,390
it's not alcohol.
Alcohol is bad for your body.

1037
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:15,224
Marijuana is not bad for your body.
In fact it's an anti inflammatory but 

1038
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,004
it's cardio.
You're smoking and then what any effect 

1039
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:21,620
in your cardio.
In fact,

1040
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,480
it probably has a positive benefit.
In fact,

1041
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:24,314
ultra marathon runner smoke pot,
they smoke pot and eat pot and there's 

1042
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:28,730
been studies that have been done 
recently.

1043
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,840
There's Bert,
oh my drinking a beer on the treadmill.

1044
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,130
There's basic study,
find that and by the way,

1045
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:37,520
beer not a bad thing to drink after you 
work out a beer.

1046
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,354
It replenishes the body with glycogen 
according to some people because the 

1047
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:42,374
alcohol and the hops,
like some people say that after a nice 

1048
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:47,210
workout.
A beer is not a bad thing to have.

1049
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,490
Lance Armstrong said that on your 
podcast did it?

1050
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,370
They used to drink beer.
They used to drink beer.

1051
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:54,640
That was their steroid back in the 20s 
or the front.

1052
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,483
So the tour de France wine too.
They just say get fucked up cause they 

1053
00:42:57,981 --> 00:42:59,870
were sore and in pain all to know it 
was,

1054
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,610
it was,
it was.

1055
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,080
It would lower your blood it within your
blood out so you could,

1056
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,940
it was like a dopamine.
It was the same thing as doping.

1057
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,953
Theoretically it was low grade doping if
I'm not mistaken because I was really 

1058
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:09,020
fascinating.

1059
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,640
Your blood out dude.
You want to do the opposite.

1060
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:13,040
You want to thicken it a yeah,
maybe I was wrong.

1061
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,820
Yeah,
you definitely don't want to think blood

1062
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,110
out like you don't want to be 
dehydrated.

1063
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:20,630
You want to be extra hydrated.
It's just the opposite.

1064
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,550
For me,
it was a way to drink,

1065
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:25,100
relax at the end of the night,
watch some TV,

1066
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,810
get on my treadmill,
listen to a podcast,

1067
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,430
put on Youtube and get on the treadmill 
and just kinda walk in a four and have a

1068
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:32,300
bottle of wine.
Well listen,

1069
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,163
it's way better than not walking on the 
treadmill and just drinking the bottle 

1070
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:36,231
of wine.
Okay.

1071
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:38,000
Then we can agree to disagree.
Yeah.

1072
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,810
I mean I think it's way better than not 
doing the treadmill.

1073
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,470
Yeah,
for sure.

1074
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,740
But lets a lot of wine.
I'm not drinking it every single night.

1075
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,090
How many nights a week?
Five.

1076
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,120
This is feels like an intervention,
but honestly,

1077
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:51,560
how many nights a week did I drink wine?

1078
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,490
Yeah.
Well,

1079
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:54,240
right now it's bad because I'm on the 
road.

1080
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:58,550
So it would just be Thursday,
Wednesday,

1081
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,550
Thursday,
Friday,

1082
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,383
Saturday,
those nights he drank several bottles 

1083
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:01,131
of,
no,

1084
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:01,431
no,
no,

1085
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:03,320
but I'm doing standup.
So I go on the stage.

1086
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:05,340
I have a cocktail.
It's,

1087
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,193
I'm not as dialed in as like,
I'm never going to be able to just tell 

1088
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,090
you I have one bottle.
I'm not like a housewife.

1089
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,410
I might have one bottle of wine at 
night.

1090
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,420
I was like,
I'm on the road all the time.

1091
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:18,290
So like I'll drink on the road sometimes
and when I'm home I don't drink,

1092
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:20,100
but I was like,
I didn't drink last.

1093
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,500
Oh,
I drank a little bit last night,

1094
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,690
but it just seems like a stunning 
number.

1095
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,913
Four bottles of wine at night,
if that's the same size boxes he's 

1096
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:28,274
talking about that and your blood sugar 
must be out of control from all that 

1097
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:31,920
wine,
blood sugar,

1098
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,770
uh,
is,

1099
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,740
it's probably a little out of sync 
because I noticed that,

1100
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,563
I noticed that if I have like a cup of 
coffee the next morning I start firing 

1101
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:43,890
real hot.
Like almost like mannequins.

1102
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:44,724
It's pretty awesome.
You write really good when your blood 

1103
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,910
sugar spiking?
I do.

1104
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,910
Can we just talk about Stan hope you can
talk about anything but the fact that it

1105
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:00,690
makes you uncomfortable talking about 
your wine consent rights.

1106
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,270
Yes.
I Dunno.

1107
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,710
We'd love you.
We want you to be healthy.

1108
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,450
I'm dude,
I've lost a ton of weight.

1109
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:09,840
My blood pressure is great.
I'm doing a lot better than I was doing.

1110
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,580
So like I'm,
I'm on the right path.

1111
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:12,414
Do you think that doing this travel 
channel show where you're constantly on 

1112
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:16,110
the road all the time,
it makes it worse?

1113
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,420
Yeah,
I would think of what,

1114
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,910
because you,
you don't really like flying either.

1115
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:22,590
She liked to get liquored up before 
flights.

1116
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:23,483
Yeah.
Yeah.

1117
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,890
And so those flights to Vietnam were 
pretty tough.

1118
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,913
I wish that I was,
I wish there was a guy that could eat 

1119
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,530
pills,
but I'm not that guy.

1120
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,320
I heard Vietnam is awesome.
That's Anthony Bourdain's favorite place

1121
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:35,580
to visit.
Amazing.

1122
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,490
Yeah.
And I'll say this to anyone listening.

1123
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:40,463
If you got 13 friends and you guys want 
to have an amazing fucking week of your 

1124
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:45,444
life,
take coach seats to Vietnam cheap and 

1125
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:53,070
just go to how long bay?
Get a junk boat and just go round.

1126
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:53,963
It is,
it's super inexpensive to build a junk 

1127
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:59,430
boat and they're beautiful.
They're fully captained and staff.

1128
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:00,264
Do you have your own chef?
And they should change the name of junk 

1129
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:05,060
boat if it's that nice.
I know they're beautiful talking.

1130
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,913
Just like pull up a pit pit.
Just type in Vietnamese junk boat and 

1131
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,680
you'll see they're gorgeous.
They're gorgeous.

1132
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:11,514
All teak.
Like they sleep 13 and it was $800 a 

1133
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:15,660
night.

1134
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,000
How many ex pats are there?
Uh,

1135
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,650
uh,
a few.

1136
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,531
A bunch.
I would say.

1137
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:23,010
I think you could do a show.
A standup show.

1138
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,970
Oh yeah,
100%.

1139
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,390
100%.
That's the Junco dude look like a pirate

1140
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:28,500
ship.
And that is crazy.

1141
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,210
Game of thrones ship 800 bucks a night.
And that's how long bay,

1142
00:46:31,211 --> 00:46:32,430
but he's in right there.
Wait a minute.

1143
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,293
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1144
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,880
That's 800 bucks a night for everyone on
board.

1145
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,440
Nope.
Just one.

1146
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,780
Just for everyone's asleep.
Star slept 13 it was $800 a night.

1147
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,710
It's 800 bucks combine.
Yup.

1148
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,240
That's insane.
Joe.

1149
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:48,990
That that includes food and all crew.
How safe is it?

1150
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,030
100% say if it's a bay,
it's not,

1151
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:54,030
you're not going,
it's just all cliffs and mountains.

1152
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:55,620
It's really gorgeous.
Wow.

1153
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,600
And what is crime like in Vietnam?
Oh,

1154
00:46:57,601 --> 00:46:58,740
it's up there.
Yeah.

1155
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,613
Yeah.
Like you don't go out late at night and 

1156
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:01,770
I know you don't like,
you know,

1157
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:05,100
just the thing about Vietnam that I 
witnessed her,

1158
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:08,730
I experienced was that like if you get 
in a fight with one Vietnamese dude,

1159
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,100
hundred Vietnamese guys were jumping on 
top of you.

1160
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,690
Like that was the who got in a fight,
one of the x,

1161
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,890
one of the ex pats that was running.
One of the things we did,

1162
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,180
he said,
I was like,

1163
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:19,620
I wanted to go and get these egg 
sandwiches,

1164
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:20,454
have these great egg sandwiches,
did the most amazing sandwiches I've 

1165
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:24,420
ever had.
And I was like,

1166
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:25,830
I'm going to go run out.
I'm going to get 10 of them.

1167
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,060
And he goes,
well bring someone with you.

1168
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:28,603
Well cause it was like,
they're like 50 cents each and the lady 

1169
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:31,510
makes them in like a home,
like a hot dog cart.

1170
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:32,800
And she made it.
Dude,

1171
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,570
they're the best.
And I have my whole crew with me so I'll

1172
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:35,480
get them for everyone.
Oh,

1173
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:36,970
okay.
What was in them?

1174
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,260
Uh,
egg,

1175
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,920
shredded pork and uh,
I don't think cheese,

1176
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:44,620
no cheese because Vietnamese don't 
really fuck around with cheese.

1177
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,800
With a hot sauce.
Yeah.

1178
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,673
I don't think there was cheese,
but the eggs were cooked perfectly and 

1179
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:49,894
the,
the bread was so soft and flaky and it 

1180
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:52,684
was hollowed out and center.
So when the egg fell apart all it did 

1181
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:56,650
was just kind of melts into the bread.
So you had like,

1182
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,250
it was just the best sandwich I've ever 
had in my life.

1183
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:02,470
I think they're called [inaudible] and 
uh,

1184
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,160
I went out to go get 10 and the guy 
goes,

1185
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,650
bring someone with you.
And I was like,

1186
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,633
Oh,
I'm just going to go right across the 

1187
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:07,684
street.
And he's like,

1188
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:08,643
it doesn't matter if,
say if you get into some altercation 

1189
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:11,740
cause you cutting someone in front of 
someone in traffic.

1190
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,640
Like the big thing with traffic there is
you don't run across the street.

1191
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:16,863
You walk,
even if they're coming at you walk so 

1192
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:19,060
they can avoid you.

1193
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,940
You never change your pace.
So if you change your pace,

1194
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,100
that's how they hit you.
Oh Christ.

1195
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,181
Yeah.
And he's like,

1196
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:28,720
and if you do that and you get a fight,
you literally have 50 Vietnamese guys on

1197
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:29,920
you.
And he was like,

1198
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:30,850
and it,
it happens.

1199
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,530
And it happened to me like two weeks 
ago.

1200
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:35,020
I got in a fight with one guy and just,
I mean everyone,

1201
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:37,360
like store owners were dropping their 
aprons and jumping on this guy.

1202
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,620
He said,
whoa.

1203
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,180
So yeah,
but I don't think it's,

1204
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,220
I don't think it's crime ridden,
but it's not,

1205
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,113
it's not fucking Montana.
It's amazing how quickly they forgave 

1206
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:50,350
Americans.
They sort of just like,

1207
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:52,660
it probably didn't forget kids.
I don't know.

1208
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,120
I mean I don't think it's like Japanese.
Like,

1209
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:55,954
I think the older Japanese folks 
apparently just are still pretty pissed 

1210
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:00,814
off.
The ones that were alive when they 

1211
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,090
dropped the bombs.
Yeah,

1212
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,290
yeah.
I can see that.

1213
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,690
I can see that it's fairly reasonable.

1214
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,700
No Japanese,
it's,

1215
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:16,150
it's a very fascinating culture because 
they're,

1216
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,780
they're openly nationalistic,
you know,

1217
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:23,470
like you could say it's racist,
but it's openly nationalistic.

1218
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,050
Like they just like no white people.
They'll have bars,

1219
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:27,250
just no white people.
Oh,

1220
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,340
you can't come in.
Could you imagine if someone tried to do

1221
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,600
that in America?
You had to say no foreigner.

1222
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:35,080
She put up an like,
is that the Donald Trump America?

1223
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,460
Like they'll put up a no foreigners sign
in front of certain establishments.

1224
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,930
And some will argue that they have the 
right to do that.

1225
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,820
There's a drinking club,
uh,

1226
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,170
like a drinking club on once.
It's like,

1227
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,500
called the Soho Room or something.
It's on sunset,

1228
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:53,560
down near the argo.
What used to be the argyle,

1229
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,270
it's like a drinking club.
And they were like,

1230
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:56,110
hey,
we're setting a meeting,

1231
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,480
a general meeting with a this writer for
you.

1232
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:58,991
And I was like,
oh,

1233
00:49:58,991 --> 00:49:59,650
cool.

1234
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:00,610
And they're like,
you gotta be a member,

1235
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:04,570
he's a member and then he'll let you in.
But it's meant as members only and I was

1236
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:05,404
like,
oh cool.

1237
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,710
And I rolled up and my manager judy was 
there and I go,

1238
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:10,030
what are you doing here?
She was like,

1239
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:11,020
I'm in the meeting.
I was like,

1240
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:11,854
oh they let women in here cause I just 
to zoom that was this like old men's 

1241
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:17,410
only club.
She's like,

1242
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:19,120
what fucking world have you been living 
in it?

1243
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:20,920
You just shocked that they let women in 
and I was like,

1244
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,300
oh.
In my head I was like,

1245
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:24,220
well this please place doesn't seem as 
cool anymore.

1246
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,690
We shut it.
Let a man,

1247
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,980
is there a place where there's no

1248
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,590
place where they don't let women.
There's places where you don't let men.

1249
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,940
Those curves places,
those places where the older ladies like

1250
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:36,410
to work out.
I guess what is,

1251
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,520
it's overweight people,
right?

1252
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,413
Yeah.
Oh is it overweight people were all 

1253
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:41,290
women.
I think it's just all women.

1254
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,070
All women have curves.
There's places that are,

1255
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,840
is that if I,
am I getting the right name?

1256
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,120
Because there's places that are just all
women gyms.

1257
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:48,480
Is that what it's called?
It's called crow.

1258
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,360
You couldn't go there?
No,

1259
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,970
but you can never have a Dick Swinger's 
club.

1260
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,450
Like with only men.
Could you have an all men,

1261
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:57,200
Jim?
No.

1262
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,033
No one ever let you.
I think you could probably do that or 

1263
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:02,880
don't think you're good.
And I think the argument would be they,

1264
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,610
the argument they would make,
I'm not saying it's right,

1265
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:05,683
would be that women get sexually 
harassed and our gold at a regular gym 

1266
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:11,360
and they get uncomfortable and they 
don't,

1267
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,160
they don't want to have to deal with 
men.

1268
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:14,090
They just want to work out.

1269
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,880
They could probably add a bar,
have it called no broads or whatever and

1270
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:21,850
like just have like the line that most 
bars have where they're like,

1271
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,631
ah,
no,

1272
00:51:22,631 --> 00:51:24,430
we were only letting the women in 
tonight,

1273
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:26,020
you know?
And I say only lifting,

1274
00:51:26,021 --> 00:51:27,880
only let them in.
And they could probably easily do that.

1275
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:30,170
I don't think it's against the law.
I don't want him there.

1276
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,270
Very good.
No,

1277
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,460
I'm good.
I'll leave it over here.

1278
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:34,540
Brian.
Alternate Gloria.

1279
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:35,374
All right.
Would fucking come after you or one of 

1280
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:39,100
those well was a,
yeah,

1281
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:40,540
they can't,
they don't have anything like that.

1282
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,763
I grew up in a,
I feel like I grew up in a time when 

1283
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:46,300
you'd go to the men's locker room where 
the bar was,

1284
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,261
where they'd all,
all the men.

1285
00:51:47,261 --> 00:51:48,094
We'll play cards as a kid at like 
country clubs and you'd walk in and 

1286
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:52,414
you'd be like one day and then Saturday.
That was all taken away before I could 

1287
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:55,474
ever get there.

1288
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,820
There's no real place like a Bachelors 
Club,

1289
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,770
you know?
That's what pool halls used to be.

1290
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,320
Yeah.
Pool halls was like what?

1291
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,154
What,
what pool halls were at the turn of the 

1292
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,460
century in New York City.
It was like,

1293
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,513
and then a lot of places in the country 
where these places where young men who 

1294
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,260
didn't want family,
they wanted the bachelor life.

1295
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:19,580
They didn't want to have a nine to five 
job and know some square life.

1296
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,653
They wanted to have action and they 
wanted to gamble and they wanted to 

1297
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:23,924
drink and they wanted to stay together 
and just be men and they would go to 

1298
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:30,700
pool halls and they would gamble.
And pool halls were almost entirely,

1299
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,900
almost entirely revolved around 
gambling,

1300
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:34,003
which is a like a little known secret.
Like the game is called billiard pocket 

1301
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:39,164
billiards,
but it's called pool because you pool 

1302
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,020
your money together for a bet.

1303
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,580
That's the original name as the 
definition of the name pool.

1304
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,750
Really?
Yeah.

1305
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,700
So at the turn of the century in New 
York City,

1306
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:50,534
there was something like a thousand pool
halls and there was all these guys that 

1307
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:56,120
just didn't want to do it.
They didn't want to get married,

1308
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:59,360
they didn't want a nine five job.
They wanted to live the bachelor life.

1309
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,040
And today that's like disgraced.
If you want to be a bachelor,

1310
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,320
if you want to be a 50 year old guy and 
live by yourself,

1311
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:08,660
you never had kids and you don't have a 
regular job.

1312
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:11,420
You just said hang out in a pool hall.
The time you're a fucking loser.

1313
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,533
It's amazing.
But you could have the same amount of 

1314
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:15,644
money,
have a wife that you don't really like 

1315
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:18,620
being around,
you know,

1316
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:22,010
be trapped in some weird job and people 
think you're a winner.

1317
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,410
You know you'd have the same amount of 
money.

1318
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,303
It's like it's,
we have standards and one of the 

1319
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:30,690
standards is a bunch of men that don't 
want to be a part of society.

1320
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,130
You don't want to have a nine to five 
job,

1321
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,993
you better be some outdoor dude cause 
you know you've been a camper or 

1322
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:36,624
something.
If you wanna like get by and normal 

1323
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:42,180
conversation with people and tell them 
that you're,

1324
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,014
you're not married and you don't have a 
nine to five job and you don't really 

1325
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,760
care for that,
but you're 49 years old,

1326
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,590
you better have some reason.
Like he's,

1327
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:52,380
he's really eccentric.
He writes poetry and the woods like chef

1328
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:53,214
to have fucking something that you do 
that people consider like a noble quest 

1329
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,560
if you like.
You know what I like to do?

1330
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,630
I like smoking cigarettes or like 
drinking whiskey.

1331
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,160
I like being around my friends.
Sometimes I say open up money.

1332
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:05,100
I get a hooker.
People were like,

1333
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:07,860
what the fuck?
They'll get angry at you.

1334
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,700
He'll get angry.
Fucking loser is fucking,

1335
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,573
you want to be like this loser.
He doesn't have a family sleeps till 

1336
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:14,874
whenever he wants.
Hangs out with a bunch of guys and 

1337
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,390
laughs all night.
Fucking loser.

1338
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,753
I remember hearing someone right when I,
right before I fell in love with my 

1339
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:22,274
wife.
I remember seeing someone at the Improv 

1340
00:54:23,721 --> 00:54:25,040
going,
man,

1341
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:25,220
you know

1342
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,530
I want to be the old guy at the bar,
and I went.

1343
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,510
I was like,
Oh fuck.

1344
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,920
I was hanging out with ron white the 
other night.

1345
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:31,850
It was great.
Yeah.

1346
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,110
The old guy at the bar was awesome.

1347
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,600
Yes.
We had a couple of drinks.

1348
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:38,340
We had some labs.
What do you pull them up,

1349
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,174
Jamie?
What's going on?

1350
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,673
Breaking news club.
What about like a elk's lodge or at 

1351
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:46,030
nights at Columbus or even exist?
Yeah.

1352
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:46,861
Yeah,
they do.

1353
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:48,630
I've got an offer to be in one of those 
one time.

1354
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,220
Yeah,
but I mean is it all guys?

1355
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,590
Girls go like a Latin shriners,
they're called a fraternal groups.

1356
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:59,460
I mean fraternal means looking at that 
picture.

1357
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:00,294
I could tell how it smells in that room.
It would almost be fun to hang out with 

1358
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:06,300
those old guys.
Just hear them all.

1359
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:07,680
Drop end bombs nonstop.

1360
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,740
Me,
the fucking hat.

1361
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,200
Can we just agree when you become 60 
years old,

1362
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:15,034
you don't want to wear that stupid hat.
They're wearing a hat like a monkey 

1363
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:18,034
that's begging for change.
One of them on the monkey with the 

1364
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,123
grind.

1365
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,630
No,
they have the mother hat with the tassel

1366
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,730
little monkeys.
They always do that.

1367
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:28,680
Right?
Whatever happened to the Friar's club.

1368
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:32,400
Well it was a big thing in New York and 
it's a big thing with guys like,

1369
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,260
you know loves it.
He's like Jeff Ross loves it.

1370
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,410
Yeah,
I don't,

1371
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,573
I never got it.
It's Fitzsimmons used to like it in New 

1372
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,390
York.
They used to go there and play pool.

1373
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,383
It'd be cool if it was a,

1374
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,630
if they had like a,
if they had like a legit pool,

1375
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,523
you could play poker and know that there
was like a Thursday night poker game if 

1376
00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:47,254
you go to,

1377
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,173
well that was a lot of the things,
the same thing and a lot of ways his 

1378
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,020
guys looking to hang out with other guys
I was looking to be,

1379
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,380
this is a certain amount of society that
just demands circulate to you and having

1380
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,450
a regular job where you have to,
you know,

1381
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:05,710
and it's just when you have to wear a 
fucking tie and a suit,

1382
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,810
you're right away.
You're doing something.

1383
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:08,644
You don't want to do your dressing in a 
way that you would never dress if you 

1384
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:12,730
were just left to your own devices,
right?

1385
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:13,843
You've got a tie and a suit and a 
fucking one of those pockets scarf 

1386
00:56:15,911 --> 00:56:19,580
things and you have to go to work.
You can't swear and you're there all day

1387
00:56:19,581 --> 00:56:24,070
and your feet hurt because you get a 
wooden heel walking around a wooden heel

1388
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:24,904
and a fucking hard leather of soul,
like a stupid shoe that you have to 

1389
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:28,450
wear.

1390
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,940
And you've got a tie clip and you're 
fucking,

1391
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:31,774
you have to bullshit on the phone and 
you have to pretend to be someone that 

1392
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:34,804
you're not all day long.
That when you have to pretend to not be 

1393
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:45,010
a guy who likes pussy or not be a guy 
likes to party or swear or you,

1394
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:48,160
you have to like neuter yourself in a 
lot of ways.

1395
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,710
And in doing so over long periods of 
time,

1396
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:54,160
especially when you rewarded for that,
you're rewarded for it at work or you're

1397
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,110
exemplary conduct.
You know,

1398
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:58,330
he's got a great bedside manner.
He's got,

1399
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,820
he's got a wonderful office,
manners,

1400
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,621
you know,
you,

1401
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:04,570
you fucking slow.
It's slowly start to chip away at you.

1402
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,883
You still,
you start to slowly become something 

1403
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:08,764
that you're not really and you don't,
you don't get a chance to express 

1404
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:12,214
yourself and you get a few hours at the 
end of the day to have a couple of 

1405
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:15,874
drinks and go to sleep and do it all 
over again and you'll reset period that 

1406
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:20,620
you get over the weekend.
It's not enough time,

1407
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,183
dawn of time.
And if you had a year to be yourself 

1408
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:25,600
again and just be around your friends 
and you just,

1409
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,630
you guys could just behave and think the
way you really feel,

1410
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,613
laugh at shit.
You actually think it's funny but fuck 

1411
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:32,530
around with each other.

1412
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:33,740
That's been a comment.
Yeah,

1413
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,240
exactly.
I'll never forget,

1414
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:39,750
I'll never forget me,
you and owl and uh,

1415
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,760
we're sitting together talking about 
someone you're like,

1416
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:46,761
I can get that kind of suck my Dick and 
I'm me and laughed so fucking hard.

1417
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:50,630
And I just thought to myself,
I thought no one lives no like,

1418
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:54,330
because no one lives in that world that 
we live in,

1419
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,940
that we're all a little fucking toasty.
And you're like,

1420
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:57,774
I can get that kind of suck my Dick and,
and like you can you imagine saying 

1421
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,110
that?
What was the guy doing?

1422
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,400
Who was the guy?
Do you remember?

1423
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,420
Yeah.
Okay,

1424
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:08,640
we'll talk later.
I don't remember where it was.

1425
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,730
I love being able to say something 
totally retarded.

1426
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:12,564
Like to add to my friends.
Cause you like when like Joe Joey will 

1427
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:18,650
say like the most fucked up.
Like he'll say fucked up shit on it

1428
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,600
stage,
but he'll pull you aside,

1429
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,090
who pull you aside and say something

1430
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,190
unbelievably fucked up shit that makes 
you laugh.

1431
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,653
That was one of the things that he was 
doing while that fucking the whole cap 

1432
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:29,944
rule thing was going on.
I'm going to have you on your current 

1433
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,660
wife boss suck my Dick.

1434
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Yes.
She says dark.

1435
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:44,620
So crazy.
Did he air those still up like the rl,

1436
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:50,060
all those tweets and those are my,
those are some of my favorite calls.

1437
00:58:50,061 --> 00:58:52,130
When bonds calls me Tom,
he calls me and he's like,

1438
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,413
ah,
have you been following joeys twitter 

1439
00:58:55,041 --> 00:59:00,041
thread?
And like you literally are cleaning this

1440
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:01,911
sleep out of your,
I was like,

1441
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:03,200
hold on,
let me get it out of my computer.

1442
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:06,560
What's going on?
So fucking Tommy and Tommy,

1443
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:09,010
that's one of them are our biggest,
cause we,

1444
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:09,844
you know,
we started together doing the road 

1445
00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:13,090
together and one of the favorite things 
you,

1446
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,680
when you sit in the green room with the 
guys,

1447
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,630
just kind of bullshit.
I can bullshit with that guy forever.

1448
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,080
Forever.
He really is the best.

1449
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,360
Such a sweetie.
She's such a great guy.

1450
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,920
He's tall as is his wife.
She's awesome man.

1451
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,180
I'd might argue that she's funnier than 
him.

1452
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,940
She's pretty well.
He's fucking hilarious.

1453
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,760
He's funny.
He's funny in a way that I,

1454
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,860
this is why,
but he's like Joe,

1455
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:37,694
like Joey,
cause I remember watching Tom when he 

1456
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:41,630
just this,
you know Tom's hearing this so I know,

1457
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:42,464
you know I love you to death Tommy.
But like there was a time where tom an 

1458
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:45,321
oil,
he'll admit this,

1459
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:48,320
that he was trying to figure out how to 
do it like a towel and,

1460
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,273
and he would just be like,
like his pacing was off and then all of 

1461
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:52,094
a sudden something switched on him and 
he's telling stories where I can't find 

1462
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:57,500
out.
I don't see the setup punch,

1463
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,290
but I'm howling.
Fuck Tommy.

1464
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,730
They just fucking howling laughing at 
him and I'm like bucking.

1465
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,573
He is dialed in.
He is in the bees and the sweet spot of 

1466
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:08,000
his writing right now.

1467
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,810
Yeah,
he's awesome.

1468
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:12,230
What I was going to say was,
he's really fucking funny,

1469
01:00:12,231 --> 01:00:14,630
but I know what you're saying cause 
she's really fucking funny.

1470
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,310
She's hilarious.
She's really,

1471
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:17,144
and they have a kid now,
which is going to be really interesting 

1472
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:22,880
because once you have a kid you have a 
solid 20 minutes new material.

1473
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,953
It's just a matter of like covering over
the same ground that everybody else 

1474
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:26,534
covers over.
When you have a kid you have to Kinda 

1475
01:00:27,831 --> 01:00:32,240
like comb through your material and make
sure none of it has been done before.

1476
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,200
It's too as as really hard.
It's hard with like really common shared

1477
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:37,034
experiences that are transformative,
like having a kid or something happened 

1478
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:41,384
to you like guys who have cancer that a 
lot of times you have similar material 

1479
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,074
about getting cancer.
I remember Schimmel had a bunch of 

1480
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:51,461
cancer bits after he got back from a 
cancer airplanes dose.

1481
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:52,963
Those bits have been beaten down so much
that you almost have to have something 

1482
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:57,614
fucking catastrophic happened on a plane
for you to do a joke about being on a 

1483
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,290
plane.
It's like that subject matter,

1484
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,153
like people's eyes sort of glaze over if
you go over that because they've heard 

1485
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:12,560
playing jokes and travel jokes because 
comedians talk about what they do and if

1486
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:16,370
you only travel all the time,
you're doing shows and then traveling.

1487
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,443
So like the show,
no one's going to be able to relate to 

1488
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,750
that.
Like you're doing something weird,

1489
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,340
you're talking,
everybody listens.

1490
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:24,710
People pay for that.
What the fuck kind of job was at.

1491
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:28,250
That's just weird for people to relate 
to and that's for you.

1492
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:32,330
That's your job,
but your job is also to live because you

1493
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:35,780
have to have things to talk about.
When you get up there,

1494
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:39,050
your job is to Hashtag be curious,
you know,

1495
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,913
which is why I was saying to you,
it's kind of crazy that you have this 

1496
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:42,704
insane life,
like your life is one of the more 

1497
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:49,130
fascinating lives of all my friends 
because you travel everywhere.

1498
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,290
I fucking called him up one day.
I go,

1499
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,190
what are you doing man?
He's like,

1500
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,810
I'm on a moped in Vietnam.
I go,

1501
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,850
who the fuck can you call?
And they're on a moped in Vietnam.

1502
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:02,750
Like that's your life is crazy.
It's crazy in that way.

1503
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:03,973
You know it's talking about it on stage.
You're going to have so much material 

1504
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:10,430
meant once you,
if you stopped doing that show,

1505
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,264
if you decide and then you know you do 
this hour and then you go to make your 

1506
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:17,930
next hour and you start talking about 
just the crazy shit you've done.

1507
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,190
Oh my,
you have so much time.

1508
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,060
I mean I literally right now I'm looking
at this hour and I'm chunking it out and

1509
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:24,894
you know,
my youngest daughter is a very 

1510
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:28,770
interesting child so like I've got a 
whole chunk about her.

1511
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,300
I've got a middle chunk.
I'm in the,

1512
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:32,160
I'm on the fence about,
but it's just,

1513
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,330
it's fun stuff.
It's,

1514
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,970
it's good.
But then I just literally break to like,

1515
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:36,804
I fought a bear,
I got involved with a Russian mafia and 

1516
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:41,610
the net and I'm like,
just get rid of this chunk so I can go.

1517
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,980
I drank goat's blood with a messiah 
chief.

1518
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,220
I fucking had my first open water dive 
at 90 feet.

1519
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,950
I fucking jumped off the tallest strat.
I jumped off the stratosphere.

1520
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:53,640
I jumped off the like I literally would 
Mike Ready to get this hour out so I can

1521
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:55,620
just start writing.
But that's the,

1522
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:57,600
and that's,
I think I'm maybe,

1523
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:59,640
I'm lucky right now because I go,
I'm ready to,

1524
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,860
I'm ready to go on the road of figured 
the hour out.

1525
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:04,470
I don't need it to murder.
I need to figure it out.

1526
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,800
Well the the way to do that is like,
I think is doing these little short sets

1527
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:10,704
around town.
Yeah.

1528
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,263
Well you just go up and say for the next
15 minutes I'm going to talk about 

1529
01:03:14,851 --> 01:03:15,684
drinking blood with the Messiah chief 
and we'll fucking see what we can get 

1530
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:17,890
out of this.
Yeah,

1531
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:19,260
let's put it on your phone.
Cause I did,

1532
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,420
I just,
this last weekend,

1533
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,673
a long time ago,
I told you a story and passing and this 

1534
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:26,640
is how weird the podcasts are.
He said,

1535
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:28,380
I told you a story and passing that was 
a funny,

1536
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:30,360
I thought it was a funny story for me 
and you to talk about.

1537
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,990
And everyone loved it and they've always
chanted it out at my shows.

1538
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:34,824
I've never been able to tell it.
It's a story about flying dildos going 

1539
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:37,813
to the show.

1540
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,930
And I never,
it never worked.

1541
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,850
And I tried it on stage.
People go do it and I'd be like,

1542
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,601
well I'll do,
I'll do it,

1543
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:45,150
but it's not going to work cause it's a 
good room for us.

1544
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:49,080
But this last weekend someone yell just 
fucking talent.

1545
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,960
And so I told it and it worked and I 
figured out the ending.

1546
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,270
That's the best feeling in the world 
when you're like,

1547
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,250
okay,
now I've got my beginning,

1548
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:57,084
my middle of my ending,
now I've got to figure out that middle 

1549
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:01,470
guts and I can get through this.
Holy Shit.

1550
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,401
And then I'm like,
all right,

1551
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:04,230
let's get April 1st,
let's get this hour done.

1552
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,243
I'm ready to fucking write.
Like I'm ready to powerful Paul fucking 

1553
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:09,240
man.
Very excited.

1554
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,120
Eyes are wide,
very excited.

1555
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,260
I'm gonna stand up mode,
man.

1556
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,490
Good,
beautiful fuck.

1557
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,040
It's the greatest feeling in the world.
It's the reason you get into this.

1558
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,710
And then this business takes over 
somehow and says,

1559
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,960
now it doesn't.
You let it,

1560
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,420
you have to let it.
Don't let it take over.

1561
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,430
I ain't need money.
You know the feeling,

1562
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,780
but you make money.
I know,

1563
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,580
but money doing standup too.
Yeah.

1564
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:32,760
But I wasn't making money doing stand up
the way I'm making it now.

1565
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,470
Six years ago.
Mm.

1566
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,750
What about podcasts?
Do you have good ads and your podcasts?

1567
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,040
Make good money on my podcast.
I wouldn't say I make like what you were

1568
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,750
crawling make,
but like at all.

1569
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,540
But good money,
like a definitely good money.

1570
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,330
Like enough to pay for?
Uh,

1571
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,490
maybe a couple of cars.
Okay.

1572
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,100
I'm trying to guess.
I don't know what I dunno,

1573
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:58,180
like that's very specific,
very specific domestic cars.

1574
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,060
Uh,
fully loaded.

1575
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,430
Um,
uh,

1576
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:04,270
for this expedition in a [inaudible].

1577
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,813
So tell me about your stan hope trip is 
the best decision I ever made in my 

1578
01:05:10,141 --> 01:05:11,280
grownup life.
Yeah.

1579
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,170
Yep.
How would you do I just,

1580
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,320
what'd you decide?
I'd card set on podcasts with you.

1581
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:17,154
I'd said I wanted to go out there for 
the super bowl and it didn't work out 

1582
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,400
because I did a podcast with crawl on 
Monday and I wouldn't be able to make it

1583
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:23,440
back.
And I felt bad.

1584
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,790
I felt like I didn't get,
I was like,

1585
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,530
cause I really love,
I really love dog.

1586
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,210
I think he's one of the sweetest guys 
around.

1587
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,040
So I just called him up one day.
I go,

1588
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:33,250
hey you mind if I come out like just to 
hang out for a day and party.

1589
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,040
And he was like,
I'm fucking here,

1590
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:35,933
Lewis do it.
So I just tagged it on to one of my 

1591
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:41,320
trips and I did like,
I've been doing like theater,

1592
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:43,210
not theater but like a single club.

1593
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,740
Then weekend,
then single club.

1594
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:45,623
I just canceled the single club 
throughout to Doug's Chelsie picked me 

1595
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:49,120
up at the airport,
rolled in.

1596
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,940
Everyone's in the fun house drinking 
bingos in there.

1597
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,793
It's fucking amazing.
I think we podcasted for six hours 

1598
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,970
nonstop,
nonstop,

1599
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,430
unedited.
Ma.

1600
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,333
I'm telling you when I say the open,
my opus of podcasting is just me and 

1601
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,970
doug talking shit about everybody.
Just fucking tearing apart.

1602
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,740
Art terrapower Park,
good comedy,

1603
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,460
tearing apart life.
His Buddy Chad shanks there.

1604
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,303
Tash hilarious.
Doug's podcast is one of my favorite 

1605
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:15,604
ones to listen to because it's,
it is a real authentic extension of his 

1606
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:22,570
personality.
The same way this is for you.

1607
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:23,404
That is what you do.
When I first started listening to 

1608
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:25,294
podcasts,
I go,

1609
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,820
this is what Joe does.
He gets all nine at the end,

1610
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,440
the night smokes a joint and just 
research is most important.

1611
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,010
Shit it most crazy insane shit and now 
he's just telling us about it.

1612
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:33,963
Oh this is fucking amazing.
Oh now he's bringing the people that he 

1613
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:36,634
finds online.
He's bringing them in and having a 

1614
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:38,680
conversation with them.
This is great.

1615
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,753
This is Doug.
Just start drinking a four fucking vod 

1616
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:45,220
cause with a bartender and is fun.
Have you ever been out to his compound?

1617
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,090
Nope.
Oh,

1618
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,400
it's fucking amazing.
Hello.

1619
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:49,990
How far is it from the airport and the 
drive?

1620
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,990
About an hour and a half.
And he's Charlie's his tour manager.

1621
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,320
Would it bt to drive from la I think six
hours.

1622
01:06:56,321 --> 01:06:58,500
Six to eight from here.
60th his place.

1623
01:06:58,501 --> 01:06:59,590
Six to eight I think.
Yeah,

1624
01:06:59,591 --> 01:07:01,030
six days.
That's not bad.

1625
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:03,520
I typed in my address on accident and 
gave me directions.

1626
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,820
It's seven miles from the Mexico border.
We roll in.

1627
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:09,880
That's crazy.
And Doug is literally just,

1628
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,020
and you know man,
it's like,

1629
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:11,913
you know Douglas say this but like he 
doesn't get to hang out with comics 

1630
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,520
cause he lives in the middle of nowhere.

1631
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,530
So he rolled in,
he was in his pajamas,

1632
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,483
never changed out of his pajamas,
just smiling ear to ear and smoking a 

1633
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:23,470
cigarette and he's like,
oh what can I get you to drink?

1634
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,910
And literally off the bat we start 
podcasting and just catching up.

1635
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,820
I was fucking,
this is his fun house.

1636
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,100
So what is the fun house?
Why does he call it the fun?

1637
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,830
So he's got five think he's got four 
properties,

1638
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:38,920
four houses on this property.
He's got the main house,

1639
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,320
he's got the maybe as like seven,
I don't know.

1640
01:07:41,321 --> 01:07:42,154
But he's like,
there's a bunch of like trailers around 

1641
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:44,074
that people can live in.
And then he's got an a guest house that 

1642
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:46,714
I stayed in and he's got another house 
that Chalian his wife Tracy stay in and 

1643
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:53,110
their buys houses in the neighborhood.
They're like 35 grand.

1644
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,550
What?
They're like 35 grand.

1645
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,383
He just keeps buying them.
When the people bought the house for 35 

1646
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:58,300
grand going to Detroit.
You can buy.

1647
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,290
Just keeps by.
Yeah,

1648
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,540
but we're not talking about Detroit.
We're talking about Bisbee.

1649
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,790
He buys them.
Just keeps buying them and he's,

1650
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:08,260
and he's got corrugated metal fence.
Can't see over it.

1651
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,430
So it's all around 35 Grand Detroit and 
get it for like 500 right?

1652
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,313
Yeah,
but it's still busy in the middle of 

1653
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:15,190
nowhere.
No one wants to move there.

1654
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,160
Hold on,
hold on,

1655
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:17,090
hold on.
It's where you're wrong.

1656
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,010
I let me tell you something.
I shot a Vlog for this.

1657
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,431
You're like,
you know,

1658
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:22,190
I've been doing my blogs.
Why bring my camera out to do my Vlog?

1659
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,410
I liked how you say it cause nobody else
says it.

1660
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,870
Everybody else will write it,
but they don't say it.

1661
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,940
Oh really?
I never heard anybody saved blog.

1662
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,510
Am I saying it wrong?
No,

1663
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,000
you're saying that totally rocking it,
but it's something that people write.

1664
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,760
They write down,
you know,

1665
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:38,010
like Vlog for the day.
Nobody says it.

1666
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,910
Know what to call idea blog.
Right.

1667
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,833
Did you ever hear anybody saved Vlog?
Now Brian is as entrenched in the 

1668
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:46,460
culture.
I mean,

1669
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:48,230
it's probably the right thing to say.
I just never,

1670
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,353
I've seen it written.
I just never heard anybody say it other 

1671
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:52,780
than,
you know,

1672
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,320
he's addicted to vlogs.
I found out he just want,

1673
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:58,220
knows all of the youtubers.
But I had shaylee bring me into,

1674
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,840
uh,
into Bisbee and I shot,

1675
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,510
I shot b roll of busy.
It's beautiful.

1676
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,220
Really beautiful.
Right,

1677
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,373

1678
01:09:06,831 --> 01:09:07,664
kick,
how corollas went to tombstone rolled 

1679
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:11,330
in.
And Man,

1680
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,050
it ended.
I have a vlog out posted.

1681
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,620
I have to edit it.
This is a cave for sale out there.

1682
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,800
I met the two people that live in it.
So Dope House man.

1683
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,640
Uh,

1687
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,680

And I told Doug,

1688
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:28,514
I said,
you need to have more people come out 

1689
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:31,850
here and do this because it was so fun,

1690
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:34,760
It was so fun.
Like we,

1691
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,220
we were,
we ended up just singing at the end,

1692
01:09:37,221 --> 01:09:40,640
just partying and singing songs and,
oh,

1693
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,490

And Yeah.

1694
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:44,360
And so that podcast right now,

so I'm not sharing cave house.

1699
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:55,610
Is this the cave house in Bisbee?
Look at this.

1700
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,170
Oh,
though I didn't meet these people then.

1701
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,330
Oh,
hello.

1702
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,810
Hey Katherine Clark.
This is my home.

1703
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,690
You that gate.
Oh,

1704
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,370
so it's dug into the side of the house.
Yeah.

1705
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:10,030
Is this the same place?
This is in Bisbee Jamie.

1706
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:11,210
Yeah.
Wow.

1707
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,433
Look at that.
It's got a dope fucking little forest 

1708
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,613
behind it.
And this waterfall and shit did that 

1709
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:19,610
does not what Doug's compound.
It looks like.

1710
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,460
This is awesome.
If I moved to Bisbee,

1711
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:24,710
I'd buy this for me.
I kept saying to myself,

1712
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:27,500
they've got a theater in there that doug
does.

1713
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:29,330
This is nuts.
Look at this.

1714
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,660
These people have,
oh my God,

1715
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,000
that's gonna be so cool as fucking 
house.

1716
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,171
If it's like,
yeah,

1717
01:10:36,171 --> 01:10:37,310
right.
Why cold?

1718
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,080
Cause you're going to cave in Mexico.
I know,

1719
01:10:39,081 --> 01:10:40,010
but it's,
it's cave.

1720
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:42,590
It's rockets or hot down there.
It's the desert.

1721
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,840
You think that's hot in their old?
Yeah.

1722
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:45,913
Oh,
I think being in the cable be cold no 

1723
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:47,990
matter where you are.
Cooler,

1724
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,100
right?
Yeah.

1725
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,610
But still it's 140 degrees outside.
It's not cool in there.

1726
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,600
It might be.
If it's like a base,

1727
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:57,440
the house is fucking bad ass.
I want to live there,

1728
01:10:57,441 --> 01:10:58,274
man.
I bet you'd get it for 125 I bet you 

1729
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:01,124
couldn't.
I bet that house has at least a million 

1730
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,180
bucks.
1.5

1731
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:06,560
million.
Is that what it says?

1732
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:07,850
Hello?
By the way,

1733
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:09,350
I'm looking at 1.5
million of these days.

1734
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:11,300
It doesn't look like that.
Yeah.

1735
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,470
Right.
So no 1.5

1736
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:14,100
million gets you

1737
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,410
in La.
His who?

1738
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,280
A regular house.
Three bedroom.

1739
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:18,000
Three bath.
Yeah.

1740
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,260
Isn't it crazy?
When we were kids,

1741
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:23,100
he thought of someone who had $1 million
is being like the most unbelievably rich

1742
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:23,934
set for life.
And then you hear someone's house cost 

1743
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:27,360
$1 million.
You're like Holy Shit.

1744
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:28,930
Million Dollars.
Yeah.

1745
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:31,410
And then you look at what $1 million 
buys you in La and you're like,

1746
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,740
what?
Yeah.

1747
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:34,710
How about,
what would it buys you in New York City?

1748
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,240
You're,
we'll look at that.

1749
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,740
No.
Oh my God.

1750
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,490
The missus and I looked at fucking 
apartments in New York City at one point

1751
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:42,780
in time,
just on a whim,

1752
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:44,700
man.
I just get these ideas in my head like I

1753
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:47,100
don't want to live in the same place 
forever.

1754
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:47,934
I like to move around and I'm thinking 
maybe I should buy an apartment in New 

1755
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,203
York.
We'll just try living in New York for a 

1756
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:52,843
few months,

1757
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,690
so like 5 million bucks for like a 1600

1758
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,040
square foot apartment.
I was like,

1759
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:00,570
this is nuts.
I got,

1760
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:01,423
I got back probably larger than that,
but I got back from Doug's and went 

1761
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:04,884
right back,
right back with my wife and her best 

1762
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:07,560
friend,
her buddy,

1763
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,860
her husband's a movie guy.
He's got money and they were like,

1764
01:12:10,861 --> 01:12:15,270
let's get a compound compound.
Where would you do it though?

1765
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,240
I'm being dead serious.
I could totally do it in Bisbee,

1766
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,120
but would you want to do in Brisbane?
I don't,

1767
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,590
I wouldn't want to.
I'd like to do it with it.

1768
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,910
With some fan.
Do you want to be that close to Mexico?

1769
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,330
I would like to do it maybe in like in 
like Montana,

1770
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,580
Alabama,
Georgia,

1771
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,790
Montana.
Now you're talking like Colorado

1772
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:37,150
Cock,
Colorado Cock Cock Colorado.

1773
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,713
I slow rolled that one.
Colorado will be tough I think because 

1774
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:42,570
of the elements.
Oh,

1775
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,290
don't be a pussy.
It's all white people.

1776
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,670
What are you talking about?
What elements?

1777
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,140
You're talking about black people.
I remember that.

1778
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,850
Yeah.
Remember that Brian in Atlanta,

1779
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:49,953
we're in Atlanta.
We're talking to this racist white girl 

1780
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,650
and she,
she was like,

1781
01:12:53,651 --> 01:12:55,810
well you don't want to go to that club.
I go,

1782
01:12:55,811 --> 01:12:56,381
why?
She goes,

1783
01:12:56,381 --> 01:12:57,214
well,
you know the elements like the hangout 

1784
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,690
there.
What?

1785
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,800
What the fuck?
What the fuck to say?

1786
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,750
The elements.
So we looked at each other.

1787
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:08,410
I could hold the hell.
What does that even mean?

1788
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,570
But we both kind of knew what shoes I 
go.

1789
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,370
Explain yourself.
What are you saying?

1790
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,070
She's like,
well,

1791
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,490
black people,
no shot.

1792
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:16,570
Oh,
the elements.

1793
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,870
The elements like fucking earth,
wind and fire.

1794
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,313
The element.
It's so weird when you said elements 

1795
01:13:25,061 --> 01:13:25,570
too.
I'm like,

1796
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,900
wait a second.
I can't believe you just said that.

1797
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:28,830
You remember?
Yeah.

1798
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:29,703
You remember that girl?
She was way out in the open with their 

1799
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:32,710
racism.
She's like,

1800
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:34,550
y'all are,
why come on,

1801
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:37,270
you know,
he know about the elements.

1802
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,970
Y'All don't wanna be around the 
elements,

1803
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,380
especially when it gets dark out.
You can't see who trump.

1804
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,470
Did you watch that video?
Yeah.

1805
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:48,600
Dirt or whatever.
What is he the,

1806
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:52,210
the daily show video where it shows that
nothing.

1807
01:13:52,211 --> 01:13:53,570
None of you saw this.
No,

1808
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,030
no.
I'll keep going.

1809
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:57,580
But everybody's saying that word drunk.
Drunk,

1810
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,520
but I didn't know what it meant.
It's a,

1811
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:01,690
it's this guy who's,
I was not the daily show,

1812
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:03,510
but it's the other guy.
Uh,

1813
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,590
John Oliver.
John Oliver did a breakdown,

1814
01:14:05,591 --> 01:14:06,424
a Donald Trump the other day on his show
and it was one of the most beautiful 

1815
01:14:09,431 --> 01:14:10,510
things ever.
It was.

1816
01:14:10,511 --> 01:14:12,130
So they found

1817
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:16,390
out that hit like trump's real name,
like his great grandfather changed it to

1818
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:17,330
trump.
Uh,

1819
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:20,770
but it was originally drum for whatever 
dirt or whatever it was.

1820
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,700
Cough.
Yeah.

1821
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Trump's not bad.
What's wrong with drums?

1822
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:25,810

Doug's talked about it and they just 
released the second podcast dealing with

1844
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:15,760
this.
I think they found Bingo.

1845
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:16,923
So,
uh,

1846
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:21,990
so Bingo is Doug's wife,

1849
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,630

1850
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,290
She gets him at six 30 and like combat

She drives me to the airport and then 

1853
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,810
like halfway through she says,
uh,

1854
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,870
I'm running away.
And I was like,

1855
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,030
I'm fucking hung over shit.
I'm like,

1856
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:47,350
I don't know how to deal with this 
information.

1857
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:48,723
And I'm like,

1858
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:50,944

1859

1860
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:53,950
Yeah.
Succumbed Syndrome.

1861
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:54,843
So bingo started,
started dating some guy that lives in 

1862
01:15:58,331 --> 01:16:00,240
the woods.
I heard about all this.

1863
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,200
Yeah.
And so it's got an outhouse.

1864
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,070
Outhouses.
One for his bird is owls.

1865
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:06,690
Yeah.
Guide.

1866
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,320
And so,

1867
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,600
she's like,
don't tell Doug,

1868
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:11,050
don't tell Shaylee.
Don't tell anyone.

1869
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,160
I'm just disappearing.
Obviously you didn't abide by that fuck.

1870
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,170
No,
I was called Doug immediately.

1871
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:18,400
I was like,
I woke him up.

1872
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:19,600
I was like,
Bingo.

1873
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:21,280
Ran Away.
And so like,

1874
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,630
it was,
it was pretty serious.

1875
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:25,120
I think it was [inaudible] with Doug.
Everything's,

1876
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:27,370
there's a joke,
like everything is lighthearted.

1877
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,233
What,
did you ever listen to the podcast with 

1878
01:16:29,111 --> 01:16:33,160
him and her when she was talking about 
ending ending this thing,

1879
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,870
this experience called life?
Yeah,

1880
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:36,310
that's why I called Doug.
I was like,

1881
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,840
I was like,
I can't let this.

1882
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,711
She's like,
just,

1883
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:39,550
just don't tell dog.

1884
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:40,840
Don't tell anyone.
I appreciate it.

1885
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,900
Give me a big hug.
Got It all on my blog.

1886
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,390

1887
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:49,030
I'm not fucking problem.
Not that would never share anything like

1888
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:51,250
that.
I saw I got to sing as tearful.

1889
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:52,180
Goodbye.
Cause I was like,

1890
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,223
in my head I'm like,
I don't know how this is going to end 

1891
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:56,560
for Bingo because I know that she says 
that.

1892
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,200
So I called Doug immediately wake him up
and I was like,

1893
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,160
Bingo.
Ran Away.

1894
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:01,563
He was like,
what?

1895
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,480
He knew she ran away halfway through in 
the ride because he's like,

1896
01:17:04,481 --> 01:17:05,314
hey,
you left your phone and you took 

1897
01:17:06,341 --> 01:17:10,130
blankets.
And then she was like,

1898
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,750
cause he called me on my phone and he 
was,

1899
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,970
and she was like,
yeah,

1900
01:17:12,971 --> 01:17:13,261
yeah,
yeah.

1901
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,810
I thought burt wanted to sleep in the 
car halfway through.

1902
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:15,171
I'm like,
oh,

1903
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:17,360
I could sleep in this fucking car.
Like I should have gone to sleep.

1904
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:20,690
And then I looked back,
I see coolers and like all gear,

1905
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,670
like it's all packed and my bags and I'm
like,

1906
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,620
fuck.
So I called Doug Call Shaylee.

1907
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,250
So then Doug,
I say that I told some secrets,

1908
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:30,650
maybe that shouldn't have said to doug,
but one of the things mango,

1909
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,513
say she wanted this guy and doug to kind
of meet and figure out what she should 

1910
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:36,350
do.
So it was like,

1911
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,120
she wants you to podcast and do it

1912
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,151

Whoa,

1913
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:39,551

1916
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:48,000

So wow.

1917
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,350
So strong psych meds.

1918
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,453
So I tell Doug and so literally he calls
me like as at my plane lands and he's 

1919
01:17:55,141 --> 01:17:56,430
like,
we're podcasting right now.

1920
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:57,953
So that podcast just got released 
yesterday and I think th just texted me 

1921
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,444
the new podcast.
We're bingo calls in I guess just got 

1922
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:09,770
released right now.
No,

1923
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:11,580
they're not.
Just some dude.

1924
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:14,910
I know hall somewhere.
I sat in the car with her man.

1925
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,970
Oh there's so many.
Uh,

1926
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,030
it's,
it's uh,

1927
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,080
it was intense,
but you know,

1928
01:18:19,081 --> 01:18:22,440
doug takes everything was such a pace.
Such like a Lego.

1929
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:24,570
Yeah.
Well fuck it.

1930
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,280
I'll bring bath,
tub willie in his,

1931
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:29,310
what he calls him and I'll do a podcast 
with bath tub willie.

1932
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:30,680
Yeah.
And I told Doug,

1933
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:31,510
I go,
hey dude,

1934
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:34,310
don't say that anything opening of the 
podcast is so cries.

1935
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:36,300
Your calls me,
tells me Bingo ran away.

1936
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,770
So a,
that

1937
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:41,900
pizza.
So sad.

1938
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:44,420
When you see someone who you in your 
mind,

1939
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,230
like you have the memory of them being 
like real happy.

1940
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:49,603
Like when I think of Bingo,
I think of Bingo hanging out with doug 

1941
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,770
at shows and it's always,
we're laughing.

1942
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:55,640
We're all laughing.
Yeah.

1943
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,840
So that's my idea of Bingo.
So my idea of a depressed Bingo,

1944
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:01,910
it doesn't make any sense.
I don't,

1945
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,560
I don't have it in my,
my,

1946
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:06,590
my accessible memory,
you know what I mean?

1947
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,390
Like I've only seen her have a good 
time.

1948
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:09,224
I've only seen her having fun and we all
accepted there's ups and downs to being 

1949
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:14,893
a person.
There's like highs and lows and you 

1950
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:18,050
know,
you get in slumps and you feel like shit

1951
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:19,460
and then you come back and you feel 
great.

1952
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:22,670
And it's one of the reasons why you 
appreciate those really high spots cause

1953
01:19:22,671 --> 01:19:26,750
you remember when you didn't feel so 
good but you see someone like Bingo,

1954
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,673
like when she was hanging around with 
Doug and in my eyes it was always like 

1955
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,173
dogs.

1956
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:35,600
You got to let Doug Be Doug.
You know.

1957
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:39,860
And Doug's always had a problem with,
you know,

1958
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,053
when he was with other chicks there was 
always like some sort of a different 

1959
01:19:44,211 --> 01:19:49,211
kind of drama then like what Bingo 
presented being presented crazy.

1960
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,043
But she also presented like this 
willingness to like have fun and go 

1961
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:55,484
along with everything.
And it was perfect for like letting the 

1962
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:03,740
best parts of Doug just blossom because 
they were so cool together.

1963
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,240
Yeah.
And she's crazy.

1964
01:20:05,241 --> 01:20:08,580
She's got blue hair and half her head 
shaved and she's a mad woman.

1965
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:09,840
Right.
So it was like,

1966
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:11,430
this is great,
this is perfect.

1967
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,533
And it was always in my eyes.
All I remember is them smiling and 

1968
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:19,710
laughing.
So it's always weird to me.

1969
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:20,783
And even though rationally,
obviously I know that people have their 

1970
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:23,364
ups and downs.
When I remember someone who's like 

1971
01:20:25,771 --> 01:20:29,010
really happy and really laughing and you
know,

1972
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:30,300
like big open smile.

1973
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,380
Ah Ha ha.
You know,

1974
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:33,000
throwing her head back laughing.
That's,

1975
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:33,834
that's like the,
these are the thoughts that I have when 

1976
01:20:35,191 --> 01:20:37,260
I think about like her and doug hanging 
out at shows.

1977
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:39,140
I think how,
how,

1978
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,940
how does someone forget how to do that?
Like how do you,

1979
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:44,400
how do you stay in that pocket?
How do you,

1980
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:45,234
uh,
how do you stay as close to the fun all 

1981
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:51,450
the time.
Pocket is possible without slipping in.

1982
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,340
I mean,
is it a chemical thing?

1983
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:54,203
Is it a behavioral thing?
Is it a life circumstances and your 

1984
01:20:57,961 --> 01:21:00,390
reaction to it thing,
what it,

1985
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,060
what is it that brings those downers 
man,

1986
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:06,270
where people just feel like utter shit.

1987
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:09,210
Serotonin levels and I guess she has,
you know,

1988
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:10,044
issues.
So like medicine probably that she's 

1989
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:13,440
taking mixtures.
Look at brody,

1990
01:21:13,441 --> 01:21:15,320
he has ups and downs all the time.
It's,

1991
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:18,420
yeah,
and I mean I did so many people that I,

1992
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:21,450
that I ended up calling crazy almost to 
a point.

1993
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:22,980
It seems like it's,
but it's,

1994
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,300
you know,
it's,

1995
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,200
I feel like could be calling a woman 
crazy in the future.

1996
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:29,490
It's going to be the next tranny 
transgender.

1997
01:21:29,491 --> 01:21:31,320
Like it's like,
it's an alternative thinking,

1998
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:32,160
you know?
But it,

1999
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:35,970
I feel like I just nonstop and it's just
people,

2000
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,051
brains,
man.

2001
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:39,510
And people just,
they have ups and downs.

2002
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,460
I had fucking ups and downs,
you know,

2003
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:46,461
everyone has so many factors to right.
It's gotta be chemical man.

2004
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,000
Cool.
And then there's life,

2005
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,580
there's like the curve balls life throws
yet at you.

2006
01:21:51,581 --> 01:21:52,414
Like they're undeniable,
that great moments in your life where 

2007
01:21:54,521 --> 01:21:55,354
things are going great,
you fucking feel great and then what 

2008
01:21:57,491 --> 01:21:59,470
things are going shitty.
You feel shitty.

2009
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:00,483
That would kind of try to deny that 
there's some sort of a correlation 

2010
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:03,634
between those two.
But sometimes it's just shitty things 

2011
01:22:05,741 --> 01:22:06,880
happen.
You know,

2012
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:09,220
like Ari Shaffir just broke his ankle 
skin.

2013
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,230
That's just a shitty thing that 
happened.

2014
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:12,323
And I think the stick,
and I think we don't forget about him 

2015
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:14,491
either.
Like,

2016
01:22:14,491 --> 01:22:16,140
like,
like if you get in a relationship,

2017
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:18,120
you break up,
you feel like you got over it,

2018
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:21,210
but that still is something in you 
that's taxing that you don't even know.

2019
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:24,000
You've actually taken down a couple 
levels of happiness.

2020
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,590
She was something else.
Like your car,

2021
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:26,424
you get in a car accident that adds on 
to it and you don't even realize that 

2022
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:30,350
the ground,
that's what's the,

2023
01:22:30,351 --> 01:22:34,260
the level of happiness is getting pushed
down deeper and deeper almost.

2024
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:35,303
It's true.
The thing about a Bingo and doug that 

2025
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:40,440
really,
like when you were saying,

2026
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:41,521
it's like,
you know,

2027
01:22:41,521 --> 01:22:45,120
that's like a,
that's a really like a nuclear family.

2028
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:46,620
Like they try,
you know,

2029
01:22:46,621 --> 01:22:48,240
they travel and they all stay in one 
room.

2030
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:51,210
Fucking six people stay in one room.
That's not a good move.

2031
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:51,811
No,
but that's,

2032
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:52,471
but that,
you know,

2033
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:54,810
but like that's one of the beauties of 
Doug.

2034
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:55,644
I always,
I always,

2035
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,880
except I always look at other people is 
like always glass half full.

2036
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,620
That's the cool thing about doug is 
that,

2037
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,573
you know,
obviously Doug's shows her foot in the 

2038
01:23:03,691 --> 01:23:06,010
bills for the tour manager,
the manager

2039
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:08,440
for their wives,
their girlfriends,

2040
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:12,310
and it's like this real big family.
And so what was really heartbreaking for

2041
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:13,144
me,
because I hung out with them and I 

2042
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:14,824
didn't know anything was wrong at all.
I mean I knew that they were going 

2043
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:18,010
through this,
but like we were all hanging out and,

2044
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,110
and,
and,

2045
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:20,940
and Bingo is air.
And we were laughing and sing.

2046
01:23:20,941 --> 01:23:24,130
And I showed these guys have videos.
I have a moment computer of just,

2047
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,450
I mean,
just,

2048
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,790
I'm telling you like Saint Elmos Fire 
Shit,

2049
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:28,624
like everyone holding arms,
just literally having the greatest time 

2050
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:31,984
of my life and I lead how aggressively 
fucked up was I at the end of that 

2051
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,650
video?
How'd yet you're,

2052
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,240
you're,
you couldn't even talk on this.

2053
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:40,750
I could not speak St Elmos fire.
It was so great.

2054
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:45,130
And so my whole hope is that,
is that it's gotta be mads,

2055
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:45,520
man.

2056
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,353
I'm,
I spend an hour and a half in the car 

2057
01:23:46,841 --> 01:23:48,250
with her more than x.
We had traffic,

2058
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:50,710
but it's meds.
It's well,

2059
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:51,963
it's just what,
what is going on in your brain versus 

2060
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:58,000
another person's brain.
You can only speculate.

2061
01:23:58,060 --> 01:23:58,871
So wait,
how about no,

2062
01:23:58,871 --> 01:23:59,704
how,
I don't know how anybody else sees the 

2063
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:01,690
world,
but how about like,

2064
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:03,280
tell me if you tell me what you think 
about this.

2065
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,010
Honestly.
Um,

2066
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,740
say you put,
um,

2067
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,913
say it's a,
I'm trying to think of a scenario where 

2068
01:24:09,731 --> 01:24:12,280
I could say this end of the world,
we go to an island.

2069
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,320
It's a,
it's like you,

2070
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:17,470
your wife and kids,
Brian and some girl to,

2071
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:19,450
he'll,
I end up falling in love with Jamie,

2072
01:24:19,451 --> 01:24:21,080
a bunch of computers,
um,

2073
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,010
to make those too.
But,

2074
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,020
but what you got to pay me?
It's computer.

2075
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:27,980
Oh,
we'll give him a rocket.

2076
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:31,330
The computer.
And why haven't I fallen in love yet?

2077
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:32,980
Cause it's good.
Hear the story.

2078
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,990
You're Dominic Monaghan.
My point is,

2079
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,960
and there's no meds,
no meds.

2080
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:39,363
Right?
But you got all your favorite people 

2081
01:24:40,181 --> 01:24:41,014
there.
Okay.

2082
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,460
And there's no meds.
And I'm saying like,

2083
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,583
do you believe that someone saying maybe
that was on meds that been put in a 

2084
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:49,060
perfect scenario?
No.

2085
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:50,860
Apex predators on the island.
It's just family,

2086
01:24:50,861 --> 01:24:52,150
friends,
coconuts.

2087
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,350
He,
everyone's feeling good.

2088
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:55,540
They're eating healthy people.
Do you believe,

2089
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:56,583
cause I wonder sometimes,
do you believe then that all those 

2090
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:03,610
problems is society slid in where you 
now are on Prozac or whatever?

2091
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:04,903
Uh,
do you think that they would be pulled 

2092
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:08,150
away and that person will go like,
man,

2093
01:25:08,151 --> 01:25:09,280
I'm,
I'm feeling good,

2094
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,170
I'm eating healthy.
I got one job.

2095
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:12,550
It's just to go get coconuts in the 
morning.

2096
01:25:12,551 --> 01:25:15,550
I get my coconut,
we all sit by the pool or by the,

2097
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:16,540
I don't know man.

2098
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:19,330
I think there's a real danger.
What do you hold your hand up?

2099
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,250
What does that say?
It's a Dominic Monaghan joke.

2100
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:25,100
How he was awesome and that thought too 
and he was fucking amazing.

2101
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:29,680
This is a real danger.
And in sand it's either or,

2102
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:32,230
you know?
Have you ever taken meds?

2103
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:33,573
No,
but I think for some people they're 

2104
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:36,364
really important.
But do you feel like marijuana's 

2105
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:40,180
sometimes acts like a,
like a,

2106
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,160
like a Zoloft for you?
No.

2107
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,023
But marijuana definitely gives you a 
more sensitive perspective and a calms 

2108
01:25:47,051 --> 01:25:50,740
you down and it makes you more connected
to all the other people that you come in

2109
01:25:50,741 --> 01:25:51,574
contact with.
It definitely does that in a lot of 

2110
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:54,484
ways.
Yeah.

2111
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,473
You know,
but it's not what's going on with 

2112
01:25:57,281 --> 01:25:58,114
people.
They're taking medication that people 

2113
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:02,090
that are taking medication like Ssri.
Um,

2114
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:04,250
I've met,
I have some friends that

2115
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:07,310
they started using them and it changed 
their life.

2116
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,030
You know,
a couple,

2117
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:10,760
quite a few.
And then both of them coincidentally,

2118
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,750
or not coincidentally,
but,

2119
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:13,063
um,
after a while they weened off of them 

2120
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:18,200
and their life got better and they're 
both really smart guys.

2121
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,333
And when their life got better,
then they wean themselves off the psych 

2122
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:22,874
meds and they stayed happy.
So I think everybody's got a different 

2123
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:27,790
story too.
And there's a,

2124
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,410
there's a real,
not a danger,

2125
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:34,790
but I think it's a real prejudice that 
people do well.

2126
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:35,624
They'll,
they'll decide like it's one way or the 

2127
01:26:37,551 --> 01:26:38,384
other.
Like it's either you don't need any 

2128
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:40,814
medication,
all you need to do is diet and exercise 

2129
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:47,390
and run and you'll be fine.
And then there's other people that think

2130
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:50,840
that it's a disease.
The way to treat it is primarily through

2131
01:26:50,841 --> 01:26:54,020
medication and that's it.
And your health and your,

2132
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,771
um,
you know,

2133
01:26:54,771 --> 01:26:55,604
your exercise routines and your diet 
really doesn't have any bearing on it 

2134
01:26:58,671 --> 01:26:59,504
because it's,
there's some sort of a neurological 

2135
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:02,150
disorder.

2136
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:02,983
You have an issue with your brain.
So there's people that are under like 

2137
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:08,600
that school of thought.
I think the real answer,

2138
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:11,090
if you talk to a lot of those 
neuroscientists,

2139
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,890
they'll tell you it's somewhere in the 
middle.

2140
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:14,630
It's like,
who the fuck knows?

2141
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:15,613
Like I don't know you.
And so you might be completely batshit 

2142
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,300
crazy and you need medication.
Dude,

2143
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:23,660
you're just fucking wired wrong.
It's not happening in there.

2144
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,760
Someone needs to go in there and rewire 
shit.

2145
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:29,660
Or you might be a guy who could easily 
be healthy.

2146
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,970
If he could get on a good roll.
You know,

2147
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,070
if you could just get some momentum 
going and start,

2148
01:27:34,071 --> 01:27:35,030
you know,
getting up in the morning,

2149
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:36,223
drinking warm water with lemon,
getting on the fucking treadmill for a 

2150
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,230
half an hour every morning,
put that treadmill in the garage,

2151
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,700
plug that fucker in every morning just 
to fucking half an hour before you go.

2152
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,170
Once you start getting on these roles 
like that,

2153
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:52,040
you start feeling better.
There's a serotonin drip that happens.

2154
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,750
You start feeling better,
you get,

2155
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,610
you get more fit,
you get more healthy,

2156
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:57,410
you feel better.
When you feel better,

2157
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,450
your brain works better.
Like it's undeniable.

2158
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,210
So it's not necessarily one or the 
other,

2159
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,793
but we don't know.
I don't know what's going on in your 

2160
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:07,244
head.
You don't know what's going on in my 

2161
01:28:07,761 --> 01:28:08,594
head.
And I think that's where it gets weird 

2162
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:11,720
when people like these psych meds aren't
helping anybody.

2163
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,810
I think some of them might be helping 
some people,

2164
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,023
some people hit a bad spot man.
And I think the psych drugs can fucking 

2165
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,643
pull them up.
And then they can get accustomed to 

2166
01:28:23,961 --> 01:28:26,210
being on balance and then they can get 
off of him.

2167
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,490
I wish I knew more.
I've always,

2168
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:31,220
they've always told me I should go on a 
something for uh,

2169
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:33,390
for anxiety.
You know,

2170
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:34,041
they're like,
oh,

2171
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:36,050
to change your life.
It might,

2172
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:40,140
I might w the wonder about it is what 
adult,

2173
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:43,760
what's awesome about your personality?
Hundred percent.

2174
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:47,270
That's what everybody was crazy man.
I think fucking crazy.

2175
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,223
Well that's part of what makes you you 
and then it's not like you don't have a 

2176
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:53,840
handle on it.
It's just slippery.

2177
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:56,870
The handles slippery,
very slippery.

2178
01:28:56,910 --> 01:29:01,910
It's covered in mct oil.
It's that way for every one who's

2179
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,800
trying to do anything creatively.
You know,

2180
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:09,240
you can't be 100% relaxed.
This is not going to work that way.

2181
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,790
Have you been to a therapist before?
I'm in therapy right now.

2182
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,940
Hollow is best and I the,
my favorite moment was anytime I,

2183
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:19,710
cause I have a,
I have a lot of epiphanous moment,

2184
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,170
you know,
like I have cognitive,

2185
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,880
not cognitive and emotional.
That word.

2186
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:27,990
I've been alive 48 years.
Really ever said epiphanous I have,

2187
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:31,460
I have a lot of emotional epiphanous 
moment because yeah.

2188
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,520
You know,
I had a day where I,

2189
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,100
where I jumped off the tallest stadium 
in the world,

2190
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:37,770
swim with great white sharks and then 
rappelled up at 3000 foot mountain.

2191
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:41,640
So like at the end of that day,
you're sitting there going like the fuck

2192
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:43,170
man.
Like what?

2193
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:44,063
Like what is going through my brain?
Like I survived three times today when 

2194
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:49,980
I,
when in the day in deadly activities,

2195
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:51,460
but then I knew that were safe,
but,

2196
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,010
and so,
uh,

2197
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:56,330
and then it started happening that I 
started getting a very low threshold for

2198
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,210
this moment.

2199
01:29:57,210 --> 01:30:00,240
It's like,
things can just be like Stan hopes,

2200
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:00,711
man.
I,

2201
01:30:00,711 --> 01:30:02,580
I,
I was firing hot,

2202
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,560
I was at the airport and I was just 
like,

2203
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:06,360
he was one of the greatest times I've 
ever had in my life,

2204
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:07,931
I would like.
But I,

2205
01:30:07,931 --> 01:30:08,764
and I go,
I wonder if it was the greatest time of 

2206
01:30:09,511 --> 01:30:10,081
my hand,
my life,

2207
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:13,710
or if I'm just like so connected right 
now to whatever that is.

2208
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:15,060
They've got a theater there.
I was gonna say this.

2209
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,290
They've got a theater there.
I think Joey,

2210
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:20,340
Ari and I are going to do it 125 seats.
Stan hope presents.

2211
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:24,810
Just go down and spend it in business.
You know he and I talked about that.

2212
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:25,733
I was like,
that theater sounds like the perfect 

2213
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:29,160
place it is.
Bring in comics for a weekend.

2214
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,770
Fuck yes.
Did you ever do the old cobb's?

2215
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,510
Yeah,
I don't know.

2216
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:35,310
Like 150 seats.
No,

2217
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:37,830
it probably might not even been that 
many seats.

2218
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,320
The old cops was,
I did.

2219
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,050
It was down by the wharf.
Yes,

2220
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,320
I did it.
What was called the green room.

2221
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:45,780
Oh,
so you did it after it was cops the cops

2222
01:30:45,781 --> 01:30:48,840
and move to the new spot.
That was a great fucking club though.

2223
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:49,823
It's crazy because cobbs is like the old
cobb's was literally like the perfect 

2224
01:30:55,171 --> 01:30:56,004
size club,
but it was almost too small to make 

2225
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:59,670
money.
So like if you worked at cobb's,

2226
01:30:59,671 --> 01:31:02,250
you got paid less than if you worked at 
the punchline,

2227
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:05,700
which is also a great Rome right punch.
I was fantastic.

2228
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:09,120
It was so good about that comms cause he
was so small.

2229
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:12,210
He would go there,
which is like so packed in tight.

2230
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:16,170
I would make less money to work there,
but look forward to it more.

2231
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:18,420
It caught on fire,
right cy?

2232
01:31:18,421 --> 01:31:19,860
Yeah.
Something happened man.

2233
01:31:19,861 --> 01:31:20,694
There's some sort of a fire really.
They moved to a new spot and the new 

2234
01:31:24,421 --> 01:31:28,120
spot they moved to as a giant ass spot.
It's hard to,

2235
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,930
that was always hard to fill for me.
Not if you're Doug Benson,

2236
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:34,770
but the new spot is still awesome.
It's really like the new spot.

2237
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,663
It's really cool but it's weird.
It's got a high ceiling and it's got a 

2238
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:41,520
balcony that's way in the back where you
know Doug,

2239
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,373
when Doug sells tickets to those,
to that theater and he's done stuff 

2240
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:45,834
there.
No one from Bisbee has to hold like 25 

2241
01:31:48,151 --> 01:31:48,984
tickets for Bisbee residents.
It's all people flying into Tucson and 

2242
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:54,240
driving down to go see the show.
That's pretty fucking legit.

2243
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:55,990
Wow.
I was like,

2244
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:56,873
I was like,
dude,

2245
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,660
that is what I was like,
bring out.

2246
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:03,240
I would come in in a heartbeat in a 
heartbeat.

2247
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,040
My initial idea of coming in was like,
go in,

2248
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:06,993
do standup in like near Bisbee,
see if I can get stand up to look at my 

2249
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,630
hour,
tell me where I'm being lazy.

2250
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:11,980
But,
and then he was like,

2251
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:14,260
just do it in my house.
Wow.

2252
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:15,423
But like,
uh,

2253
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:15,980
yeah,
I,

2254
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,670
I'd love those old small rooms are the 
best.

2255
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:23,310
The laughing skull is a great fucking 
rape.

2256
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:24,970
Fucking room.
Tiny,

2257
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:26,873
you know,
it's like almost like just a little 

2258
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:29,650
bigger than the belly room,
you know,

2259
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:32,290
a hundred seat room to the belly rooms.
Fucking amazing.

2260
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,124
You know,
I never fucked around with the store 

2261
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:37,270
ever up until like very recently.
That fucking belly room is,

2262
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,930
I've fucking why would you ever do the 
or or the main room?

2263
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,270
I didn't want to,
I'll tell you how little I knew the time

2264
01:32:43,271 --> 01:32:46,600
I want them to do Ari storytelling show.
I didn't know which one was which.

2265
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:49,060
I literally had to go in and go,
what is the belly room?

2266
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,850
That's how little I did the store.
And they're like,

2267
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,713
and the guy didn't even know who I was 
and it was like an army brought me up 

2268
01:32:54,521 --> 01:32:55,900
there.
I mean,

2269
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,243
fucking perfect.
Did what's his name's new material 

2270
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:00,860
night.

2271
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:02,330
Uh,
Jay just Cya.

2272
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,060
Jeremiah,
Jeremiah,

2273
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:05,133
Jeremiah Watkins,
new material that brain's fucked but 

2274
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:10,900
like was old school,
he name it is.

2275
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:11,980
Yeah.
I got it.

2276
01:33:11,981 --> 01:33:12,814
Met his mom.
She must have been into the Bible just 

2277
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:15,190
like you,
Brian's song.

2278
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:16,740
No,
now ahead.

2279
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,160
Thank you Jamie.
But so,

2280
01:33:18,161 --> 01:33:19,660
uh,
uh,

2281
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:22,720
but like that,
that belly room and I don't,

2282
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:25,360
I'm not a guy that goes out often during
that,

2283
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:27,700
that convinced me to start getting out 
in the city.

2284
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,010
Are you call it and he's like,
can you do my host,

2285
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:31,240
my storytelling show?
I'm like,

2286
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:34,030
done that belly rooms.
Fucking amazing.

2287
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:35,950
Yes.
It's a weird place.

2288
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,640
It's so tucked away.
A little tiny room at the store.

2289
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:42,010
We do weekends there sometimes man.
Really?

2290
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:42,431
Yeah,
yeah,

2291
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:43,264
yeah.
We do like a Friday night or Saturday 

2292
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,010
night,
10 o'clock show.

2293
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,270
It's just me and friends,
you know.

2294
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,330
That's fucking amazing.
I mean the,

2295
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:52,510
the whatever the big one is that we've 
dived on that one with you.

2296
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:53,650
Yeah,
the main room.

2297
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:54,221
That's good.
When you,

2298
01:33:54,221 --> 01:33:56,960
it's good to kill and end.
Not a six show there last night.

2299
01:33:56,970 --> 01:34:00,990
I really,
David tell us the secret gassed.

2300
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:02,230
Oh,
it's hell.

2301
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,870
Came by the Ice House last night too.
It's great.

2302
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:05,763
I love that guy asked him.
There's a few people that I see I have 

2303
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:11,560
to sit and hang out with is so great.
Yeah.

2304
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,900
There's a sweethearts comedy.
Sweet Arts.

2305
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:16,180
Have you seen Nick Nicky glaciers,
new show?

2306
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:18,250
Uh,
it's actually really funny.

2307
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:19,203
I liked it.
Yeah.

2308
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,760
She hooked people up to macguires 
producing that.

2309
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:22,541
Oh really?
Yeah.

2310
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,580
Chris Mcguire is producing it.
So funny,

2311
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:26,170
right?
I believe he is.

2312
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:28,060
He was at one point in time,
I'm sure.

2313
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:30,640
I hope he's still with it.
This is hilarious.

2314
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:33,100
He's great.
He's just fucking hilarious writer.

2315
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:33,963
So funny.
She hookup lie detectors to her friends 

2316
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,750
and then ask them if they wanted to fuck
her and like,

2317
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:39,670
like these are real friends.

2318
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:40,420
And they were like,
oh.

2319
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:44,140
Like you could see they were so nervous.
Well that's normal though.

2320
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:47,560
I share those things where they try to 
measure deception.

2321
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:50,410
Most had the shittiest joke,
will it be that?

2322
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:52,960
So that's where Amy Schumer got that 
idea.

2323
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:58,870
Oh,
how that was.

2324
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,430
I'm glad you let that go.
Glad you lob that out there.

2325
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:08,690
I tried those.
I was tried to watch Conan last night.

2326
01:35:08,691 --> 01:35:11,240
I like I,
I haven't seen Conan and over a year and

2327
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:13,430
a half and I was like,
is this show even still on?

2328
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:16,580
You can't find it on Hulu.
You can't find out Netflix.

2329
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:19,010
None of that shit.
So still on tbs?

2330
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:20,180
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2331
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:21,590
No birds there once a month.
Yeah.

2332
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:23,910
What do you mean the reason I watch 
coated?

2333
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:24,883
No,
I mean like a lot of people have cut 

2334
01:35:25,881 --> 01:35:27,290
their cable,
like including myself.

2335
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:28,580
I've had it for two years now.

2336
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:32,150
And you rely on like Hulu and stuff like
that to watch everything.

2337
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:34,420
It's not any of those things.
Oh hmm.

2338
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,530
What do you would think they would make 
some sort of a deal?

2339
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:37,740
No,
I watched Conan on,

2340
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,410
I've seen,
I've never watched Conan like live,

2341
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:42,080
I'll watch it on youtube.
There's a lot of that for sure.

2342
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:43,940
Murders.
Conan.

2343
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:45,980
Conan knows them,
so they like,

2344
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:46,814
they know what to do.
Like he gives birds go bird would just 

2345
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:54,371
give these wide paths for Berta ramp.
I love Burp last night,

2346
01:35:54,411 --> 01:35:57,230
Burr,
he is one of my favorite new comics that

2347
01:35:57,231 --> 01:35:59,810
I just got into within the last couple 
of years.

2348
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:02,930
Like I could watch that guy forever.
He's really,

2349
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:06,620
he's one of the best ever right now.
Bill is one of the best ever.

2350
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,390
He's,
he's really good.

2351
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:11,440
He's really good.
He's really tucked in common.

2352
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:13,080
He's real original.
It's,

2353
01:36:13,081 --> 01:36:13,970
it's really him.

2354
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:14,993
It's very authentic.
And he's saying she's fucking some 

2355
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:20,210
controversial shit,
you know,

2356
01:36:20,211 --> 01:36:24,080
and he's going out there and uh,
it's interesting,

2357
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:27,140
even as cartoon is awesome because just 
hearing him,

2358
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,340
dude loves bright,
told him,

2359
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:30,560
Hey,
don't even get me started.

2360
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,453
So I go,
so bill and I texted him back and forth 

2361
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:34,161
with like,
Hey,

2362
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:36,290
we should hang out.
Not podcast hang out.

2363
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,273
It's one of the flaws I think I have is 
that I look at everything as work 

2364
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,430
builders.
Not on a,

2365
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:41,323
no,
no.

2366
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:42,830
If you wanna hang out,
we'll fucking hang out.

2367
01:36:42,831 --> 01:36:44,380
I'm not going to podcast.
Sort of.

2368
01:36:44,381 --> 01:36:47,270
Great.
So we have a cigar or my place cocktail.

2369
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:48,373
Shoot the shit.
How'd the sunset go out and do it at 

2370
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:52,850
work?
So the girls go,

2371
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:53,961
do you want to do so?
I said,

2372
01:36:53,961 --> 01:36:54,900
no,
my buddy bills coming in.

2373
01:36:54,901 --> 01:36:57,170
We've got to is the day Tom Segura 
special comes out.

2374
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:58,820
So I got netflix up.
I go,

2375
01:36:58,821 --> 01:37:00,650
as a matter of fact,
Oh this is a cartoon girls,

2376
01:37:00,651 --> 01:37:01,700
you're like,
cartoons,

2377
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,800
why don't you guys watch this is my 
buddy bill.

2378
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:05,270
He's coming over tonight.
Let's take a look at it.

2379
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:07,063
First thing is like these cock sucker 
mother fuckers and I looks over and 

2380
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:12,500
she's like,
are we allowed to watch us?

2381
01:37:12,501 --> 01:37:13,281
And I was like,
fuck it.

2382
01:37:13,281 --> 01:37:14,480
Your mom's not here.
Let's watch it.

2383
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:16,910
Watch the pilot,
right.

2384
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:20,240
Leanne comes in and says,
what are you guys?

2385
01:37:20,241 --> 01:37:21,021
Watch it and go,
okay.

2386
01:37:21,021 --> 01:37:21,854
It's got bad words in it,
but it's not like sexual or anything 

2387
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,213
until we show in.
Leanne says she sees an article on NPR 

2388
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:30,890
that says kids being around cursing is 
okay.

2389
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:33,470
It's actually very healthy for them to 
hear cursing.

2390
01:37:33,471 --> 01:37:36,650
It's when kids don't hear cursing that 
they believe the world is different.

2391
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:38,030
They believe the world's fucked up.

2392
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:38,953
So like they live in this bubble and 
then they do hear cursing and it fucks 

2393
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:44,030
them up and in return and so low.
So yeah.

2394
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,100
And so leanne is like,
you know what,

2395
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:49,250
let's watch it.
So we watched an interesting concept but

2396
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,720
totally makes sense.
That makes sense.

2397
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,850
Did you hear cursing when you're a kid?
Yeah.

2398
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:53,750
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

2399
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,693
Yeah,
yeah.

2400
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:57,180
And it's,
it's just these new age,

2401
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,650
I'm going to say Christian,
I'm,

2402
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:00,150
I believe in God,
but like whatever,

2403
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:04,470
like they hae cursing is not around 
children.

2404
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:05,383
We think as a new age Christian thing,
I didn't know one parent when I was a 

2405
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:10,950
kid that didn't curse,
didn't drink,

2406
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:14,040
smoke in front of their kids and curse.
But that was my whole life.

2407
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:16,060
But I grew up in the south.
Well it's,

2408
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:19,170
I guess it's trying to preserve the 
innocence of the kids.

2409
01:38:19,171 --> 01:38:20,340
Is that what,
is that what it is?

2410
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,000
I guess it's,
they're just words,

2411
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:24,834
right?
It's just words to be able to say that 

2412
01:38:25,921 --> 01:38:26,491
right away.
Like,

2413
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:27,324
what did we give a fuck?
Why do we have to behave different than 

2414
01:38:29,341 --> 01:38:31,470
the kids do?
It teaches them boundaries.

2415
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:33,570
It says this is what dad can do.
You can't do that.

2416
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,330
When you become a certain age,
you can earn that and you can do it.

2417
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:37,700
But what,
how,

2418
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:38,461
go ahead.
Yeah,

2419
01:38:38,461 --> 01:38:42,120
but what if like a kid says like pussy 
hole that you don't want kids sank pussy

2420
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:42,954
holes probably they'd have to live in 
your house to your pussy hole like well 

2421
01:38:45,811 --> 01:38:46,644
that could come up with it on their own.
It's not like puts you holes from a 

2422
01:38:49,141 --> 01:38:50,070
single origin.

2423
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:57,870
People all over the world said pussy 
hole and a hundred fifth and languages.

2424
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:01,170
None of them aware that somebody in 
Greece,

2425
01:39:01,171 --> 01:39:02,004
it already claimed that nomenclature,
but so we ended up watching it and then 

2426
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:09,570
bill came over bills and we were at 
episode three.

2427
01:39:09,571 --> 01:39:10,404
He's like,
you haven't let them see episode four 

2428
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:12,930
yet if you,
I go,

2429
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:13,621
no,
he goes,

2430
01:39:13,621 --> 01:39:15,010
got,
don't let them fucking tears.

2431
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,613
But what's so crazy,
it's like we're sitting in the kitchen 

2432
01:39:17,671 --> 01:39:20,130
and my daughter walks in.
She didn't give a shit about celebrity.

2433
01:39:20,131 --> 01:39:20,964
That doesn't mean anything,
but she heard bill's voice and went 

2434
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:27,390
like,
it was like creepy and I was like,

2435
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:28,201
Yo,
Georgia,

2436
01:39:28,201 --> 01:39:29,640
this is the guy you've been listening to
all day.

2437
01:39:29,641 --> 01:39:31,440
This the dad from that show,
she was like,

2438
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:32,893
look,
she couldn't wrap her head around the 

2439
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,450
fact that she was hearing the cartoon 
guy's voice.

2440
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:37,950
Wow.
I thought that was cool.

2441
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:39,593
But that show is fa.
F is for family as it and it's so 

2442
01:39:42,031 --> 01:39:44,310
fucking funny.
It's really good.

2443
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,940
I want a cartoon so bad.
It's a low.

2444
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:49,040
Why did you make one?
Yeah,

2445
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:55,040
you can cut stand hopes calling part.
I'm on Speaker Stan.

2446
01:39:56,821 --> 01:39:59,070
Hope you're on Rogan's podcast.
You're on speaker

2447
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,880
fucking phone vibrating in his pocket.
You know what does it delay Kyla volume.

2448
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:15,910
We'll pause it.
You pause it.

2449
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:18,100
Can we pause the show?
No,

2450
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:18,561
no,
no.

2451
01:40:18,561 --> 01:40:20,510
He's talking to stand still.
Stand still.

2452
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:28,440
I texted rogue it a picture of you in 
the fun house.

2453
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:30,100
Yeah.

2454
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,910
Yeah.
I just got it.

2455
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:34,040
Here it is.
Is this me hammer?

2456
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:34,874
Yeah.

2457
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:38,040
I just texted a picture of us.
Oh Shit.

2458
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:40,930
You in the fun house.
What's going on?

2459
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:41,660
We,
we,

2460
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:43,110
we,
we came in late.

2461
01:40:43,111 --> 01:40:46,500
Chad shank said he's been watching it 
since the beginning.

2462
01:40:46,501 --> 01:40:48,000
He goes,
they mentioned my name.

2463
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:53,640
He can't hear us yet.
Oh,

2464
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:54,713
here.

2465
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:55,900
Here.
Go ahead.

2466
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:56,763
Do you hear us Doug?
It's on speakerphone and he should be 

2467
01:40:58,691 --> 01:41:00,080
able to hear us using speaker phone.
Yeah.

2468
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:00,640
Oh,
he's watching.

2469
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:05,640
Oh yeah.
Hang on here.

2470
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:09,430
Talk to Joe.
Did you just do it?

2471
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:10,563
Well,
I'm just saying you're the only one who 

2472
01:41:10,991 --> 01:41:12,160
could talk to him.
Douglas.

2473
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:14,733
We have a,
we have a shitty way of communicating 

2474
01:41:16,151 --> 01:41:16,984
here.
We've got to figure out a better way to 

2475
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:18,304
do this because you could only hear us 
when we're like really close to this 

2476
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:21,814
phone.
You're not wired into anything so we 

2477
01:41:23,171 --> 01:41:25,180
have to pass the phone around for you to
hear us.

2478
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,780
Unless you're like this speaker from 
works pretty well.

2479
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:33,100
I was just trying to fuck with callie.
Forget to turn his phone off.

2480
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:35,480
Done Doug.
No,

2481
01:41:35,481 --> 01:41:37,370
nobody ever turns it off.
They turn it over.

2482
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,040
We're too addicted to turn it off.
Nobody.

2483
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:41,900
Nobody turned shit off.
It's too,

2484
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,690
you never know.
Someone might get in contact with you.

2485
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,490
What the fuck is going on in the desert 
sun?

2486
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:48,880
Ah,
we,

2487
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,610
we did bingos disappearance.
I don't know.

2488
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:54,243
Yeah,
he did.

2489
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:56,210
Yeah.
Gay Too.

2490
01:41:56,270 --> 01:42:00,560
At the end of it she calls and uh,
reveals her location.

2491
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:03,740
Whoa.
So got it.

2492
01:42:03,741 --> 01:42:06,320
Ain't over there.
Still has to be the,

2493
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,270
uh,
uh,

2494
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:08,843
what's it gonna be?
Is it going to be him or is it going to 

2495
01:42:11,181 --> 01:42:12,014
be me?

2496
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:13,540
Whoa.
No gunfight.

2497
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:15,060
Don't do that.
No,

2498
01:42:15,061 --> 01:42:15,560
no,
no,

2499
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:16,920
no.
Cool.

2500
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:19,200
So you and the guy.
Cool.

2501
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:21,793
Um,
so,

2502
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:23,920
so you're hopeful that it's all gonna 
work out.

2503
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:29,200
It'll work out one way or the other.
I just hope it works out in my favor.

2504
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:32,090
Well,

01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,620
But uh,

2523
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:23,090

2524
01:43:23,091 --> 01:43:26,150
I'm just going to go to bed and it's 
like dig dug and Bingo breakup episode.

2525
01:43:26,151 --> 01:43:27,520
I was like,

2526
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,960
Make it a pot of tea.
I'll be listening to this all night.

2527
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:31,603
Or,
I mean,

2528
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:33,080
esther q,
Did you know this?

2529
01:43:33,110 --> 01:43:35,570
This is 100% sure.
I found this out the other day.

2530
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,673
Extra q on the end of every single one 
of her podcasts masturbates and just 

2531
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:41,603
record herself masturbating while she's 
doing our tour dates and stuff like 

2532
01:43:44,091 --> 01:43:44,924
that.
And it's legit cause you could hear it 

2533
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:46,760
like,
oh like,

2534
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:49,670
and stuff like that.
Like it's on my episode that went,

2535
01:43:49,671 --> 01:43:51,350
that I was on,
she masturbated,

2536
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,160
came

2537
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,550
17 times at the end of the podcast.
No joke.

2538
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:57,800
What was,
so while you were podcasting,

2539
01:43:57,801 --> 01:43:58,634
when she was playing with know what she 
does is like she recorded a podcast and 

2540
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:02,870
then after I leave then she masturbates 
and goes,

2541
01:44:02,871 --> 01:44:03,704
well that was a lot of fun.
And then she comes and she comes really 

2542
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:10,820
fast cause she can make her,
comes herself come so it really fast.

2543
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,940
If she's a sex addict,
she's a sex addict.

2544
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:16,100
She's a Gesso.
Did you hear him?

2545
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:18,290
So she did it on Opion Jim?
No.

2546
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:19,263
Oh,
it was pretty good.

2547
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:20,690
Huh?
She's like,

2548
01:44:20,691 --> 01:44:21,524
yeah,
I can make my coming self coming 20 

2549
01:44:22,281 --> 01:44:23,270
seconds.
And they're like,

2550
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,290
Gee,
you know,

2551
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:25,100
Jim's like,
oh,

2552
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,140
I'd like to see that.
So she goes in a little booth.

2553
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:29,340
I think we're mostly,
we're uh,

2554
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,260
we're all the producers.
Are you rock is and just masturbates all

2555
01:44:33,261 --> 01:44:34,880
Mike just,
and you can share her.

2556
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:37,610
No,
she goes into the box and no one can see

2557
01:44:37,611 --> 01:44:38,510
her.
Oh.

2558
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:39,403
And but she did it.
And I had heard about this end of the 

2559
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:43,220
podcast.
Good for her.

2560
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,740
I had heard about this end of the 
podcast before and I had,

2561
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,690
I asked her about it.
She told me about it.

2562
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:48,733
She left my house,
she did my podcast the the day she left 

2563
01:44:50,571 --> 01:44:53,000
my house and I was like,
I'm just going to hear it for myself.

2564
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:56,000
It is.
I mean,

2565
01:44:56,001 --> 01:44:58,110
it is legit.
Not only but that,

2566
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:00,320
but is she gets done having an orgasm 
and then just says,

2567
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:01,370
okay,
Columbus,

2568
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:04,280
Ohio will be there the 22nd on the 23rd 
and it starts again,

2569
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:06,350
and then we'll stop and go,
okay,

2570
01:45:06,351 --> 01:45:08,150
you remember how last week I said I lost
my retainer whole.

2571
01:45:08,151 --> 01:45:10,210
I found it and this will start again.
Oh my God.

2572
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:11,060
That really is.

2573
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:14,620
It really is just to go get that 
subscribed,

2574
01:45:14,621 --> 01:45:15,454
but just cut to the very end.
I didn't know about it and then when I 

2575
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:18,440
found out it,
I just was like,

2576
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:20,290
Hey,
let's watch porn and podcasts as she can

2577
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,650
wipe podcast.
We just watched porn,

2578
01:45:21,651 --> 01:45:22,770
but if it didn't work,
she didn't get,

2579
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,230
I tried it.
I tried it.

2580
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,250
I gotta I gotta get behind Brian's back 
on this one.

2581
01:45:28,251 --> 01:45:32,480
It's a pretty legit podcasting episodes 
at the end of every one.

2582
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:36,500
It's like 20 times.
It's like you're getting tired phrases.

2583
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:40,970
It makes me horny though.
Immediately I told you had to masturbate

2584
01:45:40,971 --> 01:45:43,040
and look at Asian chicks.
How many people were jumping off?

2585
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:47,440
Listen to this podcast right now,
this harbor,

2586
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:49,940
definitely.
It does a number right now.

2587
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:51,453
Now you got your,
like as soon as we start talking or you 

2588
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:55,070
guys started explaining how she 
masturbates that much,

2589
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:58,040
how many dudes with their deck out?
I'll tell you how many people went right

2590
01:45:58,041 --> 01:45:58,874
to esther coups coup and the gang and 
just went to the go to the Anthony Cumi 

2591
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:03,230
one.
Go right to the end.

2592
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:04,580
Last,
last 10 minutes.

2593
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,230
I could have mine.
I'm here.

2594
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:07,303
Oh,
go to Brian.

2595
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:11,450
What red band do rude.
How dare you.

2596
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,750
And he just never invited me to be on it
and she's just,

2597
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,150
she's just always doing that.

2598
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:20,630
It's pretty good.
No,

2599
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,171
no.
Joe,

2600
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:22,880
let me pull it up for you,
Joe.

2601
01:46:22,881 --> 01:46:24,440
Let me pull it up for you.
It's really funny.

2602
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:28,130
I can't believe that Bert Kreischer is 
doing this against my will.

2603
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:31,310
If it was up to me,
I would not listen for,

2604
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:34,160
I find this offensive,
esther Kool and the gang.

2605
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:39,320
It's like the first one on my thing,
the one she does it.

2606
01:46:39,321 --> 01:46:41,390
Anthea Cumbia is actually a really good 
podcast,

2607
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,710
but you just go right to the end,
so it's hard.

2608
01:46:44,711 --> 01:46:45,710
I was already listening to,
okay.

2609
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,830
Oh God.
All right.

2610
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:53,853
Oh my God,

2611
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,393
yes.

2612
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:10,973
Oh,

2613
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:12,323
I'm going to be in Vegas this week.
20th Friday and Saturday at the South 

2614
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:27,540
Point Casino.
Oh my God.

2615
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:31,140
And by the way,
she got 12 minutes left to that.

2616
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,350
Yeah.
What a good kid it is.

2617
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:34,463
It is.
But the best is when her going up to be 

2618
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:37,374
in Vegas.

2619
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,630
Good kid.
Oh,

2620
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:42,573
I got that from my friend.
Jimmy didn't tell you we were in high 

2621
01:47:44,351 --> 01:47:45,730
school.
Quite a good kid.

2622
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,860
He'll grow.
Would be like a total pig.

2623
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:49,420
He'd go,
what a good kid

2624
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:54,140
said that

2625
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:57,710
boy said that.
Oh,

2626
01:47:57,770 --> 01:47:59,690
that's why.
That's like one of the funniest thing to

2627
01:47:59,691 --> 01:48:00,524
say when a girl like does something 
incredibly ridiculous over the top like 

2628
01:48:04,761 --> 01:48:05,594
that.
While I could kid what you've asked her 

2629
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:09,470
coo was a good kid.
She is.

2630
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:11,810
What a crazy girl.
She sleeps at.

2631
01:48:11,850 --> 01:48:13,220
Uh,
the spas,

2632
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:14,143
like the Korean spas,
like she just goes there and like lays 

2633
01:48:16,641 --> 01:48:18,680
on the floor all night.
Is that where she lives?

2634
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:19,730
No,
she just,

2635
01:48:19,731 --> 01:48:21,800
when she's in town,
which he came to La last week,

2636
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:23,540
it goes to those things.
Pause every shooter.

2637
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:26,240
She's a deep person too.
She's a very smart girl.

2638
01:48:26,590 --> 01:48:28,940
Very unusual person.
I could talk to her.

2639
01:48:28,941 --> 01:48:31,820
You get a different sort of a 
personality,

2640
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:34,820
you know?
But those,

2641
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,000
those like spas,
those Korean spas,

2642
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:43,660
that's the one thing that I'm really 
worried that we're going to lose in this

2643
01:48:44,781 --> 01:48:48,170
sort of homogenization of the world.

2644
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:53,890
Like real ethnic shit.
Like that Korean spa where it's like old

2645
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:56,300
world.
Everybody's taking their clothes off.

2646
01:48:56,330 --> 01:48:57,163
You're all going to go through this 
crazy spotting or the Russians where 

2647
01:48:59,421 --> 01:49:00,254
they do the Banya.
You ever seen that shit I've done at 

2648
01:49:02,121 --> 01:49:03,110
Bro.
Oh,

2649
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:04,790
you have done it?
I've done it.

2650
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:05,840
What is that like?
And then they get,

2651
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:09,000
they go hot and cold.
They go back and forth right old school.

2652
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:09,834
It makes you wonder,
it makes you really like separate what 

2653
01:49:11,331 --> 01:49:12,164
we called gay as a kid versus what was 
gay in the fucking 1930s that looks gay 

2654
01:49:17,391 --> 01:49:18,470
on paper.
And Dude,

2655
01:49:18,471 --> 01:49:20,600
you're naked.
He lays you on a fucking slab.

2656
01:49:20,601 --> 01:49:23,120
Like you're at a morgue.
Just starts washing your body.

2657
01:49:23,121 --> 01:49:26,180
Takes Birch bees easy,
totally naked.

2658
01:49:26,181 --> 01:49:28,970
And he got washes your ball sack.
Never leg up,

2659
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:30,390
leg up on,
leg up.

2660
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:31,273
Hold on,
hold on.

2661
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,800
The Guy Washes you,
washes your body,

2662
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,230
your asshole.
Uh,

2663
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,480
I'm almost certain he got my asshole.
Um,

2664
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:40,760
almost certainly got my asshole.
So with his hands,

2665
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:41,400
gloves?
No,

2666
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,171
no.
He's got,

2667
01:49:42,171 --> 01:49:46,250
I think he's got a,
he as birch branches or he's got,

2668
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:48,230
um,
Birch Birch.

2669
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:49,203
It's birch leaves.
That's what they beat you with and he's 

2670
01:49:50,471 --> 01:49:53,590
holding your ass hole up with that and 
he literally leg up.

2671
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,530
He gets on top of you.
He cracks your back.

2672
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:57,370
Like he,
he,

2673
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:58,360
it's,
it's fully,

2674
01:49:58,690 --> 01:49:59,800
there's a place in New York,
man,

2675
01:49:59,801 --> 01:50:01,390
if your next time you're in New York 
wearing clothes,

2676
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:02,763
he's not,
he's not any had herpes sores on his 

2677
01:50:04,061 --> 01:50:05,380
mouth.
Oh.

2678
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,190
But then he had just immediately was 
like,

2679
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:10,024
okay,
get in bath and then you just go get in 

2680
01:50:12,101 --> 01:50:16,270
like a ice cold bath.
Coldest water I've ever been in.

2681
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:19,840
Hoppin think like prickling on your feet
and then they get out,

2682
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:22,450
they put you in a room that's like,
oh I'm going to ballpark.

2683
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:23,980
And I know this sounds,
make believe,

2684
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:25,023
but like at like 200 degrees,
it was the hottest room I've ever been 

2685
01:50:27,431 --> 01:50:28,510
in my life.
Oh my God.

2686
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:29,950
Like it's not,
it's not a sauna.

2687
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:31,810
It hurts your eyes and it hurts to 
breathe.

2688
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:34,870
You stand there for like five minutes,
then they come out,

2689
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:36,640
they wash u,
they dunk you,

2690
01:50:36,641 --> 01:50:39,280
they put you back in and it's all about 
cleaning out your impurities.

2691
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:41,440
I gotta be honest with you man.
I walked out of that place.

2692
01:50:41,441 --> 01:50:44,980
Feel clean as fuck.
A little violated but clean is fuck.

2693
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:47,590
Wow.
Just oh he was in a towel.

2694
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:50,980
I totally had on was a towel.
Oh well why does it have to be a guy?

2695
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:55,060
Cause cause it's gotta be strong.
Probably there's a player legs up.

2696
01:50:55,061 --> 01:50:57,100
What if you're a big giant dude?
I had follow up,

2697
01:50:57,101 --> 01:50:58,900
I'll tell you the name of the place.
So if people want to go,

2698
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:02,820
I follow them on twitter.
This is old school Russian.

2699
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:03,663
I know a little Russian.
So I tried to talk to him and I got in 

2700
01:51:04,751 --> 01:51:06,700
there and there were like,
okay.

2701
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:08,650
And now that we became friends because 
of that.

2702
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:09,650
Yeah.
They,

2703
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:11,590
they also like if you,
you would,

2704
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,220
you wouldn't want a woman in that 
position of washing a man like that.

2705
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:15,740
No,
no.

2706
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:16,573
I and San Diego,
there's this massage parlor where they 

2707
01:51:18,491 --> 01:51:20,440
cleaned her first and she like was 
lifting my legs.

2708
01:51:20,441 --> 01:51:21,274
I've completed my asshole jacking me off
it and then we went to check on me all 

2709
01:51:24,650 --> 01:51:24,750
day.

2710
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:25,890
Yeah.
You see what I'm saying?

2711
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:30,920
Like a girl would kind of be forced into
that sort of an environment if she had a

2712
01:51:31,261 --> 01:51:32,460
wash guys,
assholes.

2713
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:33,503
Like there's,
there's gotta be a certain amount of 

2714
01:51:36,331 --> 01:51:39,960
guys that want more than you did just 
wash their dick and watched her asshole.

2715
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,833
Yeah.
To keep watching that.

2716
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:41,970
It felt good though.
Having a,

2717
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,610
if somebody wash your luck,
you collect,

2718
01:51:43,611 --> 01:51:45,350
cause I,
I laid there and she watched me for like

2719
01:51:45,351 --> 01:51:47,290
20 minutes and it felt like,
oh my God,

2720
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,590
I'm my baby again.
Kind of it,

2721
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,930
it was like this weird feeling I hadn't 
felt in a while.

2722
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:51,590
What I'm thinking

2723
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:56,590
is that like having the,
the girl removed from the equation,

2724
01:51:56,901 --> 01:51:59,750
it takes out the sex aspect of it.
That's why it's okay.

2725
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:00,593
The dude does it because if the sex 
aspect of it is there ea like there's 

2726
01:52:05,121 --> 01:52:05,954
just a certain percentage of guys are 
going to try to fuck that girl and so 

2727
01:52:09,351 --> 01:52:11,660
her jobs like hazardous,
you know what I mean?

2728
01:52:11,661 --> 01:52:12,494
Like if you don't want to fuck every 
other guy you wash all day and you're 

2729
01:52:14,691 --> 01:52:17,270
grabbing their legs and washing their 
balls and assholes,

2730
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:19,610
how many dudes going to try to fuck you?
It's like,

2731
01:52:19,611 --> 01:52:24,611
could you imagine that kind of a work 
environment where like you were like,

2732
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:26,773
imagine if your job was being a at the 
counter at a chipotle lay and you knew 

2733
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:36,060
you were the guy who was says,
what can I get you?

2734
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:38,600
You were the first guy on the whole 
chain of command.

2735
01:52:38,601 --> 01:52:39,600
I'll have one of them.
Staples.

2736
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:40,281
All right,
dude,

2737
01:52:40,281 --> 01:52:41,330
boom.
White Rice or brown rice.

2738
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,770
But if you're that guy,
right?

2739
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:45,863
Okay.

2740
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,273
Burrito completely lost my train of 
thought as soon as it was I saying 

2741
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:04,980
before that you were talking about women
watching you balls.

2742
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:08,420
Oh my God.
Forget what I said.

2743
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,950
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you my theory.

2744
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:13,100
This is going to sound racist,
but I'll say it out loud anyway,

2745
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:14,383
I had a massage from a lady in Omaha who
was black and it was the best massage 

2746
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:22,190
I've ever got and the reason I thought 
was she's not attracted to me at all.

2747
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,520
I remember what I was going to say.
She went to Chicago Lane.

2748
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:33,590
You were the first guy on the line,
the first guy on the line,

2749
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:34,703
and you were the one who asks if you 
want steak bowl and eight out of 10 

2750
01:53:37,291 --> 01:53:41,110
people wanting to fuck you.
Wait,

2751
01:53:41,970 --> 01:53:45,510
10 people tried to fuck you while you 
were at work like you matt.

2752
01:53:45,511 --> 01:53:48,630
Can you imagine that kind of pressure of
having a job like that?

2753
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:53,100
If it was a girl who was wash your 
asshole and your Dick,

2754
01:53:53,130 --> 01:53:57,210
eight out of 10 guys.
So it's a ridiculous job hazard.

2755
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,730
Like if you had any other job,
here's a better example.

2756
01:53:59,731 --> 01:54:00,564
If you were a guy,
change his tires at the local gas 

2757
01:54:02,641 --> 01:54:03,470
station.
Yeah.

2758
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:05,850
But everybody kept trying to fuck you.
He'd be like,

2759
01:54:05,851 --> 01:54:07,710
Jesus Christ,
I'm tired of working here.

2760
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:08,880
Yeah.
I just,

2761
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,650
I just want to change your tire.
That's all I want to do.

2762
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:11,753
Well,
if you have a guy in a loin cloth and 

2763
01:54:14,071 --> 01:54:19,071
that guy's washing your balls and your 
asshole maybe removes any threat of sex,

2764
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:22,140
it is,
it happens quick Russian dude,

2765
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:23,780
you don't get hard.
It happens quickly.

2766
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:26,690
And I just tweeted it out because if you
want to find it,

2767
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,490
it's,
it's Russian baths.

2768
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,200
New York,
uh,

2769
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:33,090
Chad Shank just retweeted me.
Um,

2770
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:35,220
but it's Russian bads,
New York and,

2771
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:36,410
and why,
and it,

2772
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,180
and I'm telling you when I said this and
this is,

2773
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:42,260
I agree 100% what you're saying,
I don't think they're going to disappear

2774
01:54:42,261 --> 01:54:45,800
because uh,
in our country we respect,

2775
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:50,060
I'm going to say minorities,
but we respect minorities not wanting to

2776
01:54:50,061 --> 01:54:51,980
be apart,
like wanting to have their own thing.

2777
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,780
We just don't respect it with white 
people.

2778
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:54,763
So,
so for forever we're going to allow 

2779
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:57,344
Russians and Koreans and Japanese and 
Asians to have their own little secret 

2780
01:54:59,901 --> 01:55:00,734
separate towns where like you can't do 
their shit because we go as America 

2781
01:55:05,361 --> 01:55:06,710
where we're over sensitive.
We go,

2782
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:07,040
no,
no,

2783
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:07,311
no,
no,

2784
01:55:07,311 --> 01:55:09,140
no.
We got that.

2785
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:10,760
If you want to be a part of our clubs,
you can do that.

2786
01:55:10,761 --> 01:55:13,370
We don't even give a fuck about your 
clubs and cause you never,

2787
01:55:13,371 --> 01:55:16,370
no one's ever been,
there's a karaoke spots.

2788
01:55:16,371 --> 01:55:19,130
I don't know if you've ever been in 
Korea town and are fucking amazing.

2789
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,083
You get a private room with private,
like literally your own screen and your 

2790
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:24,104
own video where you and a bunch of 
families could go in and do your own 

2791
01:55:26,241 --> 01:55:28,250
Karaoke.
And it's so much fucking fun.

2792
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:31,370
I've done it in Japan and it's,
it's a blast.

2793
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:33,590
But you can't go if you're white in 
America.

2794
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:36,000
What they want to Chen man and the,
they again,

2795
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:36,950
they treat you like shit

2796
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:39,450
until you leave.
Ah,

2797
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,370
but

2798
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:42,560
in America will,
we're totally gonna allow that.

2799
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:45,480
We're gonna allow that forever.
That would be racist for us not to allow

2800
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:47,550
that for us to say,
how dare you.

2801
01:55:47,551 --> 01:55:49,590
You need to let whites and they'll,
they just shut it down.

2802
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,810
They'd find another place to do it and 
they wouldn't tell us about it.

2803
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:53,790
Hmm.
These,

2804
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:55,440
I'm telling you to say this,
these karaoke,

2805
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:56,693
that wasn't the case.
Like I liked the fact that those places 

2806
01:56:00,001 --> 01:56:00,834
exist and that it's like their culture,
but why not let other people go visit 

2807
01:56:04,621 --> 01:56:05,680
your culture?
What is it?

2808
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,920
Why Get mad?
Why?

2809
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:08,550
Why want to kick white people out?
Terrorists.

2810
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:10,860
Dare I say it's natural.
Yeah.

2811
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:12,330
Cause,
I mean dare you say,

2812
01:56:12,331 --> 01:56:13,770
how dare you.
That's,

2813
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,770
I picked that up from you and you say 
how to do,

2814
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:18,270
but listen,
think about it.

2815
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:20,730
We didn't want black people to be in our
country clubs or Jews.

2816
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:23,070
Yeah.
I'm not saying me personally,

2817
01:56:23,071 --> 01:56:25,950
but I'm saying art my people.
But it was forced on them.

2818
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:27,563
However,
in Korean spas they don't want white 

2819
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:33,270
women just walking in and just getting 
up and dressed with tattoos.

2820
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,253
They'd fucking kick you out.
But a lot of Korean spas that white 

2821
01:56:36,391 --> 01:56:40,410
women and not with tattoos.
What do Margaret Cho has a whole chunk.

2822
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:41,900
I've heard her talk about it.
No kidding.

2823
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:42,570
Yeah,
it's,

2824
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:44,410
it's shameful.
Hmm.

2825
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,713
I know that's the way in Japan nate,
cause they have those like things you 

2826
01:56:47,461 --> 01:56:50,160
put over your arms.
It wouldn't let me work out at the gym,

2827
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:52,440
see,
unless I had a long sleeve shirts.

2828
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:53,161
Right.
So,

2829
01:56:53,161 --> 01:56:54,930
so my point is,
and I'm just,

2830
01:56:54,931 --> 01:56:58,320
I'm saying this for conversation's sake,
I'm not saying it as a point of view,

2831
01:56:58,590 --> 01:56:59,423
but is it natural?
I mean look at like look at at black 

2832
01:57:01,831 --> 01:57:03,600
churches,
you walk in as a white guy.

2833
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,270
A lot of times everyone's like,
what the fuck are you doing here?

2834
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:07,493
You're going to an all black and you 
just go and I just want to praise God 

2835
01:57:09,241 --> 01:57:10,080
with you guys.
Then they're like,

2836
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:10,771
oh,
okay.

2837
01:57:10,771 --> 01:57:13,200
I mean I guess we have to let you in.
We can't kick you out.

2838
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:17,340
So I think what you're saying,
like you go to these Russian bass plays,

2839
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:20,700
you walk in as a white guy,
they literally like not speaking Russian

2840
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:23,040
and they're literally like,
what the fuck are you doing here?

2841
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:27,090
Is that natural?
It exists so often.

2842
01:57:27,091 --> 01:57:27,924
It would be a hard argument to say it 
isn't natural because there's so many 

2843
01:57:30,271 --> 01:57:31,830
versions of it.
So many,

2844
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:32,683
yeah.
It's not that it's the right choice or 

2845
01:57:34,051 --> 01:57:36,690
that it's ultimately the way people are 
going to think and behave,

2846
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:39,180
but to have it exist and to have it be 
natural.

2847
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,620
I mean it's,
it's obviously natural.

2848
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:41,663
It's so common.
It wasn't so common if nationalism and 

2849
01:57:44,101 --> 01:57:46,860
racism like on that level wasn't so 
common.

2850
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:50,160
It's more of a nationalism even than it 
is a racism.

2851
01:57:50,161 --> 01:57:50,994
Like there's some,
some countries that are like fiercely 

2852
01:57:52,411 --> 01:57:54,870
loyal to their country.
They don't want anybody else at,

2853
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:55,943
they don't want to deal with.
The Australian was like that for a long 

2854
01:57:57,181 --> 01:57:58,080
time.
Wasn't really,

2855
01:57:58,110 --> 01:58:00,540
Yo,
you see Asians couldn't immigrate.

2856
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,513
I only know this,
I wrote a paper written in high school 

2857
01:58:02,731 --> 01:58:04,430
or college,
but you see Asians,

2858
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,273
they would allow Asians in has changed.
I'm not saying Australia is like that 

2859
01:58:07,291 --> 01:58:09,300
now,
but then the second question is,

2860
01:58:09,301 --> 01:58:10,080
okay,
so we've,

2861
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:13,350
we've said that it's,
that it's natural then.

2862
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:15,060
Then what?
What is the difference?

2863
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:20,080
Like I personally don't want those 
Russian baths and there's Korean spas.

2864
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:22,140
I don't want anyone to not have their 
own shit.

2865
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,150
If you want to have it in this country,
you should have it.

2866
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:27,180
I totally agree.
Now there's personally nothing I've ever

2867
01:58:27,181 --> 01:58:30,960
grown up with in my life that I have 
that he's just white male.

2868
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:31,920
Uh,
you know,

2869
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,110
so I don't really,
I've never really had that experience.

2870
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:35,543
Although it was a child.
I would go into the country clubs and 

2871
01:58:36,841 --> 01:58:38,790
you'd see just old white men playing 
thing,

2872
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:41,680
but like,
so I don't think it'll go away.

2873
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:45,780
But then in my question is why do these 
liberals take away everything that is,

2874
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:46,623
liberals take away one thing,
but then the stuff like the Korean spa 

2875
01:58:49,571 --> 01:58:51,910
or the karaoke place or,
or the Russian baths,

2876
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:54,160
why don't they go in and protest them?
Well,

2877
01:58:54,161 --> 01:58:58,420
because the idea is that these small 
communities,

2878
01:58:58,510 --> 01:59:03,000
they retain a bit of their homeland,
a bit of your,

2879
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,370
their past and they'd have their culture
in these areas.

2880
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:07,593
And if you are a progressive person,
the idea is that you're supposed to 

2881
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:15,691
allow that kind of thinking because it 
preserves this unique culture.

2882
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:16,833
I agree kind of delicate and it is 
delicate because the kids that are 

2883
01:59:19,811 --> 01:59:20,644
assimilating into our culture,
the children of their children that are 

2884
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:24,283
assembling into the cities,
like if they're like first and second 

2885
01:59:26,471 --> 01:59:27,970
generation immigrants,
you know,

2886
01:59:27,971 --> 01:59:28,804
they eventually become Americanized and 
these cool things like the Russian bath 

2887
01:59:32,831 --> 01:59:33,664
houses or the Korean bath house,
the bond yes' and there's a bunch of 

2888
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:37,360
them,
right?

2889
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,060
I think a bunch of different like cool 
nick too.

2890
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,280
People do.
That would be a show.

2891
01:59:42,281 --> 01:59:44,470
I'd watch that on Viceland on travel 
channel.

2892
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,820
It's kind of interesting,
right?

2893
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:48,790
It's interesting to see all the 
different ways that people do things and

2894
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:49,624
if we start putting targets and kmarts 
all across the world and that becomes 

2895
01:59:53,201 --> 01:59:54,890
everything in.

2896
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,793
We all learn each other's language and 
everything slides into one set of rules 

2897
01:59:58,751 --> 02:00:00,420
for the whole planet.
Like yeah,

2898
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:01,953
probably won't be as fun.
I mean I never really had a culture so 

2899
02:00:03,851 --> 02:00:04,684
to speak because I was,
we were transplants from the north in 

2900
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:07,720
Florida.
So like I,

2901
02:00:07,721 --> 02:00:09,610
I never saw there.
And because my parents from New York and

2902
02:00:09,611 --> 02:00:10,444
Philly,
like I never felt southern so I never 

2903
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:15,520
got attached to the born in Florida.
I was born in Florida,

2904
02:00:15,521 --> 02:00:17,890
but I never,
I owed,

2905
02:00:17,891 --> 02:00:21,700
my parents were very liberal and so I,
we didn't grow up saying the m word.

2906
02:00:21,701 --> 02:00:23,980
We didn't have a rebel flag in front of 
our yard.

2907
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:26,050
So I don't have any,
like,

2908
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:27,363
I always feel,
I always say this a lot and never have 

2909
02:00:28,091 --> 02:00:28,924
any civic pride,
nor do I have any culture other than 

2910
02:00:32,231 --> 02:00:33,520
like Irish,
you know,

2911
02:00:33,521 --> 02:00:36,390
I grew up like Irish was the thing,
right.

2912
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:41,670
So I would never want to lose the 
authenticity of Korea town or,

2913
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,010
or ha like,
or,

2914
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:49,190
or chinatown or even the exclusiveness,
like going to a Korean restaurant might.

2915
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,790
One of my buddies is Roy Choi.
I haven't talked to him forever,

2916
02:00:51,791 --> 02:00:53,770
but we used to live next to,
he did a,

2917
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:57,490
he's the chef.
You've had him on the podcast and uh,

2918
02:00:58,290 --> 02:00:59,140
we,
he took us,

2919
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:02,380
he did a,
he does the Kogi Taco truck.

2920
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,750
He's got him on the podcast.
Yeah.

2921
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:05,501
No,
no.

2922
02:01:05,501 --> 02:01:08,260
You did a 100% sure.
Eddie Wong.

2923
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:10,060
Nope.
He came in with Eddie Wong.

2924
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:10,953
But Roy Choi is a very famous chef.
One of the most famous famous chefs in 

2925
02:01:13,871 --> 02:01:18,220
La Right now on episode was this type in
Roikoi.

2926
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:19,810
Uh,
Joe Rogan.

2927
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:20,621
I'm promise.
She was.

2928
02:01:20,621 --> 02:01:23,200
I watched it and I was like,
so he was with Eddie?

2929
02:01:23,410 --> 02:01:24,760
Yeah.
No,

2930
02:01:24,850 --> 02:01:26,110
nope.
He was,

2931
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:27,850
no,
I'm a hundred percent certain.

2932
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:29,710
Well I fight.

2933
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:31,810
I fight that Google's right.
Nope,

2934
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:35,290
I'm a hundred percent certain.
Eddie Wong came in one time with the guy

2935
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:36,610
that was in that movie.
The interview.

2936
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:37,593
I'm,
I'm going to go to the match on this 

2937
02:01:39,621 --> 02:01:40,790
one.
I'm looking at it right now.

2938
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:45,791
I just move on today and you're wrong.
So Bert Kreischer is going deep and he's

2939
02:01:46,881 --> 02:01:49,750
taking chances.
They're each predictions.

2940
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:54,420
He's challenging young Jamie on the air.
Boy,

2941
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:56,690
I think we got a little too high before 
this show.

2942
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:59,750
Rogan honest with you.
We've got a little ridiculous.

2943
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:02,810
Roy Choi.
Did I misspell it?

2944
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:06,380
Roy Choi,
Joe Rogan experience with Brian Stann.

2945
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,110
Hmm?
What?

2946
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:10,030
No,
that's definitely not sure.

2947
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:11,720
It says,
it says Roy Choi.

2948
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:12,970
I promise you.
Well Brian,

2949
02:02:12,971 --> 02:02:16,580
Stan was definitely by himself because 
right?

2950
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:17,863
Yeah.
Can someone please just tweet the 

2951
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:21,480
fucking answer to me cause I'm,
I promise you I saw it.

2952
02:02:21,481 --> 02:02:22,314
I,
and I would barely should make these 

2953
02:02:23,841 --> 02:02:25,490
people do the work when you're not doing
this one.

2954
02:02:25,610 --> 02:02:27,190
Not too far.
I'm too fucked up to do that.

2955
02:02:27,191 --> 02:02:29,270
Okay.
But I promise you it's all in here.

2956
02:02:29,271 --> 02:02:31,220
One time.
I know he's wrong,

2957
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:32,510
but I'm like God Damn Z,
right?

2958
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:34,340
Roy Choi,
Bro.

2959
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:35,870
Fucking Jamie.
The,

2960
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:38,210
uh,
Roy Choi created the TACO truck.

2961
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:39,203
K uh,
he's good friends with Anthony Bordain 

2962
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:43,400
and uh,
sorry,

2963
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:45,620
maybe you're spelling it wrong.
Racist.

2964
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:47,630
Whoa.
How dare you.

2965
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,320
How dare you cast upon him a moniker 
that cannot be shaken.

2966
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,360
So anyway,
damn,

2967
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:54,900
I don't even know where if I was going 
with this point,

2968
02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:58,250
have any more wine.
It's getting hot in here.

2969
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:02,680
All sorts of different types of alcohol.
We're probably out of one young Jamie,

2970
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:03,703
Jamie's going to find out,
but I don't know where my point with 

2971
02:03:05,541 --> 02:03:06,201
this going.
Oh,

2972
02:03:06,201 --> 02:03:08,180
he took it.
He took me on my wife to uh,

2973
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:11,600
he took me and my wife to um,
uh,

2974
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:13,303
to Korea town to go eat Korean barbecue 
cause you wanted to teach us from real 

2975
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:16,070
Korean barbecue.

2976
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:18,140
Like what they,
the kind that we believe it is.

2977
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:19,640
Right.
And it was interesting.

2978
02:03:19,641 --> 02:03:21,920
We went in there and no one's spoken,
no one,

2979
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:23,600
there were not only were there any white
people,

2980
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:24,463
no one spoke English at work there.
And so we actually were complete and 

2981
02:03:27,501 --> 02:03:31,530
total tourists in our own town and just 
sat and watched him order and,

2982
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:33,290
and he just was like,
don't worry,

2983
02:03:33,291 --> 02:03:34,124
I'll,
and it was really fascinating 

2984
02:03:35,271 --> 02:03:37,640
experience.
Would I want that place to ever go away?

2985
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,593
Never in a million fucking years.
I want those places to last as long as 

2986
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:43,573
son of a bitch.
Champagne motherfucker brought out 

2987
02:03:45,411 --> 02:03:47,920
champagne.
Damn.

2988
02:03:48,370 --> 02:03:51,440
Is this cause you're wrong,
Ma Fucka have a birthday.

2989
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:54,290
Uh,
but uh,

2990
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,940
but like I believe in that.
I know,

2991
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,510
but I,
I,

2992
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:57,141
but I,
then again,

2993
02:03:57,141 --> 02:03:59,110
we're on the same liberal side of the 
fence because I am a,

2994
02:03:59,111 --> 02:04:00,650
I've,
maybe I'm a libertarian or whatever.

2995
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:01,850
I am.
I'm a liberal.

2996
02:04:01,851 --> 02:04:04,280
I'm a conservative liberal.
You're conservative.

2997
02:04:04,281 --> 02:04:05,114
Liberal.
Yeah.

2998
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:08,120
What do you liberal about?
Like gay rights,

2999
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,530
gay rights,
all rights,

3000
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:11,750
all human rights,
all female gay rights,

3001
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:15,230
transgender or you name it.
I don't want you to feel like shit.

3002
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:17,240
If I can help that,
that's my job as a comic.

3003
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:19,060
My only goal is to make people laugh.
Oh,

3004
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:21,530
why would I ever want anyone to feel bad
about their day?

3005
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:24,050
That's not my Mo.
Beautiful.

3006
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:28,190
And what do you conservative about?
Um,

3007
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:29,120
like blacks?

3008
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,393
No,

3009
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:37,650
no,
the right to tell that to you.

3010
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,160
Yes.

3011
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,860
That's what I'm conservative about.
Is that conservative anymore?

3012
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:41,491
Yes,
it is.

3013
02:04:41,491 --> 02:04:44,730
Because it's still conservative,
conservative value to be able to express

3014
02:04:44,731 --> 02:04:46,050
yourself in a way that it'd be 
offensive.

3015
02:04:46,410 --> 02:04:48,270
Did you see that,
that recent ruling,

3016
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:50,250
young Jamie pulled this up because it's 
kind of interesting.

3017
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:54,730
The court ruled against this idea that 
uh,

3018
02:04:55,050 --> 02:05:00,050
there should be laws against,
what can I calm down is about to release

3019
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:01,583
the crackin.
He's going to open this cork and Brian 

3020
02:05:04,561 --> 02:05:07,440
is terrified.
Like he's never been to the gun range.

3021
02:05:08,090 --> 02:05:11,520
I of those hit me in the eye before.
Oh,

3022
02:05:11,521 --> 02:05:13,720
there you are partying with the wrong 
people sign.

3023
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:14,583
I want you to mix it into that wine and 
make a fine rose a Zinfandel or some 

3024
02:05:18,481 --> 02:05:19,314
shit.
A wine cooler that's like a watermelon 

3025
02:05:22,591 --> 02:05:24,060
lime cooler.
Barlow,

3026
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,680
James Bartles and jaymes strawberry,
right?

3027
02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:27,683
Strawberry

3028
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:32,270
double it up.
Mothers drink during the day,

3029
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:34,010
doesn't take one of the gin.
Hey,

3030
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,300
whoa,
listen.

3031
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:38,430
Okay.
I'm Kinda hammered right now where we're

3032
02:05:38,450 --> 02:05:40,680
all hammered.
We're all stone too.

3033
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:42,183
He just said you went to take it on the 
Chin after giving a story about a man 

3034
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:47,400
massaging.
I'm really led down to the Internet,

3035
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:51,830
not backing me up with this roy toy 
thing and like starting to date it looks

3036
02:05:51,831 --> 02:05:53,200
like,
but I'm pretty sure he's right.

3037
02:05:53,370 --> 02:05:55,330
He's not right.
He's right on this all the time.

3038
02:05:56,570 --> 02:05:59,150
Is that racist?
Is that racist?

3039
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:01,333
It's just a gong.
Can we get away with a gong for anybody 

3040
02:06:04,431 --> 02:06:07,150
gets mad or that you're thinking of?
No,

3041
02:06:07,151 --> 02:06:10,980
it's Roy Choi.
I want to fucking call him.

3042
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:12,050
God,
no,

3043
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:13,930
nothing.
Roy Choi.

3044
02:06:14,050 --> 02:06:14,940
Sorry.
Sorry.

3045
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:15,740
Sorry.
Sorry.

3046
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:17,960
I'm looking at all the Eddie Wong 
episodes.

3047
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:19,670
He was in here.
He wasn't in here sweetie.

3048
02:06:19,730 --> 02:06:20,563
It's okay.

3049
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:22,690
Jamie.
Sorry.

3050
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:24,670
I mean this is the only place I've 
worked here.

3051
02:06:24,671 --> 02:06:25,504
It was in this building and I pretty 
much remember every single one you 

3052
02:06:27,551 --> 02:06:28,384
would.
It would have to be super old school 

3053
02:06:29,630 --> 02:06:31,370
like to the point where I don't remember
it anymore.

3054
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:32,233
Last time you were on the show,
we drove home together or the time 

3055
02:06:34,641 --> 02:06:35,474
before and you talked about your friend,
so it must have been within the last 

3056
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:41,950
three months.
Then I only know this cause he's done.

3057
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:45,280
He's done brain tumor or something going
on.

3058
02:06:45,290 --> 02:06:46,930
You Tony.
I'm sorry.

3059
02:06:47,570 --> 02:06:48,620
I hydrated.
He,

3060
02:06:48,621 --> 02:06:49,454
I've done,
he's done bourdain show and he's done 

3061
02:06:50,391 --> 02:06:53,630
your podcast and he'd do neither for me.
So I remember going like,

3062
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:55,990
like a per day and I get it.
Why wouldn't you go on with the board?

3063
02:06:55,991 --> 02:06:59,540
And one of the greatest people on 
television for chefs.

3064
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:01,940
But I was like,
podcast was like,

3065
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,200
I was like,
I was like,

3066
02:07:03,201 --> 02:07:05,390
and I get why you do joe,
but like throw me a bone,

3067
02:07:05,391 --> 02:07:06,290
Roy.
Like we were,

3068
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,060
he's a good guy.
He's a great guy.

3069
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:09,500
But his,
uh,

3070
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:10,490
um,
no,

3071
02:07:10,490 --> 02:07:12,350
I don't want to get removed from the 
podcast.

3072
02:07:12,351 --> 02:07:15,000
Eddie Wong and Shane Smith.
I guarantee let's,

3073
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,070
maybe you hold on.
No,

3074
02:07:16,071 --> 02:07:16,311
no,
no,

3075
02:07:16,311 --> 02:07:17,001
no.
Go to the video,

3076
02:07:17,001 --> 02:07:18,830
go to the videos and see if there's 
another Asian guy.

3077
02:07:18,831 --> 02:07:20,030
Was there another Asian guy in here with
them?

3078
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,960
Yeah,
one time there was,

3079
02:07:21,961 --> 02:07:22,794
it was,
uh,

3080
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,090
it was the dude from a,
yeah,

3081
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:28,340
he was from that show,
the show,

3082
02:07:28,341 --> 02:07:29,174
uh,
off,

3083
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:31,190
uh,
off the book.

3084
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,520
What was it?
Off the boat.

3085
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:36,100
Great.
Fresh off the boat.

3086
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:36,941
Okay.
I will spend,

3087
02:07:36,941 --> 02:07:38,050
no,
I know what I'm doing tonight.

3088
02:07:38,110 --> 02:07:39,220
It's no big deal,
dude.

3089
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:40,570
Um,
he can be wrong.

3090
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:42,640
I think you're right.
Don't attach your whole life to this.

3091
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:45,040
It's just too hard to win at everything 
in life.

3092
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:46,323
You got to let some certain losses.
They're going to come your way and 

3093
02:07:49,151 --> 02:07:51,640
you've got to regroup and you've got to 
pick up the paces,

3094
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,440
paces,
paces,

3095
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:54,723
pick up the pieces and move on with life
for Christ or bigger fan of your 

3096
02:07:58,031 --> 02:08:00,250
podcast.
And you are of your podcast per person.

3097
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:01,960
I watch all of them.
Cheryl can,

3098
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:03,970
how could you ever say that?
That Joe Rogan's,

3099
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:05,880
he's not saying anything either.
So Yeah,

3100
02:08:05,930 --> 02:08:08,590
David Choe found it.
I don't even think anybody named Roy has

3101
02:08:08,591 --> 02:08:10,480
been on the pod.
He came on with David Show.

3102
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:12,010
Yup,
he did.

3103
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:15,340
He's right here.
David was been on a few times,

3104
02:08:16,210 --> 02:08:17,980
maybe came to one of the ice house 
chronicles.

3105
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:19,090
Was it an ice house?
Chronical?

3106
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:20,830
Nope.
I'm going through this.

3107
02:08:20,831 --> 02:08:23,470
Was It on David's show?
I did David show once.

3108
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:27,310
That's it.
It was five 92 with David.

3109
02:08:27,311 --> 02:08:30,330
She was the one episode I wasn't here.
Oh Shit.

3110
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:31,263
Could have been the one episode,
but Jamie was on five 63 that can't be 

3111
02:08:34,001 --> 02:08:34,840
that dumb,
dumb,

3112
02:08:34,841 --> 02:08:35,870
dumb,
dumb.

3113
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:38,813
What wasn't gave it shows podcasts that 
when did Joe Rogan was on that podcast 

3114
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:45,250
could have been.
I think that's makes more sense.

3115
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:50,560
Number five 92 I have horrible 
podcasting and know it's done.

3116
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:54,430
I have a hard time believing when we've 
actually done 750 podcasts.

3117
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:59,460
I was all five 90 to 769 69 I've done 
769 podcasts.

3118
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:05,230
Indeed preposterous.
It's great man.

3119
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:06,700
I like what you did.
Don't know.

3120
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:09,340
I think I may have told you this one 
fucked up.

3121
02:09:09,341 --> 02:09:10,540
I'm,
I'm very,

3122
02:09:10,541 --> 02:09:11,374
uh,
I'm envious in a sense of what you've 

3123
02:09:13,241 --> 02:09:15,430
done and only,
I only that I could not do it.

3124
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:18,100
Begin it now.
What you did is you kind of took,

3125
02:09:18,370 --> 02:09:19,203
you kind of took the renaissance to 
yourself and you allowed people that 

3126
02:09:21,431 --> 02:09:22,264
think differently than you to come to 
you and talk to you and you got to kind 

3127
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:27,730
of like soak it in their information 
like a sponge as a standup man.

3128
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,890
That is like,
that's the fucking,

3129
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:30,753
that's what we all should be doing.
Instead of just sitting around and 

3130
02:09:32,471 --> 02:09:33,304
going,
what does this guy think about 

3131
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,560
airplanes?
What is it?

3132
02:09:35,561 --> 02:09:36,394
You know what I mean?
You really kind of broaden the spectrum 

3133
02:09:37,901 --> 02:09:38,734
of what you want to talk about on stage.
And I remember hearing Chris rock say 

3134
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:44,223
that he got invited to Cornell Wallace's
house for Sunday dinners and right 

3135
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:49,990
before he did his most monumental hour 
and he was like,

3136
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:50,651
you know,
it was really cool.

3137
02:09:50,651 --> 02:09:52,660
I didn't say anything.
I just would sit and listen to all these

3138
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:55,540
great black wallace or West Cornell 
West,

3139
02:09:55,541 --> 02:09:57,610
my bad.
Hey Bert.

3140
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:01,650
Roy Troy was at an episode of getting 
Doug with high with Horatio's stands,

3141
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:06,990
a hero's show and me have often been 
confused race.

3142
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:14,830
There's no way.
Yes you are.

3143
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,810
Are you serious?
You know it happens.

3144
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:20,740
Let it go.
Just embrace the loss.

3145
02:10:20,741 --> 02:10:24,700
Take it on the Chin and move forward.
Soldier on,

3146
02:10:24,701 --> 02:10:27,160
sir.
It's no big deal.

3147
02:10:27,161 --> 02:10:28,390
Burt wanted a minute.
Look at them.

3148
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:30,580
Very competitive.
Very competitive.

3149
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:33,480
It's getting doug with high.
You.

3150
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:34,070
You

3151
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:37,550
realize Doug's competitive.
Robert's competitive.

3152
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:40,550
Not Competitive at all.
The opposite of competitive.

3153
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:42,470
No you're not.
I'll let you walk all over them before I

3154
02:10:42,471 --> 02:10:43,140
try to beat you.
No,

3155
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:43,421
no,
no,

3156
02:10:43,421 --> 02:10:43,691
no,
no.

3157
02:10:43,691 --> 02:10:45,850
100%.
I shot skeet shoot with Bert.

3158
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:48,110
That's very competitive.
Don't let them lie to Ya.

3159
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:50,410
Let he plays pool.
Very competitive.

3160
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:51,853
You're a secretly competitive guy.
You don't want people to know you're 

3161
02:10:54,201 --> 02:10:55,034
competitive,
cause competitive people are aggressive 

3162
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:57,344
and aggressive.
People make people uncomfortable and 

3163
02:10:58,761 --> 02:11:00,290
uncomfortable.
People are assholes,

3164
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:02,480
right?
Fuck yeah.

3165
02:11:02,481 --> 02:11:05,510
So you're saved that file and make it my
ringtone.

3166
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:09,260
Secretly competitive people were openly 
competitive,

3167
02:11:09,261 --> 02:11:13,910
are also opened a lot of criticism.
So you're seeing really competitive.

3168
02:11:13,970 --> 02:11:14,803
Blocked a motherfucker today.
He's really good at a skeet and he's 

3169
02:11:17,451 --> 02:11:19,970
good at shooting those clay pigeons way 
better than me.

3170
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:21,980
Yeah.
He cheats on his fitbit too,

3171
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:24,140
cause he knows that we're,
our accounts are connected.

3172
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:27,800
So he just like sits,
it goes like this real fast steps.

3173
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:29,420
No,
I put on my dog,

3174
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:35,120
put it on your dog's deck and give him a
stuffed animal.

3175
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:40,550
I had a buddy of mine in high school and
he had this fucking dog.

3176
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:42,890
There's the most ornery little dog,
a little poodle,

3177
02:11:42,891 --> 02:11:43,724
little type fucking thing.
And this thing would fuck stuffed 

3178
02:11:46,521 --> 02:11:47,354
animals and it had a stuffed animal that
it was his girlfriend and he would bite 

3179
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:54,440
this stuffed animal in the neck and drag
it around and he would just fuck it.

3180
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:55,813
It's weird.
One girl animals still hump because a 

3181
02:11:58,221 --> 02:11:59,750
buddy of mine,
Joe Spagnolio,

3182
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:03,260
did you know that girl animals still 
hump because it's still in their DNA.

3183
02:12:03,261 --> 02:12:05,450
It's not.
It has nothing to do about like sex.

3184
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:06,710
What do you mean?
It's like,

3185
02:12:06,770 --> 02:12:09,550
it's like a,
it's supposed to be like dominate.

3186
02:12:09,710 --> 02:12:10,543
Like I'm dominating this other thing.
It's like a girl will get on top of a 

3187
02:12:14,091 --> 02:12:14,950
dog and like,
right.

3188
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:15,880
Yeah,
yeah,

3189
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:17,060
yeah.
Oh yeah,

3190
02:12:17,061 --> 02:12:19,400
totally man.
They do that to dominate him.

3191
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:21,020
That's fucked up,
right?

3192
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:22,500
Yeah.
They,

3193
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:27,630
they're like,
they mimic fucking to dominate female.

3194
02:12:27,651 --> 02:12:28,371
Do that.
It's funny,

3195
02:12:28,371 --> 02:12:29,810
my wife withholds it to dominate.

3196
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:35,960
That's what they do.
That's what they do.

3197
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:38,570
God dammit part,
it's got damn shell game.

3198
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:43,410
It is with me right now.
You ever see the female Hyenas Dicks?

3199
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:46,610
I hold on.
If you ever seen a hyena up close.

3200
02:12:46,670 --> 02:12:47,800
No,
my think,

3201
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:49,430
I don't even think I've seen one at the 
zoo.

3202
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:52,010
Maybe I seen a fucking massive,
oh,

3203
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:54,140
they're big animals.
It's like 200 pounds,

3204
02:12:54,141 --> 02:12:56,910
right?
It has to be bigger if you,

3205
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:01,250
I psalm one up within five feet of it 
and I literally said,

3206
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:03,350
if that thing rolled through your 
neighborhood,

3207
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:04,213
you'd think it was a fucking werewolf.
Like one of the most powerful bites all 

3208
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:12,500
the mammals to so incredibly powerful 
jaws and low hindquarters.

3209
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,393
Like almost like a gorilla baird up.
Brian Callen told me his fucking story 

3210
02:13:17,421 --> 02:13:19,460
once about this,
I guess,

3211
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:22,010
I don't remember it was a guy or a girl,
but uh,

3212
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:27,040
they were a tries of are you getting a 
third hand stoned version of this story?

3213
02:13:27,081 --> 02:13:31,860
But someone was training hyenas and they
rolled the ankle and had a limp

3214
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,800
and as soon as the Hyena realized they 
had a limp,

3215
02:13:34,801 --> 02:13:35,634
even though the a train this Hyena,
the Hyena attacked him and it took a 

3216
02:13:38,431 --> 02:13:42,870
chunk out of their calf just clamped 
down and a bit them and they had a fight

3217
02:13:42,871 --> 02:13:43,704
it off and it couldn't help itself.
It saw her like limping and its 

3218
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:48,683
instincts took over.
A just kicked in even though like this 

3219
02:13:51,511 --> 02:13:52,344
person was trained,
I don't remember what was the guy or 

3220
02:13:53,251 --> 02:13:56,010
girl if they were training this fucking 
Hyena,

3221
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:59,820
like when the shit hit the fan,
when the Hyena saw limp.

3222
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:01,700
It's nature.
It's,

3223
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:05,640
it's like programming kicked in.
That's nuts,

3224
02:14:05,641 --> 02:14:07,920
man.
Like the nature nurture argument.

3225
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:12,090
I guess it didn't work on hyenas.
Fuck no man.

3226
02:14:12,091 --> 02:14:15,060
These things are monsters.
Monsters.

3227
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:17,340
They're fucking,
they're really weird.

3228
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:18,750
It's a weird animal,
man.

3229
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:23,700
The females are bigger than the males.
I'll give them dude,

3230
02:14:23,850 --> 02:14:26,640
come on that sign an avatar animal.
That's a real animal.

3231
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:28,820
That is a total God avatar.
Anna,

3232
02:14:28,890 --> 02:14:32,790
living in Africa with lions,
this picture is of,

3233
02:14:32,810 --> 02:14:35,190
it might not be a cock.
It might be a female cock.

3234
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:37,620
The babies come out of those things too,
dude.

3235
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:40,110
That's what's crazy.
The babies come out of their dick.

3236
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:41,310
Yup.
Yeah.

3237
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:45,530
I'm pretty sure I might be so high.
It's so funny looking at it.

3238
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:49,080
Is that like used as the same as a cock 
or is it just like a woman?

3239
02:14:49,110 --> 02:14:53,270
Like a female has a Pussy Boehner.
Sometimes it comes out like our clit and

3240
02:14:53,290 --> 02:14:54,690
gets long and far.
No,

3241
02:14:54,691 --> 02:14:55,111
no,
no.

3242
02:14:55,111 --> 02:14:55,690
This is,

3243
02:14:55,690 --> 02:14:56,523
it's called a foe penis.
I think it's the only mammal that has a 

3244
02:14:59,531 --> 02:15:00,550
foe.
Penis.

3245
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:03,010
I Dunno if I need reptiles or fish have 
one,

3246
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:08,250
but it's a fake penis and that fake 
penis is also where the babies come out.

3247
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:12,130
So if it's a female,
a female has sex.

3248
02:15:12,190 --> 02:15:13,660
I don't know how the fuck she has.

3249
02:15:14,010 --> 02:15:14,843
Can we not see them?
Look at the birth of the baby comes out 

3250
02:15:18,901 --> 02:15:20,760
of there where there's a man,
male have sex.

3251
02:15:20,761 --> 02:15:24,970
Jamie investigate.
Where is the male stick is done.

3252
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,460
It's called Jamie.
I know this.

3253
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:29,130
It's called Daca.
Hyena giving birth on Safari.

3254
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:32,970
Jamie go.
Jesus.

3255
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:34,891
What happened?
I missed it.

3256
02:15:34,891 --> 02:15:35,724
Just watching.
A lot of baby stuff come out of her 

3257
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:38,033
pussy hall puts his Dick.
You can't see pussy if it's an animal 

3258
02:15:40,531 --> 02:15:42,120
because you look at it just comes out in
the sack.

3259
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,510
If you say animals pussy,
you seem like a real creep.

3260
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:47,040
Yeah,
but vagina even sound awesome.

3261
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:50,370
Look at that fucking Oh,

3262
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:54,490
oh good golly.
Walk at that thing.

3263
02:15:55,810 --> 02:15:59,470
What a weird animal.
And then what a harsh,

3264
02:15:59,710 --> 02:16:00,543
harsh fucking place to live.
Do you see that picture I posted on 

3265
02:16:02,591 --> 02:16:05,670
instagram meal the day somebody posted 
it on the message board?

3266
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:08,260
I uh,
I found it on the Google.

3267
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:09,980
Yeah.

3268
02:16:09,980 --> 02:16:12,080
Are Copied and pasted on my own.
Which one it was,

3269
02:16:12,081 --> 02:16:16,460
but it's a lion with a um,
whoa.

3270
02:16:16,610 --> 02:16:18,760
Is that the female fucking the mail or 
mating?

3271
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,390
Ooh,
this is an actual meeting.

3272
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,010
Meeting Hyenas at the zoo.

3273
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:23,973
Okay.

3274
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:27,060
Oh my God.
So that's where we got it.

3275
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:32,230
Oh God.
What in the fuck.

3276
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:33,693
By the way,
my wife gives that same face sometimes 

3277
02:16:35,201 --> 02:16:36,670
like wrap it up.
Pig boy,

3278
02:16:36,671 --> 02:16:38,710
people are watching.
This is horrific.

3279
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:40,120
Oh my God.
He's calling in.

3280
02:16:40,810 --> 02:16:41,643
He's doing yard on that pussy.
But it's almost like he's like barely 

3281
02:16:43,721 --> 02:16:44,930
alive.
Like he's,

3282
02:16:44,931 --> 02:16:45,641
this is like,
he's like,

3283
02:16:45,641 --> 02:16:48,190
he's trying to climb a fence and he 
can't quite get over it.

3284
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:50,140
You know,
it doesn't look violent.

3285
02:16:50,141 --> 02:16:50,974
It looks like he's a dying person trying
to make it over a fence and the noises 

3286
02:16:53,831 --> 02:16:54,664
he's making.
It sounds like esther co he's checks 

3287
02:16:58,571 --> 02:16:59,404
after,
after he shoots his load in there and 

3288
02:17:00,091 --> 02:17:01,210
starts licking her.
Oh,

3289
02:17:01,211 --> 02:17:02,044
he cream pied.
He discussing cream pies gusting 

3290
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:07,120
perfect.
She's just frozen there.

3291
02:17:07,121 --> 02:17:07,960
Look at her.
She's like,

3292
02:17:07,961 --> 02:17:11,200
what just happened that you never 
happened before?

3293
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:13,570
What just happened?
You gotta think like that's probably the

3294
02:17:13,571 --> 02:17:15,640
first time she's ever been fucked,
right?

3295
02:17:16,390 --> 02:17:18,040
That Hyena,
that the female,

3296
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,450
no,
I'm sure she's been being full line to,

3297
02:17:20,451 --> 02:17:21,960
it was a pop.
I promise you that.

3298
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,430
I don't meant to sound racist about 
hyenas,

3299
02:17:24,470 --> 02:17:25,303
but fucking monsters.
But don't they have rules in the 

3300
02:17:27,951 --> 02:17:30,040
Armenian community and you can fuck your
kids.

3301
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:35,020
They all fuck kids manatees right now.
I'm gonna get hate mail.

3302
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:36,430
If you could,
what would you pick?

3303
02:17:36,431 --> 02:17:37,340
Ready?
Uh,

3304
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:40,480
are safari with your children?
Right,

3305
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:41,231
right.
Goes far.

3306
02:17:41,231 --> 02:17:45,580
I see all the animals or hunting trip.
Uh,

3307
02:17:45,581 --> 02:17:46,414
one of the good ones where it's 
conservative and it's the money goes 

3308
02:17:48,341 --> 02:17:51,040
back to the people.
I don't want to go hunt in Africa.

3309
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:51,953
Really.
I can't imagine any conservation 

3310
02:17:54,851 --> 02:17:55,684
argument that you could ever make,
which is like one of the most important 

3311
02:17:58,181 --> 02:17:59,620
arguments for,
for hunting.

3312
02:18:00,110 --> 02:18:00,943
I don't,
I can't imagine any conservation effort 

3313
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:03,653
you,
you would make where it's like to get 

3314
02:18:06,311 --> 02:18:07,144
your meat,
you're going to get in a plane and 

3315
02:18:08,711 --> 02:18:12,970
you're going to fly across the ocean.
It's going to take you 16 hours and then

3316
02:18:12,971 --> 02:18:15,010
you're going to kill something over 
there and they get it.

3317
02:18:15,011 --> 02:18:15,844
Bring it back on a plane all the way to 
California or the way to Michigan or 

3318
02:18:19,661 --> 02:18:21,150
wherever you live.
Like

3319
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:24,173
the only reason why I'd be going over 
there is cause I enjoyed hunting and I 

3320
02:18:27,191 --> 02:18:28,510
don't think there's anything wrong with 
that,

3321
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:33,430
but I haven't crossed into that yet.
I'm not into it and I shouldn't even say

3322
02:18:33,431 --> 02:18:36,760
yet because I don't think I ever will.
I'm never going to shoot a lion.

3323
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:38,500
I don't want to shoot anything I don't 
want to eat.

3324
02:18:38,830 --> 02:18:40,750
I don't want to go.
I just don't,

3325
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:45,780
I don't have a desire to like go and 
shoot something that I would never bring

3326
02:18:47,531 --> 02:18:49,180
home and eat.
Like those,

3327
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:51,850
those things are sort of,
they don't make any sense to me.

3328
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:54,040
I get the,
I get how they need to happen.

3329
02:18:54,070 --> 02:18:54,903
Like you know the Zimbabwe,
this is an article recently about the 

3330
02:18:56,381 --> 02:18:58,270
Cecil,
the lion thing that's kind of fucked up.

3331
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,373
They're going to call 200 lions in 
Zimbabwe because hunters aren't going 

3332
02:19:02,591 --> 02:19:04,770
there anymore.
So they have this too.

3333
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:07,990
They have too many lions.
So because they have too many lines,

3334
02:19:07,991 --> 02:19:09,320
the cows,
the angeles,

3335
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:12,010
the wild animals that they have roaming 
around through the,

3336
02:19:12,011 --> 02:19:14,530
the fields,
apparently they're getting devastated.

3337
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:17,620
So their solution is to go out and call 
200 lines,

3338
02:19:17,621 --> 02:19:18,454
which means they're going to shoot him.
Not only is it not going to give them 

3339
02:19:20,501 --> 02:19:21,334
any money,
but they're going to have to pay money 

3340
02:19:22,661 --> 02:19:25,210
to someone to go out there and find 
these lines and shoot them.

3341
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:28,250
So it comes at a desk.
A deficit

3342
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:32,900
is Zimbabwe Park to call 200 lines site 
lack of hunters.

3343
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:36,470
So since there's the look,
it's not,

3344
02:19:36,530 --> 02:19:37,400
see,
again,

3345
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:39,430
I'm not saying that you should go on a 
lion.

3346
02:19:39,690 --> 02:19:40,640
I would never,
I would never,

3347
02:19:40,641 --> 02:19:43,010
I have no interest in killing a lion,
ever.

3348
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:44,210
No interest.
However,

3349
02:19:44,211 --> 02:19:45,080
however,
how much,

3350
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:47,660
so like let's ballpark it.
$50,000

3351
02:19:47,661 --> 02:19:50,060
for each line.
So if they're going to do 200 lines,

3352
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:53,940
it'd be what does that $10 million and 
this is hurting my,

3353
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:55,310
the lines.
No,

3354
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:57,260
it's not that much.
$10 million.

3355
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:58,180
It's a million,
right?

3356
02:19:58,181 --> 02:20:00,410
At $2 million to dollars.
Wait a minute.

3357
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:01,970
How many people is it?
How many?

3358
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:04,550
It was $50,000
and how many lions?

3359
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:09,050
200 so it's,
it's $200 thousand lines.

3360
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:11,600
And it was,
it was a hundred hunters.

3361
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:17,200
It would be our hundred thousand dollars
and $50 it's two.

3362
02:20:21,250 --> 02:20:26,250
It's 210 months.
It was Roy Choi is $10 million.

3363
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:31,040
It's 200 lines at $50,000
a lion.

3364
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:33,830
Right?
So they missed out on all that money and

3365
02:20:33,831 --> 02:20:37,520
$10 million that could keep the pride 
health.

3366
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:41,390
How is it $10 million?
Because if it's $100,000

3367
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:46,391
and there's a hundred lions,
isn't that now $100,000?

3368
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:47,900
Yeah,
it's 10 million bucks.

3369
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:49,413
Welcome.
I hope they're drinking partying with 

3370
02:20:54,171 --> 02:20:55,220
us.
Oh,

3371
02:20:55,221 --> 02:20:56,120
for sure.
People are,

3372
02:20:56,330 --> 02:21:00,440
I just think like be the dumbest person 
at math ever lived.

3373
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:02,360
It's like sport.
The top,

3374
02:21:02,390 --> 02:21:04,760
I'm in the top three doubles people at 
math.

3375
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:06,350
Yeah,
sports and math.

3376
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:07,760
I just had a visual.
There's two.

3377
02:21:07,761 --> 02:21:11,420
This should be a sketch.
Joe with his daughter doing math and her

3378
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:13,180
going like,
I don't fucking know her.

3379
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,320
Just him just stopping to go,
want to learn the number.

3380
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:17,473
This is what I,
this is what I learned when I was in 

3381
02:21:18,711 --> 02:21:23,711
high school calculators.
They're always right and we're not going

3382
02:21:24,141 --> 02:21:24,974
to run out of batteries.
So what you'd do is you'd go to a 

3383
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:30,050
calculator and in my fucking brain I was
done.

3384
02:21:30,051 --> 02:21:34,250
Two numbers were not even remotely 
important to me.

3385
02:21:34,850 --> 02:21:37,670
I don't the,
the quest for like to,

3386
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:41,060
to calculate things and I get that.
It's a nice little game.

3387
02:21:41,061 --> 02:21:43,650
It's a little puzzle for your mind,
but it's not interesting enough for you.

3388
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:45,770
Do you remember when they told you,
oh,

3389
02:21:45,771 --> 02:21:46,604
and you'll just carry a calculator in 
your pocket around all day or are you 

3390
02:21:48,201 --> 02:21:49,520
going to learn how to do math and you're
like,

3391
02:21:49,580 --> 02:21:54,580
how can we calculate a stupid,
how often does it come up?

3392
02:21:57,471 --> 02:21:59,960
I mean I knew how to like carry the 
money.

3393
02:21:59,961 --> 02:22:01,520
If I,
if I worked at a register,

3394
02:22:01,521 --> 02:22:02,354
someone maybe a $27 and 50 cents due 
back and change and knew how to dish 

3395
02:22:07,161 --> 02:22:10,470
that I was fucked that one up.
I would always go see,

3396
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:11,333
gave me 20 bucks.
You paid $16 well here's four and then 

3397
02:22:14,121 --> 02:22:16,010
here's the change.
I was given a dollar extra.

3398
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:19,500
I never did the math of like three and 
then or whatever.

3399
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:25,770
It's so funny mathematics or weird thing
because

3400
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:29,800
it's a simple mathematics like 
calculations like addition,

3401
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:31,830
multiplication,
division stuff.

3402
02:22:31,831 --> 02:22:32,664
Do you have to do in your head that that
everybody associates with math like Oh 

3403
02:22:35,611 --> 02:22:36,660
God,
that's so boring.

3404
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:39,720
But then you get to weird math like 
math.

3405
02:22:39,721 --> 02:22:40,554
That's kind of solving equations about 
like how big a black hole is trying to 

3406
02:22:47,071 --> 02:22:47,904
figure out like gravity waves and 
they're doing a lot of that stuff with 

3407
02:22:52,171 --> 02:22:57,171
mathematics and they're analyzing data 
and measuring and calculating and trying

3408
02:22:57,691 --> 02:23:01,830
to figure out like the way the fucking 
universe works.

3409
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:05,760
And it's all with some strange math that
you gotta go deep,

3410
02:23:05,761 --> 02:23:06,181
deep,
deep,

3411
02:23:06,181 --> 02:23:07,014
deep,
deep into get to that goodwill hunting 

3412
02:23:08,461 --> 02:23:09,294
shit.
They,

3413
02:23:09,510 --> 02:23:10,343
when they,

3414
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:15,270
oh someone make one video of just 
explaining that kind of problem.

3415
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:16,830
And what's the deal with remainders?

3416
02:23:17,430 --> 02:23:19,250
I don't understand.
I don't know.

3417
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:20,513
Is saying clown possie right now.
And what's the deal with the remainder 

3418
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:25,313
magnets

3419
02:23:29,820 --> 02:23:31,350
by the way,
in a parallel universe,

3420
02:23:31,351 --> 02:23:34,290
everyone's drinking it.
Doug Stan hope's house watching this.

3421
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:38,040
What a great fucking life.
This is hilarious dude.

3422
02:23:38,190 --> 02:23:39,690
Fucking magnets.
How they work,

3423
02:23:39,691 --> 02:23:40,524
Bro.
I got a credit Brian Poo sane for 

3424
02:23:42,241 --> 02:23:43,074
fucking in turning me on to that.
He said that somewhere and I heard him 

3425
02:23:45,421 --> 02:23:48,650
say that and I fucking left dude.
You gotta say two days.

3426
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:51,420
Steve Agee is one of the funniest 
motherfuckers alive.

3427
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:53,640
That guy's so fucking talented.
Next thing.

3428
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:55,530
Mct Oil.
In your shakes.

3429
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:59,130
Don't put a lot or you poop your shelf.
It's true and strong,

3430
02:23:59,190 --> 02:24:01,560
strong advice.
I deserts,

3431
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:05,010
I'm put a teaspoon in a couple of 
tablespoons,

3432
02:24:05,011 --> 02:24:06,450
you'd be fine.
Does it fine.

3433
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:10,860
Do you find that it binds to you longer 
and you binds to you?

3434
02:24:10,861 --> 02:24:12,510
So I do my shakes,
my shakes,

3435
02:24:12,511 --> 02:24:14,760
our uh,
our um,

3436
02:24:14,990 --> 02:24:15,823
k like a little Dick Loaded Kale,
a alma milk your protein and you pack 

3437
02:24:20,101 --> 02:24:20,934
your Dick with a stick or when you get a
dick load usually happening around the 

3438
02:24:24,451 --> 02:24:27,900
outside with baby powder load.

3439
02:24:28,260 --> 02:24:30,390
I feel it all the way to the top of 
Kale.

3440
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,040
Right?
And then I pushed it down a little bit.

3441
02:24:32,041 --> 02:24:34,800
I put some frozen fruit and they're 
usually blueberries or something.

3442
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:38,370
I do your uh,
hemp protein.

3443
02:24:38,490 --> 02:24:42,210
And then I do mean green from trader 
Joe's and that's my shake.

3444
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,073
Okay.
But then I just heard you say somewhere 

3445
02:24:44,911 --> 02:24:48,240
that mct oil helps bind the proteins 
are,

3446
02:24:48,241 --> 02:24:50,850
helps bond the nutrients to your,
to your fat cells.

3447
02:24:51,230 --> 02:24:52,063
And I believe Rob Wolf to told me that,
who the fuck told me that one of those 

3448
02:24:55,801 --> 02:24:56,634
guys.
So I was doing my shakes and I was 

3449
02:24:57,691 --> 02:25:01,680
noticing shitting like a wolf within two
hours before,

3450
02:25:01,681 --> 02:25:04,010
before the MCT oil.
I take the mic,

3451
02:25:04,030 --> 02:25:06,240
oh shit.
Fucking right out of his ass.

3452
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:08,610
Crazy like Howell's.
Why does it,

3453
02:25:08,611 --> 02:25:10,200
yeah,
it's going to be quicker than a dog than

3454
02:25:10,201 --> 02:25:11,970
a house dog.
How many anger involved?

3455
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:13,230
Oh Dude,
it's a wolf.

3456
02:25:13,231 --> 02:25:15,720
He's got predators.
He's got of pack.

3457
02:25:15,721 --> 02:25:17,460
He's got to hang with it.
Fucking happens quick.

3458
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:21,030
Why are you using Kale and mean?
Green is they're not the same shit.

3459
02:25:21,090 --> 02:25:21,923
I don't know.
I would imagine on wolf would take an 

3460
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:23,823
angry shit.

3461
02:25:24,990 --> 02:25:25,823
Teeth glared just just shitting out 
quick because it doesn't want to feel 

3462
02:25:29,951 --> 02:25:30,784
vulnerable,
doesn't want some other wall to come 

3463
02:25:34,811 --> 02:25:36,970
along and try to take the office spot.
I agree.

3464
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:43,200
What a Rudel society can imagine.
If you were a wolf and you just lived on

3465
02:25:45,101 --> 02:25:45,934
a mountain and all you did is run around
and bite shit chase things and you're 

3466
02:25:50,041 --> 02:25:53,710
your number one instinct is chase things
and chop at their legs.

3467
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,280
That's what they like to do.
I'd like to run up behind cows,

3468
02:25:57,281 --> 02:25:59,320
run up behind elk,
whatever.

3469
02:25:59,321 --> 02:26:01,630
You can get deer and they paint their 
legs,

3470
02:26:02,090 --> 02:26:03,280
their legs,
and they,

3471
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:04,133
they'll chase them and they bite their 
legs again and they'll take down a big 

3472
02:26:06,851 --> 02:26:09,040
ass animal.
That way they'll take down a mousse.

3473
02:26:09,110 --> 02:26:14,110
Sounds like social justice warriors.
Fuck yes.

3474
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:16,023
Are you upset?

3475
02:26:16,410 --> 02:26:17,970
It was social justice warriors?
Yeah,

3476
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:19,700
hundred percent.
What's going on?

3477
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:20,593
Oh,
like when I see someone like Kurt 

3478
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:22,970
Metzger who I find to be fucking 
hilarious,

3479
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:25,190
when I watched people attack him based 
on,

3480
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:26,293
based on some list of fucking demands,
they have like terrorists as opposed to 

3481
02:26:31,250 --> 02:26:32,520
the demands.
What did they do this,

3482
02:26:32,570 --> 02:26:33,980
this,
this is a broad stroke.

3483
02:26:33,981 --> 02:26:38,170
I know that Kurt almost lost his job on 
amy show by amy saved him.

3484
02:26:38,210 --> 02:26:41,360
Amy stood up for him,
but because he did some thing,

3485
02:26:41,370 --> 02:26:42,740
I'm,
Kurt didn't want to talk about it,

3486
02:26:42,741 --> 02:26:44,510
so I'm not gonna talk about it,
but okay.

3487
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:45,980
I mean,
maybe he did talk about it.

3488
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,570
You Go,
I'm sure curse on the show.

3489
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:51,440
Jamie mother fucker.
But uh,

3490
02:26:51,710 --> 02:26:52,790
but like,
I don't know man.

3491
02:26:52,791 --> 02:26:57,230
I just find,
I just find that shit bothersome and I,

3492
02:26:57,231 --> 02:26:59,420
and I,
it looks like wolves just trying to bite

3493
02:26:59,421 --> 02:27:01,820
until someone goes,
until some corporation goes,

3494
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,430
he's been bitten the doll,
it's fucking weak.

3495
02:27:04,431 --> 02:27:05,264
Let's eat it.
This is what I think we have to really 

3496
02:27:06,111 --> 02:27:06,300
be

3497
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:09,530
careful about.
We have to really be careful about an I,

3498
02:27:09,531 --> 02:27:10,364
I mean us,
I mean as humans we got to really be 

3499
02:27:13,501 --> 02:27:18,000
careful about trying to get other people
to think and behave the way we do.

3500
02:27:18,810 --> 02:27:22,260
Like once you establish like sort of a,
uh,

3501
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:27,060
a guideline of how we all want to be 
treated with each other,

3502
02:27:28,530 --> 02:27:29,363
you're going to have disagreements.
And if you believe one thing and I 

3503
02:27:32,251 --> 02:27:35,250
believe something that's different than 
what you believe,

3504
02:27:36,330 --> 02:27:37,163
it can become a real problem if I 
decided to go after you for your belief 

3505
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:45,390
and attack you for your belief and try 
to get you fired for your belief.

3506
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:46,613
Right?
Yeah.

3507
02:27:46,620 --> 02:27:49,110
That's where it gets weird.
Like,

3508
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:51,360
and especially when it comes to 
something like standup,

3509
02:27:51,390 --> 02:27:56,250
which requires a certain amount of 
offensive thinking they requires,

3510
02:27:56,251 --> 02:27:58,050
if you want stand up that I'm going to 
enjoy.

3511
02:27:58,350 --> 02:28:00,630
You got to take some risks,
you got to be offensive.

3512
02:28:00,650 --> 02:28:01,483
You,
you have to be offensive and an honest 

3513
02:28:02,311 --> 02:28:03,144
way that is undeniable,
especially in this era because we're 

3514
02:28:06,271 --> 02:28:07,104
living in this era where we're supposed 
to pretend that certain differences 

3515
02:28:09,301 --> 02:28:11,820
don't exist and diversities the most 
important thing.

3516
02:28:11,821 --> 02:28:12,654
But there's some hilarious differences 
and it's one of the reasons why we like 

3517
02:28:15,511 --> 02:28:19,710
black comics because black comics can 
shit all over white people and it's just

3518
02:28:19,711 --> 02:28:22,250
the same kind of funny racial

3519
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,083
humor and it's totally acceptable 
because white people been Dick's to 

3520
02:28:26,571 --> 02:28:28,910
black people for so long that it's like 
in,

3521
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,680
it's just in the guidelines.
It's a lot.

3522
02:28:30,681 --> 02:28:35,060
It's like if you go back to old like 
Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryor bits,

3523
02:28:35,390 --> 02:28:37,880
like they were great and white people 
like them,

3524
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:38,990
you know?
It's like,

3525
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,460
like it relieved a little tension to 
have him shit on white people,

3526
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:44,410
you know?
Yeah.

3527
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:46,790
I like Katt Williams.
I still like Katt Williams.

3528
02:28:46,791 --> 02:28:47,541
Yeah,
dude,

3529
02:28:47,541 --> 02:28:48,374
I want to tour with their guys.
That guy is so the one I love when he 

3530
02:28:51,111 --> 02:28:53,540
gets into a preachy mode,
do I like what he's sweating in?

3531
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:55,430
His hair's fucked up and his shirts 
soaking.

3532
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:56,773
I love that dude.
He's wild and you know he gets crazy 

3533
02:28:59,631 --> 02:29:01,820
sometimes and things go off the rails 
yesterday.

3534
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,860
He's awesome.
Did he go off the rails yesterday?

3535
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:05,540
Something like that.
He punched some guy.

3536
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:07,910
Maybe that guy was talking shit.
Okay,

3537
02:29:07,911 --> 02:29:09,670
I got your back cat.
I got,

3538
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:12,650
I'm on cats team right now.
Funny as fuck man.

3539
02:29:12,651 --> 02:29:16,060
I think he's one of my all time favorite
comedians as far as like,

3540
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:16,953
like when he's in the groove,
when he's talked and moving and he's 

3541
02:29:19,161 --> 02:29:22,280
crushing it.
He's a motherfucker,

3542
02:29:22,310 --> 02:29:24,860
dude.
He's maybe your ass pussy.

3543
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:28,580
I liked dude.
Katt Williams is fo force in nature when

3544
02:29:28,581 --> 02:29:29,840
he's on.
He's a force of nature,

3545
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:30,950
man.
He's just so good.

3546
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:32,540
The thing is,
Shit.

3547
02:29:32,650 --> 02:29:33,483
Oh,
Challenges Kevin Hart to a $5 million 

3548
02:29:35,811 --> 02:29:40,811
battle and explains Georgia arrest.
How do you not love this?

3549
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:45,800
Oh my God,
I love him.

3550
02:29:46,930 --> 02:29:47,950
Well,
social media,

3551
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:49,870
boy,
I know what you do,

3552
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:51,670
but you do it from life.
Life.

3553
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:53,770
Have you do it for real.
Here it is,

3554
02:29:53,771 --> 02:29:54,604
Kevin.
I've got a show at Joe Hometown and 

3555
02:29:58,481 --> 02:29:59,314
Philly.
I'm gonna tape my special Nair on that 

3556
02:30:02,371 --> 02:30:04,270
stage.
We can put whatever you want.

3557
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:08,560
A full court basketball court,
a boxing ring,

3558
02:30:09,790 --> 02:30:10,623
two microphones for a rap cypher,
or you can get y'all ass dusted in 

3559
02:30:15,761 --> 02:30:20,350
comedy on that stage.
$1 million up for each one.

3560
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:24,930
That's $5 million minster 28 million in 
forms.

3561
02:30:25,630 --> 02:30:28,690
I'll be bringing mine and cash.
Mitch,

3562
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:32,650
bring yours however you won't as issue.
Not a puppet.

3563
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:34,900
Don't bring no white people with in.

3564
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:42,570
You didn't take it all or you had taking
part in parcel.

3565
02:30:42,910 --> 02:30:45,670
Oh my goodness.
The no load by the way,

3566
02:30:45,671 --> 02:30:46,800
he's wearing a fur coat.
Oh,

3567
02:30:47,650 --> 02:30:48,920
he's wearing a fur coat.
He made try.

3568
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:49,833
It's hard over his face.
He made a hard side stand in front of a 

3569
02:30:51,731 --> 02:30:53,680
Lamborghini.
Just got out of a private jet.

3570
02:30:54,310 --> 02:30:57,250
We make enough money to drink out a real
blast where?

3571
02:30:57,740 --> 02:30:59,350
Oh Shit.
Do you get that reference?

3572
02:30:59,351 --> 02:31:01,810
Told them to give her the plastic cup.
Do you get that reference?

3573
02:31:02,110 --> 02:31:02,830
No.
Okay.

3574
02:31:02,830 --> 02:31:04,270
I love Kevin by the way.
Love cat.

3575
02:31:04,330 --> 02:31:05,163
Okay.
Kevin did a comedy group with all the 

3576
02:31:07,721 --> 02:31:09,910
guys at tour with them and they all,
the guys that tore them,

3577
02:31:09,911 --> 02:31:14,080
they call themselves a plastic cup boys.
So he goes to,

3578
02:31:14,081 --> 02:31:16,900
so he says,
fuck y'all plastic cup boys.

3579
02:31:16,990 --> 02:31:19,770
We drink out of a real glass.
Oh,

3580
02:31:19,771 --> 02:31:20,060
I want

3581
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:21,930
to be black right now.
So fucking bad.

3582
02:31:22,190 --> 02:31:23,023
Can you just enjoy on the sidelines 
without wanting to be a part of the 

3583
02:31:24,861 --> 02:31:25,694
actual,

3584
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:26,553
I want to.
I want it.

3585
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:28,060
You know what I want to do?
You know what I want to do?

3586
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:29,770
I want to tell me I want,
I want to be in that world.

3587
02:31:29,771 --> 02:31:31,960
I want to be in a fur coat.
I'm going to recreate that with,

3588
02:31:31,961 --> 02:31:35,050
but I'm going to do it to Thompson Mura 
and and I'm going to be like,

3589
02:31:35,051 --> 02:31:36,340
fuck,
fuck y'all babies.

3590
02:31:36,341 --> 02:31:39,820
We got real kids have like you could 
reenact it.

3591
02:31:39,821 --> 02:31:41,500
Sort of like how they reenact the civil 
war.

3592
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:42,513
You guys can read it and ask the cat and
Kevin Hart comedy feud if it were to 

3593
02:31:47,921 --> 02:31:51,010
really go down.
He's got his jet going in the background

3594
02:31:51,011 --> 02:31:53,050
and he got into a Lamborghini dude.
First of all,

3595
02:31:53,051 --> 02:31:56,260
who's Lamborghini is that in his jet and
where'd you get the fur coat?

3596
02:31:57,070 --> 02:31:59,160
And he's only bringing in $5 million of 
his cash.

3597
02:31:59,161 --> 02:32:00,740
He does not have enough done.
Well,

3598
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:01,900
he might,
he might.

3599
02:32:01,930 --> 02:32:02,621
I mean,
look,

3600
02:32:02,621 --> 02:32:04,750
that guy can do giant places.
Katt Williams.

3601
02:32:04,770 --> 02:32:05,710
Even though,
like I said,

3602
02:32:05,711 --> 02:32:07,210
he's gone off the rails a couple of 
times.

3603
02:32:07,330 --> 02:32:08,163
He could still do giant player.
He's one of the best comics in the 

3604
02:32:09,551 --> 02:32:11,350
world.
Why?

3605
02:32:11,351 --> 02:32:13,600
Why has he not been on your podcast yet?
I never met him.

3606
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:15,790
Oh Dude.
No where we work.

3607
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,550
He rolls with shook too.
I've met him twice.

3608
02:32:21,950 --> 02:32:22,691
He's a,
he,

3609
02:32:22,691 --> 02:32:25,060
by the way,
he's a legit hip hop dude.

3610
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:26,493
He rolled,
I think he went up against Camron and 

3611
02:32:28,591 --> 02:32:33,290
dip squad and like how to fuck a rap 
battle against like,

3612
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:34,100
like,
like uh,

3613
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:36,580
I think someone got shot for it.
Can you google that?

3614
02:32:36,581 --> 02:32:41,581
Jamie sequoia was there like,
he's man,

3615
02:32:42,370 --> 02:32:43,600
he's a fascinating guy.

3616
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:46,820
When his standup is on,
it's just a sensational and who would,

3617
02:32:46,821 --> 02:32:49,990
he's sweating and pacing and you know,
he's just sensational.

3618
02:32:50,180 --> 02:32:54,020
What my thing was is that I worked with 
my good friends with red grant,

3619
02:32:54,290 --> 02:32:57,020
which is one of his openers.
And uh,

3620
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:58,850
he always paid the comics he worked 
with,

3621
02:32:58,851 --> 02:33:00,230
well,
it was treated them nice.

3622
02:33:00,470 --> 02:33:01,670
That's so fucking important.

3623
02:33:01,850 --> 02:33:02,683
He,
he said something that I remember 

3624
02:33:03,841 --> 02:33:04,674
reading or watching a video rather and 
he was talking and it made total sense 

3625
02:33:08,491 --> 02:33:10,650
and I didn't really consider it that 
much before.

3626
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:13,500
He was like,
I never eat before I go onstage.

3627
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:16,710
I don't want to have any food digesting 
in my stomach.

3628
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:18,120
And then I thought about it,
I was like,

3629
02:33:18,121 --> 02:33:18,451
what?
Well,

3630
02:33:18,451 --> 02:33:19,284
what is it like the like it could be 
like seven o'clock and the show's at 

3631
02:33:21,571 --> 02:33:23,290
eight like I got to eat.
I gotta.

3632
02:33:23,291 --> 02:33:24,120
Yeah,
I gotta eat.

3633
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:26,550
Do you really like most of the time you 
don't like,

3634
02:33:26,551 --> 02:33:27,384
we're so spoiled.
Like most of the time you can go like a 

3635
02:33:29,221 --> 02:33:32,190
long time without actually eating and 
you'll be fine.

3636
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:34,410
It's like you have a little bit of a 
craving,

3637
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,393
but it's almost too much for us to lock.
Got Actors on stage and he was saying 

3638
02:33:38,491 --> 02:33:40,680
that like eating before you go onstage.

3639
02:33:40,710 --> 02:33:41,543
It slows you down,
it slows down your thinking because you 

3640
02:33:42,691 --> 02:33:44,310
body needs the energy to digest that 
food.

3641
02:33:44,311 --> 02:33:45,360
I'm like,
of course it does.

3642
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:46,583
Of course it does.
And I remember that this is several 

3643
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,880
years ago.
I remember as soon as I,

3644
02:33:50,970 --> 02:33:52,380
I uh,
saw that video,

3645
02:33:52,381 --> 02:33:53,214
I was like,
that is how I'm going to think about 

3646
02:33:54,151 --> 02:33:56,310
that from now on.
Because before I was just thinking about

3647
02:33:56,311 --> 02:33:59,310
the moment itself when like I could do 
it even though I just ate.

3648
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:02,460
I could be fine and you can if you don't
eat too much,

3649
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:06,630
but eating right before you go onstage 
is probably about it.

3650
02:34:06,631 --> 02:34:06,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

3651
02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:07,990
Those are,
uh,

3652
02:34:08,230 --> 02:34:10,660
when I used to work with Jay Moore,
that was a buddy hackett quote.

3653
02:34:10,930 --> 02:34:11,763
What's us?
Jamie Katt Williams talk signing with 

3654
02:34:14,111 --> 02:34:15,500
camera on camera.
On.

3655
02:34:15,501 --> 02:34:18,200
Yeah.
He worked with deb squad dipset tip set.

3656
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:24,390
You can't say dip squad.
Dude was that ready?

3657
02:34:24,391 --> 02:34:29,391
This dipset dipset are racist.
You know what people love to do?

3658
02:34:30,050 --> 02:34:30,883
They love to call you a racist.
So it takes any fucking focus off of 

3659
02:34:33,251 --> 02:34:35,320
their potential racism.
That's a big one.

3660
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:40,210
I definitely couldn't be a racist.
But what you are did dip,

3661
02:34:40,420 --> 02:34:43,360
dip squad,
stip set.

3662
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:44,223
You don't even know what it's sad is he 
shouldn't be commenting on their 

3663
02:34:46,181 --> 02:34:50,170
culture.
There's a very big difference from being

3664
02:34:50,171 --> 02:34:53,020
called racist and doing something racist
on accident.

3665
02:34:53,410 --> 02:34:54,243
Oh yeah.
The both.

3666
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:55,780
Both are possible.
Like I did,

3667
02:34:55,781 --> 02:34:56,561
I did something.
No,

3668
02:34:56,561 --> 02:34:58,530
but I mean like meaning like I've been 
called like I've been,

3669
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:00,720
I've had,
I've had whatever person go,

3670
02:35:00,721 --> 02:35:02,350
oh,
that jokes racist and you're like,

3671
02:35:02,351 --> 02:35:04,360
it's not racist at all at all.

3672
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:06,910
There's no racism in that joke.
Um,

3673
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:07,913
but,
and then I've done something racist on 

3674
02:35:08,891 --> 02:35:09,724
accident and then realizing you've done 
something that is in fact hurtful is 

3675
02:35:13,511 --> 02:35:15,010
like,
holy fuck,

3676
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:18,430
you're,
you're almost taking the real meaning of

3677
02:35:18,431 --> 02:35:20,400
the word away from the word.
Uh,

3678
02:35:20,410 --> 02:35:21,430
it,
does that make sense?

3679
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:23,740
Well,
it's,

3680
02:35:23,741 --> 02:35:26,230
you can't change the definition.
So what race has immense,

3681
02:35:26,990 --> 02:35:28,250
no.
Well,

3682
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,860
yeah,
but I think people lighten the load.

3683
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:31,330
Like I though,
I'll tell you the two examples.

3684
02:35:31,331 --> 02:35:32,164
I used to have a joke.
There's Hackey I'm gonna just say it 

3685
02:35:33,461 --> 02:35:34,294
real quick.
Or you say you want to know something 

3686
02:35:35,711 --> 02:35:37,240
racist.
That was where my flaw,

3687
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:38,193
because people would hear that and 
assume I was about to say something 

3688
02:35:39,491 --> 02:35:40,210
racist.
Right.

3689
02:35:40,210 --> 02:35:42,460
When in fact I'm about to say a joke and
it was,

3690
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:44,410
they don't make baby powder for black 
people.

3691
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:45,820
Like how racist is that?

3692
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:46,683
They should make eight different colors.
Call it magic Johnson and Johnson's 

3693
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:51,190
stupid joke.
Black woman got upset,

3694
02:35:51,191 --> 02:35:53,500
stormed out of the date and funny bone.
Literally,

3695
02:35:53,501 --> 02:35:54,334
I'm going to protest now.
I did something racist one time where I 

3696
02:35:57,071 --> 02:35:59,620
walked into a,
but I didn't mean to do it.

3697
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:01,300
I was,
I'm a big fan of opiate anthony.

3698
02:36:01,690 --> 02:36:04,210
I think this will attest to anyone 
that's listened to opiate anthony.

3699
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:05,733
And uh,
one of the sayings they used to say on 

3700
02:36:07,781 --> 02:36:09,490
that was,
hello boys.

3701
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:11,950
Like it was like a saying from the show.
Uh,

3702
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:17,320
and I rolled into a all black club in 
the eighth,

3703
02:36:17,321 --> 02:36:18,850
I think the eighth ward,
it's called bullets.

3704
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:21,970
And I walked into the bathroom was all 
black men and I was a little buzz.

3705
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,320
Oh Geez.
And I just wrote it was,

3706
02:36:23,321 --> 02:36:26,230
but it was all old black men.
It was all old black man.

3707
02:36:26,350 --> 02:36:27,400
Oh No,
I know.

3708
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:29,530
I know.
And I just walked in one hello boys.

3709
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:33,690
But now you gotta understand my,
my,

3710
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:34,563
my,
my usage of that is based on Opie and 

3711
02:36:36,131 --> 02:36:36,964
Anthony,
which was just to show that they had 

3712
02:36:38,621 --> 02:36:41,180
that line in their opening trailer.
Yeah.

3713
02:36:41,530 --> 02:36:43,120
And so I wasn't,
I definitely didn't,

3714
02:36:43,150 --> 02:36:46,750
I would never my ever in a million years
ever do something like that.

3715
02:36:46,870 --> 02:36:50,350
However black man grabbed me and pulled 
me aside.

3716
02:36:50,351 --> 02:36:51,184
So you don't say that word in here.
And I realized I did something racist 

3717
02:36:53,591 --> 02:36:56,230
and I went that,
that feeling,

3718
02:36:56,231 --> 02:36:57,970
that heartfelt feeling I had where I 
went,

3719
02:36:58,090 --> 02:37:01,060
I am like literally almost in tears.
Like I am so sorry.

3720
02:37:01,061 --> 02:37:02,500
I have no idea what that brings up in 
you.

3721
02:37:02,501 --> 02:37:05,290
And I didn't know that,
but I had no intention.

3722
02:37:05,390 --> 02:37:08,380
And that is the two differences where I 
go,

3723
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,110
don't don't throw that word around 
unless you're,

3724
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:14,290
unless you're ready to throw the glass.
The Rock in the glass house,

3725
02:37:14,291 --> 02:37:16,040
that's a word you could easily throw

3726
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:20,630
around in a room full of white guys and 
you were thinking in a non racist way.

3727
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:21,673
Just let it out.
You let it out because you would let it 

3728
02:37:23,421 --> 02:37:25,370
out all the time.
But it's,

3729
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:27,980
it's a perfect way to describe it.
It's accidental racism.

3730
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:29,173
100% I think we've got a real problem 
with people looking for stuff that's 

3731
02:37:32,241 --> 02:37:33,410
racist.
It isn't though.

3732
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:36,110
You know like tea,
like a thing like that.

3733
02:37:36,380 --> 02:37:39,440
You would have to find out who you are.
Like who is this guy?

3734
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:42,290
Why is Bert Kreischer Guy?
You know?

3735
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:45,230
It's like has he done stuff?
Is this funny for him?

3736
02:37:45,231 --> 02:37:47,570
Does he think it's a boundary pusher 
guy?

3737
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:50,990
We want to go into a room full of black 
people in say some racist is just like,

3738
02:37:51,410 --> 02:37:53,450
like Ari when he was doing the amazing 
racist.

3739
02:37:53,480 --> 02:37:54,280
Remember that

3740
02:37:54,280 --> 02:37:55,113
dude?
That's the reason I know Ari is so 

3741
02:37:57,431 --> 02:37:59,380
crazy.
That's the reason I know Ari.

3742
02:37:59,381 --> 02:38:00,850
That is,
that's a sketch.

3743
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:01,713
You know that and I look and I've showed
it to people since maybe times have 

3744
02:38:05,231 --> 02:38:10,231
changed from when I first saw that to 
went now when I saw the one Negro one.

3745
02:38:12,220 --> 02:38:13,320
Yeah.
All right.

3746
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:14,800
I'm not telling you.
I'll tell you what.

3747
02:38:14,801 --> 02:38:18,010
It was like 2004 I just had a kid and I 
was sitting up in my house,

3748
02:38:18,450 --> 02:38:19,283
my house having a bottle of Jameson.
I was working with Jameson at the time 

3749
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:25,390
and I saw it and I had seen already 
before and I giggled.

3750
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:28,180
Hardest fought.
I'm going to own that.

3751
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:30,160
That there was a time where that was 
funny.

3752
02:38:30,161 --> 02:38:31,930
If it's not funny now and people hate 
it,

3753
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:33,580
I giggled hardest.
Fuck.

3754
02:38:34,090 --> 02:38:37,240
It's still kind of funny.
I mean it's fucked up.

3755
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:39,970
It's definitely fucked up,
but it's still kind of funny.

3756
02:38:40,480 --> 02:38:42,640
What's more fucked up as the guy from 
fucking sham wow.

3757
02:38:42,641 --> 02:38:44,740
Owns all that shit that is kind of 
fucked.

3758
02:38:44,770 --> 02:38:47,230
That's the most fucked up about all of 
that is sham.

3759
02:38:47,231 --> 02:38:49,270
Wow owns all of that.
How much,

3760
02:38:49,550 --> 02:38:52,300
what do you think he's making Jamie?
Like 80 grand a month on those.

3761
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:55,273
See like your situation,
like if they knew you like anybody else 

3762
02:38:59,541 --> 02:39:02,630
knows you,
then there would be no worry.

3763
02:39:02,631 --> 02:39:03,464
It would be just,
I got drunk and I fucked up and I said 

3764
02:39:05,511 --> 02:39:07,400
the wrong thing.
I said the actual,

3765
02:39:07,401 --> 02:39:08,234
I just said the wrong words.
Isn't it interesting that that thing 

3766
02:39:11,630 --> 02:39:12,463
where you did that,
if they did know you and they knew you 

3767
02:39:13,581 --> 02:39:15,830
said the wrong words and you knew they 
knew that,

3768
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:16,693
okay,
this guy genuinely would have said this 

3769
02:39:18,021 --> 02:39:21,320
to a bunch of white people and he just 
slip of the tongue and it just was,

3770
02:39:21,470 --> 02:39:22,303
listen,
Ben Opie and Anthony and it was in my 

3771
02:39:23,211 --> 02:39:25,700
fucking repertoire of words to say when 
I walk in a room.

3772
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:26,653
But there's a giant difference between 
that and someone who walks in that 

3773
02:39:29,451 --> 02:39:33,740
bathroom with a decided intention to 
make those black men uncomfortable.

3774
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:35,380
There's sharks in there.
Yeah.

3775
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:37,070
And he says difference.
However,

3776
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:38,083
however,
there's no distinction between what we 

3777
02:39:40,011 --> 02:39:42,710
did to them.
Especially if they're like you.

3778
02:39:42,711 --> 02:39:44,270
They've had a couple of drinks.
Yeah.

3779
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:45,980
Like you,
you were all at a bar.

3780
02:39:45,981 --> 02:39:46,814
Right?
So maybe they could be a little tipsy 

3781
02:39:48,051 --> 02:39:49,070
too.
And you know,

3782
02:39:49,071 --> 02:39:49,904
sometimes people are a little drunk and 
they misinterpret things where they're 

3783
02:39:51,981 --> 02:39:54,440
quick to a,
to quick to look for an altercation.

3784
02:39:54,441 --> 02:39:55,830
That could be a problem too.
You know,

3785
02:39:56,430 --> 02:39:59,670
name of the bar was bullets.
I was there to see kermit ruffins.

3786
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:03,650
I was hanging out with him and his car 
and uh,

3787
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:06,150
nothing.
I'm just thinking,

3788
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:07,350
oh,
go ahead.

3789
02:40:07,350 --> 02:40:07,961
And,
and I,

3790
02:40:07,961 --> 02:40:09,420
and I and I,
when I bought that,

3791
02:40:10,150 --> 02:40:13,380
that is in essence,
like I remember,

3792
02:40:13,381 --> 02:40:13,980
I remember just the

3793
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,080
guy pulling me aside and literally 
grabbing me,

3794
02:40:16,081 --> 02:40:17,130
not,
not be a nice about it,

3795
02:40:17,131 --> 02:40:19,350
but grabbing me so you don't say those 
words here.

3796
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:20,453
And I went,
whoa.

3797
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:23,640
Like I didn't grow up racist.
So I don't like to say,

3798
02:40:23,641 --> 02:40:25,320
boy,
what's a trunk mistake?

3799
02:40:25,321 --> 02:40:26,300
Yeah.
I did drop any

3800
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:27,173
exact thing when I moved here.
It's like the first six months I was at 

3801
02:40:29,281 --> 02:40:32,670
the comedy store,
I came up to a guy that I knew and I go,

3802
02:40:32,671 --> 02:40:34,830
hey boy.
And he goes,

3803
02:40:34,831 --> 02:40:36,390
what the fuck she is?
I had no idea.

3804
02:40:36,391 --> 02:40:39,890
I'd never heard of the boy thing ever.
And I don't know where he got it from.

3805
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:41,520
Boy in Ohio.
No,

3806
02:40:41,521 --> 02:40:42,354
I don't.
And I just didn't have racism in my 

3807
02:40:44,491 --> 02:40:45,324
family or anything really.
So I never read them was raised as some 

3808
02:40:48,031 --> 02:40:49,700
sort of a preserve religion.

3809
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:52,260
It's amazing that the fence was up and 
there was like,

3810
02:40:52,261 --> 02:40:53,640
it was like that.
Remember that?

3811
02:40:53,641 --> 02:40:55,770
Uh,
that was it.

3812
02:40:55,771 --> 02:40:56,604
Joaquin Phoenix that had that fucking,
that the m nine Shama Lama Ding Dong 

3813
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:04,710
movie about those people don't want the 
village,

3814
02:41:04,711 --> 02:41:05,544
the village.
And there was planes that were flying 

3815
02:41:07,231 --> 02:41:08,760
overhead.
They didn't know about the planes.

3816
02:41:09,090 --> 02:41:09,923
Remember that.
It's one of those movies where you at 

3817
02:41:11,521 --> 02:41:12,354
the end of the movie like,
I'm going to find him and I'm going to 

3818
02:41:13,951 --> 02:41:14,784
fucking choke him.
I'm going to find you and I'm going to 

3819
02:41:18,321 --> 02:41:20,310
choke you.
No,

3820
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:21,451
no,
no,

3821
02:41:21,451 --> 02:41:22,284
no.
That is not a movie idea to do that son 

3822
02:41:25,651 --> 02:41:28,410
of a bitch who let you do this,
who let you spend so much money on this.

3823
02:41:28,411 --> 02:41:32,190
You fucker New Hampshire.
I think what?

3824
02:41:32,191 --> 02:41:34,170
No planes fly over them.
Get the fight.

3825
02:41:34,171 --> 02:41:36,480
I've ever seen a plane the fuck out of 
here.

3826
02:41:36,490 --> 02:41:41,490
They just made it to the road in a day.
They walked to the road in a day.

3827
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:47,850
It's some fucking hippies aren't going 
to find you decades ago.

3828
02:41:47,851 --> 02:41:48,684
Shut your mouth.
It's one day and one day they're on the 

3829
02:41:52,251 --> 02:41:55,320
road the same day.
That's not far.

3830
02:41:55,321 --> 02:41:59,160
How fast are you walk in there in the 
Cherokee within 24 hours.

3831
02:41:59,190 --> 02:42:02,460
So you're telling me you didn't even 
hear harleys when Harley's ride down the

3832
02:42:02,461 --> 02:42:05,850
road do you didn't hear that the fuck 
out of here?

3833
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:07,523
This whole face.
That's sort of what my compound to be 

3834
02:42:09,211 --> 02:42:11,100
like.
Standups,

3835
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:14,160
compounds.
Just like that guy knocked it out of the

3836
02:42:14,161 --> 02:42:16,620
park with his first movie though the 
sixth sense,

3837
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:19,850
which was another like twist.
I think those two,

3838
02:42:19,890 --> 02:42:22,700
the twist was so good at that movie.
It might've ruined him.

3839
02:42:23,010 --> 02:42:24,960
Ariana are talking about storytelling 
like that.

3840
02:42:24,961 --> 02:42:28,140
The best stories you ever list to,
when did you realize he was dead?

3841
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:29,430
Oh,
spoiler alert.

3842
02:42:29,730 --> 02:42:30,990
Oh,
you son of a bitch.

3843
02:42:31,500 --> 02:42:34,860
I never figured it out until now.
What do you mean he was dead?

3844
02:42:35,130 --> 02:42:36,960
The kid was dead.
No.

3845
02:42:36,990 --> 02:42:38,520
Oh my God.
The guy was dead.

3846
02:42:38,521 --> 02:42:41,400
Who is?
Wait.

3847
02:42:41,470 --> 02:42:43,370
When did you,
when did you figure it out?

3848
02:42:43,390 --> 02:42:46,800
He said it like when the kid and him 
were having the conversation towards the

3849
02:42:46,801 --> 02:42:47,634
end of the movie.
I was getting suspicious somewhere in 

3850
02:42:49,801 --> 02:42:50,311
there.
I was like,

3851
02:42:50,311 --> 02:42:51,144
what the fuck is going on?
This is like 2004 when did that movie 

3852
02:42:54,331 --> 02:42:55,111
come out?
Oh No,

3853
02:42:55,111 --> 02:42:58,800
it was not 2004 was probably in 1998.
[inaudible] 99.

3854
02:42:59,050 --> 02:43:01,400
Wow.
Was it?

3855
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:03,390
Bam.
Roy Choi was on this show.

3856
02:43:04,530 --> 02:43:05,780
Careful.
So,

3857
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:07,500
uh,
but I don't remember.

3858
02:43:07,501 --> 02:43:08,334
I think it was towards the end.
I think they were having a conversation 

3859
02:43:10,081 --> 02:43:12,070
together and I was,
but I was trying to figure out what

3860
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:15,630
the fuck was going on before that.
But I can tell you in the moment,

3861
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:19,180
part of the moment of the movie when he 
finds blood on his shirt,

3862
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:20,343
oh,
that's what I realized because I was 

3863
02:43:22,030 --> 02:43:23,800
like,
when he grabbed the red door handle,

3864
02:43:23,801 --> 02:43:24,880
I was like,
yeah,

3865
02:43:24,881 --> 02:43:27,460
I don't know what that fucking means.
Why did she lock him out of that room?

3866
02:43:28,210 --> 02:43:30,760
Is he not have an office anymore?
So he need to get an office.

3867
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:33,490
That was a great movie,
man.

3868
02:43:34,050 --> 02:43:37,940
But then the twist was so,
so much of a part of the movie that the,

3869
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:40,300
in his movies you would wait for the 
twist.

3870
02:43:40,830 --> 02:43:41,663
You know,
he tried to figure out when is this 

3871
02:43:42,281 --> 02:43:43,780
twist coming?
What's better?

3872
02:43:44,050 --> 02:43:45,610
That or usual suspects.

3873
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:47,910
Okay.

3874
02:43:47,910 --> 02:43:50,730
I think usual suspects is the goddamn 
classic.

3875
02:43:50,731 --> 02:43:52,410
It's best.
That's a classic.

3876
02:43:52,411 --> 02:43:53,244
What do you mean?
What's,

3877
02:43:53,310 --> 02:43:58,200
which one's better to six sense or the 
single slit in the reveal though the two

3878
02:43:58,201 --> 02:44:00,030
best reveals in movie probably,
right.

3879
02:44:00,630 --> 02:44:01,710
Oh,
in the reveal.

3880
02:44:01,711 --> 02:44:03,290
I thought you mentioned it in the movie 
itself.

3881
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:04,300
In the,
in the butt.

3882
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:06,930
But then the real voc cents is better.
No,

3883
02:44:06,931 --> 02:44:07,764
the movie is the reveal.
The keyser soze a reveal is like a 

3884
02:44:11,281 --> 02:44:12,470
little,
like what?

3885
02:44:12,750 --> 02:44:14,280
All of a sudden he's on limping.

3886
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:15,000
Okay.

3887
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,340
What about in the final reveal?
It's walks away.

3888
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:19,320
That was the worst.
So it was worst.

3889
02:44:19,370 --> 02:44:20,250
I di,
I mean,

3890
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:21,113
I did not like,
and people get mad at me for saying 

3891
02:44:22,171 --> 02:44:23,610
that.
You don't even understand fight club,

3892
02:44:23,611 --> 02:44:24,900
bro.
You don't understand.

3893
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:27,150
You understand what it stands for.
Okay.

3894
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:28,850
Yeah.
What about memento?

3895
02:44:30,770 --> 02:44:33,170
Uh,
it was good.

3896
02:44:33,710 --> 02:44:38,140
I'll tell you what butterfly effects 
probably the movie that butterfly.

3897
02:44:39,060 --> 02:44:40,540
Oh,
Ashton Kutcher.

3898
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,380
Did you actually watch that?
Uh,

3899
02:44:42,430 --> 02:44:43,850
due to kind of fucked me up for a couple
of days.

3900
02:44:43,851 --> 02:44:45,650
The pants on.
Why did you,

3901
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:50,990
why did you watch that movie?
Who says what time travel you are Joe?

3902
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:51,913
Like whoa.
Like if you ever have a time travel 

3903
02:44:53,241 --> 02:44:55,600
person in here,
I just want to hang out and just listen.

3904
02:44:55,690 --> 02:44:57,140
I'm,
I'm obsessed with time travel.

3905
02:44:57,230 --> 02:45:00,470
Is there a time traveler person?
It's like the big foot guide I think.

3906
02:45:00,471 --> 02:45:02,140
Does it offset well there was this one.

3907
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:04,850
Hi.
I think it was the universe.

3908
02:45:05,090 --> 02:45:10,090
University of Connecticut Raw Roy Mallet
bottom Ronald [inaudible].

3909
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:12,680
Ronald Mallet.
Yeah,

3910
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:16,790
Ronald Mallet.
He was a scientist out of the University

3911
02:45:16,791 --> 02:45:20,090
of Connecticut and this is a crazy like 
spiderman story.

3912
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:25,540
His Dad died when he was young and he 
became obsessed with figuring out Ronald

3913
02:45:27,150 --> 02:45:28,110
Mallet.
Uh,

3914
02:45:28,430 --> 02:45:32,780
he became obsessed with figuring out a 
time machine so he could go back in time

3915
02:45:32,781 --> 02:45:33,614
and save his father and flaps.
That's what led him on this path to 

3916
02:45:37,941 --> 02:45:42,941
become like the world specialist in,
I mean he's like a legit credentialed,

3917
02:45:44,810 --> 02:45:48,890
you know,
respected intellectual and scientist and

3918
02:45:48,891 --> 02:45:50,780
his,
his accomplishments.

3919
02:45:50,781 --> 02:45:53,930
He's like,
he's been able to like try to keep track

3920
02:45:53,931 --> 02:45:54,764
of and study time in a way that they're,
they're really thinking that there's 

3921
02:45:57,951 --> 02:46:00,170
going to come one point in time,
some day,

3922
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:01,133
whether they're going to be able to 
figure out how to travel back and forth 

3923
02:46:02,871 --> 02:46:03,260
through time.

3924
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:07,130
It's going to take a long ass time.
But one thing that he along as time,

3925
02:46:07,370 --> 02:46:08,203
one thing that he learned was that he 
most likely will never be able to go 

3926
02:46:11,001 --> 02:46:14,010
back in time and save his dad.
And so the,

3927
02:46:14,011 --> 02:46:16,610
the,
I think the idea as it's been explained,

3928
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:21,700
if I remember correctly,
is that you only can time travel back to

3929
02:46:22,221 --> 02:46:24,590
the point where the first time machine 
was made.

3930
02:46:25,250 --> 02:46:28,790
So if someone one day fuck comes up with
a time machine,

3931
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,560
say if that's like a hundred years from 
now,

3932
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:35,090
the from that moment on from the moment 
of the invention of the time machine to,

3933
02:46:35,091 --> 02:46:35,924
to forever in the future,
all those people can come back to that 

3934
02:46:39,171 --> 02:46:39,980
moment.

3935
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:40,813
So you're telling me the first guy that 
invents at time of trig can travel back 

3936
02:46:42,801 --> 02:46:45,680
a second then two seconds than five 
seconds.

3937
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:46,613
Mm even know even crazier when the 
moment of first time machine is 

3938
02:46:50,491 --> 02:46:54,210
invented.
All the people that have gone from,

3939
02:46:54,360 --> 02:46:55,193
you know,
let's say a time machine gets invented 

3940
02:46:55,981 --> 02:46:56,814
in 2050 okay.
All the people from 2052 as long as 

3941
02:47:01,381 --> 02:47:02,214
human life survives and as long as 
there's a power source and as long as 

3942
02:47:06,070 --> 02:47:06,903
there's a computer grid,
as long as there's some method of 

3943
02:47:09,541 --> 02:47:10,374
establishing information,
all those people will be able to come 

3944
02:47:13,501 --> 02:47:16,380
back to that moment and any other moment
in between.

3945
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:20,700
So time stops,
there's no regular time.

3946
02:47:20,701 --> 02:47:22,740
They might be regular time for you,
but he becomes,

3947
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,863
it's,
it's only a matter of perspective 

3948
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:26,273
because regular time for you is not 
going to matter anymore because people 

3949
02:47:28,021 --> 02:47:28,854
can come and go back to your time.
How are we sure I hadn't said this as 

3950
02:47:32,371 --> 02:47:35,520
much as they want.
But then here's another problem.

3951
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:36,533
Here's another problem.
How much mass is contained in this one 

3952
02:47:40,861 --> 02:47:44,520
environment and is it okay to bring in 
more mass?

3953
02:47:44,670 --> 02:47:47,280
And what happens if you do?
So if you have,

3954
02:47:47,430 --> 02:47:51,000
if you have 300 million people in 
America right now,

3955
02:47:51,090 --> 02:47:51,923
but a time machine gets invented and,
and then all of a sudden people from 

3956
02:47:55,620 --> 02:47:56,453
2050 to 250,050
to whenever the fuck the next big 

3957
02:48:00,901 --> 02:48:02,640
asteroid wipes us out like the 
dinosaurs.

3958
02:48:02,641 --> 02:48:03,474
You've got super,
super far distance in the future people 

3959
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:06,953
every day,
every person has the possibility and 

3960
02:48:09,391 --> 02:48:12,600
potential with technology to reach this 
moment right now.

3961
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:15,390
And what if they did all together all at
once?

3962
02:48:15,690 --> 02:48:17,640
What we even have the space to contain 
them.

3963
02:48:18,090 --> 02:48:18,923
Would we even have the space on this 
earth to what we would have to regulate 

3964
02:48:21,421 --> 02:48:22,254
time travel at every second of every day
from today on until the moment there's 

3965
02:48:27,700 --> 02:48:28,140
no,

3966
02:48:28,140 --> 02:48:28,973
I can debunk this.
Are you ready for me to debunk a 

3967
02:48:30,321 --> 02:48:31,670
scientist?
Hoping you can do it.

3968
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:33,770
Here we go.
Mic drop moment.

3969
02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:36,380
Dear scientists have spent your whole 
life figuring this out.

3970
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:39,680
I just shut you down.
So I built a time travel.

3971
02:48:39,710 --> 02:48:40,543
Me and Brian are time.
Travel consists of a bottle of 

3972
02:48:42,501 --> 02:48:44,120
champagne,
a lighter and a joint.

3973
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:47,240
Right?
I'm just saying it's simple,

3974
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:51,310
simpler time machine stopped.
No mental illness.

3975
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:57,640
Can I handle this one on my own?
So I'm just saying simple mechanics.

3976
02:48:58,200 --> 02:48:59,930
Let's pretend that that's the time 
machine,

3977
02:48:59,960 --> 02:49:00,770
right?
So we got it.

3978
02:49:00,770 --> 02:49:01,910
All right.
We invent the time machine.

3979
02:49:01,911 --> 02:49:02,744
God,
Oh my God,

3980
02:49:02,750 --> 02:49:05,450
we right now we can travel back to that 
moment three days ago.

3981
02:49:05,451 --> 02:49:06,284
We can try to travel back to this moment
or three days and now I can say to 

3982
02:49:09,991 --> 02:49:10,950
Brian,
hey,

3983
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:14,640
our time machine really just consists of
a bottle of champagne,

3984
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:17,570
a joint and lighter.
Go to f,

3985
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:20,940
let's fucking send you back.
You know the three things,

3986
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:24,290
bill one then come back to me now your 
idea,

3987
02:49:24,310 --> 02:49:28,020
she gets together with my chipolte lay 
person and have sex and have a baby.

3988
02:49:28,021 --> 02:49:33,021
That makes no sense you guys.
There's no time machine ever going to be

3989
02:49:34,231 --> 02:49:38,180
built because [inaudible] bro,
it's up.

3990
02:49:39,150 --> 02:49:42,210
Donald Trump is president.
Cats and dogs living together.

3991
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:44,100
Simulation program,
tie machine,

3992
02:49:44,101 --> 02:49:45,270
doesn't matter.
Births,

3993
02:49:45,271 --> 02:49:46,950
ideas back to the future three 
basically.

3994
02:49:46,980 --> 02:49:47,813
Is that what it is?

3995
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:53,550
Jamie?
Jamie shutting your shit down.

3996
02:49:54,350 --> 02:49:57,030
I'm interrupting your kettle bell 
workout on.

3997
02:49:57,040 --> 02:50:00,330
Stop shutting down.
Oh fuck.

3998
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:01,943
Would you like,
we're going to be cool to see like 

3999
02:50:02,370 --> 02:50:04,790
scientists actually work on time travel.
Like if they're like,

4000
02:50:04,880 --> 02:50:05,713
like shooting lasers does that walls and
trying to run through a wall or 

4001
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:08,513
essentially

4002
02:50:09,070 --> 02:50:10,840
definitely doing it in one way or 
another.

4003
02:50:10,841 --> 02:50:12,550
They might even not even realize they're
doing it,

4004
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:13,533
but every intensive scientific 
experiment that anyone's doing anywhere 

4005
02:50:17,201 --> 02:50:18,034
in the world,
I need results that they get in 

4006
02:50:19,031 --> 02:50:21,940
groundbreaking results.
Auger kind of added together and to this

4007
02:50:21,941 --> 02:50:25,180
super possibilities.
So whatever they invent today,

4008
02:50:25,181 --> 02:50:28,090
whatever they figure out today.
Even if they're not thinking like,

4009
02:50:28,091 --> 02:50:29,740
hey,
we're gonna invent a time machine,

4010
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:30,603
but any new technology that someone 
invents a day makes more things 

4011
02:50:32,891 --> 02:50:35,140
possible.
There's more things become possible.

4012
02:50:35,141 --> 02:50:37,150
Eventually people are going to get to 
the point where they go,

4013
02:50:37,360 --> 02:50:38,950
hey,
this time thing,

4014
02:50:39,190 --> 02:50:42,310
we manipulate this or is this just what 
it is?

4015
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:43,173
Is it what it is?
Or we can we move around in it like the 

4016
02:50:44,681 --> 02:50:46,540
air.
Remember when we didn't used to think we

4017
02:50:46,541 --> 02:50:47,374
could fly through the air,
but then we realized we could fly 

4018
02:50:48,731 --> 02:50:49,450
through the air.

4019
02:50:49,450 --> 02:50:50,283
Why can't we fly through time?
Are you sure we can't fly through time 

4020
02:50:52,331 --> 02:50:53,164
today?
And if people keep getting smarter and 

4021
02:50:54,581 --> 02:50:55,414
smarter and more and more aware of the 
possibilities that had been created by 

4022
02:50:58,781 --> 02:51:02,260
all these different technologies,
it's going to open up the door to insane

4023
02:51:02,261 --> 02:51:03,094
possibility,
like unimaginable possibility of the 

4024
02:51:05,741 --> 02:51:08,860
ability to manipulate matter,
human bodies,

4025
02:51:08,861 --> 02:51:09,694
time travel.
It's just a matter of whether or not 

4026
02:51:11,141 --> 02:51:13,660
we'll have enough power and whether or 
not we'll,

4027
02:51:13,690 --> 02:51:16,870
like if we do it correctly,
we're figuring it out to the point where

4028
02:51:16,990 --> 02:51:17,823
like,
we definitely didn't figure out the 

4029
02:51:18,101 --> 02:51:20,440
fossil fuel thing or the plastic thing 
correctly.

4030
02:51:20,650 --> 02:51:21,483
We invented it without considering the 
consequences of way more fucking people 

4031
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:26,073
and way more impact on the environment 
than anybody ever imagined when they 

4032
02:51:28,031 --> 02:51:28,864
first invented those things.
So when you see the oceans choking up 

4033
02:51:30,641 --> 02:51:34,360
with plastic and the fucking skies all 
fucking black with smog from shitty car,

4034
02:51:34,630 --> 02:51:35,463
like nobody,
nobody saw that coming when they 

4035
02:51:36,251 --> 02:51:37,240
invented those things.

4036
02:51:37,510 --> 02:51:38,343
So there's gotta be a way where they can
look at all the different things that 

4037
02:51:41,141 --> 02:51:41,974
we're doing right now and extrapolate 
into the future and figure out how to 

4038
02:51:46,001 --> 02:51:47,470
fix it.
Once they can do that,

4039
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:51,910
then it becomes a matter of how much 
energy do you put forth and what are the

4040
02:51:51,911 --> 02:51:55,450
rewards that you get back and can,
you can continue to sustain that energy.

4041
02:51:55,630 --> 02:51:56,463
So if you can continue to sustain the 
energy and you start just creating time 

4042
02:51:59,111 --> 02:52:01,780
machines and you start creating,
uh,

4043
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:04,960
the ability to manipulate bodies and 
change shapes,

4044
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:07,900
you would turn your body into whatever 
the fuck you wanted it to be.

4045
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:10,210
And there would be no standard human 
being.

4046
02:52:10,420 --> 02:52:14,620
There'd be people with fucking wings.
There would be people with giant heads.

4047
02:52:14,621 --> 02:52:17,350
You could literally,
if they start manipulating bodies,

4048
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:18,333
it's just a matter of time before they 
manipulate them at will and before they 

4049
02:52:21,011 --> 02:52:22,540
manipulate them back and forth.

4050
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:23,433
What's going to be the first person that
decides to become a horse person and 

4051
02:52:25,631 --> 02:52:26,464
then besides become a center and then 
decides to become the hulk and then 

4052
02:52:29,411 --> 02:52:32,270
becomes a brony.
You know how many,

4053
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:33,273
how many fucking people are going to do 
weird shit to their body once they 

4054
02:52:35,891 --> 02:52:38,530
realize that you can change it,
you can decide,

4055
02:52:38,531 --> 02:52:42,910
you can introduce a gene that makes your
shoulders stretch out wide like this,

4056
02:52:42,940 --> 02:52:45,640
give me tomorrow.
You never fucking know.

4057
02:52:45,660 --> 02:52:47,500
Give me wings tomorrow,
Dude.

4058
02:52:47,980 --> 02:52:48,813
If they can figure out how to splice 
genes into different plants to create 

4059
02:52:52,661 --> 02:52:53,494
like more resistant plants to pesticides
and they can figure out how to 

4060
02:52:56,891 --> 02:52:57,724
manipulate things.
They figured out how to grow a human 

4061
02:52:59,830 --> 02:53:00,880
ear,
uh,

4062
02:53:00,881 --> 02:53:02,350
on a,
on some sort of a mammoth.

4063
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:04,000
He was a mouse or something like that.
Like they're,

4064
02:53:04,120 --> 02:53:04,953
they're constantly trying to figure out 
new ways to combine things and 

4065
02:53:08,171 --> 02:53:09,190
manipulate things.

4066
02:53:09,550 --> 02:53:12,910
Just keep going from today to a hundred 
thousand years from now.

4067
02:53:13,150 --> 02:53:14,560
It's inevitable.
Inevitable,

4068
02:53:14,561 --> 02:53:15,640
dude,
they habitable.

4069
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:17,100
Imagine if they had told your 
grandparents,

4070
02:53:17,110 --> 02:53:19,540
you'll be able to speak to your child on
the other side of the coast.

4071
02:53:20,050 --> 02:53:23,080
How would I do that?
It's just look at this human ear.

4072
02:53:23,081 --> 02:53:23,914
They grew on a fucking rat,
had kind of looked like Richard Ross 

4073
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:27,550
here,
Asian guy.

4074
02:53:27,610 --> 02:53:28,151
It looks like,
well,

4075
02:53:28,151 --> 02:53:30,850
lead Ishmael's ear,
the UFC fighter.

4076
02:53:31,950 --> 02:53:35,270
What's that?
They grew his nose jacked.

4077
02:53:35,310 --> 02:53:36,143
Yeah.
They grew his nose on his forehead and 

4078
02:53:37,301 --> 02:53:39,190
then they cut you open and stitch it 
back in.

4079
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:41,733
I was on the forehead or on your face.
What they do is they kind of stretch it 

4080
02:53:45,011 --> 02:53:45,844
out.
They stretch your skin out by putting 

4081
02:53:48,041 --> 02:53:52,810
this sort of a artificial nose thing 
that they kind of grow on your head.

4082
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:56,110
There's a bunch of different experiments
that people are doing right now.

4083
02:53:56,430 --> 02:53:58,240
This is the hope and this is 
interesting,

4084
02:53:58,241 --> 02:54:00,940
but it's kind of like almost like,
um,

4085
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:04,750
be beginner steps to what they're 
ultimately going to be able to do.

4086
02:54:04,830 --> 02:54:05,663
No way does this,
are they doing this because there's no 

4087
02:54:07,930 --> 02:54:09,620
like those plastic surgery stuff?
No,

4088
02:54:09,621 --> 02:54:09,910
no,
no.

4089
02:54:09,910 --> 02:54:11,260
I got his nose fucked up.
No,

4090
02:54:11,261 --> 02:54:13,840
but I mean like meaning you know,
like all of a sudden we have,

4091
02:54:13,841 --> 02:54:15,430
we have a cure to fix.
I knows it's gone.

4092
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:15,970
Right,
right.

4093
02:54:15,970 --> 02:54:19,300
As opposed to AIDS.
Medication is still kind of like,

4094
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:21,310
they're just like,
we're going to hold it off.

4095
02:54:21,350 --> 02:54:24,190
We're not curing it cause the money's in
the comeback.

4096
02:54:24,220 --> 02:54:29,220
Do you think that's real?
That's Chris Rock said to Joe,

4097
02:54:29,771 --> 02:54:30,604
I don't get all my information from,
I get it from podcasts and comedy and 

4098
02:54:33,191 --> 02:54:35,590
TV.
You never know.

4099
02:54:35,890 --> 02:54:36,723
It definitely could be real,
but I would imagine it would be really 

4100
02:54:38,891 --> 02:54:39,724
hard for people to ethically hide the a 
cure for aids because they can make 

4101
02:54:44,830 --> 02:54:46,540
money from the treatment.

4102
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:49,210
You'd have to assume that the same 
people too.

4103
02:54:49,450 --> 02:54:50,283
You'd have to assume that the people 
that are making the treatment got ahold 

4104
02:54:53,291 --> 02:54:54,124
of the cure and decided to stop it.
Either they bought them out or it was 

4105
02:54:57,611 --> 02:54:59,350
their company that invented it.
You'd have to,

4106
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:01,630
they'd have to all be conveniently 
connected.

4107
02:55:02,230 --> 02:55:03,063
I guess you're right.
And then there's also a scientist as a 

4108
02:55:04,761 --> 02:55:05,594
scientist that would have to be involved
in the discovery of something as 

4109
02:55:09,410 --> 02:55:14,410
monumental as curing aids.
If a scientist could figure that out,

4110
02:55:14,990 --> 02:55:17,740
that would be gigantic for the 
reputation it would see.

4111
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:19,970
They would be like Francis Crick.
They would be like,

4112
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:21,760
you know,
there'll be like Watson.

4113
02:55:21,800 --> 02:55:24,040
They would be like one of the great 
scientists of all times.

4114
02:55:24,041 --> 02:55:26,540
Someone has invented something.
They would be like,

4115
02:55:27,050 --> 02:55:27,883
I mean you,
you could go back in time and think 

4116
02:55:30,501 --> 02:55:33,530
about all the big inventors,
the teslas and all the different people.

4117
02:55:33,530 --> 02:55:34,363
Someone who can invent something that 
cures the black plague of the 20th 

4118
02:55:37,431 --> 02:55:38,990
century,
which is what AIDS was.

4119
02:55:38,991 --> 02:55:41,120
Still a lot of people,
someone came along and cured that,

4120
02:55:41,570 --> 02:55:42,890
God damn,
they'd be big.

4121
02:55:43,220 --> 02:55:44,053
They'd be giant.
I don't think you can keep that shit 

4122
02:55:44,901 --> 02:55:47,360
quiet because I'm going to lose it.
Make sense?

4123
02:55:47,890 --> 02:55:50,210
Now May,
I guess I'm agreeing with the conspiracy

4124
02:55:50,211 --> 02:55:50,841
theorists.
Oh,

4125
02:55:50,841 --> 02:55:54,290
I've heard on this podcast,
you can't totally listen to them.

4126
02:55:54,380 --> 02:55:55,213
Not because their ideas are invalid,
but because a lot of times they don't 

4127
02:55:58,820 --> 02:56:01,760
absolutely know and people jumped to 
conclusions,

4128
02:56:01,761 --> 02:56:02,594
so it's not,
the conspiracies don't exist because 

4129
02:56:03,591 --> 02:56:05,030
they definitely exist.
We all know that.

4130
02:56:05,031 --> 02:56:07,550
Some people can spire to do certain 
things.

4131
02:56:07,551 --> 02:56:11,060
It happens all the time,
but it's whether or not the conspiracies

4132
02:56:11,061 --> 02:56:14,660
that we just get really attached to,
whether or not they're,

4133
02:56:14,780 --> 02:56:17,510
they're real and oftentimes they're just
not.

4134
02:56:18,290 --> 02:56:19,123
You know,
I still believe in time travel time 

4135
02:56:21,411 --> 02:56:24,680
travel is totally possible.
I just don't think it's happened yet.

4136
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:26,030
Everyone was like,
dude,

4137
02:56:26,031 --> 02:56:27,650
I think everything's possible,
man.

4138
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:30,110
I think we're going to come to some 
weird point in time,

4139
02:56:30,111 --> 02:56:32,270
whether it's like I said a thousand 
years from now,

4140
02:56:32,271 --> 02:56:33,104
whatever the fuck it is.
It's going to be a weird point in time 

4141
02:56:34,461 --> 02:56:35,294
where we could do anything we want.
Jamie put pull up that fucking video 

4142
02:56:38,511 --> 02:56:41,540
that you showed me yesterday.
Good googly movement.

4143
02:56:41,550 --> 02:56:45,110
You ready to get your mind ready?
But he seen us Nvidia Shit.

4144
02:56:45,780 --> 02:56:50,470
[inaudible] get on Jamie.
Am I done three hours.

4145
02:56:50,930 --> 02:56:53,090
You gotta you gotta see this right?
I'll hold it to Wa.

4146
02:56:53,420 --> 02:56:54,740
You gotta pee.
I gotta pee,

4147
02:56:54,741 --> 02:56:55,574
but I can keep talking.
Why don't you it and Brian and I will 

4148
02:56:57,381 --> 02:57:00,050
have a little chit chat while you're 
gone and then we'll come back in and joy

4149
02:57:00,051 --> 02:57:01,010
this joy.
No,

4150
02:57:01,011 --> 02:57:03,520
we're going to be good.
It's Roy Choi Shit.

4151
02:57:03,521 --> 02:57:04,354
Can you believe that Brian?
What the Fuck Bert Kreischer remember 

4152
02:57:07,131 --> 02:57:07,700
that part of you

4153
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:08,533
Indiana Jones where she's riding an 
elephant and then she sprays Cologne on 

4154
02:57:12,081 --> 02:57:14,600
the elephant and it cause the elephants 
smelled.

4155
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:16,380
No,
I hated that part.

4156
02:57:16,381 --> 02:57:17,214
I don't know.

4157
02:57:20,150 --> 02:57:20,983
Okay.

4158
02:57:21,510 --> 02:57:23,130
Oh my God,
it's so ridiculous.

4159
02:57:23,250 --> 02:57:24,083
I broke this lighter while I was sitting
here and I didn't know why I was doing 

4160
02:57:26,791 --> 02:57:27,624
it while I was doing it.
I just kept pushing on little pieces of 

4161
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:31,800
lighter and pieces are breaking off.
I was like,

4162
02:57:31,801 --> 02:57:32,634
get the fuck is wrong with you.

4163
02:57:32,870 --> 02:57:36,180
They got like lighter fluid all over.
You're going to light it a joint.

4164
02:57:36,181 --> 02:57:36,280
Yeah,

4165
02:57:36,280 --> 02:57:37,390
I didn't,
I didn't,

4166
02:57:37,391 --> 02:57:38,224
but I'm like,
why?

4167
02:57:38,590 --> 02:57:39,423
What is it about pot that makes you uh,
one thing at a time is just not 

4168
02:57:42,581 --> 02:57:47,110
interesting enough.
He got to thinking about time travel and

4169
02:57:47,290 --> 02:57:50,290
chipotle lay and how do I break this 
lighter with two fingers?

4170
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:52,630
Can I you just use two fingers and break
the slider?

4171
02:57:52,690 --> 02:57:54,340
I won't push with the third finger at 
all.

4172
02:57:54,660 --> 02:57:55,493
He says time travel is possible.
He thinks it's just not technologically 

4173
02:57:58,361 --> 02:58:00,970
here yet.
He says he needs about 250,000

4174
02:58:01,290 --> 02:58:01,980
to make a scale

4175
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:02,813
model of his machine.
But if you could get funding like the 

4176
02:58:04,501 --> 02:58:06,030
hard drum collider,
like 10 billion,

4177
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:07,140
then they could probably do it.

4178
02:58:07,480 --> 02:58:09,580
This is Ma Mallet says that's what he 
said.

4179
02:58:09,700 --> 02:58:11,650
Jesus Christ.
I would say that too though.

4180
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:12,513
Yeah,
he give me funding like the fucking 

4181
02:58:13,270 --> 02:58:16,630
larger green cartoons,
the life.

4182
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:20,310
It's like shark tank and try that on.
Check this out.

4183
02:58:20,311 --> 02:58:24,190
Cause this is the Nvidia tilt brush,
is that what's called Jamie?

4184
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:26,830
It's on the HTC vive.
Uh,

4185
02:58:26,860 --> 02:58:31,190
Google bought this APP and they're 
pushing it out as this thing just became

4186
02:58:31,270 --> 02:58:32,103
a made for preorder this week.
It's like a three d room you're in and 

4187
02:58:36,041 --> 02:58:36,874
a,
you have like a wand and a pallet kind 

4188
02:58:38,021 --> 02:58:40,210
of on wandon right hand pallet on your 
left hand.

4189
02:58:40,211 --> 02:58:41,044
And with some tools you could kind of 
pick from explain what you're seeing 

4190
02:58:42,821 --> 02:58:43,481
right now.
But uh,

4191
02:58:43,481 --> 02:58:44,314
yeah,
so this guy was painting was all sorts 

4192
02:58:45,281 --> 02:58:47,020
of different colors.
There's hyper color,

4193
02:58:47,350 --> 02:58:48,183
there's a different oil pinning things,
but you painting in three d it looks 

4194
02:58:50,621 --> 02:58:51,454
like you're painting on a two d plane 
and immediately it becomes available to 

4195
02:58:54,881 --> 02:58:57,110
your eyes that you're not painting.
And just today,

4196
02:58:57,160 --> 02:58:58,420
like you've been used to your whole 
life,

4197
02:58:58,450 --> 02:59:02,410
you're actually in a speedy,
cool playing live sculpting.

4198
02:59:02,470 --> 02:59:03,303
You know what I want to see though,
I want to see you be able to do that in 

4199
02:59:05,351 --> 02:59:07,810
paint.
And then be able to print it out on your

4200
02:59:07,811 --> 02:59:09,550
printer.
You can't unit but you can share it.

4201
02:59:09,551 --> 02:59:09,640
Yeah.

4202
02:59:09,640 --> 02:59:10,930
You,
well you can't now,

4203
02:59:10,931 --> 02:59:11,764
but one day,
three d printer would be able to 

4204
02:59:12,911 --> 02:59:13,744
recreate the same way people can pour 
molten silver into an ant colony and 

4205
02:59:17,831 --> 02:59:20,620
pull out a fucking ant thing.
You've gotta be able to take this thing,

4206
02:59:20,670 --> 02:59:22,750
print that too.
He's growing.

4207
02:59:22,751 --> 02:59:23,584
He's,
he's drawing a monster's inc type 

4208
02:59:24,911 --> 02:59:27,070
monster and then getting to touch it.
Well,

4209
02:59:27,071 --> 02:59:27,904
not only that,
he's making flames come out of these 

4210
02:59:29,501 --> 02:59:29,981
things.
Oh,

4211
02:59:29,981 --> 02:59:31,660
this is bad ass.
I look at that.

4212
02:59:32,320 --> 02:59:36,210
Beautiful.
I can't wait to draw Jodi with big boobs

4213
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:39,550
and 3-d dude.
Find out when it's available and we will

4214
02:59:39,551 --> 02:59:40,384
purchase out that you can buy it now.
It won't ship until like a couple of 

4215
02:59:44,981 --> 02:59:47,080
more weeks until they fucking do it,
Brian.

4216
02:59:47,081 --> 02:59:48,850
And we get this.
Do you ever,

4217
02:59:48,851 --> 02:59:51,080
do you ever do one of those uh,
uh,

4218
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:52,840
cast with this?
Yes.

4219
02:59:52,841 --> 02:59:53,180
No.
No.

4220
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:56,230
What was link people up to this?
Jamie.

4221
02:59:56,260 --> 02:59:57,093
Jamie.
What's the,

4222
02:59:57,140 --> 02:59:59,380
what's going to so much fun?
You can get video outputs,

4223
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:02,620
dragon to back it up,
back it up.

4224
03:00:02,621 --> 03:00:04,600
Just a second dude,
back it up.

4225
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:07,240
Look at that.
That's insane.

4226
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:09,370
There's some really cool art being made 
with this.

4227
03:00:09,371 --> 03:00:10,204
The guy that showed this to me,
Chadwick at circle vr cities working 

4228
03:00:12,161 --> 03:00:12,580
with,
uh,

4229
03:00:12,580 --> 03:00:13,413
I maybe I shouldn't even say,
but some cool visual artists that are 

4230
03:00:15,551 --> 03:00:18,040
making some really,
really awesome things.

4231
03:00:18,140 --> 03:00:18,840
Wow.
There's that.

4232
03:00:18,840 --> 03:00:21,100
And you get to almost interact with it.
You can,

4233
03:00:21,160 --> 03:00:23,080
you can explore this space.
So like,

4234
03:00:23,110 --> 03:00:23,681
uh,
this,

4235
03:00:23,681 --> 03:00:26,020
this is actual actual program records,

4236
03:00:26,190 --> 03:00:28,270
all the movements and motions that 
you're making.

4237
03:00:28,510 --> 03:00:31,930
You can upload them and share them and 
download them on your own.

4238
03:00:32,200 --> 03:00:34,600
And then watch,
like I could watch Brian Paint,

4239
03:00:34,601 --> 03:00:36,160
Joey Diaz or however you want to do.

4240
03:00:36,450 --> 03:00:39,650
You were talking right now and most of 
the people are just listening to this.

4241
03:00:39,651 --> 03:00:42,670
So if you want to see the video,
the video's entitled,

4242
03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:44,913
uh,
Nvidia powers tilt brush art contest at 

4243
03:00:48,261 --> 03:00:53,261
htc vine at Pax 2015 and it's amazing.
I mean,

4244
03:00:53,421 --> 03:00:56,000
it's really,
it's one of the most amazing things I've

4245
03:00:56,001 --> 03:00:58,340
ever seen.
When you look at like the future,

4246
03:00:59,030 --> 03:01:00,220
like you look at technology

4247
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:01,690
in the future and you think like,
what,

4248
03:01:01,691 --> 03:01:04,300
what does entertainment going to be like
when you see something like this?

4249
03:01:04,720 --> 03:01:05,553
I mean,
you're going to have like full on dmt 

4250
03:01:06,731 --> 03:01:08,470
trips with a headset.
Yeah,

4251
03:01:08,670 --> 03:01:09,503
100%.
You're not even going to have to do a 

4252
03:01:10,121 --> 03:01:10,990
drug.
And you know,

4253
03:01:10,991 --> 03:01:11,824
that's something McKenna predicted.
Terence Mckenna predicted that one day 

4254
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:16,893
through virtual reality.
They would figure out a way to recreate 

4255
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:20,643
the DMT dimension and you'd be able to 
go there without actually being fucked 

4256
03:01:24,011 --> 03:01:27,430
up without actually being intoxicated on
dmt.

4257
03:01:27,670 --> 03:01:28,660
You'd be able to go there.

4258
03:01:29,640 --> 03:01:32,460
I think DMT is the existence of time 
trouble.

4259
03:01:33,240 --> 03:01:35,210
Well,
I mean it's,

4260
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:36,810
it's something weird,
you know,

4261
03:01:36,811 --> 03:01:38,310
whatever the fuck it is.
Kill that.

4262
03:01:39,190 --> 03:01:41,820
It's talking about that a lot.
Why I reached out to that.

4263
03:01:41,821 --> 03:01:42,840
Have you done?
No,

4264
03:01:42,841 --> 03:01:44,460
I reached out to dunk and talk to him 
about it.

4265
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:45,740
You want to do it?
Uh,

4266
03:01:45,810 --> 03:01:47,840
I told him I did and he said he thought 
it was a bad idea.

4267
03:01:48,210 --> 03:01:51,300
Why?
It's like I say that knows pretty well,

4268
03:01:52,570 --> 03:01:53,690
you know,
I don't have that Brent.

4269
03:01:53,720 --> 03:01:56,020
Maybe I don't have the brain.
I want to babysit you,

4270
03:01:56,100 --> 03:01:58,160
man.
You sure?

4271
03:01:58,190 --> 03:01:59,140
Now,
right up there,

4272
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:01,950
I've done every drug there is,
but I've never done dmt and I don't know

4273
03:02:01,951 --> 03:02:04,860
if my,
my biggest fear right now is not,

4274
03:02:04,890 --> 03:02:07,110
it's not the trip.
It's not the con,

4275
03:02:07,650 --> 03:02:08,483
it's the fact that I have two children 
and they rely on my brain to make them 

4276
03:02:11,551 --> 03:02:12,384
money.
So for me to fuck with my brain for me 

4277
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,880
is not the greatest thing because I got 
a pretty fragile brain.

4278
03:02:18,030 --> 03:02:19,800
You know,
we've all heard of this podcast.

4279
03:02:20,140 --> 03:02:22,380
I fucking drink a bottle of wine on a 
treadmill.

4280
03:02:22,410 --> 03:02:27,000
Like I'm not the guy that maybe belongs 
rolling the dice and going,

4281
03:02:27,060 --> 03:02:27,893
let's see what happens.
What are you worried that would happen 

4282
03:02:29,610 --> 03:02:31,230
but don't come back.
You don't come back.

4283
03:02:31,390 --> 03:02:32,223
That's it.
Come like the dude from pink floyd and 

4284
03:02:33,391 --> 03:02:37,320
just lose your marbles or diamond.
Yeah,

4285
03:02:37,440 --> 03:02:39,070
and I'll probably Williams whatever his 
name is.

4286
03:02:39,071 --> 03:02:39,480
[inaudible]

4287
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:43,410
since he got high on acid,
he was in Vietnam.

4288
03:02:49,290 --> 03:02:51,740
I was in the shit.
Shit man.

4289
03:02:52,060 --> 03:02:53,350
Ryan,
you weren't even in that country.

4290
03:02:53,351 --> 03:02:55,850
You were in Iraq was the only reason.
Oh yeah.

4291
03:02:55,860 --> 03:02:56,681
Yeah.
It was.

4292
03:02:56,681 --> 03:03:00,310
The only reason I won't do it is a,
it's just a pure,

4293
03:03:00,311 --> 03:03:01,900
I don't come back.
Well,

4294
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:03,910
that's a legitimate fear.
That's it.

4295
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:04,833
I love my kids.
I want them to have a great life and I 

4296
03:03:06,071 --> 03:03:08,740
committed to that when I had them and 
that's my fear.

4297
03:03:09,100 --> 03:03:14,100
Do I respect you massively for allowing 
a differentiation in,

4298
03:03:14,950 --> 03:03:17,290
in family and and,
and,

4299
03:03:17,350 --> 03:03:20,650
and the extra treasure psychosis or 
whatever the,

4300
03:03:21,250 --> 03:03:23,500
whatever the thing is,
psychedelic say.

4301
03:03:23,501 --> 03:03:24,334
That's it.

4302
03:03:26,770 --> 03:03:28,840
Can I tell you what I all,
I could think that whole time.

4303
03:03:29,110 --> 03:03:30,580
Why don't you guys have,
could you,

4304
03:03:30,581 --> 03:03:33,760
could you guys have an a,
a vr camera,

4305
03:03:33,880 --> 03:03:37,450
a virtual reality camera on the side so 
people could throw on goggles,

4306
03:03:37,690 --> 03:03:38,523
smoke a joint,
watching show like they were sitting in 

4307
03:03:39,791 --> 03:03:41,530
the room.
That's definitely going to happen.

4308
03:03:41,770 --> 03:03:43,600
I think that's bad.
I think it's going to happen.

4309
03:03:43,770 --> 03:03:45,100
I'm telling you.
No Way.

4310
03:03:45,101 --> 03:03:46,330
We'll be able to stop it.
Sorry.

4311
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:47,960
It's already happening to us.
Right?

4312
03:03:48,430 --> 03:03:49,770
What about how many years away,
Jamie?

4313
03:03:50,370 --> 03:03:51,750
Less than a year.
Let's do it.

4314
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:53,720
I'll make it happen tomorrow.
Crazy.

4315
03:03:53,730 --> 03:03:54,563
You don't get an eagle,
the eagle on us and there's no reason 

4316
03:03:56,681 --> 03:03:57,514
already.

4317
03:03:58,030 --> 03:04:02,390
People that have like live shows like I 
like it like a live podcasts video where

4318
03:04:02,570 --> 03:04:03,403
if feels like you're sitting in the 
studio and he just can walk and look 

4319
03:04:05,751 --> 03:04:07,550
around and do whatever you're doing.
That's the show.

4320
03:04:08,780 --> 03:04:09,613
I know the brilliance of it.
I loved what I love about it and when I 

4321
03:04:11,631 --> 03:04:12,464
listen,
I feel like I'm in the room when I'll 

4322
03:04:13,901 --> 03:04:16,400
watch it,
I still feel like I'm in the room.

4323
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:17,833
But man,
I would be cool to be able to be on the 

4324
03:04:18,981 --> 03:04:21,590
road and throwing some glasses and just 
feel like I'm sitting there.

4325
03:04:22,190 --> 03:04:24,500
It's gonna happen.
It's 100% going to happen.

4326
03:04:24,530 --> 03:04:25,363
There's no way around it.
Did you guys watch the Oscars and see 

4327
03:04:27,201 --> 03:04:28,034
like all the Samsung?
I like things where they now have like 

4328
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:33,440
the glasses where you just snap your 
phone in a day.

4329
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:35,420
They now advertise.
Oh,

4330
03:04:35,421 --> 03:04:36,670
virtual reality goggles.

4331
03:04:36,940 --> 03:04:37,850
We just take it like,
well,

4332
03:04:37,870 --> 03:04:40,220
you're no five unbox therapy.
Brought those in.

4333
03:04:40,221 --> 03:04:41,930
Yeah,
and I put that on,

4334
03:04:41,931 --> 03:04:42,741
man.
Did you put it on?

4335
03:04:42,741 --> 03:04:43,574
Did you try it out?
But now they're actually advertising it 

4336
03:04:45,621 --> 03:04:46,454
on tv to the masses,
like the moms and the dads on the 

4337
03:04:49,371 --> 03:04:51,610
corner.
And the one that Samsung has is,

4338
03:04:51,611 --> 03:04:55,130
is cool but there's one that has a 
higher resolution,

4339
03:04:55,360 --> 03:04:56,193
like not just like the cell phone one is
like real simple because you just use 

4340
03:04:59,451 --> 03:05:00,284
your existing cell phone,
you slide it into this sort of bracket 

4341
03:05:02,271 --> 03:05:03,104
you put on the headphones.
But they have some that are attached to 

4342
03:05:04,941 --> 03:05:06,230
computers,
you know,

4343
03:05:06,240 --> 03:05:10,730
they're the really intensive programming
as far as like their ability to,

4344
03:05:10,731 --> 03:05:11,564
uh,
to computate like the big thing about 

4345
03:05:13,580 --> 03:05:17,990
visuals and about artificial reality and
about virtual reality.

4346
03:05:18,260 --> 03:05:19,093
The big thing is computational power.
It's to be able to create a seamless 

4347
03:05:24,321 --> 03:05:26,120
reality all the time.

4348
03:05:26,480 --> 03:05:27,313
Like it's one of the things that you 
would always see when you would play 

4349
03:05:29,151 --> 03:05:31,430
video games.
It's like a little bit of lag.

4350
03:05:31,790 --> 03:05:34,690
Like if your computer was struggling 
because your um,

4351
03:05:35,210 --> 03:05:36,043
you know,
your video card couldn't keep up with 

4352
03:05:37,431 --> 03:05:40,030
the,
the resolution of the,

4353
03:05:40,031 --> 03:05:43,810
of the screen and the frames per second 
that you had it set up down.

4354
03:05:44,490 --> 03:05:46,400
Well the,
you the resolution is a big one cause it

4355
03:05:46,470 --> 03:05:49,010
it would establish with the frames per 
second where,

4356
03:05:49,011 --> 03:05:49,844
because like most video cards like in 
when I used to make pcs I used to buy 

4357
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:54,793
like pcs.
I just buy the shell and buy a 

4358
03:05:56,061 --> 03:05:58,300
motherboard and hard drives and shit.
And uh,

4359
03:05:58,550 --> 03:06:01,010
my friend Andrew would,
he would always help me out.

4360
03:06:01,011 --> 03:06:01,844
Here's my security net in case things 
went bad cause I was like okay what the 

4361
03:06:04,251 --> 03:06:05,084
fuck is next?
And I would get on the phone with him 

4362
03:06:06,981 --> 03:06:08,710
from Oklahoma and he would talk me 
through it.

4363
03:06:08,710 --> 03:06:10,660
But it's only making toast.
Yeah.

4364
03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:11,713
But creating a pc that's like,
one of the big things is like if you 

4365
03:06:14,871 --> 03:06:17,450
want to game on it,
the old video cards,

4366
03:06:17,451 --> 03:06:18,284
a lot of them you'd have to connect to 
video cards together and form an Sli 

4367
03:06:21,111 --> 03:06:25,640
connection that allowed you to have like
double the processing power in order for

4368
03:06:25,641 --> 03:06:26,474
you to play at a high resolution.
Otherwise you'd have turned the 

4369
03:06:28,011 --> 03:06:30,410
resolution.
And I was way low so that it looked like

4370
03:06:30,411 --> 03:06:31,244
shit.
Like some guys would even take away all 

4371
03:06:32,931 --> 03:06:33,764
the,
um,

4372
03:06:33,980 --> 03:06:37,700
the textures.
So like say you would be playing quake,

4373
03:06:37,730 --> 03:06:41,210
so you'd be going down a dark dungeon.
It would look cool as fuck and you would

4374
03:06:41,211 --> 03:06:44,150
see good crazy lighting and the graphics
are amazing.

4375
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:48,800
But to the hardcore competitive gamers,
that shit was just distracting.

4376
03:06:49,040 --> 03:06:53,360
So what they would do is they would take
all the textures out and they would turn

4377
03:06:53,361 --> 03:06:58,361
the entire space that you were playing 
in and to this white canvas with you.

4378
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:00,053
Like you are a bright red and they can 
even change what your character 

4379
03:07:02,941 --> 03:07:06,480
represented on their screen.
So like you would say like,

4380
03:07:06,481 --> 03:07:10,650
I'm going to be like this little chick 
character because the chick character is

4381
03:07:10,651 --> 03:07:12,870
really difficult to hit cause she's so 
small.

4382
03:07:12,871 --> 03:07:13,704
It's hard to pinpoint even though they 
all have the same sort of box that you 

4383
03:07:16,141 --> 03:07:18,270
could shoot them in.
But it was to be harder to pinpoint.

4384
03:07:18,480 --> 03:07:19,313
And other people would say,
well what I want is everybody I play to 

4385
03:07:22,141 --> 03:07:24,750
be the giant square robot.
So they're an easy target.

4386
03:07:24,900 --> 03:07:27,870
So you see this like this,
this is what quake looks like.

4387
03:07:27,871 --> 03:07:28,704
This is quake three.
What it looks like when they turn off 

4388
03:07:31,140 --> 03:07:34,350
all the textures.
There's probably better ones out there,

4389
03:07:34,351 --> 03:07:35,950
Jim.
And we can see like a death match.

4390
03:07:36,420 --> 03:07:37,790
We'll see.
There's no texture.

4391
03:07:37,791 --> 03:07:39,570
So you don't see any texture on the 
ground.

4392
03:07:39,571 --> 03:07:41,820
You don't see any graphics.
Everything's sort of muted.

4393
03:07:41,900 --> 03:07:42,733
Is this theoretically what the premise 
of the matrix was where he just saw 

4394
03:07:44,991 --> 03:07:45,170
number

4395
03:07:45,170 --> 03:07:46,040
verse?
No,

4396
03:07:46,041 --> 03:07:46,461
no,
no.

4397
03:07:46,461 --> 03:07:47,510
But this is,
is just,

4398
03:07:47,511 --> 03:07:49,190
she just,
it's a last,

4399
03:07:49,191 --> 03:07:51,050
it's kind of cheating a lot of people's 
eyes.

4400
03:07:51,051 --> 03:07:52,510
It makes you green also.
Like,

4401
03:07:52,511 --> 03:07:54,290
oh there's the bright green guy.
Yeah,

4402
03:07:54,291 --> 03:07:57,590
you can change,
you can change what their character is.

4403
03:07:57,680 --> 03:08:01,400
So like say you don't have the,
you don't have the right,

4404
03:08:01,401 --> 03:08:03,470
like say if you decide that you were a 
girl in the game.

4405
03:08:03,471 --> 03:08:04,490
And a lot of guys,
like I said,

4406
03:08:04,491 --> 03:08:07,550
played as a girl because it was small.
You,

4407
03:08:07,610 --> 03:08:09,550
you don't get to decide how other people
see you.

4408
03:08:09,620 --> 03:08:12,410
Other people can see you as a giant 
circle.

4409
03:08:12,560 --> 03:08:16,910
Like instead of even seeing you as a 
person or a seeing is as a moving thing,

4410
03:08:17,060 --> 03:08:17,893
they could see you as a circle that 
doesn't change and you just become a 

4411
03:08:20,391 --> 03:08:23,810
target.
So it's way easier to hit you that it is

4412
03:08:23,811 --> 03:08:24,644
for you to hit.

4413
03:08:25,300 --> 03:08:27,200
It was way,
way easier for them to hit you,

4414
03:08:27,201 --> 03:08:31,010
then it's for you to hit them because 
you've become a giant target.

4415
03:08:31,011 --> 03:08:33,960
Whereas you're playing the game the way 
it's intended and they're just,

4416
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:35,120
uh,
you know,

4417
03:08:35,121 --> 03:08:37,730
an octopus with a machine gun or 
whatever the fuck their characters.

4418
03:08:38,180 --> 03:08:41,810
So you can kind of manipulate things and
change in the settings.

4419
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:44,480
And some people like it because it makes
it real simple.

4420
03:08:44,750 --> 03:08:45,590
You know,
like it's,

4421
03:08:45,620 --> 03:08:48,200
it's such a fast paced game anyway.
They don't want to be there.

4422
03:08:48,230 --> 03:08:49,063
They're not there for all that bullshit.
They're not there for textures and the 

4423
03:08:51,291 --> 03:08:52,124
way it looks,
they're just that kick ass and spray 

4424
03:08:53,751 --> 03:08:54,584
people,
rail gun people in the middle of the 

4425
03:08:56,061 --> 03:08:56,894
air.

4426
03:08:57,630 --> 03:09:00,990
It would bounce off these bouncy pad.
You can't talk.

4427
03:09:00,991 --> 03:09:02,760
You can't talk to me about,
uh,

4428
03:09:03,270 --> 03:09:04,530
about,
uh,

4429
03:09:04,560 --> 03:09:05,393
video games without thinking about the 
way dunk and looked at him when he was 

4430
03:09:07,441 --> 03:09:08,670
addicted to them.
Oh yeah.

4431
03:09:08,730 --> 03:09:10,200
I think about that so much.
Cause you know,

4432
03:09:10,201 --> 03:09:14,580
it's like when he was like,
is it different kind of video game too.

4433
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:17,880
He plays a video game that you become 
like a part of the game.

4434
03:09:17,881 --> 03:09:20,820
He's into those like massive multiplayer
games,

4435
03:09:20,990 --> 03:09:21,890
you know.
Hey,

4436
03:09:21,990 --> 03:09:24,540
I remember driving through the training 
through the hills.

4437
03:09:24,600 --> 03:09:25,171
They can,
oh,

4438
03:09:25,171 --> 03:09:27,840
that's the mountains of till door or 
whatever.

4439
03:09:27,980 --> 03:09:28,813
Ah,

4440
03:09:29,090 --> 03:09:29,351
uh,
no,

4441
03:09:29,351 --> 03:09:31,090
but I used to be addicted to,
this sounds silly,

4442
03:09:31,130 --> 03:09:32,910
really silly,
but to Tony Hawk's,

4443
03:09:32,950 --> 03:09:34,000
uh,
ice skater,

4444
03:09:34,230 --> 03:09:36,730
it was so good.
You were addicted to a skating game.

4445
03:09:36,770 --> 03:09:37,603
I was addicted to video games.
It's just the idea of getting into the 

4446
03:09:39,641 --> 03:09:42,460
same format.
It's just like drinking or drugs.

4447
03:09:42,461 --> 03:09:44,800
I'm sure the same rituals,
you know,

4448
03:09:44,801 --> 03:09:46,240
and then all of a sudden the same 
payoff.

4449
03:09:46,300 --> 03:09:48,550
But just imagine once this shit,
this,

4450
03:09:48,551 --> 03:09:51,640
this technology does virtual reality 
technology we were just looking at,

4451
03:09:51,880 --> 03:09:53,950
imagine if that becomes

4452
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:54,813
the new video game,
then things are going to be so bizarre 

4453
03:09:57,311 --> 03:09:58,144
because all all they're going to have to
do is figure out some sort of a body 

4454
03:10:01,291 --> 03:10:04,670
suit that,
that you were where the,

4455
03:10:04,671 --> 03:10:09,340
the actions of your environment 
correspond how the body suit feels like.

4456
03:10:09,640 --> 03:10:13,810
Like you could sit there with this 
virtual reality thing on and stand there

4457
03:10:14,050 --> 03:10:14,883
and when things grab at you,
it'll feel like something's actually 

4458
03:10:17,471 --> 03:10:18,304
grabbing you.
Like it's gonna get weirder and weirder 

4459
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:21,040
and then eventually they going to go,
listen man,

4460
03:10:21,220 --> 03:10:23,110
we can give you what we're giving you 
right now,

4461
03:10:23,140 --> 03:10:23,973
but it's not as good as we can do.
And what we can do is we can cut your 

4462
03:10:26,351 --> 03:10:27,184
brain open and we could put these 
electrodes in there and I can guarantee 

4463
03:10:29,921 --> 03:10:32,200
you,
you are going to be a super person.

4464
03:10:32,380 --> 03:10:34,960
You're going to be one of the avengers.
You're going to live in the moon.

4465
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:37,840
You're going to get your dick sucked.
Anytime you snap your finger twice,

4466
03:10:38,140 --> 03:10:43,140
you're going to have a a Harem of golden
girls from planet pussy that are here to

4467
03:10:44,051 --> 03:10:44,884
suck your Dick 24 hours a day just 
waiting and like a corral like 

4468
03:10:47,831 --> 03:10:51,550
immigrants trying to fucking come off of
a raft and escaped to freedom.

4469
03:10:51,730 --> 03:10:53,180
That's what's going to be like every day
of your life.

4470
03:10:53,240 --> 03:10:56,060
All you gotta do is cut your head open,
but it takes some wires in there.

4471
03:10:56,360 --> 03:10:57,193
What will happen is the same thing as my
wife and your wife grown chickens and 

4472
03:11:00,441 --> 03:11:03,020
grown eggs.
They'll all the sudden,

4473
03:11:03,530 --> 03:11:04,730
40 years from now,
they'll be like,

4474
03:11:05,090 --> 03:11:06,890
you know what?
I'm going to have a child.

4475
03:11:07,340 --> 03:11:08,570
Like it's the same thing,
man.

4476
03:11:08,600 --> 03:11:10,370
Your wife does it.
My wife does it.

4477
03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:11,473
They grow,
they have chickens and they grow eggs 

4478
03:11:12,861 --> 03:11:13,694
and they fucking find some sort of 
pleasure in like almost dislike 20 year 

4479
03:11:18,051 --> 03:11:22,250
jump at 50 or jump back,
but like having an animal and I know you

4480
03:11:22,251 --> 03:11:24,350
love those eggs.
I know I fucking love those eggs.

4481
03:11:24,351 --> 03:11:26,930
When I cracked those eggs open and I go,
I met.

4482
03:11:26,931 --> 03:11:29,240
I never eat.
I never eat scrambled eggs my life until

4483
03:11:29,241 --> 03:11:32,090
I got chickens.
Now I'm like fucking scrambled eggs.

4484
03:11:32,091 --> 03:11:33,140
You get away with eating.

4485
03:11:33,170 --> 03:11:37,280
No scrambled eggs over easy.
I don't fuck with scrambled eggs,

4486
03:11:37,430 --> 03:11:39,410
but man,
now that I know they're in my backyard,

4487
03:11:39,411 --> 03:11:41,570
a little wet scrambled egg with some 
cheese on it.

4488
03:11:41,900 --> 03:11:44,120
That's the best God damn thing in the 
world because they're my eggs,

4489
03:11:44,270 --> 03:11:45,103
but so the same thing will happen is 
that progression will give just like 

4490
03:11:47,481 --> 03:11:49,870
tomatoes and cucumbers and Kale,
all that shit.

4491
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:51,830
We get a store back in the day.
They had to grow it.

4492
03:11:51,831 --> 03:11:52,664
They never fucked with it.
Same thing will happen is one day 

4493
03:11:54,441 --> 03:11:56,000
someone would be like,
man,

4494
03:11:56,210 --> 03:11:57,043
it's going to sound crazy.
I'm thinking about getting a hand job 

4495
03:11:59,390 --> 03:12:00,560
and someone would be like,
what?

4496
03:12:00,870 --> 03:12:02,420
From like a person?
They're like,

4497
03:12:02,421 --> 03:12:04,040
yeah,
I'm going to disconnect.

4498
03:12:04,400 --> 03:12:06,800
I'm going to get one hand job.
I want to see what it feels like.

4499
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:10,040
I've heard about it so tired that people
hooked up to the Matrix.

4500
03:12:10,370 --> 03:12:12,020
You wouldn't be able to jerk you off 
correctly.

4501
03:12:12,230 --> 03:12:13,063
And it was like really tired,
atrophied hands because they haven't 

4502
03:12:15,771 --> 03:12:17,810
moved in months.
He didn't disconnect

4503
03:12:22,590 --> 03:12:23,423
good though because they don't have an 
energy and then after they're done they 

4504
03:12:25,171 --> 03:12:27,540
have to rest for days.
They're exhausted.

4505
03:12:27,930 --> 03:12:28,763
Arm swells up with inflammation is your 
tore all the ligaments and their arm 

4506
03:12:32,011 --> 03:12:34,530
cause they're just not used to moving it
and they jerked you off.

4507
03:12:34,620 --> 03:12:35,453
But look at you like hunting,
hunting with the airfoil hands with the 

4508
03:12:41,041 --> 03:12:42,070
eggs.
I mean there's,

4509
03:12:42,150 --> 03:12:43,140
there's a also,

4510
03:12:43,140 --> 03:12:43,973
because we are,
we are a part of the generation that 

4511
03:12:47,191 --> 03:12:49,500
came before us.
They gave birth to us,

4512
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:50,573
you know the people for them gave birth 
to them and all you have to do is go 

4513
03:12:52,491 --> 03:12:55,040
back three or four times and you live on
savages.

4514
03:12:55,190 --> 03:12:57,050
Okay.
That's not that far away.

4515
03:12:57,200 --> 03:12:59,540
Not that far away.
You can do that like five or six times.

4516
03:12:59,541 --> 03:13:01,070
You get to the point where there's no 
electricity.

4517
03:13:01,360 --> 03:13:02,193
He get to the point where people are 
burning wood and coal and shit to stay 

4518
03:13:04,671 --> 03:13:06,500
alive.
Like he's not that far.

4519
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:08,960
Where you do that.
You don't do that like 10 or 11 times.

4520
03:13:08,961 --> 03:13:10,940
Do you get to like barbarian type 
people,

4521
03:13:11,090 --> 03:13:13,190
but then you got to keep people going,
let's go camping.

4522
03:13:13,310 --> 03:13:14,143
But this is what I'm saying is like when
we're looking at the future and we're 

4523
03:13:16,791 --> 03:13:21,530
saying this is a real slippery slope,
like there's always gonna be people that

4524
03:13:21,531 --> 03:13:22,290
want eggs.

4525
03:13:22,290 --> 03:13:22,971
There's going to be,
it didn't,

4526
03:13:22,971 --> 03:13:24,830
it was there.
I don't want you to cut into their brain

4527
03:13:24,831 --> 03:13:25,664
and create the perfect reality.
They're going to be happy with their 

4528
03:13:27,441 --> 03:13:31,310
imperfect,
but yet realistic reality.

4529
03:13:31,370 --> 03:13:32,810
I know this is real.
I don't,

4530
03:13:32,840 --> 03:13:33,673
I,
I'm not going to take that magic leap 

4531
03:13:35,360 --> 03:13:36,193
into you drilling a hole in my head and 
sticking in some sort of a Usb port and 

4532
03:13:40,041 --> 03:13:41,960
plug me into the Matrix.
I'm not ready.

4533
03:13:42,170 --> 03:13:43,560
I'm not ready.
So they decided to go out,

4534
03:13:43,700 --> 03:13:45,650
but their kids might not do that,
man.

4535
03:13:46,280 --> 03:13:47,090
You know,
it might,

4536
03:13:47,090 --> 03:13:47,923
it might be one of those generational 
things where it takes just a few 

4537
03:13:50,571 --> 03:13:54,380
generations of people to go,
why are you camping?

4538
03:13:55,730 --> 03:13:57,860
Why you camping?
Do you want to live with dragons?

4539
03:13:57,861 --> 03:13:59,840
Do you want to fly to the moon on your 
Dick?

4540
03:14:00,110 --> 03:14:00,943
Can you want to shoot your Dick like a 
fucking pogo stick and the launch 

4541
03:14:03,111 --> 03:14:05,090
yourself into the fucking asteroid belt?

4542
03:14:05,330 --> 03:14:06,830
Well,
you can do it dude.

4543
03:14:07,220 --> 03:14:08,053
Okay.
And it'll feel like you're really doing 

4544
03:14:09,081 --> 03:14:10,630
it.
You don't have to fucking camping.

4545
03:14:11,090 --> 03:14:11,980
Camping.
Oh my God.

4546
03:14:11,981 --> 03:14:14,330
You see a bird?
Did you see a bird for real?

4547
03:14:14,870 --> 03:14:18,060
Did you wash your asshole and stream 
your shifts?

4548
03:14:19,190 --> 03:14:23,990
Standing Up Shane road a dragon into a 
black hole.

4549
03:14:23,991 --> 03:14:27,020
You fucking pussy.
Take the operation,

4550
03:14:27,440 --> 03:14:28,273
let them stick the USB port in your 
brain and let's do this then the next 

4551
03:14:32,121 --> 03:14:34,160
generation.
So I'm not saying it's a good idea,

4552
03:14:34,550 --> 03:14:36,590
I'm just saying it's going to happen.
I just want all I want.

4553
03:14:36,680 --> 03:14:41,680
Jamie is vr right there so I could throw
on the goggles right now on the road and

4554
03:14:43,131 --> 03:14:45,590
just be like,
you'd never get anything done.

4555
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:47,540
I just know it's just every now and 
then,

4556
03:14:47,541 --> 03:14:50,120
just the same way I watch a podcast,
but dote on and be in the room.

4557
03:14:50,150 --> 03:14:50,983
That would be bad ass.
That would be bad ass like just for 

4558
03:14:52,461 --> 03:14:54,020
right now.
Those fixes in life.

4559
03:14:54,710 --> 03:14:56,840
Just throw on the goggles and be in the 
room.

4560
03:14:56,841 --> 03:14:59,840
It'd be really fun.
It'd be so connected to that technology.

4561
03:14:59,841 --> 03:15:01,400
You'd want it all the time.
Could,

4562
03:15:01,401 --> 03:15:03,680
it'd be so much more spectacular than 
regular life.

4563
03:15:03,710 --> 03:15:05,870
You'd want it all the time.
It'd be a real problem,

4564
03:15:06,170 --> 03:15:06,831
you think?
Yeah.

4565
03:15:06,831 --> 03:15:07,664
Yeah,
because if you lived your life without 

4566
03:15:09,531 --> 03:15:10,970
it and then all of a sudden it was an 
option,

4567
03:15:11,240 --> 03:15:12,073
it'd be so you'd be like,
why would I do those other things like 

4568
03:15:14,091 --> 03:15:14,924
I'm really confused.
There's certain options that would be 

4569
03:15:19,980 --> 03:15:21,530
before people would probably a hundred 
people,

4570
03:15:21,531 --> 03:15:22,970
a lot,
a lot of hundred percent.

4571
03:15:23,140 --> 03:15:23,973
A lot of people would,
a lot of people would not be able to 

4572
03:15:25,161 --> 03:15:28,670
handle it.
It's almost like we're not born with the

4573
03:15:28,671 --> 03:15:33,671
discipline or the even the concept of 
those kinds of parameters,

4574
03:15:34,940 --> 03:15:37,490
like I think that's what's going on with
these massive multiplayer games.

4575
03:15:37,491 --> 03:15:38,324
Guys like Dunkin and you remember rob,
the dude from the comedy store we've 

4576
03:15:40,701 --> 03:15:42,980
talked about often who is addicted to 
everquest?

4577
03:15:43,100 --> 03:15:44,450
Same.
Same kind of stuff.

4578
03:15:44,860 --> 03:15:45,693
Do you just get you,
you get influenced by something that 

4579
03:15:48,801 --> 03:15:50,010
you're not really,
you don't

4580
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:50,843
have an immune system for it.
He don't have like an intellectual 

4581
03:15:53,161 --> 03:15:55,590
immune system to say,
okay,

4582
03:15:56,220 --> 03:15:57,053
this is not real.
So we have to decide what we're doing 

4583
03:15:59,071 --> 03:15:59,904
here.
Are we going to live in the shittiest 

4584
03:16:01,681 --> 03:16:02,514
fucking neighborhood possible and rent 
the worst fucking apartment possible as 

4585
03:16:05,761 --> 03:16:09,060
long as it's got an internet connection 
and just plug in and be there all day?

4586
03:16:09,300 --> 03:16:14,220
Or are we going to try to live a 
comfortable existence on earth

4587
03:16:14,260 --> 03:16:16,270
and material earth where you can afford 
to pay your bills?

4588
03:16:16,271 --> 03:16:19,780
You don't freak out and occasionally use
this thing.

4589
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:21,970
How do we do this?
How do you manage this?

4590
03:16:22,240 --> 03:16:24,550
Because if it's so much better than real
life,

4591
03:16:24,551 --> 03:16:25,384
if you put it on and all of a sudden 
you're an avatar and it feels like 

4592
03:16:28,781 --> 03:16:29,614
Avatar and you're having a fucking great
time and you're jumping through the 

4593
03:16:31,871 --> 03:16:34,840
trees and landing in these hammocks and 
shit,

4594
03:16:34,841 --> 03:16:35,674
and you're all fucking flying dragons 
around and going to war and getting 

4595
03:16:38,861 --> 03:16:42,490
hooked up to that tree there guy,
that's gonna be real,

4596
03:16:42,580 --> 03:16:43,413
they're going to have that where it's 
going to be something that they've 

4597
03:16:46,301 --> 03:16:47,134
invented it.
They can send your mind and it won't 

4598
03:16:50,201 --> 03:16:51,034
even be artificial.
That's what it's not going to be like 

4599
03:16:52,481 --> 03:16:53,314
some like previously created narrative 
where it's got a beginning and an end 

4600
03:16:58,480 --> 03:16:59,313
like dragon's layer.
Remember that video game where you'd 

4601
03:17:01,180 --> 03:17:02,530
fucking turn the handle to the left?

4602
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:03,393
It's into the right

4603
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:05,500
cliff.
Now,

4604
03:17:05,500 --> 03:17:06,333
now talking about that.
I'm talking about that computations are 

4605
03:17:08,491 --> 03:17:11,490
gonna reach a point where it's so 
fucking powerful.

4606
03:17:11,640 --> 03:17:12,473
They're going to be able to create a 
real world where you're going to feel 

4607
03:17:14,911 --> 03:17:17,700
pebbles into your feet.
You're going gonna feel sand.

4608
03:17:17,701 --> 03:17:19,210
We're going to be thirsty.
Are you going to,

4609
03:17:19,211 --> 03:17:20,044
your Dick's going to get hard.
You're going to feel like you're really 

4610
03:17:21,991 --> 03:17:24,180
there,
it's going to be indistinguishable.

4611
03:17:24,181 --> 03:17:25,830
And it's,
it's a matter of time.

4612
03:17:26,070 --> 03:17:28,950
It's not if it's when it's 100%,
when,

4613
03:17:29,490 --> 03:17:33,870
when you see that this is Morse code,
this is banging on coconuts.

4614
03:17:33,871 --> 03:17:36,360
That's a smoke signal.
That's what that is.

4615
03:17:36,390 --> 03:17:37,560
This is,
it's common,

4616
03:17:37,561 --> 03:17:38,000
man.

4617
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:38,833
It's going to save marriages too,
because you can be able to like put 

4618
03:17:40,471 --> 03:17:43,770
these little yellow or green dots on 
your wife and then go like,

4619
03:17:43,771 --> 03:17:45,570
download any girl you want and be like,
oh,

4620
03:17:45,571 --> 03:17:47,010
I'm fucking Roseanne Barr.
Right?

4621
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,160
Because we get so mad at my wife's never
greenlight.

4622
03:17:49,230 --> 03:17:52,380
And that stopped with the downloads.
Can we do it without the dots tonight?

4623
03:17:53,510 --> 03:17:58,510
Sorry.
Can we do it without the dots?

4624
03:18:00,160 --> 03:18:03,000
I live a pretty amazing life.
I love my life.

4625
03:18:03,030 --> 03:18:03,863
I think there were a lot of,
a lot to be a lot of people that trade 

4626
03:18:05,431 --> 03:18:07,940
with me,
but every now and then I'd like to throw

4627
03:18:07,941 --> 03:18:08,774
in some goggles and a bed in a hotel 
room and just hang out in the room and 

4628
03:18:11,311 --> 03:18:12,920
listening to guys podcast.
I'm,

4629
03:18:12,930 --> 03:18:14,210
that's all I'm saying.
That's,

4630
03:18:14,230 --> 03:18:15,330
I'm talking,
I'm talking,

4631
03:18:15,630 --> 03:18:17,820
uh,
like you bringing it all back.

4632
03:18:17,880 --> 03:18:18,713
Yeah,
like that's the first thing I think is 

4633
03:18:20,220 --> 03:18:21,390
those things are here.

4634
03:18:21,570 --> 03:18:24,870
We can get them,
Samsung's got them plug one in.

4635
03:18:25,340 --> 03:18:27,180
Let me get those things,
those things.

4636
03:18:27,210 --> 03:18:28,043
That's Nvidia.
That's not the Samsung one is the one 

4637
03:18:29,791 --> 03:18:33,000
with the cell phone and there's pretty 
good Jason's we're talking about,

4638
03:18:33,001 --> 03:18:35,880
we've talked about it early on.
Video Shit is complete next level,

4639
03:18:35,910 --> 03:18:38,070
next back to the next level on the next,
next,

4640
03:18:38,071 --> 03:18:39,000
next,
next level.

4641
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:42,300
And when that,
when that becomes something that I think

4642
03:18:42,301 --> 03:18:43,134
what we're going to do,
and I think we should probably talk 

4643
03:18:44,521 --> 03:18:48,250
about this once we're done here,
I think the best way to do it is to find

4644
03:18:48,250 --> 03:18:52,480
out when they're available and then like
set up some sort of a new studio.

4645
03:18:52,720 --> 03:18:55,120
Like a new room in here.
I got you covered.

4646
03:18:55,150 --> 03:18:58,100
You know like we have that other room.
We could do something back in there.

4647
03:18:58,480 --> 03:19:01,060
Like a room for it.
It's based off of a room.

4648
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:01,781
Yeah.
Yeah.

4649
03:19:01,781 --> 03:19:02,650
I got you.
I got you covered.

4650
03:19:02,770 --> 03:19:03,171
Okay.
I've,

4651
03:19:03,171 --> 03:19:04,500
I've been approached by a bit of traffic
channel.

4652
03:19:04,501 --> 03:19:08,140
It just doesn't work with us.
So I'll set my guy up with you guys.

4653
03:19:08,230 --> 03:19:10,750
I'll just set them up with Jamie.
But uh,

4654
03:19:10,780 --> 03:19:13,630
it doesn't work for us.
So will you be on the first podcast?

4655
03:19:13,631 --> 03:19:16,720
We do from there hundred percent naked 
naked.

4656
03:19:16,810 --> 03:19:19,000
I didn't ask for that.
I'll fuck your mouth.

4657
03:19:20,790 --> 03:19:23,100
Racist.
A Gong is racist.

4658
03:19:23,140 --> 03:19:24,880
Fucking inman.
I think that,

4659
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:26,500
I mean,
as a fan of pot,

4660
03:19:26,530 --> 03:19:28,480
you know,
you've got to always come realize I come

4661
03:19:28,481 --> 03:19:29,980
at this,
all of this and you know this,

4662
03:19:30,640 --> 03:19:32,860
but I'm the first time I met you and I 
was like,

4663
03:19:32,861 --> 03:19:33,850
dude,
I got to see the dog,

4664
03:19:33,851 --> 03:19:35,890
the deprivation tank,
the pool table.

4665
03:19:35,950 --> 03:19:36,783
I'm a fan always of comedy of podcasting
and I can tell you what the consumer 

4666
03:19:41,861 --> 03:19:43,000
wants because this is what I,
how,

4667
03:19:43,001 --> 03:19:46,180
this is how I use podcasts and the way 
people use it that listened to it.

4668
03:19:46,410 --> 03:19:48,760
And then when I'm on the road bike,
I like to,

4669
03:19:48,761 --> 03:19:49,594
I like to get lost.
I lay in bed and listen to it in the 

4670
03:19:52,181 --> 03:19:55,690
phone and I just kind of like fall 
asleep and disappear into it.

4671
03:19:56,560 --> 03:20:00,580
That is the next level of podcasting I 
believe because man,

4672
03:20:00,581 --> 03:20:02,440
I'm telling you,
I got a loan out on the road.

4673
03:20:02,441 --> 03:20:05,890
It would be so much easier for me to 
like pour a glass of wine,

4674
03:20:05,920 --> 03:20:06,753
throw on some goggles,
and they'd just be with you guys and 

4675
03:20:08,111 --> 03:20:09,450
just be like going to happen.
It's,

4676
03:20:09,470 --> 03:20:11,260
it's,
and it's unavoidable.

4677
03:20:11,290 --> 03:20:12,123
I think the same way when you're sitting
in your man cave and you watch a 

4678
03:20:13,961 --> 03:20:16,390
Netflix,
what are you doing?

4679
03:20:16,390 --> 03:20:18,640
I mean you're,
you're watching narcos.

4680
03:20:18,641 --> 03:20:20,650
Narcos.
Thank you.

4681
03:20:20,651 --> 03:20:22,690
Eddie Bravo.
Why'd you decide when to watch it?

4682
03:20:22,691 --> 03:20:24,070
Right?
So you just sit down,

4683
03:20:24,220 --> 03:20:26,820
you press play and it's a,
it's entertaining you,

4684
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:28,480
you know,
and it plays right in front of you.

4685
03:20:28,570 --> 03:20:31,420
Imagine if you could just say magically,
just if I could just go,

4686
03:20:31,750 --> 03:20:32,583
you know what honey?
I'm going to go back to the room and 

4687
03:20:33,431 --> 03:20:34,264
hang out with Brian and Joe and Jamie 
and I just throw on some goggles and 

4688
03:20:36,791 --> 03:20:38,410
then hit play and all of a sudden I'm in
the room.

4689
03:20:39,130 --> 03:20:42,550
We're all in this room.
Just feels like it feels like this.

4690
03:20:42,760 --> 03:20:44,560
Yeah.
And you're just chilling.

4691
03:20:44,710 --> 03:20:45,700
Yeah,
that's the name.

4692
03:20:45,720 --> 03:20:46,553
I mean,
and they can be a guy you let in every 

4693
03:20:47,950 --> 03:20:48,783
week that actually can sit in.
He have someone pull up a chair and sit 

4694
03:20:51,671 --> 03:20:53,770
in the virtual world with Dato.
Yeah.

4695
03:20:53,780 --> 03:20:56,200
To like prescreen them.
I make sure I'm not out of their fucking

4696
03:20:56,201 --> 03:20:57,580
mind.
Are you jacking off,

4697
03:20:57,820 --> 03:20:58,660
hey,
hey,

4698
03:20:59,290 --> 03:21:00,970
is what I'm seeing?
Really what you're doing.

4699
03:21:02,060 --> 03:21:05,680
Guess how could you be jacking off the 
entire time esther Ku style.

4700
03:21:05,980 --> 03:21:06,813
But meanwhile you're,
you're the dude with the pocket 

4701
03:21:08,231 --> 03:21:09,064
handkerchief and the tie clip.
This is the right room to make that 

4702
03:21:11,321 --> 03:21:12,154
happen.
And I'm being dead serious when I say 

4703
03:21:12,851 --> 03:21:13,684
this.
Like,

4704
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:14,533
and like I said,
we've been approached for travel 

4705
03:21:15,671 --> 03:21:16,930
channel.
People have come to us and go,

4706
03:21:17,110 --> 03:21:17,831
hey,
could you do vr?

4707
03:21:17,831 --> 03:21:19,960
It just doesn't work for a network TV 
show.

4708
03:21:20,350 --> 03:21:24,040
I'll send whatever p context.
I have this way to Jamie.

4709
03:21:24,110 --> 03:21:28,690
And because as a fan,
that is what I'd like to watch.

4710
03:21:28,960 --> 03:21:30,610
I'd like to be here.
I'd like to sit right there.

4711
03:21:30,611 --> 03:21:33,250
I really want to sit right here,
but it's going to happen.

4712
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:35,550
It's just what we're,
we're,

4713
03:21:35,551 --> 03:21:36,384
we're experiencing right now is the 
beginning of a new revolution in 

4714
03:21:39,341 --> 03:21:41,710
entertainment where movies are going to 
play out like that.

4715
03:21:41,950 --> 03:21:44,950
I think there's also going to be movies 
with not just one,

4716
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:46,220
but multiple different

4717
03:21:46,220 --> 03:21:48,470
possibilities like at every turn.
Really.

4718
03:21:48,500 --> 03:21:49,333
Yeah.
I think there's going to be interactive 

4719
03:21:50,271 --> 03:21:51,890
movies.
I think what they're gonna do is they're

4720
03:21:51,891 --> 03:21:55,340
going to figure out a way to engineer 
virtual reality into an integrated,

4721
03:21:55,670 --> 03:21:56,503
integrated environment where the virtual
reality is interactive and there's a 

4722
03:22:01,101 --> 03:22:04,160
bunch of different potentials.
So like instead of like,

4723
03:22:05,180 --> 03:22:06,590
say if you,
uh,

4724
03:22:06,620 --> 03:22:08,090
if there's a movie,
you know,

4725
03:22:08,091 --> 03:22:09,920
um,
American Werewolf in London,

4726
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:10,853
it's got a really specific beginning,
a really specific moment where it 

4727
03:22:13,941 --> 03:22:16,490
becomes a werewolf specific moment 
where,

4728
03:22:16,700 --> 03:22:17,533
uh,
his girlfriend realizes he's aware of 

4729
03:22:19,311 --> 03:22:20,144
wolf and then he gets killed.
There's all these specific moments that 

4730
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:25,460
what if instead of all those specific 
moments,

4731
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:29,750
it's completely interactive.
Like you're actually there in London and

4732
03:22:29,751 --> 03:22:33,740
you are this American guy and your 
friend is put my fucking mind.

4733
03:22:33,770 --> 03:22:34,603
Yeah,
you're friendly.

4734
03:22:35,340 --> 03:22:36,440
Yeah,
and you can,

4735
03:22:36,620 --> 03:22:39,410
you can not only you in London,
but you're in the fucking,

4736
03:22:39,770 --> 03:22:43,250
you're in the bogs.
You're walking around in Scotland,

4737
03:22:43,280 --> 03:22:43,750
you're,
you're,

4738
03:22:43,750 --> 03:22:46,820
you're going to go to the fucking pub 
where the slaughtered lamb.

4739
03:22:46,860 --> 03:22:50,000
Remember they had the head on the wall.
All that stuff's going to be possible.

4740
03:22:50,001 --> 03:22:52,760
You're going to feel the rain.
You're going to feel the moisture.

4741
03:22:52,940 --> 03:22:55,280
They get to do a tap into your fucking 
dope man.

4742
03:22:55,281 --> 03:22:56,114
They're going to be able to do something
to your brain that makes you think 

4743
03:22:58,791 --> 03:22:59,900
you're really experiencing it.

4744
03:23:00,150 --> 03:23:02,970
You just proved me wrong and all the 
stuff,

4745
03:23:02,971 --> 03:23:04,300
they were like,
it's perfect for travel.

4746
03:23:04,310 --> 03:23:05,143
And I was like,
I don't get it.

4747
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:06,750
I'm looking at it and then you're like,
I'm like,

4748
03:23:06,840 --> 03:23:07,673
I could be in London,
like throwing goggles a be fucking 

4749
03:23:09,631 --> 03:23:11,910
walking through Austria.
It's going to happen.

4750
03:23:11,940 --> 03:23:13,430
That's the fucking future mining.

4751
03:23:13,560 --> 03:23:14,810
It might not happen.
Why?

4752
03:23:14,850 --> 03:23:15,990
Why?
We're alive.

4753
03:23:16,270 --> 03:23:17,103
I think it's going to,
I think it's just going to be just like 

4754
03:23:18,281 --> 03:23:19,114
when,
when you go to Disneyland or anything 

4755
03:23:19,811 --> 03:23:20,381
where it's like,
Hey,

4756
03:23:20,381 --> 03:23:22,070
I'm wa on the needs for speed.
Right.

4757
03:23:22,071 --> 03:23:23,290
And they're like,
Joe,

4758
03:23:23,291 --> 03:23:24,460
come here.
I need your help.

4759
03:23:25,490 --> 03:23:26,323
But to just going to be way more intense
than a horse ride at Disneyland is a 

4760
03:23:28,721 --> 03:23:29,280
better example.

4761
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:30,113
Well cause they have like 68 different 
endings or different stories that play 

4762
03:23:34,011 --> 03:23:34,390
out.

4763
03:23:34,390 --> 03:23:36,430
Have you been on those rides where they 
are like,

4764
03:23:36,610 --> 03:23:39,490
I only know that universal in Orlando 
has them,

4765
03:23:39,670 --> 03:23:40,503
but it's like the spiderman ride,
the whole crowd where it's a screen and 

4766
03:23:43,931 --> 03:23:44,764
it's a,
it's a cart that technically doesn't 

4767
03:23:46,361 --> 03:23:47,194
move technically,
but the screen shoots fire at you in 

4768
03:23:50,031 --> 03:23:50,890
suits Smith.
Yeah.

4769
03:23:50,950 --> 03:23:52,900
And you feel like you're free falling 90
feet.

4770
03:23:52,990 --> 03:23:54,130
Yeah.
Have you been in the news?

4771
03:23:54,250 --> 03:23:56,090
I've been on those.
I haven't been on that one a bit.

4772
03:23:56,091 --> 03:23:57,730
Um,
but I've been on other ones like that.

4773
03:23:57,790 --> 03:23:58,623
Those are awesome.
Those are the ones that I believe when 

4774
03:23:59,961 --> 03:24:00,794
we can't cover them on birth to conquer,
but all those rods because it's 

4775
03:24:03,401 --> 03:24:05,700
impossible.
So I was teen possible.

4776
03:24:05,850 --> 03:24:06,820
It's TV.
It's not,

4777
03:24:06,821 --> 03:24:08,110
there's no,
it's not the smell.

4778
03:24:08,111 --> 03:24:08,681
You're like,
you know,

4779
03:24:08,681 --> 03:24:09,590
like when you're on the sentence,
right.

4780
03:24:09,591 --> 03:24:10,490
He smells,
it's just wild.

4781
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:12,040
It's just,
it's literally like watching like,

4782
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:13,541
like,
oh,

4783
03:24:13,541 --> 03:24:14,240
that's funny.

4784
03:24:14,240 --> 03:24:16,960
Yeah.
You can't get like a little bit of video

4785
03:24:16,961 --> 03:24:17,621
of it.
I don't know.

4786
03:24:17,621 --> 03:24:19,240
I'm going to try.
Barb was shooting an episode.

4787
03:24:19,360 --> 03:24:22,060
I think people would want to see the 
little bit of video even till they go,

4788
03:24:22,061 --> 03:24:23,530
Huh,
I don't even see anything.

4789
03:24:23,710 --> 03:24:24,550
And then you could explain.
Yeah,

4790
03:24:24,590 --> 03:24:27,310
nothing is actually happening.
It's amazing.

4791
03:24:27,700 --> 03:24:28,700
It's amazing.
It's uh,

4792
03:24:28,810 --> 03:24:31,480
it's like the raiders of the lost ark or
writers a little bit like that,

4793
03:24:31,720 --> 03:24:35,040
but a little more driven thing.
The raiders of the lost Ark is moving,

4794
03:24:35,150 --> 03:24:39,130
goes fucking rods blow me away every 
time when you go,

4795
03:24:39,310 --> 03:24:42,310
when it's just a screen.
I am like a child,

4796
03:24:42,311 --> 03:24:43,700
like,
like Ha,

4797
03:24:44,010 --> 03:24:45,780
like literally grabbing pete.
What I mean,

4798
03:24:45,781 --> 03:24:46,614
that's,
I guess that's the premise of the show 

4799
03:24:47,071 --> 03:24:48,030
also.
But man,

4800
03:24:48,031 --> 03:24:48,864
I am falling fucking apart.
They're going to be able to have things 

4801
03:24:53,731 --> 03:24:55,170
like that times a million.

4802
03:24:55,540 --> 03:24:58,650
Do I think the next,
the next generation rollercoasters I was

4803
03:24:58,651 --> 03:25:00,740
talking to events and about this is 
because you know,

4804
03:25:00,830 --> 03:25:01,663
Doug's a big roller coaster fan.
What does best is a really big roller 

4805
03:25:04,471 --> 03:25:07,350
coaster fan.
Like the massive dude.

4806
03:25:07,950 --> 03:25:10,050
Massive.
Does he have like pins?

4807
03:25:10,290 --> 03:25:10,741
Uh,
no,

4808
03:25:10,741 --> 03:25:13,260
but he flies.
He flies himself out for the opening.

4809
03:25:13,261 --> 03:25:16,700
Abroad's like Doug Benson.
I can't talk to him.

4810
03:25:16,701 --> 03:25:17,534
He loves rollercoasters.
What was the last time you were on a 

4811
03:25:19,870 --> 03:25:22,110
rollercoaster?
They're fucking amazing.

4812
03:25:22,111 --> 03:25:22,944
They really are fucking amazing.
There's certain things that people that 

4813
03:25:24,890 --> 03:25:26,700
look,
draw a line in the sand or you're fan of

4814
03:25:26,710 --> 03:25:29,850
cricket.
Cricket's fucking amazing.

4815
03:25:30,210 --> 03:25:31,043
It lasts for four days.
How great would that be if I wasn't 

4816
03:25:32,190 --> 03:25:32,911
really?
Yeah.

4817
03:25:32,911 --> 03:25:34,920
Last one.
How great would it be if you had like an

4818
03:25:34,921 --> 03:25:37,260
ongoing communal event?
Like what's the score today?

4819
03:25:38,200 --> 03:25:39,330
Doesn't really,
four days.

4820
03:25:39,360 --> 03:25:40,200
40 days straight.

4821
03:25:40,590 --> 03:25:41,423
2020 cricket last for a day.
Regular cricket usually lasts for like 

4822
03:25:43,861 --> 03:25:44,910
four days.
Dang.

4823
03:25:45,180 --> 03:25:46,800
Don't you dare get Google list.
Jamie,

4824
03:25:47,640 --> 03:25:50,490
what a weird game.
It's so funny how baseballs weird too,

4825
03:25:50,491 --> 03:25:51,830
but it's normal.
Yeah.

4826
03:25:51,870 --> 03:25:53,970
Cause we're used to that weird.
You know other,

4827
03:25:54,030 --> 03:25:54,863
other people like what the fuck is,
but baseball so boring like in 

4828
03:25:56,881 --> 03:25:59,700
comparison to a lot of other sports like
comparison to soccer.

4829
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:01,980
They can understand why soccer never 
took hold.

4830
03:26:02,170 --> 03:26:03,630
We were like,
Eh,

4831
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:06,480
not buying it.
So whoever took cold,

4832
03:26:06,540 --> 03:26:07,373
the whole world loves it.
The whole world there is a soccer never 

4833
03:26:09,541 --> 03:26:11,910
took hold was advertising.
Um,

4834
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:13,920
no because America,
no,

4835
03:26:13,921 --> 03:26:15,720
it's advertising.
That's because America,

4836
03:26:15,870 --> 03:26:18,480
no,
soccer was very popular in the 70s never

4837
03:26:18,710 --> 03:26:19,710
was popular.
Oh,

4838
03:26:19,850 --> 03:26:21,810
tony was bro.
That's like big foot.

4839
03:26:21,820 --> 03:26:25,350
That's like some shit native Americans 
talk about around a campfire flashing.

4840
03:26:25,351 --> 03:26:26,184
Your lights went to the other car when 
there is no headlights on and you're 

4841
03:26:28,051 --> 03:26:29,940
going to get shy as a gang initiation.

4842
03:26:29,940 --> 03:26:31,560
You didn't hear about that one.
No.

4843
03:26:31,620 --> 03:26:32,453
Sour cream talking about,
I think I saw a movie with Ethan Hawke 

4844
03:26:34,351 --> 03:26:39,120
about the terrible Richard Gere.
That's true time.

4845
03:26:39,121 --> 03:26:41,110
Sigora your Dick.
Oh,

4846
03:26:41,370 --> 03:26:44,490
oh.
Necessary.

4847
03:26:46,410 --> 03:26:48,030
Have we broken over the three hour 
point?

4848
03:26:48,060 --> 03:26:48,630
Oh,
for sure.

4849
03:26:48,630 --> 03:26:49,463
Okay.
I'm just wondering because I keep 

4850
03:26:50,131 --> 03:26:51,780
feeling like I should wrap it up into 
it.

4851
03:26:51,990 --> 03:26:53,520
You want to wrap it?
We wrapping it.

4852
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:55,710
Let's wrap it.
Let's have a fake wrap.

4853
03:26:55,711 --> 03:26:56,544
We fake wrapped it.
I can figure out if it not wrapping it 

4854
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:00,930
ourselves.
Another conversation just got perfect.

4855
03:27:01,560 --> 03:27:02,820
Um,
it's good.

4856
03:27:02,821 --> 03:27:05,880
It's in a good place.
I'm very happy.

4857
03:27:06,270 --> 03:27:09,590
I've gotten over the stupor of about 40 
minutes ago where I was so high shit and

4858
03:27:09,591 --> 03:27:14,591
I've been talking to anybody that I hit.
I hit a moment where I was like,

4859
03:27:15,630 --> 03:27:16,710
Whoa,
wait.

4860
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:20,640
My idea was good.
It's just,

4861
03:27:20,641 --> 03:27:22,740
I couldn't remember what it was halfway 
into it.

4862
03:27:23,010 --> 03:27:25,260
The idea of being like pick a regular 
job and a,

4863
03:27:25,420 --> 03:27:27,420
if like eight out of 10 people that came
there wanting to fuck you,

4864
03:27:28,130 --> 03:27:28,963
but it probably,
if a girl was Washington guys balls and 

4865
03:27:30,181 --> 03:27:31,014
Asshole,
I'll probably be more than eight out of 

4866
03:27:31,591 --> 03:27:32,910
10.
I'm probably really conservative.

4867
03:27:33,740 --> 03:27:34,573
But this girl that was she,
I mean she knew that was a part of her 

4868
03:27:36,421 --> 03:27:37,350
job.
She made more money.

4869
03:27:37,410 --> 03:27:38,243
It's a different gig.
I saw you hit that joint more than I've 

4870
03:27:40,021 --> 03:27:40,860
ever seen.
You had a joint.

4871
03:27:41,020 --> 03:27:42,100
It's pretty strong.
Pretty

4872
03:27:42,100 --> 03:27:43,360
strong stuff.
We were deep.

4873
03:27:43,730 --> 03:27:48,640
Who went in the hole deep in the rabbit?
Oh No.

4874
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:51,430
Soliciting crusher.
A who gives a fuck?

4875
03:27:51,570 --> 03:27:53,550
He's catching up there.
He's got to have a lean,

4876
03:27:53,560 --> 03:27:55,690
is trying to kill his neighbor's dogs.
Do you know about that?

4877
03:27:55,810 --> 03:27:57,940
Havoline is killed the fucking dog down 
the street from him.

4878
03:27:58,120 --> 03:28:00,250
How about lit with the hub?
Lena havoline is a weird,

4879
03:28:00,520 --> 03:28:01,353
it looks like a pig,
but it's actually like a cousin of a 

4880
03:28:03,521 --> 03:28:05,560
pig.
I think it was called a peccary.

4881
03:28:05,800 --> 03:28:06,633
I think that's the,
the technical name for what kind of an 

4882
03:28:09,181 --> 03:28:12,100
animal it is.
But it's this weird freaky looking thing

4883
03:28:12,101 --> 03:28:15,490
that lives in the American southwest and
those motherfuckers were,

4884
03:28:15,580 --> 03:28:17,310
will kill dogs.
Uh,

4885
03:28:17,830 --> 03:28:18,461
they,
uh,

4886
03:28:18,461 --> 03:28:19,294
they killed a dog and Stan hope,
but I understand what they do is they 

4887
03:28:22,121 --> 03:28:22,954
flank them,
they get on the side of them and they 

4888
03:28:24,491 --> 03:28:27,070
just fuck it all run at him and tear him
apart.

4889
03:28:27,490 --> 03:28:28,630
So if they have,
you know,

4890
03:28:28,631 --> 03:28:33,631
you let some domesticated really soft 
dog loose and you,

4891
03:28:35,741 --> 03:28:38,560
uh,
leave him out there in,

4892
03:28:38,570 --> 03:28:40,060
uh,
the plains where,

4893
03:28:40,061 --> 03:28:43,030
where do they live?
The desert desert desert.

4894
03:28:43,390 --> 03:28:44,950
You leave them out there in the desert 
to play.

4895
03:28:45,340 --> 03:28:48,520
These mother fuckers literally might 
jump on him.

4896
03:28:48,521 --> 03:28:49,510
And eat him.
Like,

4897
03:28:49,520 --> 03:28:50,353
look,
get those teeth.

4898
03:28:51,160 --> 03:28:53,680
Those are aggressive.
They don't really go after people.

4899
03:28:53,770 --> 03:28:54,603
Here's a,
here's a really interesting thing about 

4900
03:28:55,530 --> 03:29:00,530
Havalinas there a,
an animal that responds in an insane way

4901
03:29:01,420 --> 03:29:02,253
to what's called a Predator call.
And a Predator call is look at the 

4902
03:29:05,741 --> 03:29:08,770
fucking teeth on that thing.
That's how the biggest Havalina,

4903
03:29:09,010 --> 03:29:12,260
they're not that big,
but they're fucking for Roche.

4904
03:29:12,420 --> 03:29:15,340
These are ferocious animals.
There's so powerful.

4905
03:29:15,820 --> 03:29:17,590
Um,
so they take this sound,

4906
03:29:17,591 --> 03:29:19,660
a Predator call is like a sound of an 
animal.

4907
03:29:19,661 --> 03:29:21,390
It's dying.
So they have this thing.

4908
03:29:21,390 --> 03:29:22,223
It's like something in agony and pain.
These motherfuckers come running like 

4909
03:29:29,711 --> 03:29:30,544
you've never seen anything before.
Like the way my friend Remy Warren 

4910
03:29:34,001 --> 03:29:35,200
described it,
he said,

4911
03:29:35,230 --> 03:29:36,063
havoline has come to a Predator call the
way you wish all animals came to a 

4912
03:29:38,771 --> 03:29:40,750
Predator call.
Like when you call them,

4913
03:29:40,751 --> 03:29:44,890
they come running at you full blast 
running cause Wayne to Jack.

4914
03:29:44,900 --> 03:29:45,733
Whatever's making that noise.
Like it's a race between them and all 

4915
03:29:47,921 --> 03:29:51,880
the other monsters behind them that are 
chasing to try to find this rabbit.

4916
03:29:52,150 --> 03:29:52,983
It's screaming,
they're probably broke its leg or 

4917
03:29:54,251 --> 03:29:56,950
something.
Oh Dude,

4918
03:29:56,980 --> 03:29:59,200
holy.
When you see them run,

4919
03:29:59,320 --> 03:30:03,220
they just running towards that sound 
like full clip and not cautious at all.

4920
03:30:03,410 --> 03:30:05,590
They just trying to get it in as quick 
as they can.

4921
03:30:06,460 --> 03:30:09,070
Who should?
The wild is so fucking scary,

4922
03:30:09,071 --> 03:30:12,210
dude.
Wild animals are solo.

4923
03:30:12,250 --> 03:30:13,083
Scary.
The wild of being a fucking peccary 

4924
03:30:17,380 --> 03:30:18,213
running around and dug stan hopes 
neighborhood trying to get by in the 

4925
03:30:20,441 --> 03:30:22,450
desert.
Seven miles away from Mexico.

4926
03:30:23,320 --> 03:30:25,510
Have you seen man on a buffalo?
I've met this guy.

4927
03:30:25,511 --> 03:30:26,344
He rides a buffalo around like it's a 
horse and then he gets attacked by a 

4928
03:30:28,841 --> 03:30:30,670
cougar and say as a baby and all this 
stuff.

4929
03:30:30,671 --> 03:30:33,310
It's like a documentary from the 70s 
that's really good.

4930
03:30:33,610 --> 03:30:36,160
And I highly recommend episodes of man 
and the Buffalo.

4931
03:30:38,220 --> 03:30:39,080
No,
no.

4932
03:30:39,100 --> 03:30:40,070
It's anything after that.
That

4933
03:30:40,070 --> 03:30:45,070
is the perfect sentence.
Dropped a fucking champ.

4934
03:30:48,550 --> 03:30:50,330
Lower fins,
cougars and whatnot.

4935
03:30:50,360 --> 03:30:51,193
Yeah.
A guy on a buffalo episode to tell you 

4936
03:30:53,140 --> 03:30:53,973
something.
I'm seeing this greatest video on the 

4937
03:30:57,321 --> 03:30:59,120
roses and saying,
how does he get the Buffalo?

4938
03:30:59,121 --> 03:31:00,200
Listen,
I don't know,

4939
03:31:00,201 --> 03:31:04,350
but those are the most unpredictable 
animals baby in the middle of nowhere we

4940
03:31:04,351 --> 03:31:05,000
wrote,
we drove.

4941
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:05,833
We drove buffalo across Texas and it's 
like one of the most unpredictable 

4942
03:31:08,781 --> 03:31:10,910
animals just wants to be the worst show 
ever.

4943
03:31:10,940 --> 03:31:13,210
And then if you listen to the song 
unfortunate look,

4944
03:31:13,220 --> 03:31:18,220
the baby's about to charter schools in 
the water and has to rescue the baby.

4945
03:31:20,360 --> 03:31:21,960
I think this is a joke Bryan.
No,

4946
03:31:21,980 --> 03:31:22,220
no,
no.

4947
03:31:22,220 --> 03:31:23,720
This is a real movie and the Seventies 
Watch,

4948
03:31:23,750 --> 03:31:25,220
um,
cause watched it.

4949
03:31:25,221 --> 03:31:27,740
The next thing I fucking cougar just 
attacks on.

4950
03:31:27,741 --> 03:31:29,000
Hang on Jamie.
Back it up.

4951
03:31:29,001 --> 03:31:30,140
Two shotguns,
Joe.

4952
03:31:30,141 --> 03:31:30,974
Listen lyrics.
I think this might be a joke now that 

4953
03:31:33,051 --> 03:31:33,860
song it guy.

4954
03:31:33,860 --> 03:31:35,640
This guy took a real movie and just,
yeah,

4955
03:31:35,690 --> 03:31:37,490
the song's good.
Sounds fake.

4956
03:31:37,491 --> 03:31:40,190
Let's,
let's go to the Cougar Park.

4957
03:31:40,560 --> 03:31:42,770
Um,
do you remember Grizzly Adams?

4958
03:31:42,830 --> 03:31:44,180
Oh fuck yeah.
That guy just died,

4959
03:31:44,181 --> 03:31:45,014
right?
Right here.

4960
03:31:45,640 --> 03:31:46,473
Yeah.
The guys crawling look into killed his 

4961
03:31:48,220 --> 03:31:49,053
deer and then a wolf attacks the buffalo
and the buffalo likes like get Outta 

4962
03:31:56,421 --> 03:31:57,070
here,
man.

4963
03:31:57,070 --> 03:31:57,903
Shit,
this cougar really is hanging on this 

4964
03:31:58,681 --> 03:31:59,514
guy.
How the fuck did they train that cat 

4965
03:32:00,891 --> 03:32:03,420
punching the cat and he's my God.
It's fun.

4966
03:32:04,250 --> 03:32:06,770
I picked that scripting gone wrong.
And how do you,

4967
03:32:06,771 --> 03:32:07,940
do you think so?
Of course you're,

4968
03:32:07,941 --> 03:32:10,010
I've worked with [inaudible].
Oh Shit.

4969
03:32:10,011 --> 03:32:11,900
A Wolf came after that.
Buffalo and God,

4970
03:32:11,901 --> 03:32:12,734
yeah.
Don't,

4971
03:32:12,830 --> 03:32:14,720
yeah,
I worked with lions and uh,

4972
03:32:14,900 --> 03:32:15,670
wait,
what?

4973
03:32:15,670 --> 03:32:16,310
Yeah.
Worked with,

4974
03:32:16,310 --> 03:32:17,450
no,
I worked with lions.

4975
03:32:17,451 --> 03:32:19,580
Bears and elephants.
Yeah,

4976
03:32:19,790 --> 03:32:22,100
of course.
One of the Elian fucks with you.

4977
03:32:22,101 --> 03:32:24,020
It's,
it's not that aggressive.

4978
03:32:24,410 --> 03:32:26,060
It's like,
it's like Paul Paul.

4979
03:32:26,090 --> 03:32:28,740
So what that was doing was a fucked up 
like a fuck up,

4980
03:32:28,840 --> 03:32:29,673
but it looks like the trainer that was 
probably the trainer they shot that 

4981
03:32:32,540 --> 03:32:35,180
cause it looks like a train or knowing 
how to handle an animal like that.

4982
03:32:36,050 --> 03:32:37,820
Like when,
when I fought a bear,

4983
03:32:38,120 --> 03:32:39,110
I saw the,
I reached out,

4984
03:32:39,111 --> 03:32:41,090
I found the video of it.
Come kill.

4985
03:32:41,091 --> 03:32:42,890
Don't kill this movie for me,
man.

4986
03:32:42,980 --> 03:32:44,900
No,
that's why I had the marshmallow church.

4987
03:32:45,200 --> 03:32:47,850
I've told you a story a million times.
No,

4988
03:32:48,190 --> 03:32:51,110
I'm not movie kill the Buffalo Guy 
Movie.

4989
03:32:51,200 --> 03:32:52,640
Oh yeah.
I'm pretty fucked up.

4990
03:32:54,230 --> 03:32:58,730
But like when you fight a bear or are 
you fighting a lion,

4991
03:32:59,380 --> 03:33:02,350
it really is uninteresting.
Yeah.

4992
03:33:02,940 --> 03:33:05,360
It's a lot of like interesting.
It's,

4993
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:07,040
it's scary for you.
And doing it.

4994
03:33:07,041 --> 03:33:09,170
But when you watch it on video,
it's a lot like,

4995
03:33:10,040 --> 03:33:10,873
it's a lot more dramatic for you in the 
moment than it looks because they're 

4996
03:33:14,451 --> 03:33:17,090
very fucking team.
So,

4997
03:33:17,091 --> 03:33:17,900
uh,
so yeah,

4998
03:33:17,900 --> 03:33:20,050
so if you want,
I told her on Ari's,

4999
03:33:20,150 --> 03:33:23,800
this is not happening story.
I fought a bear but it's,

5000
03:33:24,190 --> 03:33:24,830
it's,
yeah,

5001
03:33:24,830 --> 03:33:26,390
but it's,
it's literally like you feel like you're

5002
03:33:26,391 --> 03:33:28,100
getting lifted off the ground and shaken
by your head,

5003
03:33:28,310 --> 03:33:29,660
but they're just moving you around a 
little bit.

5004
03:33:29,661 --> 03:33:33,380
But they're so fucking powerful that 
literally to watch that.

5005
03:33:33,381 --> 03:33:36,620
I mean just in my own experience and I 
fought a lot of animals.

5006
03:33:37,390 --> 03:33:38,080
I,

5007
03:33:38,080 --> 03:33:41,070
I look at that and I just go,
how do you not have this in your act?

5008
03:33:41,071 --> 03:33:43,110
Like he fought a lot of animals cause 
man,

5009
03:33:43,111 --> 03:33:43,944
I'm trying to talk to him about my kids.
I go to this chunk of my kids are going 

5010
03:33:47,641 --> 03:33:48,830
to get rid of this,
got rid of them,

5011
03:33:48,831 --> 03:33:49,411

Shit.

5012
03:33:49,411 --> 03:33:53,610
And then I'm fucking April 1st at the 
Irvine Improv.
