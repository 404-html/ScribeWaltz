1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,160
Yeah,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,590
dude,

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,540
you're fucking Instagram things that
you're doing these Hong Dynasty things.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,160
What are you doing?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,660
That shit is hilarious.

6
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:18,560
You and Bobby Lee and
these 15 second clips,

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,760
I'm hooked.

8
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:22,730
I don't know what you're doing
but I'm laughing my dick off.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,733
Um,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,990
I mean first of all,

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,240
people always like to like it's publicly
known that I'm wealthy because of the

12
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:33,010
New York Times and all
this shit that came out,

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,850
the Facebook stuff.

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,510
So people always like whenever I
do anything to preface it with,

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:37,811
well,

16
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:40,810
if I was rich or if I had your
fuck you money or if you know,

17
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:42,850
and I go this shit.

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,270
Most of everything I do cost little or
nothing like the Han Dynasty is okay,

19
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,560
so Instagram comes out and what?

20
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:51,880
Vine is like seven seconds,

21
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:52,330
right?

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:52,961
I don't have vine,

23
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,100
but vine is seven seconds.

24
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,390
Instagram's 15 seconds.

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,520
We're old guys.

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,520
When I go hang out with my nephews and
stuff and they were like teenagers,

27
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,640
like they won't even watch
a one minute youtube clip.

28
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,120
It's like,

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,230
if it doesn't get their attention,

30
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:05,620
they're like,

31
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,220
or they'll just,

32
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,370
they'll watch it with the,

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,080
the bar.

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,070
Just fast forward,

35
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:09,601
fast forward and,

36
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,434
you know,

37
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,620
so I said,

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,390
let's just fuck around.

39
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,030
We filmed this thing on our iPhone and uh,

40
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,690
it's just,

41
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,110
you know,

42
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,740
Bob,

43
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,970
Bobby Lee's actually an actor or,

44
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,441
you know what,

45
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:21,274
before we get started,

46
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,931
let me just say,

47
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:27,931
I was on Joe show last time and it
ended with me saying it was a dumb idea,

48
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:29,524
but I was like,

49
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,390
I'm,

50
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,600
I'm extremely unhealthy.

51
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,291
I'm out of shape.

52
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,610
I had mercury poisoning,

53
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:34,480
high blood pressure,

54
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:35,141
high cholesterol,

55
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:35,974
all that shit.

56
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,660
I just got diabetes and I said,

57
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,280
I'm going to get diabetes or whatever.

58
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,040
I mean,

59
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,570
everyone's,

60
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,070
everyone's going to have it soon.

61
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,913
But,

62
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,810
uh,

63
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,171
I said,

64
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:44,780
I'm going to,

65
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,311
what did I say?

66
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:48,520
I was gonna spend a year to get trained
and I want to have like a UFC fight or

67
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,181
some shit like that.

68
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:52,510
And you were explaining to me how
Bellmont was Bobby Lee's brother,

69
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:53,344
Steve Lee,

70
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,640
who's 40 years old,

71
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,750
who's one of those guys.

72
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,470
He's,

73
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,010
he's like a thousand times funnier than
Bobby without trying like Bobby's like a

74
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,940
professional comedian.

75
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:01,774
Steve just,

76
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,520
he's just a funny and crazy guy.

77
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,350
He's one of the,

78
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,020
he's got a sort of Al
Bundy thing where he's 40,

79
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:10,900
and he talks about how he could have
been state champions just if you just did

80
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,190
this one arm bar or something.

81
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,460
And he works at or used
to work at this place,

82
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:16,500
fat cells in Hollywood,

83
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,280
part time as a sandwich guy.

84
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:22,090
And I hired him to be on
my show full time and,

85
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,100
and he started slacking.

86
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,540
It was what I thought would happen.

87
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,470
And I said,

88
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,303
all right,

89
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,050
you and me are going to go into this room
and we're going to Russell and you're

90
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,430
basically wrestling for your job.

91
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,320
You're,

92
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,320
you're doing wrestling and I'm doing
judo and I outweigh him by 60 pounds.

93
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,620
He's like a little tiny Asian guy,

94
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:41,910
right?

95
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,731
And I'm like,

96
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:42,941
yeah,

97
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:44,830
he used to do judo and um,

98
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,331
my friend was like,

99
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:46,571
dude,

100
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,170
don't underestimate him cause you know,

101
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:48,550
he,

102
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,170
he was almost state champ.

103
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:50,411
I'm like,

104
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,850
that was like over 20 years ago.

105
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:52,570
He's like,

106
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:52,871
but yeah,

107
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,220
those little wrestling guys,

108
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,040
you know,

109
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,810
um,

110
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,800
you can't fuck with them.

111
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,660
And then his brother was the referee,

112
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,580
so says Dave,

113
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,541
my brother,

114
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,170
you know,

115
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,090
he's like very relaxed and lazy about
things until you challenge his pussy or

116
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:07,924
money.

117
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,370
So Steve,

118
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,851
you know,

119
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,020
Steve's on the Han Dynasty.

120
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,770
He's like a fucking,

121
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:11,981
you know,

122
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:12,940
he's a crazy guy.

123
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,860
He's always good natured.

124
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,430
He's always funny when I told him like,

125
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,303
if you don't win this,

126
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,750
you're going back to fat cells.

127
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,210
And the job he has for me right now,

128
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,403
it's like,

129
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,981
they're like,

130
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,840
what do you need to hire Steve Leaf?

131
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,351
Or what did he do?

132
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,184
I'm like,

133
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,820
I literally send them all over the world
to fuck as many horses as possible.

134
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,781
Like that's his job.

135
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,620
That's his job right now.

136
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,090
Having sex with prostitutes.

137
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,330
Yeah.

138
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:34,870
I send him,

139
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,520

142
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,590
he's 53 years old.

143
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,110
I sent them to Macau there,

144
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:48,111

his normal job when he's not on my show

145
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,990
is he drives hookers around.

146
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,180
He's the number one whore
transporter in Los Angeles.

147
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,110
Um,

148
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,110
I think he put 290,000
miles on is a Prius.

149
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,711
And I said,

150
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:04,660
do the math and he has delivered
6,000 hookers to their John's.

151
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,221
Wow.

152
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:05,620
And I go,

153
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,570
that makes you the number
one hort transporter.

154
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,810
Maybe there's a guy out there that's just
fucking doing math and staying up all

155
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,920
night and just trying
to break that record.

156
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,450
Well he hasn't,

157
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:12,761
he hasn't,

158
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:14,110
he has his arch enemy and everything.

159
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,740
It's like a whole nother gap.

160
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:16,961
Yeah,

161
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:17,800
there's another guy.

162
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,090
Um,

163
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,690
but he's like,

164
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,523

165
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,521

166
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,354
The transporter.

167
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,230
He never tries to fuck the hookers.

168
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,050
He's serious about it.

169
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,490
He's got like baby wipes and condo.

170
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,200
He's like,

171
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,771
he's like,

172
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,150
he takes the job seriously.

173
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,400
He's not does any creepy shit.

174
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,660
So him,

175
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,190
him and Steve,

176
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,001
I go,

177
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,170
hey you guys,

178
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,471
you know,

179
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:45,910
everyone hears stories about like the
sec underground sex world in Macau and

180
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,210
this,

181
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,470
why don't you go and investigate?

182
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,370
And by investigating,

183
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,690
I mean fuck all of them.

184
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,570
And so I send them to Macau.

185
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,780
We record the whole thing that's
going to be called the Macau brothers.

186
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,350
And we're going to put that up on DVD,

187
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:58,120
AAC,

188
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,571
whatever.

189
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,230
But uh,

190
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,460
so go back to this wrestling match.

191
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:00,890
Okay.

192
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,723
So

193
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,900
w so mission thing or you,

194
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,010
whoever wins.

195
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,510
Well that's why I'm not a wrestler.

196
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,320
So Bobby's like Bobby used to wrestle too,

197
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:11,830
so he's like,

198
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,450
I'll be the referee and yeah,

199
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,110
whoever,

200
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,740
whoever gets the first person
down submit whatever they win,

201
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:18,130
you know,

202
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,040
but what is whatever
like is it to tap out?

203
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,930
Because if you get a Jujitsu guy down,

204
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,130
it doesn't mean Jack Shit.

205
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,371
Right.

206
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,630
That's when the game starts.

207
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:25,901
Right,

208
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:26,141
right,

209
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,321
right.

210
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:30,820
You know guys all about what
you call he pawn slam a guy.

211
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,860
Yeah.

212
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,100
It was just a,

213
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,220
I guess whoever gets someone in a
hold that they can't get out of her,

214
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,230
something undefined.

215
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,580
Undefined victories.

216
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:39,881
Yeah.

217
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,320
Cause there they're just
no punching or kicking.

218
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,154
It wasn't.

219
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,143
Yeah.

220
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,180
And so yeah,

221
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,390
him working for me is not like
sweeping the floor or whatever.

222
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,710
Him working for me is getting to
fuck really hot chicks to great gig.

223
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,041
Yeah.

224
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,020
So essentially his face
changes cause I'm like,

225
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,690
and I'm like,

226
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:57,950
ah,

227
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,070
I'm

228
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,180
probably still give him his job.

229
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,014
Even if,

230
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,071
and I go,

231
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,461
I'm just,

232
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,810
all I'm going to do is let them fuck.

233
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,703
He's like,

234
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,490
he's like,

235
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:04,731
you know,

236
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,430
half of my size,

237
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,263
I'm going to be size,

238
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,600
but like waste skinnier when I go,

239
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,260
I'll just let them fuck around and then
I'll just flatten them when they'll

240
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,481
just,

241
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:11,751
it'll be,

242
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,351
it'll look funny,

243
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:13,184
you know,

244
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,150
in less than a minute.

245
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:14,984
He took me off.

246
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,040
I go,

247
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,940
if you don't win right now,

248
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:17,421
you fucker,

249
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,254
you're losing your job.

250
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,040
His fee.

251
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,341
He goes,

252
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:19,731
red zone,

253
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:20,564
his face.

254
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,591
And I go,

255
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,421
Oh fuck dude,

256
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:23,254
this guy.

257
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,610
And then he comes at me and he's small,

258
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,700
but then he just like grabbed my arm
or something gets me down and I'm like,

259
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:28,881
oh,

260
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,570
whatever.

261
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,980
And then I can't get out of it.

262
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,820
And then he just puts all of his mind
into this hole and I'm just sitting there

263
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,690
and I can't get out of it.

264
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,523
And I'm like,

265
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,161
you know,

266
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,330
I'm also curious.

267
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,164
She's just like,

268
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,690
I've never seen you look more
like a pussy in your life.

269
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,390
And I was sitting there thinking,

270
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,021
fuck dude,

271
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,300
I remember I told Joe that
I was going to do this shit.

272
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:50,930
Like people have that glamorous idea
that they're going to go and have an MMA

273
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,650
fight.

274
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,380
I would never discourage anybody
from being an MMA fighter.

275
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,760
I think you live and you die
if you want to be a bull rider.

276
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,190
If you want to ride motocross,

277
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,410
if you want to drive Formula One,

278
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,244
race cars,

279
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,810
all those things are dangerous.

280
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,920
All those things are awesome.

281
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,731
You know,

282
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,391
live your life,

283
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:08,700
man.

284
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,490
I thought I did it.

285
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,353
I mean it's not,

286
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,991
I mean I,

287
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:14,600
I fought in taekwondo and I
kickbox it's fucking stupid.

288
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:14,931
It's tainted.

289
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:15,651
I did it for free.

290
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,850
There was no money involved in it.

291
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,480
I couldn't,

292
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,350
I had no insurance.

293
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,250
I had no health insurance.

294
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,980
So I would never tell someone
don't do anything dangerous,

295
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,030
but he can't.

296
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,040
I don't think you should dabble.

297
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,900
That's something like there's dudes that
are doing it that I know that are like

298
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,470
trying to make him the UFC or have
made it into the UFC that that's their

299
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,520
fucking whole life,

300
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,120
man.

301
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,170
They get up in the morning,

302
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,580
they're doing their
strength and conditioning.

303
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,121
They're running,

304
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:39,990
they're drinking wheat grass juice in.

305
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,810
They're fucking taken
all their amino acids.

306
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,880
Joe,

307
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,110
I'm not done babble.

308
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,990
I'm good.

309
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,430
They made UFC their life.

310
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,150
I'm gonna make,

311
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,430
I'm going to make a serious
commitment to my diabetes.

312
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,630
I'm going to make that my life.

313
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm going to eat doughnuts.

314
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm going to fucking do
you really have diabetes?

315
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,140
I just,

316
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,010
I was prediabetic for like the last four
years and I like just cross over the

317
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,250
line.

318
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,810
I just crossed over and he's like,

319
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,021
dude,

320
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:00,560
with,

321
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,850
with lots of the complete nutritional
diet change and lots of exercises,

322
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,070
like you can go back
to not having diabetes,

323
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,270
but whatever.

324
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,140
He would rather not.

325
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,330
You'd rather just take
insulin and just eat donuts.

326
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,841
I know.

327
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,470
It's horrible.

328
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,161
That's so bad.

329
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:13,850
Everyone's like,

330
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:13,971
well,

331
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,971
they say 50% of everyone that's being
born in America today will have diabetes.

332
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,810
Why don't you do this
and swore on the show,

333
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,000
okay,

334
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,250
you and I are talking and we're friends.

335
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,350
Why don't you hire someone?

336
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,910
So you got boatloads of cash.

337
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,300
Hire someone to concoct a diet for you to,

338
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:29,871
to feed.

339
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:30,560
You.

340
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,940
Hire someone that's a nutritionist that
is going to concoct like really healthy

341
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,620
meals all day long,

342
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:37,730
really low sugar,

343
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,250
and you'll hear that
shit within a few months.

344
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,760
I mean,

345
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,050
you just met him right now.

346
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,860
First of all,

347
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,420
credit credit's going to do it.

348
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,220
Well,

349
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,580
this is,

350
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,190
this is what happens when I made my money.

351
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,660
I naturally,

352
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:51,740
I just don't trust people.

353
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,650
So I made the room naturally
before or I just always,

354
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:55,484
I just don't trust people.

355
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,010
So I

356
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,110
just made the rookie mistake.

357
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,220
You've heard the expression before,

358
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,690
don't hire your friends and family.

359
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,210
And I hired all,

360
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,980
only my friends and family and I was like,

361
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,140
you know,

362
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,390
hey,

363
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,470
I don't know how to work a camera.

364
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,281
I don't care.

365
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,031
You're my cousin.

366
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:09,510
You have to,

367
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,110
you know,

368
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,110
I just wanted everyone around
me to be someone I trusted.

369
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,491
And,

370
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:14,850
uh,

371
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,683
it just,

372
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,480
you don't get the level of work that,

373
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:18,980
you know,

374
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,550
like I work every night till seven,

375
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,510
eight in the morning still.

376
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,081
I don't have to,

377
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:22,531
but I do,

378
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:23,220
you know,

379
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,480
and you know,

380
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,890
without even,

381
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,170
cause th there's always
in the back of their mind,

382
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:28,441
they're like,

383
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,460
Dave's not going to fire me.

384
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:29,930
Right?

385
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,700
Like he's my cousin or
he's my best friend,

386
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:32,534
like right.

387
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,930
And then I was just sitting there going,

388
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,010
how come I do have all this money and I
hired all these guys and I'm overpaying

389
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,670
the shit out of him.

390
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,800
And like I'm still at
the office by myself,

391
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:41,760
you know.

392
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,930
So I fired everyone.

393
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,990
I only hired people that are not
my friends and white and I said,

394
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:50,431
no more Asians.

395
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:52,770
I'm only on your hiring
white people and man,

396
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:53,940
that's crazy racist.

397
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,470
Very racist.

398
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,200
Shins are very hard workers as
long as you're not your family.

399
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,603
Um,

400
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,390
I dunno,

401
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:00,690
I just,

402
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,320
I just,

403
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,153
I just wanted to,

404
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,061
first of all,

405
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:03,241
yeah,

406
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,530
it's very racist and I was like,

407
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,210
okay,

408
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,050
because you want to,

409
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,350
I want to try something different.

410
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,700
I already wrote the yellow train
and we get on a white shirt.

411
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,610
And uh,

412
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,421
so I hired,

413
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,850
I hired people that are not
friends I'm friendly with,

414
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,930
but they're not my homeys.

415
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:16,650
And then,

416
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,250
and then there they were hired for
specifically what their job was like.

417
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:22,340
If you're a trainer then that's what I,

418
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,681
you know,

419
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,161
I'm not like,

420
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,431
Hey,

421
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,930
I know you're not a
trainer but just do it.

422
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,031
And,

423
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:26,280
uh,

424
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I found out with this next phase of the
experiment that I immediately like be

425
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:32,850
friended all of them.

426
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,390
Like now they're all my best friends and,

427
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,100
and even if I like critter,

428
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,270
you know,

429
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,601
I said,

430
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:40,434
listen,

431
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,550
I have diabetes.

432
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,510
I,

433
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,343
you know,

434
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,490
and he's also my body guard,

435
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:45,510
which everyone thinks is a joke,

436
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:45,930
which is,

437
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,190
which it is most of the time.

438
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,840
But you know,

439
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,160
weird shit happens once in a while.

440
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,611
And I said,

441
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,444
look,

442
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,460
I love eating.

443
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,870
I'm a friends with lots of shifts.

444
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,351
You know,

445
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:56,520
I go to a lot of restaurants,

446
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,253
you know I love,

447
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,960
I have a a piece of me that's like,

448
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,520
you remember just having no money and
going to a restaurant or a nice restaurant

449
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:09,240
for the first time and just like having
that snooty and I'm looking at Sushi

450
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,140

453
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,650
I didn't know cause I'd never been there.

454
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:14,484
And they're like,

455
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,320
that's market price sir.

456
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,213
And I'm like,

457
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,590
well how the fuck am I to,

458
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,561
okay,

459
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:20,790
so this a Toro,

460
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,751

461
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,051
And they're like,

462
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,380
it's the fattest part of the
tuna and it's $60 a piece.

463
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,760
You mean for the two pieces?

464
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,211
No,

465
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:27,301
no,

466
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:27,421
no.

467
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,260
For one piece.

468
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,220
And I'm like $120 for two
tiny fucking pieces of fish,

469
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:32,791
but you know,

470
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,451
I didn't have any money.

471
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:33,870
I'm like,

472
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,451
I'm not going to get there.

473
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:34,770
And they're like,

474
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:34,981
yeah,

475
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:35,671
if you have to ask,

476
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:36,660
then you can't afford it.

477
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,550
And so now I have the
money and I go in there.

478
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:38,731
Yeah,

479
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,410
motherfucker give me a hundred Toro.

480
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,311
What?

481
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:41,610
I'm like,

482
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,930
give me the whole fucking fish.

483
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:43,764
And then it's like,

484
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,640
oh two and it has the most
amount of mercury and you know,

485
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,200
the doctor checks my blood and he's like,

486
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,450
you have so much mercury
in your fucking blood,

487
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,720
you know exactly.

488
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,190
That really happened to you.

489
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,660
Yeah.

490
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,300
Like you were eating that much Sushi
that you well I thought I thought it was

491
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,440
healthy and you know the,

492
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,970
the oceans are polluted the
shit so polluted their full
full of like radioactive

493
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,410
waste and all this shit.

494
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,161
And I'm like,

495
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,731
yeah,

496
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:10,990
I'm not eating hamburgers
anymore in every meal costs $500.

497
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,170
I'm rich motherfucker.

498
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,530
And it's like moderation for everything.

499
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,980
Can't eat fish every day.

500
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,540
You know,

501
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,410
I was starting to get,

502
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,070
um,

503
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,903
was it?

504
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,780
God Damn it,

505
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,200
I forget the poisoning that
I was getting from sardines.

506
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:23,861
Yes.

507
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,720
Sardines have tons of our snack.

508
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,891
Yeah,

509
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:26,740
I was getting arsenic.

510
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,120
Sardines have tons of that shit.

511
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:29,200
It was a small amount.

512
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:29,920
It's a heavy metal,

513
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,753
you know,

514
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,930
they're eating at the bottom of the
ocean and he's just fucking garbage down.

515
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,320
And then once that shit
gets in your blood,

516
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,790
it takes forever to get out.

517
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,090
You know,

518
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,923
it didn't take long.

519
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:38,410
I,

520
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:38,681
I,

521
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:39,041
yeah,

522
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,990
I got rid of the arsenic in
the short amount of time.

523
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,460
I just stopped eating sardines.

524
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:42,910
Oh,

525
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,820
I was hitting him every day.

526
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,003
Wow.

527
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,550
Yeah.

528
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,383
White trash.

529
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,433
I like sardines.

530
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,880
Sardines.

531
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,410
Well I guess I don't
know about the arsenic,

532
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:51,280
but they said,

533
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,213
well I just,

534
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,000
because my hair started
falling out and I couldn't,

535
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,511
you know,

536
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm like,

537
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,340
I'm still relatively young,

538
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,880
but I just,

539
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,380
mercury was making your hair fall.

540
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,300
Well it said for mercury poisoning,

541
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,170
it's like memory loss and like,

542
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,641
it's like,

543
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,180
I,

544
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,690
I'm like,

545
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,000
I have the same memories.

546
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,290
My 70 year old father,

547
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,010
he's like,

548
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,400
well,

549
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,731
you know,

550
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:10,420
I'm like,

551
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,021
people will do the,

552
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:11,441
hey Dave,

553
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,340
you just told that story.

554
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,720
And I'm like,

555
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,200
really?

556
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,160
And I'm like fuck.

557
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,941
And it's like,

558
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,760
I know that like,

559
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,710
it's like when you know something
but you're feeling really dumb.

560
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,221
And I'm like,

561
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,054
why?

562
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,961
What's this blocking?

563
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,620
They're like,

564
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:23,831
dude,

565
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:25,930
your blood is like just full of it.

566
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,250
So wow.

567
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,390
So I told critter,

568
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:28,751
I said,

569
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:29,584
listen,

570
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,970
I need the kind of trainer
that physically abuses me.

571
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:34,781
Like,

572
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,310
you can put a finger in
my ass if you have to.

573
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:37,300
He has huge hands.

574
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,200
I said,

575
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,033
here's the key.

576
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,470
Here's the key to my
house and eat a salad.

577
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,333
Every single.

578
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,203
I told her,

579
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,690
I go,

580
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,150
I don't have that kind of
discipline because I don't drink,

581
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:46,901
I don't do drugs.

582
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,130
And so food is my vice,

583
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,110
especially since I don't gamble anymore.

584
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,680
And it's like I love to eat and
I love to eat late at night.

585
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,940
I like to have dinner number two,

586
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:55,810
dinner number three.

587
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,381
So I said,

588
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,400
here's the key to my house.

589
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,350
I'm every single day I'm going to come
up with some excuse to not work out.

590
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:02,711
Oh,

591
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:03,790
I got to fuck this girl.

592
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,790
Or I have a really important
meeting with Joe Rogan at,

593
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,633
or you know,

594
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,420
it's like,

595
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,140
I don't care.

596
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,480
You have permission to come into my house,

597
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,070
physically dragged me out of my bed,

598
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,190
punched me in my chest and get me to
work up because I'm not going to want to.

599
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,041
He's a big dude,

600
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:16,330
you know?

601
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:16,670
A big,

602
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,170
yeah.

603
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,411
Well,

604
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:18,041
he's also,

605
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:18,880
this is the best part.

606
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,981
Everyone's like,

607
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:21,791
you have a body guard.

608
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,690
You have that with a joke,

609
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:23,590
you have a body guard and I go,

610
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,460
yeah,

611
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,780
in the last year,

612
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,420
my,

613
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,570
my two major injuries or from him,

614
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,470
like he almost broke my neck and he broke
my ribs broken right now he broke my

615
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,500
rib like two weeks ago when he just,

616
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,650
I don't know what that
syndrome is like the,

617
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,770
when a parent loves their babies so much
that they shake it and the baby dies.

618
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,640
Like,

619
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,660
cause he has the weekends off.

620
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:44,494
So when I see him,

621
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,750
he sees me and he picks
me up and he always like,

622
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,300
hugs me.

623
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,640
Broke your ribs by shaking.

624
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,500
Well he hugged me and he was shaking
me and while he was shaking somewhere,

625
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,240
my friend David Chang tripped him.

626
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,930
Oh No.

627
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,160
But then he fell on top of me.

628
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,023
Oh Jesus.

629
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,711
And he's a big guy.

630
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:58,550
So I'm like,

631
00:14:58,551 --> 00:14:58,791
yeah,

632
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,210
my,

633
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,510
my body guard that I paid to protect me,

634
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,493
hurts me.

635
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,000
Broke your ribs and
almost broke your neck.

636
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,960
How many almost break your neck?

637
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,680
Just when he shakes me like
it's so violent that I'm like,

638
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,143
I'm like,

639
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,940
I feel like those students are all movies.

640
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,161
Like,

641
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:13,460
dude,

642
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,420
one jerk and like my next going
to snap and he did it and uh,

643
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,780
and I couldn't turn my head this way
for like two weeks and I was like,

644
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,973
like,

645
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,780
can can you like protect
me and not hurt me anymore?

646
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,663
You know,

647
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,600
I dunno,

648
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,433
whatever.

649
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,730
What you need is someone
who's a Dietitian,

650
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,010
someone is going to be that you
can hire like a professional chef.

651
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,990
Kevin James used to have
this guy who worked for him.

652
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:36,920
It was fantastic.

653
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,960
He had this guy working for him all day,

654
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,500
right?

655
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,160
The guy would cook all these meals
and he would leave pre prepared,

656
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,320
like really healthy meals
in his refrigerator.

657
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,150
Then he hired some woman
to do it after that.

658
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,661
All right.

659
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:48,980
So I did that for a little bit.

660
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,960
Like I've got this,

661
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:50,630
uh,

662
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,050
see,

663
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,801
this is what I'm talking about.

664
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:52,520
I,

665
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,690
I don't remember the name of the service,

666
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,100
but they deliver the meal every day.

667
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,943
There's a bunch of those.

668
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,220
Susan's healthy gourmet is
one that I used for awhile.

669
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,083
It's like,

670
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,451
yeah.

671
00:15:59,451 --> 00:15:59,961
And I'm like,

672
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:00,291
cool,

673
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:00,710
I'm being,

674
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,760
first of all was miserable.

675
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,430
The meal started to stack up in the,

676
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,750
in the refrigerator.

677
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,080
It's like,

678
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,410
oh,

679
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,980
like,

680
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,150
like inside I'd be like,

681
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,571
Oh cool,

682
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:09,270
I did it.

683
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,430
I'm on this program.

684
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,791
Right.

685
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,690
But then weren't really eating it,

686
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,210
but then I'd look at it or
I'd look or I'd eat it and go,

687
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:14,601
oh cool,

688
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:14,960
I,

689
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,860
I ate good today.

690
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,570
And then like at three in the morning,

691
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,130
still go out and get the Burrito.

692
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,450
And um,

693
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,460
so the thing I'm doing now,

694
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,590
which I already can see,

695
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,393
um,

696
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
it's horrible and everyone
says it doesn't work,

697
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,940
but now I'm sort of like stuck
in this weird thing is I,

698
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,680
it's like the whole I want,

699
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,753
I'm like,

700
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,491
no one's like,

701
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,480
diets aren't going to work.

702
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,030
Right,

703
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,230
right.

704
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,610
This has to be a lifestyle change,

705
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:43,760
right?

706
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,520
Like you can't like go for three
months eating salads and then be like,

707
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,180
Hey,

708
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,070
I got my weight down,

709
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,550
I got my cholesterol down,

710
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,660
I got my diabetes down.

711
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,810
And then going back to it,

712
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,090
it's like you have to have.

713
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,990
But I'm like,

714
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,010
but I love food.

715
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,093
I love eating.

716
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,980
And so the thing I'm doing now,

717
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,933
which I put,

718
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,090
didn't put too much research
into his chewing and spitting.

719
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,553
There's,

720
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,080
I know guys who did that with meat.

721
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,550
There's some MMA fighters.

722
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,270
Like Diego Sanchez was
doing that for awhile.

723
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,101
He wouldn't eat meat.

724
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:10,970
He would just chew it up.

725
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
It's horrible for your head.

726
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,891
It isn't really,

727
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:16,280
it's horrible for you because
first of all so you get like,

728
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:17,114
so I'll,

729
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,430
I'll order like three entrees,

730
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,230
I'll get spaghetti fried chicken,

731
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,920
steak,

732
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,701
I'll get pie,

733
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,780
I'll order everything.

734
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,980
It's just like Roman
Times gluttony to the Max.

735
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:28,814
Right.

736
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,570
And I'll have like the worst is if it's
at a nice restaurant cause then they

737
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:33,404
don't have the,

738
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,780
they have like cloth Napkins and I'm like,

739
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,310
can you bring some more
of those paper Napkins?

740
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,260
And I'm sitting there and I'm like are,

741
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,840
and I'm just chewing everything,

742
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,430
getting all the flavor out of it.

743
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,870
And then I'm spitting it,

744
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,430
which the mouth,

745
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,500
as soon as it starts
chewing and making saliva,

746
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,100
the stomach starts making acid

747
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,780
to prepare for the food coop to come down.

748
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,140
Right.

749
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,490
But if the food never comes down,

750
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,200
there's just like acid in your stomach,

751
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,270
you know?

752
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,600
And,

753
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,950
and also when you eat,

754
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,770
all the sugar already goes into your,

755
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,640
like before it hits your stomach,

756
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:03,020
you know?

757
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,853
Yeah.

758
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,520
So I'm eating all this food.

759
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,850
I like nice restaurants and chewing
it and spitting and Napkins and then,

760
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,040
and then putting it like on the plate
and then the dude's comes sooner.

761
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:13,620
Is there,

762
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,730
is there something wrong with the meal?

763
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:14,881
I'm like,

764
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:15,031
no,

765
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:15,180
no,

766
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,013
it's delicious.

767
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,130
It's fucking amazing.

768
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,450
And then you know,

769
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,420
you're looking for shortcuts,

770
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,710
bro.

771
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,730
I'm looking for shortcuts.

772
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,751
He can't do that.

773
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,520
Why don't you just hire a real trainer?

774
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,780
Not critter,

775
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,200
but hire someone who's like a real legit
strength and conditioning trainer who's

776
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,270
going to put you through some stuff.

777
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,980
If you really want to
do something that's fun,

778
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,000
you should or you're fired.

779
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,080
He should take a martial art.

780
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,951
Yeah,

781
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:35,401
I guess.

782
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,270
I mean you did judo.

783
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,340
I think I need a hot chick.

784
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,260
How would that work for the trainer?

785
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,170
Cause then I'll be motivated
and just Kinda wanna fucker.

786
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,400
Well that's then if you can't fuck her,

787
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:47,520
you want to bring other girls hotter
around to show her that you can fuck them.

788
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:47,701
Like,

789
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:48,570
listen bitch,

790
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,831
I could fuck them.

791
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:53,730
Why can't I fuck you and then it will
become some weird ego thing and Joe having

792
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:57,090
an eating disorder is the number one
thing to like bond with hot chicks because

793
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:57,924
they all have one.

794
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,071
I'm like,

795
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,930
should I go a anorexic or chewing
and spitting or really overly mia?

796
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:04,290
And they're like,

797
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,070
well I tried.

798
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,371
I'm like,

799
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:05,791
cool,

800
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,590
I'm blogging.

801
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,590
It's like all of a sudden like this
super boring dumb girl is like all like,

802
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,533
Oh yes,

803
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,310
but a lot of like cross fit chicks.

804
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,750
They don't have eating disorders.

805
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,860
If you get like a strength
and conditioning type cow,

806
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,810
you're right Joe.

807
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,980
I do have blood loads of money.

808
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:24,981
I got to figure out how not a shortcut
I just need to figure out to make not

809
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:25,801
cure cancer,

810
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:26,431
not cure aids.

811
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,560
Some kind of delicious food that
you can eat every day and it's you.

812
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,070
This is the thing.

813
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,630
The more you suffer,

814
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,250
the more you'll enjoy pleasure.

815
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,650
You are a glutton for pleasure,

816
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:39,350
my friend but you love but here,

817
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,320
check this out.

818
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,860
Technology.

819
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,340
So my,

820
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,990
my Japanese business partner,

821
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,100
I work with this company.

822
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:44,790
Good smile.

823
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,230
It's not legal in America yet,

824
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,040
but he has,

825
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,701
he smokes,

826
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,151
he drinks,

827
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:48,984
he eats all this shit.

828
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,060
I don't even know what
this process is called.

829
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:53,610
You might have heard of
it but he wants a month.

830
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,290
This is like real rich guy shit.

831
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,490
He gets all like a lot of his blood
taken out and then they do shit to it.

832
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,600
Like they make it into super blood and
then he puts it back into them and then

833
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,950
all everything goes down.

834
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:05,460
His,

835
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,030
his,

836
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,810
you know,

837
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,291
and I go,

838
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,124
what is that?

839
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,523
It's not,

840
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,860
it's not FDA,

841
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,600
whatever test it is not in America yet.

842
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,770
And so I do this thing called Regena
Kane and I have done today actually on my

843
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:19,170
shoulder had been bothering me.

844
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,280
They take,

845
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:25,281
they take your blood out and they spin
it in a centrifuge and apply heat to it.

846
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,290
And so your blood thinks like it
has a fever and it creates this anti

847
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,880
inflammatory response and creates this
like yellow serum on and they extract the

848
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:36,570
yellow serum out of your blood and then
they inject it directly in areas where

849
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:37,530
you have inflammation.

850
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,870
Oh really good for a injuries.

851
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,141
Right.

852
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,390
But it's also like when you
do it like I did it today,

853
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,201
energy,

854
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,220
you just feel great.

855
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,093
Like go gray right now.

856
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,520
Dana White told me about it cause
he has a inner ear infection,

857
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,020
uh,

858
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,970
an issue rather called [inaudible]
disease and it's from um,

859
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,210
he got beat up one time when he was
young but a bunch of guys and is,

860
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,440
he gets this tonight,

861
00:20:56,441 --> 00:21:00,250
it's like ringing in his ear and it fucks
with his balance and shit and it's all

862
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,084
inflammation.

863
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,030
Well they figured out
a way to inject this,

864
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,750
this,

865
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,290
this serum made out of your blood
and it totally cured it for him.

866
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,240
He went through surgeries,

867
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,550
he was on medication,

868
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,240
he did a bunch of shit that
really fucked with them.

869
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,980
But this stuff instead
of fucking with them,

870
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,830
it uses your own blood and
it made him feel fantastic.

871
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,860
And he used to have to go to Germany for
it and I was going to fly to Germany.

872
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:21,694
You go do this.

873
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,410
But then they started
opening these places around.

874
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,480
Now they have one lifespan
medicine in Santa Monica.

875
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:26,200
I did this morning.

876
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,220
Well this is what I'm talking about,

877
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:27,431
Joe.

878
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:28,030
It's like,

879
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,870
I get the whole like,

880
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,280
you need to suffer to like,

881
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,671
you know,

882
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:31,330
but,

883
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,680
but that's for injuries.

884
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,011
I know,

885
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:33,641
but it's like,

886
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:36,010
do you have any injuries you could
use as an excuse to get this?

887
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,520
I'm just saying like the
way technology's going now.

888
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,180
Like you're,

889
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,320
you're covered in tattoos,

890
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,771
but like,

891
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:42,101
you know,

892
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,680
in five years they're going to have
some ray that just gets rid of all your

893
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:45,011
clarity.

894
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:46,150
Do they have lasers?

895
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:46,610
I drag them out.

896
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,040
It's not good right now,

897
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,880
but what's painful?

898
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,070
But it will get in and
they'll make it so it's not,

899
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,400
you know,

900
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,450
they're going to have everything.

901
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:52,720
So,

902
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,290
you know,

903
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,100
so I'm like,

904
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,050
do I need to like really
switch my eating habits?

905
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,780
Are they gonna make like a,

906
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:58,690
you know,

907
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,940
some oculus rift fake
hamburger where I'm like,

908
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,691
oh yeah,

909
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:02,760
it's delicious and not,

910
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,071
you know,

911
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:03,580
I don't know.

912
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,780
This is my take on it.

913
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,190
I think gluttony and eating like
lots of delicious food is fun,

914
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,461
right?

915
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,560
But feeling like shit is not fun.

916
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,140
And what I like to do is have cheat days.

917
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,540
What I like to do is I really like,

918
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,890
this is what I've eaten today so far.

919
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,871
I had a,

920
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,560
a blended juice drink,

921
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,630
which was like celery,

922
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,860
ginger,

923
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,873
carrot,

924
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,980
a cucumber.

925
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:27,791
I'm trying to remember all the,

926
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,350
a Cayenne pepper,

927
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,440
Oregano oil,

928
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,000
lemon,

929
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,720
all this stuff.

930
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,800
Fantastic for you.

931
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:36,071
Right?

932
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,570
That's what I had for breakfast.

933
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,980
And the only thing I,

934
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,690
I it this morning is
today unshaved Pussy Lips,

935
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,770
slight hint of urinary tract
infection that's I have today.

936
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,820
And I feel great.

937
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,430
I don't know if you're going to feel
great and a couple of hours once the

938
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:52,780
fucking infection kicks in,

939
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:53,230
but,

940
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,520
but I got an iron stomach.

941
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:57,070
I gotta go to fucking
in and out Burger man.

942
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,851
I'll fuck ups.

943
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,440
I had Popeye's chicken last night,

944
00:22:59,441 --> 00:22:59,890
dude.

945
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,270
And so because you ate that,

946
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:02,770
that's why you gotta hit
this weird ginger drink.

947
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,470
I eat primarily healthy.

948
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:05,770
Right.

949
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,850
Primarily healthy.

950
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,150
Right.

951
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,710
But then occasionally I go off the rails.

952
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,010
Right.

953
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,010
But most of the time my
body's getting healthy food.

954
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,580
Right.

955
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,990
That's the key because you feel better,

956
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:14,480
man,

957
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,400
and you will feel better.

958
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:16,234
I feel great.

959
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,961
You'll feel better.

960
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:17,800
You'll have more energy.

961
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,160
I drink these blended Kale shakes
in the morning and making myself,

962
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,510
I throw Kale,

963
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:23,280
tastes like shit.

964
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,531
It's like,

965
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:24,270
Shit,

966
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,240
don't you use the spinach?

967
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,290
You can do that too,

968
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,250
but I like Kale.

969
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:27,760
Okay.

970
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,940
It's a superfood or spinach.

971
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,710
A superfood too.

972
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,543
They're all good,

973
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,970
but I failed to hit up kills
hip or and fucking strong.

974
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,350
It's,

975
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,530
he's got a lot of nutrients in it.

976
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:36,364
It's really good for you.

977
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:36,821
What's better?

978
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:37,654
Kale or spinach?

979
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,240
Probably with the,

980
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,020
probably Kale because
it's a little darker.

981
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:41,710
A little green.

982
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,543
That's the key.

983
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,800
Like dark green leafy vegetables.

984
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,100
They have fido nutrients

985
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,100
and all sorts of vitamins and stuff
and you'd get something out of them.

986
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,113
First of all,

987
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,111
when I eat,

988
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:51,410
I'm like,

989
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll have a bowl like this.

990
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:54,110
Hi.

991
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,321
Like,

992
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:54,431
I'm,

993
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:56,540
I'm pointing to my about 10 inches.

994
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,810
Like a big fucking salad bowl that
you would give to like a family.

995
00:23:59,811 --> 00:23:59,991
Like,

996
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:00,141
Oh,

997
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:02,360
here's our salad and everybody
would take a portion.

998
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,060
I blend that whole mother fucker up.

999
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,520
I drink that shit myself
with four cloves of garlic.

1000
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,530
I throw a whole apple in there.

1001
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,221
Ginger,

1002
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:11,790
I throw a chunk of ginger,

1003
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,321
like a,

1004
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,420
a thumb size chunk of ginger.

1005
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,190
It's just everybody
else who tastes it goes,

1006
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,630
what the fuck are you drinking?

1007
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,770
But Dude,

1008
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,170
I throw that shit down
and it's like rocket fuel.

1009
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,393
I feel great.

1010
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,520
I feel fucking fantastic.

1011
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:26,600
It's better than coffee.

1012
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,940
I have like a Tereso Bacon Burger.

1013
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,090
And then,

1014
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,610
and then,

1015
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,570
and then I take the top bun off and I go,

1016
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,111
yes,

1017
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:33,940
I'm doing good today.

1018
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,360
You got rid of that gluten and then
I feel supercharged to take a nap.

1019
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:38,931
And I'm like,

1020
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:39,690
yes,

1021
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,140
you,

1022
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,790
you know,

1023
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,990
I think you're enjoying your success
and you're enjoying your wealth and your

1024
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:45,950
joint pleasure.

1025
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,570
And that's a part of who you are.

1026
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,381
And it's also,

1027
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,890
I think one of the things about
artists is artists are very indulgent.

1028
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm putting that about my
comedian friends and you know,

1029
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,770
and yeah,

1030
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,140
you were very indulgent.

1031
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,360
Self destructive,

1032
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,420
your natural comedian,

1033
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,460
you are a natural standup comedian.

1034
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,061
You,

1035
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,500
you did a thing at,

1036
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,460
was it at Ucla?

1037
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,990
You did a thing at Ucla that you
put on that video that was up there.

1038
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,650
A bunch people,

1039
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,010
dude,

1040
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,820
that was like a guy who have been doing
standup for years and you had only done

1041
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,560
it like how many times when you
did that was the first time.

1042
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:16,120
And there's time.

1043
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,240
That's shit's ridiculous.

1044
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:17,561
Dude.

1045
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:18,200
Should I plug that?

1046
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,890
Fuck yeah.

1047
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,221
All right.

1048
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:20,570
So I'm gonna put it on my Twitter.

1049
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:21,081
It's on Twitter.

1050
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:21,914
If you can find it.

1051
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,550
My,

1052
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:22,881
my,

1053
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:23,714
uh,

1054
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,360
my problem with the Internet is I,

1055
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,980
I always think it's like the
wild west when it's actually not,

1056
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:30,600
so almost everything I
put up on youtube or,

1057
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,480
or a Vimeo gets flagged.

1058
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,870
I just put up a new episode of
my show DVDs and they got flag.

1059
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,400
So it gets flagged for what?

1060
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,090
Just there's nakedness,

1061
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,580
nakedness or whatever.

1062
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:40,911
I mean,

1063
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:41,630
I think in the,

1064
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,770
so you took a,

1065
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,810
you change your DVD asa page.

1066
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,291
Yeah.

1067
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:45,710
It's like,

1068
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,670
it's like Wikipedia now,

1069
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,300
dude.

1070
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,580
It's that anybody can go
on there and change it.

1071
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,240
Now they could say Dave's a
fag or whatever and it'll,

1072
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:52,950
you know,

1073
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,000
I can't believe I just said,

1074
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,890
good luck.

1075
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,360
They're going to do that now you did.

1076
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,650
You made a Wikipedia out of it.

1077
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,633
We used to do that.

1078
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,980
We used their technology
and we just was like,

1079
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,550
if some,

1080
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,240
it's like it's,

1081
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,380
it's your website now.

1082
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,463
How would you do that?

1083
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,140
Cause who cares?

1084
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,980
You're going to care once your
website is all black dicks.

1085
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,300
I know that's what's going to happen.

1086
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,860
So whatever threat level,

1087
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:16,980
I love the current threat level vitamin
PISS yellow as the current threat level,

1088
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:19,970
so everything on that website
right now it's the fans did it.

1089
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,640
Oh that's great.

1090
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,473
Yeah.

1091
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,281
I'm like,

1092
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:22,611
fuck it.

1093
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:24,020
I'm not even going to
maintain my own website.

1094
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:26,960
Like you had a thing
where you got offline.

1095
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,290
Yeah.

1096
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:27,511
You,

1097
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:27,710
you,

1098
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,880
you took down your,

1099
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,550
your podcast and you put up this fucking,

1100
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,300
this clan.

1101
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,601
I had to,

1102
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:34,730
I had a text you about it
immediately once I read it,

1103
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,960
because I was alone.

1104
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,040
It was like two o'clock in the morning.

1105
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:41,750
I'm in my house and I'm howling laughing
cause you're talking about racism,

1106
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,620
but you said something
to this totally true,

1107
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:43,890
right?

1108
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:43,980
You're

1109
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,870
like everyone's afraid of the yellow man,

1110
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,370
like black men get to fuck.

1111
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,430
But how come Jackie Chan never got the
finger bang or fuck in in rush hour one,

1112
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:53,941
two or three?

1113
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:54,301
And I'm like,

1114
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:57,420
it's true Jackie can't
Chan like he's safe.

1115
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,450
It's,

1116
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:58,750
it's,

1117
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,550
it's amazing.

1118
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,460
It's um,

1119
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,260
I'm in bed fucking this white girl and
I had my phone like mixed to her head

1120
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:07,440
like this and it's a text comes in
and this is Joe just saying like,

1121
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,530
ha ha ha.

1122
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,421
He's like,

1123
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,840
he's like writing my a press
release back to me and it's look,

1124
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,760
wait,

1125
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,180
first of all,

1126
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,801
one quote,

1127
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,320
you go,

1128
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,640
oh so fucking funny.

1129
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,840
I look,

1130
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,183
I'm just,

1131
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,970
I didn't know these kinds of facts but
like do you know how many Asians are in

1132
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:24,590
America?

1133
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,820
Like I'm talking about Jungle Asians,

1134
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:27,900
like Japanese,

1135
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:28,381
Korean,

1136
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,101
Filipino,

1137
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:30,760
like all of the agents combined.

1138
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:31,594
Do you know how much,

1139
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,120
how many of them there are in America?

1140
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,030
Know what's taken tick.

1141
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,260
Tick a guess 20 million
or or percentage wise?

1142
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,561
Oh,

1143
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:38,071
percentage.

1144
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:38,790
Yeah.

1145
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,140
20 million would be what?

1146
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Less than 10% 8% it's 4%
4% it's 4% so it's like

1147
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,173
I just like,

1148
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:48,990
you know,

1149
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,560
I like doing,

1150
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,820
I just like doing shit and you know,

1151
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:51,920
and then people always,

1152
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,853
they need to be like,

1153
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,101
oh,

1154
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:55,980
check out this Asian comedian or
check out this Asian artists for.

1155
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,401
And I'm like,

1156
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:57,770
why can't I just be an artist?

1157
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,710
What can I just be an artist?

1158
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,880
Why do I always have to be like,

1159
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,490
you know,

1160
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,830
like a mugged by a black guy.

1161
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,281
Right,

1162
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:02,860
exactly.

1163
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,110
Never.

1164
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,300
I dude,

1165
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,120
this dude fucking mugged me man.

1166
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,550
If you say you got mugged by
a dude that was a white guy.

1167
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,360
Right.

1168
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,870
You know,

1169
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,580
if I got fucking mugged by this dude.

1170
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,430
Yeah.

1171
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,350
And you know,

1172
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:14,140
also Cura,

1173
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,910
she's on my shoulder.

1174
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,780
The first time I met her was
seven or eight years ago.

1175
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,880
And so this is still in the year,

1176
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,360
you know,

1177
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,360
it was like 2005 2006 and it was on the
set of the first Asian American Porno in

1178
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:28,081
America.

1179
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:28,914
And I was like,

1180
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,461
I don't,

1181
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:30,090
the first one,

1182
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,361
I was like,

1183
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,440
I don't even know what that means.

1184
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,461
And I'm like,

1185
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,510
there's Asian chicks and porn.

1186
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,381
And it was like,

1187
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,190
no,

1188
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,560
the first porno in America where they're,

1189
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:40,394
they're all Asian.

1190
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,670
And I'm like,

1191
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:42,480
what the male pro?

1192
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,751
I'm like,

1193
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:42,901
yeah,

1194
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:43,650
that exists.

1195
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:43,951
And they're like,

1196
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:44,131
no,

1197
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:44,964
it doesn't,

1198
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,271
the goal,

1199
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:49,710
the only place in porn where you see
an Asian guy is gay porn and he's the

1200
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:50,490
bottom.

1201
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,530
So he's literally getting
fucked in his ass.

1202
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,360
And that's the only place you see them.

1203
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,950
So what about Japanese porn?

1204
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,560
No,

1205
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,540
but that's in Japan,

1206
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,610
I'm saying in America and I'm like,

1207
00:28:59,611 --> 00:28:59,940
wow,

1208
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,930
2005,

1209
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,291
whatever.

1210
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,580
And that still doesn't exist yet.

1211
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,940
And so I go on the set and then
the guy that's the performers,

1212
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,810
Filipino and I'm like,

1213
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:07,644
that doesn't even count,

1214
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,660
you know,

1215
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,420
Asian?

1216
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,650
No,

1217
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,321
they count them.

1218
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:10,860
Just joking.

1219
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,220
Um,

1220
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,510
but so I go,

1221
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:12,721
wow,

1222
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:13,261
that's weird.

1223
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:14,094
And then,

1224
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,910
and then I just,

1225
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,181
you know,

1226
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,680
the Shit I talk about on my show,

1227
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:17,491
the Shit I just do.

1228
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,324
And then I just,

1229
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,880
it's like if you talked about,

1230
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:20,521
it would be fine.

1231
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,680
If a black guy talks about it,

1232
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,523
but it's just,

1233
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,910
it brings out like this,

1234
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,440
these people and they just,

1235
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,260
they're so offended by it and I go,

1236
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,400
what?

1237
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,641
You know,

1238
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:29,821
and I,

1239
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:34,140
and I know in the script for Romeo must
die gently kisses aliyah at the end,

1240
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:35,190
but they changed it to,

1241
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,540
they just danced together.

1242
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,130
And you know,

1243
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,250
Jackie Chan is the star of rush
hour of fucking dollar franchise.

1244
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,600
Why doesn't he get the
fuck or Finger Bang in?

1245
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,611
Why not?

1246
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:45,970
Like,

1247
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:46,803
okay fine,

1248
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,250
he didn't get to do it in one,

1249
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,470
maybe in two he gets to fuck all right.

1250
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:51,040
Will,

1251
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,311
you know,

1252
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,144
it's like,

1253
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,631
why,

1254
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:53,464
why can't,

1255
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,210
why can't they be sexual?

1256
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:55,950
You know,

1257
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,570
and I don't know the answer to that.

1258
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,070
The male,

1259
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:05,070
the male Asian with the white woman is
such a rare combination in movies and in

1260
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:06,724
television.

1261
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,760
It's so fucking rare that when they're
doing it almost feels like they're doing

1262
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:10,594
it on purpose.

1263
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,260
Right.

1264
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,800
And it's like,

1265
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,130
but you know,

1266
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,480
cause there was once that have with
the black guys are like black guys,

1267
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:16,971
you know,

1268
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:18,880
if I see you as white women
were going to kill you.

1269
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,560
But now it's like John was fever.

1270
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,390
Yeah.

1271
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,223
Yeah.

1272
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,220
So it's a disease.

1273
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,630
I know my,

1274
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,580
my best guest on it is when,

1275
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,130
and this is just my guess,

1276
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,620
is when,

1277
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:31,891
when,

1278
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:33,070
when I hear people go,

1279
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:33,671
Oh man,

1280
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:34,930
there's fucking Asians are like,

1281
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,370
they're taking over all this best spots
at all the best universities and they're

1282
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,100
owning all the real estate and
China's taken over the world.

1283
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,350
It's like they're taking everything.

1284
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,420
They can't take our white
pussy on top of that,

1285
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:46,691
you know?

1286
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:47,770
So I dunno.

1287
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,521
I Dunno what it is,

1288
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,110
but I just know like when I do shit,

1289
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:52,570
like I get a lot more slack for it then,

1290
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,360
but whatever,

1291
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,650
I don't,

1292
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,483
I don't give a shit.

1293
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,740
Well,

1294
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,490
the point that you were making,

1295
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:57,761
I mean,

1296
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:58,870
I know you were just being funny,

1297
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,370
but the point you were making,

1298
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,390
it's true.

1299
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:01,840
I mean,

1300
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,260
you don't see Asian guys get
laid in movies and if they do,

1301
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,490
it's with an Asian girl.

1302
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,091
I mean,

1303
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:08,290
I'm sure there's examples.

1304
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:11,680
There's one Steven Yeun from walking dead.

1305
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,370
That was,

1306
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:13,870
that's true.

1307
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,501
That's the only one.

1308
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:15,410
That's a perfect example,

1309
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,800
mags.

1310
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,190
Pretty God.

1311
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,023
Damn,

1312
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,860
that's a good one.

1313
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,461
That's a good one.

1314
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:18,661
That was,

1315
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:19,750
I high five them for that.

1316
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,560
That's a victory for the Asian and
he stayed alive for many seasons.

1317
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,310
Yeah.

1318
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,150
So he's doing it.

1319
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,081
Wait,

1320
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:28,720
can I just plug the thing
really quick is the thing,

1321
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,111

1322
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:29,500

1323
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,470

1324
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:30,791

Dot.

1326
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,660
Emmy.

1327
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,820
Cause like I've been looking
forever cause everyone's like,

1328
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:36,010
why don't you just have your
own platform or whatever.

1329
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:36,281
And I'm like,

1330
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:37,450
I don't want to spend time doing that.

1331
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,100
So it's hire somebody.

1332
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,890
Well I mean it just like
when you do it yourself,

1333
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:42,400
it always cry.

1334
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,800
I don't know.

1335
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,633
I don't want to,

1336
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,640
for me to have less employees,

1337
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,900
it's not even the money thing.

1338
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,111
Right?

1339
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:48,490
Like I don't want to become a manager,

1340
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:48,800
you know?

1341
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,390
Right.

1342
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:49,841
So this,

1343
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:50,320
these,

1344
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,090
these kids had started this thing vid me,

1345
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,900
which is like my answer to youtube or
whatever and I could put anything up

1346
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:56,051
there.

1347
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:57,490
So I put my comedy special.

1348
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,030
So if you go to vid.me and then
put in DVD or subscripted DVD,

1349
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,100
I say you have my comedy special,

1350
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:05,110
which is the first time
I did comedy at Ucla,

1351
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,990
which is inner cut with like machine
guns and girl's butt holes and like Lisa

1352
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:10,360
stuff,

1353
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,170
me slapping and cigarettes out of smoking
vaginas and there was a lot of stuff,

1354
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:14,501
stuff,

1355
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,450
stuff that you can't put anywhere.

1356
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,640
Stuff like here.

1357
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,590
Can I give you a great example of like,

1358
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,360
well first of all talk about Instagram.

1359
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,540
I went on years and like someone found
their high school drawing art like Oh

1360
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,010
yeah,

1361
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,730
I mean you,

1362
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:32,730
you have the frenetic energy of like you
got like that Bernie Wrightson and like

1363
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,780
you have like you got all the,

1364
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,943
you were like good.

1365
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,821
I was pretty good.

1366
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,061
Yeah,

1367
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:40,160
you were pretty good and yet all
you like went crazy with the detail.

1368
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,020
Whenever I see a young guy with like
lots of detailed like that motherfuckers,

1369
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,000
a lot of energy that's
usually from like ray,

1370
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,440
especially in the subject matter,

1371
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,540
like the rage growing every fucking
hair on the Werewolf's face whenever the

1372
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:57,110
teeth with the glistening with
the fucking blood and whatever.

1373
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,180
Lots of obsessed with comic book art.

1374
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,840
Yeah,

1375
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,311
I mean it's,

1376
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:00,771
it's great.

1377
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,100
I mean,

1378
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,510
I think from what I saw,

1379
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,050
yeah.

1380
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,760
From what I saw.

1381
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,000
And how old were you when you do that?

1382
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,770
Somewhere in high school?

1383
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,930
Probably 15 or 16 that's what I'm saying.

1384
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:10,100
Like you stopped at some point,

1385
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:10,370
right?

1386
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,410
I had an asshole fucking art teacher,

1387
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:12,980
man.

1388
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,813
He wasn't looked.

1389
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,570
I don't,

1390
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:14,870
I don't,

1391
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,490
I feel bad for the dude because he was,

1392
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:18,350
it was clearly a Dork.

1393
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:18,680
Right.

1394
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,100
You know,

1395
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,431
and,

1396
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,510
but he,

1397
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,553
that's great.

1398
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,480
He had this way of talking about shit
where he just killed all your dreams.

1399
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,870
I taught like I would draw all like Conan
the barbarian and Ninjas and that's an

1400
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:36,610
werewolves and I would draw shit that I
would like to teach bullshit teenage boy

1401
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:36,950
shit.

1402
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,450
Yeah,

1403
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:37,770
I would do,

1404
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,640
I did a whole series.

1405
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,411
I love that.

1406
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:40,191
That's a little red riding.

1407
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:41,500
I did a whole series of,

1408
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:41,960
uh,

1409
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,540
like little kid stories that went wrong.

1410
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,840
The three little pigs is a werewolf.

1411
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,260
Fucking just attacks the pigs.

1412
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,670
I had Humpty Dumpty,

1413
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:50,361
I pulled that one up.

1414
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:50,751
Eventually.

1415
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:51,860
Humpty dumpty with the ax.

1416
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,753
You're an artist.

1417
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,780
You're an artist.

1418
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,051
Yeah.

1419
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:55,850
Well I certainly was.

1420
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,790
That's what I was going to do for
a living until I started fighting.

1421
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,480
And then when I started fighting I became
completely obsessed with that cause it

1422
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,480
was so primal and so much different
than anything else I'd ever done.

1423
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,020
This is,

1424
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,820
see we have the same story up until then,

1425
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,990
or even up until then,

1426
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,600
because in high school
I drew like that too,

1427
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,910
like crazy detail or whatever.

1428
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,070
And then I started fighting
too and I loved it and I,

1429
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,510
and then I started fighting all the time,

1430
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,810
except I never won 90% of the fights.

1431
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:21,350
I get my ass.

1432
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,183
I still love it.

1433
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,611
I'd be like,

1434
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:22,791
yeah,

1435
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:23,720
let's fuck these dudes up.

1436
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,120
You mean like fighting like on the street?

1437
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,160
You know,

1438
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,920
I had a lot of anger.

1439
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,760
I didn't do that.

1440
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,001
Oh,

1441
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:29,650
you mean fighting?

1442
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,130
Yeah,

1443
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:30,500
I don't,

1444
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,560
you had like one fight in high school
and it wasn't really much of a fight.

1445
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,221
Well,

1446
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:36,500
one other time where a
d this is the best one.

1447
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,311
Um,

1448
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:37,970
was uh,

1449
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,030
the most important one for me.

1450
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:40,010
It was this dude,

1451
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,200
we wouldn't even like fighting.

1452
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,520
It's like he was this kid,

1453
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:44,570
like they bust these,

1454
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:45,170
uh,

1455
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,000
these black kids and
from bad neighborhoods,

1456
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,140
Newton south high.

1457
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,840
And there was this one kid and me and him,

1458
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,270
we still look at each other
like in the hallway and like,

1459
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:53,780
you know,

1460
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,780
he would stare at me and I would stare
him that nothing really happened.

1461
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,490
But then one day we were in the locker
room together and I was passing him.

1462
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,100
He looked at me and uh,

1463
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,440
I don't remember what was said,

1464
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:07,010
but I remember the dude grabbed me
and hip toss me down to the ground,

1465
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,970
throw me on my back and held me down
and he was thinking about punching me.

1466
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,920
He was like holding me,

1467
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,753
my like,

1468
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,990
and just held me and then let me up.

1469
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:16,250
I was totally humiliated,

1470
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,151
totally humiliated.

1471
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,620
He said the n word with the Er?

1472
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,310
No,

1473
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:19,521
no,

1474
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:19,731
no,

1475
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:19,941
no,

1476
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:20,121
no.

1477
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,670
I didn't see anything of Kimmy.

1478
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,390
I think I said like
what the fuck you know,

1479
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,260
or something like when he was home,

1480
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,213
but I realized,

1481
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:25,950
shit,

1482
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,870
I don't know how to wrestle.

1483
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:28,550
I think I was probably 14 I was like,

1484
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:29,041
God damn it.

1485
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:29,360
I don't know.

1486
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,200
I need to learn how to read.

1487
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,290
This is humiliating feeling you like I,

1488
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,010
I don't want to ever feel
that it was terrible.

1489
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,470
I had never had taken like a
couple of karate classes then,

1490
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,010
but

1491
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,210
know grappling whatsoever.

1492
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,451
Right.

1493
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:43,440
So at the same time I joined the wrestling
team and I started getting really

1494
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,300
serious about taekwondo
at the very same time.

1495
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,410
It was because of that dude.

1496
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,820
Like I owe him.

1497
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,270
He,

1498
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,630
he made me who I became like for real
because he humiliated the shit out of me.

1499
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,733
You know,

1500
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,360
like that changed your
course down that path.

1501
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:58,460
But if that never happened
and you stuck with the art,

1502
00:35:58,461 --> 00:35:59,294
I mean that looks,

1503
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,810
I mean that looks pretty good.

1504
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,081
Well,

1505
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:02,040
I enjoyed art.

1506
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,701
I still do.

1507
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:03,331
I still draw.

1508
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:03,661
I was draw,

1509
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:03,871
draw,

1510
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,640
draw like that.

1511
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:04,860
Yeah.

1512
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,730
I could still do it like that.

1513
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,340
I mean do electronic
crosshatching and all that stuff.

1514
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:08,580
Yeah.

1515
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,450
I love cross hatching.

1516
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:09,780
Yeah.

1517
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,380
I love,

1518
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,190
I love deep.

1519
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,510
I like to do um,

1520
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,900
like pencil and then
ballpoint pen over the pencil.

1521
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,100
That's like my favorite style of,

1522
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:19,440
I have some other stuff that I'll put up
that I did like that I want to check it

1523
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:19,640
out.

1524
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,880
Cause like technical pens,

1525
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,610
I always found to be like
a little too permanent.

1526
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,870
Like I like seeing,

1527
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,470
like though I feel like with a ballpoint
pen you could sorta almost barely touch

1528
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,530
the paper and the image just
starts to slowly come out.

1529
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,710
Do this with your kids.

1530
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,950
Ballpoint pen drawn bananas.

1531
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,000
Like that sensation of a ballpoint pen
on a banana is like the best thing.

1532
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,320
And then like the next day when the,

1533
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,183
the,

1534
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,300
the banana peel dries up,

1535
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,260
the drawing looks different.

1536
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:45,190
My kids love art.

1537
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:45,790
Yeah.

1538
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,630
It's a fun thing.

1539
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,780
But my progression was,

1540
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,640
was the same thing.

1541
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,900
Everything in high school was
this shit like crosshatching pen,

1542
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,033
pencil,

1543
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,480
prisma colors.

1544
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,441
And then,

1545
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:57,100
um,

1546
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,401
you know,

1547
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:58,570
I discovered spray paint,

1548
00:36:58,571 --> 00:36:59,830
which was like the fucking,

1549
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,780
like the best thing ever.

1550
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:02,050
It's like,

1551
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,591
oh my God,

1552
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,610
I discovered the Matrix,

1553
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:04,240
you know,

1554
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,721
and then,

1555
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:05,554
um,

1556
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,101
uh,

1557
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,960
acrylic and oil paint.

1558
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,370
But what I discovered now after
painting and drawing for years is that

1559
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,130
all those things I just said,

1560
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:16,120
spray paint oil,

1561
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:19,090
acrylic is you just even pencils.

1562
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:20,440
Like you draw something,

1563
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,630
you create something and
if you don't like it,

1564
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:23,321
you just paint over it,

1565
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,154
you just erase it.

1566
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:24,941
And then,

1567
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:25,660
uh,

1568
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,070
the new thing that like,

1569
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,993
I just,

1570
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,583
this is like,

1571
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,240
like alchemy or like painting with,

1572
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,830
with magic is the watercolor.

1573
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,933
It's like,

1574
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,010
it's like the medium in art that has like,

1575
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:36,530
I,

1576
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,490
I'd probably say like the least
amount of respect because it's like,

1577
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:39,671
oh,

1578
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:40,151
watercolor,

1579
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:41,350
you think of like old ladies,

1580
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:41,861
you know,

1581
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:42,940
on some ways that,

1582
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,720
I dunno,

1583
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,160
but like this whole book that
I did is all watercolors.

1584
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:49,000
It's like 300 pages of watercolors.

1585
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:49,750
And I'm like,

1586
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,583
you know,

1587
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,020
I'm a pretty well respected artists now.

1588
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,880
Like I should be able to
get this thing published.

1589
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,550
I shouldn't have to like self publish
it and I don't want to self publish it.

1590
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:58,780
That's like in the same way,

1591
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:00,700
like I don't want to put up my own,

1592
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:01,534
uh,

1593
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,820
what do you call like of um,

1594
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,173
um,

1595
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,280
I don't want to start my
own youtube or whatever.

1596
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,630
Like I just would rather to do the art
and have like a respected publication,

1597
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,503
put it out.

1598
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,900
So I turned the book in and start this
book bidding war with all the published,

1599
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,020
all the cool artsy publishers
don't want to put it out.

1600
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:17,801
And I'm like,

1601
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:18,634
Dave,

1602
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,860
you got to take these four pages out.

1603
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:21,041
You know,

1604
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,110
our legal team looked at it and you know,

1605
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,370
I guess there's obscenity laws.

1606
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,980
Like you can't put an ar
15 in a girl's butthole.

1607
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,983
And I go,

1608
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,033
but I thought,

1609
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,390
you know,

1610
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,130
it's hard.

1611
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:32,290
Well,

1612
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:32,711
it's art.

1613
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:33,730
And I thought like,

1614
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,660
we lived in America,

1615
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:35,440
I thought you do whatever,

1616
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,110
you know,

1617
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,690
and I keep,

1618
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,310
I don't know,

1619
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,990
I guess I keep pushing things and
finding out that you can't do them,

1620
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,853
but you can,

1621
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,311
you can,

1622
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:44,410
you just can't do it in their forum.

1623
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:44,711
Right.

1624
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:45,340
That's all it is.

1625
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,173
And I go,

1626
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,261
what's the problem?

1627
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:47,650
They're like,

1628
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,640
we might get sued.

1629
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:48,940
I go,

1630
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,870
well by who?

1631
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:50,890
I don't know.

1632
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,460
It's always like this preemptive
like this imaginary fear and I go,

1633
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,750
we need people like you out there.

1634
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,660
I go look like,

1635
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,020
and I was excited cause I was like,

1636
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,000
oh these are like the
publishers that I like,

1637
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,260
I would love to work with you.

1638
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,310
And I go,

1639
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,510
oh so I,

1640
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,030
you know,

1641
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:10,030
I put the book out myself and it's like
we sold it out like the special edition

1642
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:11,074
right away.

1643
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,870
If you want to get it to
that David show.com but it's,

1644
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,410
we made so much money on it,

1645
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:18,190
on the,

1646
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,600
I don't want to say
this like I'm bragging,

1647
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:21,370
but it's like I didn't even
want to make that money.

1648
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,700
Right?

1649
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,230
Like I would rather someone
else to make that money.

1650
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:24,260
I just wanted to put it out.

1651
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,320
But it's like they wouldn't do it.

1652
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:27,190
So you had to do it yourself.

1653
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,520
And that,

1654
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,540
that's sort of,

1655
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,970
I bring that up because I'd rather just,

1656
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,820
it's so easy to just do a video
on and throw it up on Youtube.

1657
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:34,511
That's so easy.

1658
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:36,460
I don't want to fucking find,

1659
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:36,761
you know,

1660
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:39,040
it's like I just want to make
shit and just put it out there,

1661
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,380
but everything I do gets taken down.

1662
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,970
So I just gotta you know,

1663
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,320
it's just you are,

1664
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:46,390
you are an unusual guy and an unusual,

1665
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,720
an unusual situation and
you want it to be free.

1666
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,340
You want to be free to express yourself.

1667
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,001
And you know,

1668
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,030
someone could say like,

1669
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,190
Oh fuck him and he's this and he's
that and he's arrogant and he's this.

1670
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,921
But no,

1671
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:57,161
you're,

1672
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:57,581
you,

1673
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:58,391
you're being free.

1674
00:39:58,391 --> 00:39:59,470
You're not worried.

1675
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,000
You're not being a fake.

1676
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,130
You are actually doing things
that you're interested in.

1677
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,170
And in a lot of ways this isn't,

1678
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:09,490
we is a real problem that we have in
society with needing someone to publish

1679
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,270
your stuff.

1680
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,730
Because if you need someone to publish
your stuffed and they're going to have to

1681
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:15,880
approve it and then you're not going to
get the original vision of the artist or

1682
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:16,870
the writer or whatever,

1683
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,080
you're going to get a bunch of other
people's in pink opinions of what you

1684
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:22,330
should broadcast when you should publish.

1685
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,691
Well look,

1686
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:25,230
can I ask you this because you are like,

1687
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,160
since I first did your show,

1688
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,290
I think the first time
I ever did you show,

1689
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,430
I'd never been on TV.

1690
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,360
And since I've been on,

1691
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,751
I mean you,

1692
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:32,110
you,

1693
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,970
you have like a long career in TV,

1694
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:35,590
you fear factor or the UFC stuff.

1695
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,980
And so I've been on TV twice now.

1696
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,930
I did Anthony Bourdain shows,

1697
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,490
parts unknown and I did,

1698
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:42,940
um,

1699
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,140
I do the news for Hbo,

1700
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:49,010
for Vice Hbo and both shows that
I've been on one Emmy's and like,

1701
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,640
it's like everything I do doesn't
have to be guns in buttholes.

1702
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:54,781
Right.

1703
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:55,000
You know,

1704
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,830
I can work,

1705
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,663
they can do with it.

1706
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,461
They're like,

1707
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:57,761
Hey,

1708
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:59,410
do do comedy but don't cuss.

1709
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,513
And then I could do it.

1710
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,653
But,

1711
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,930
so the two times I did TV,

1712
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:05,764
like it's like,

1713
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,010
oh,

1714
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,341
David,

1715
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:06,971
those shows you won,

1716
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:07,210
won,

1717
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:07,841
won Emmy's.

1718
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,120
And so the floodgates
sort of open in like,

1719
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:13,710
now I have all these people
interested in doing shows with me and,

1720
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,583
but there,

1721
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,030
do you ever have this experience?

1722
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,231
Because then,

1723
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,451
you know,

1724
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:16,761
you know a lot,

1725
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:18,430
a lot of rich people and whatever.

1726
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:23,350
Like I sit in board rooms with like CEOs
and people that run these companies and

1727
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,140
they're billionaires
and they run the world.

1728
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,610
They have way more money than me.

1729
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,690
They have way more power,

1730
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:29,021
fame,

1731
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:29,854
whatever.

1732
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,650
And they're still not free men.

1733
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,900
They're the answer to,

1734
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:34,870
to,

1735
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,520
to AOL Disney or I don't know.

1736
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:38,470
Like they,

1737
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,111
they go,

1738
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:39,944
uh,

1739
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,661
uh,

1740
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:40,970
you,

1741
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,240
yeah,

1742
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,540
like you gotta take these four P's.

1743
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,580
I'm not afraid to take chances.

1744
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:43,970
I go,

1745
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,290
you're a fucking billionaire who like,

1746
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,200
who gives a shit?

1747
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,033
It's like,

1748
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:48,711
Oh wow,

1749
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:51,800
you have all the money in the world
yet you still have to answer to

1750
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,700
shareholders.

1751
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,710
Like your business partners,

1752
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,611
your wife.

1753
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:56,430
I don't know.

1754
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,520
I made a conscious decision
not to get married.

1755
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,354
I don't have kids.

1756
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,710
I don't work for anybody.

1757
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,940
And so it's like,

1758
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,780
man,

1759
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,290
it would be so easy for me to just
sign this deal and do this TV show.

1760
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,124
But then they're like,

1761
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,840
but then you can't have Han dynasty on
your team that don't ever let anybody

1762
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:13,100
take you from doing what you're doing.

1763
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:13,281
Well,

1764
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,000
no one says,

1765
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,070
well the nice thing is no
one says you can't do it.

1766
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,701
They just go,

1767
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,020
if you want to be on our team,

1768
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,340
then you can't do this shit.

1769
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,920
Like what is this Hong Dynasty
saying you can't do it.

1770
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,401
Look,

1771
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:23,440
I haven't heard that one,

1772
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,450
but I don't projects before with
have told me to take down my website,

1773
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,550
take down your message board,

1774
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:27,890
take time.

1775
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,760
Like fuck you.

1776
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,120
Right.

1777
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,730
I'm not taking out shit because
if you want me to do that,

1778
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:32,990
you want me to compromise myself.

1779
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,440
That's going to start there and it's
going to end up with me wearing a fucking

1780
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:36,891
suit,

1781
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:38,060
sitting behind a desk,

1782
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,170
talking to some idiot about his sitcom
that I could give two fucks about what

1783
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:42,590
happened.

1784
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,570
And it's a weird thing cause
it's like I didn't give a shit.

1785
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,370
Then when I was poor,

1786
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,020
I didn't give a shit when I was rich.

1787
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,160
And then it's like,

1788
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:50,660
what now I'm going to have a boss.

1789
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,860
Like it's weird,

1790
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,000
like you don't have to do that.

1791
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,440
Just do things that you're doing now.

1792
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,090
This is what I'm saying that I know,

1793
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:56,980
but this is what I'm saying Joel,

1794
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:58,400
like I don't want like,

1795
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,230
well what's a bet?

1796
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,260
Let's put it this way.

1797
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,590
What's the benefit of you doing
something on television other than vice,

1798
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,350
which is an awesome show
and Anthony Bourdain show,

1799
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:07,184
which is an awesome,

1800
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,480
things like that is great,

1801
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,180
but what's the benefit of
you doing a television?

1802
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,021
Do you need more money?

1803
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:13,400
You don't know what to do with money.

1804
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,690
It's just like to do projects.

1805
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,480
It's just for me like I dunno,

1806
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,450
I just film this pilot where just,

1807
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:21,951
yeah,

1808
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:22,671
it's not for the money.

1809
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:23,750
They don't even have to pay me anything.

1810
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:28,100
But it's like I get to fly
somewhere and I get to like,

1811
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,020
like doing a show like this.

1812
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,960
We can say anything we want
or we could talk about like,

1813
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,111
oh,

1814
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,790
I want to make this movie
and talk about the ideas,

1815
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:36,830
but this is like making it happen.

1816
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,250
You know?

1817
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:37,760
It's like,

1818
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,630
but you could do that.

1819
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:39,471
I know,

1820
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:41,480
but it's like the thing
with the publishing,

1821
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,300
it's so much easier for like
when I showed up on board,

1822
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:46,130
ain't set like it's all taken care of.

1823
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:46,461
I was like,

1824
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:47,294
wow.

1825
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,840
This producer called everyone does
camera man's like a award winning

1826
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:51,531
cinematographer.

1827
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:52,364
He knows what he's doing.

1828
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,110
Like I don't want to
become the guy that's like,

1829
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:54,771
oh,

1830
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:56,180
I got to start my own network now.

1831
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:58,230
I've got to hire my own guys
and do all this shit to,

1832
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,390
you can do that though,

1833
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,233
man.

1834
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,010
You can have meetings and this is one
of the things you could do is get a

1835
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:04,800
manager,

1836
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,820
get a nice Jewish boy who understands
show business and tell that motherfucker

1837
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,230
this is,

1838
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:09,980
this is me.

1839
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,801
I'm David Chow.

1840
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:12,830
I like to put ar 15 up curls.

1841
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,920
Buttholes I like to do watercolor
paintings that are obscene.

1842
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,820
I like to do this thing called DVD
asa that gets me fired from Hbo.

1843
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,140
I'm a crazy man.

1844
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:21,690
Nobody fired,

1845
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,523
but I,

1846
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,780
you got an option.

1847
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,660
We'll talk the talk.

1848
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,760
I got tons of money and I'd like to do
fun shit and I don't want to have a boss,

1849
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:30,680
but I want to be able to do cool projects.

1850
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:31,530
I want to life,

1851
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:32,970
I want to have adventures.

1852
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,570
So what do we need to do to hire a bunch
of like real good union cameraman to

1853
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,470
set up a real good production
studio where we can edit video,

1854
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,790
higher legit people.

1855
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,900
I don't want to deal with shit.

1856
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,340
I just want to go do my stuff.

1857
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,730
You handle all that and you could do
all that and it can become profitable

1858
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,593
easily.

1859
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,500
Easily.

1860
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:52,920
Well,

1861
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,940
I mean I'm not your manager,

1862
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:54,841
but that's what I'm saying.

1863
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:55,674
It's like,

1864
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,650
it's like being a reluctant entrepreneur.

1865
00:44:58,830 --> 00:44:59,970
I don't want to do that.

1866
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,290
I'm going to have to,

1867
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,290
you should,

1868
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,870
you know you should
get stuff you're doing.

1869
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,471
It's Hong Diane.

1870
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:04,860
She's tough.

1871
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,693
It's fun.

1872
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,271
That was like,

1873
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:06,841
just like,

1874
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:07,081
you know,

1875
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:07,914
it's like,

1876
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,730
it's like a weird feeling to go to like
a Denzel movie or Liam Neeson movie and

1877
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:15,060
you're sitting there and you're like,

1878
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:15,894
this is shitty,

1879
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:16,920
but you're like,

1880
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,600
it's so much money behind it.

1881
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,220
How did it even get made?

1882
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,821
You know?

1883
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,500
Or you're sitting in an editing room and,

1884
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,060
and that you're putting in,

1885
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,010
you're working on the
show and you're like,

1886
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:26,401
wow,

1887
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:27,390
that ports are really funny.

1888
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:27,900
It was like,

1889
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,070
that's never going to be on TV.

1890
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,150
Why?

1891
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,340
Because everyone in this room agrees.

1892
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:33,480
That's the funniest thing.

1893
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,160
It'll never be on TV.

1894
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,670
Why?

1895
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,020
Because of a coasts soap commercial is
going to pull their ads if you do that,

1896
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,370
that's half the best shit
I've ever said on fear factor.

1897
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,243
Never made it to the air.

1898
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:43,951
Exactly.

1899
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:46,340
Cause I would fuck with the
contestants and save ridiculous shit.

1900
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:48,360
Like to see that wasn't
going to be on the air.

1901
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,290
I would love to see that.

1902
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,230
But you got to understand that
that's not what they're trying to do.

1903
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,561
Their,

1904
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:54,990
their business is not the
business of artistic expression.

1905
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,300
Right.

1906
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:55,800
Businesses,

1907
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,850
the business of making money.

1908
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:59,070
What's the best way to optimize
our chance to make making money?

1909
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:01,890
You got to get a real cookie
cutter bullshit television show,

1910
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:02,290
right?

1911
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:03,123
You know these,

1912
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,270
but they're saying there's,

1913
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:07,680
then there's no audience for a fear
factor type show where Joe Fox with the

1914
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,360
contestants there is,

1915
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,040
but it's not that forum.

1916
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,750
That forum has already been established.

1917
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,890
It's already locked down.

1918
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:14,970
It's already censored.

1919
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,270
But what you're doing on the,

1920
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,090
on the Internet is a wild wet,

1921
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:19,470
like this podcast,

1922
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:20,580
it has no boss.

1923
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,830
There's no one to tell us
what we can talk about.

1924
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:23,760
We can do whatever we want.

1925
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,030
Right.

1926
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,350
And it's because it's on the Internet.

1927
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,650
You could do that same sort of
thing and running to what I do,

1928
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:29,221
which is like,

1929
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:30,054
hey Joe,

1930
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,721
you're on.

1931
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,250
Like,

1932
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:31,750
you know,

1933
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,840
whatever the network UFC is on.

1934
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:34,531
Or you know,

1935
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:35,610
anytime you do TV stuff,

1936
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,361
do they ever go,

1937
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:37,020
hey Joe,

1938
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,620
I've had a few talks about some
fucking crazy shit on your last show.

1939
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,920
You've got to take that episode down.

1940
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:41,790
No,

1941
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,180
no,

1942
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,013
I'm not going to do that.

1943
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:43,853
I wouldn't do it.

1944
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,670
I bet we've,

1945
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,510
there's been a few issues,

1946
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,640
but I can justify the things
that I've talked about.

1947
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:47,851
I mean,

1948
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:48,151
I'm not,

1949
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:51,600
I'm not just going off on a rail you love.

1950
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,440
You'll see what I'm saying.

1951
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:52,771
I love it.

1952
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:52,920
Yeah.

1953
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,610
I've never met anyone who like knows so
much and it just couldn't recall that if

1954
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:58,530
they at one point like
Dana white or whoever said,

1955
00:46:58,531 --> 00:46:59,364
hey Joe,

1956
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,090
you're,

1957
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,290
you're like part of UFC.

1958
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,550
Like you've been doing it forever.

1959
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,560
You're podcast is just,

1960
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,220
I quit.

1961
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,030
I quit the UFC.

1962
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,470
You would like that in one second.

1963
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:07,891
One second.

1964
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:08,401
You didn't say.

1965
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:09,780
I love it so much that I can,

1966
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,040
I've come close a couple of times.

1967
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,640
Wow.

1968
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:11,920
Yeah.

1969
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,141
I'm,

1970
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:12,510
I'm,

1971
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,343
there's no way.

1972
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:13,771
I'm not,

1973
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:14,131
I'm never,

1974
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:17,400
I'll never change what I do in stand up
and I'll never change what I do with the

1975
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:17,881
podcast.

1976
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:20,310
I firmly believe that if I did that,

1977
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,770
I would be a miserable fuck if I decided.

1978
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:23,430
I believe that too.

1979
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,460
I'm going to censor the podcast and now
I'm not going to have people like David

1980
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,030
[inaudible].

1981
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,170
He's a fucking loose cannon.

1982
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,070
He's talking about Jackie
Chan finger banging people.

1983
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,821
He's got an ar,

1984
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:31,720
15 is up scores,

1985
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:32,554
girl's butthole.

1986
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,701
If I did that,

1987
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:33,911
I would,

1988
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:34,960
I would fuck myself over.

1989
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:38,670
And plus I started doing this thing that
I'd like as much as doing the UFC or

1990
00:47:38,671 --> 00:47:42,550
started doing these fight
companion podcast where we
sit down and we watched the

1991
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:42,851
fights.

1992
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:46,840
We put the fight up on there and we drink
and you smoke weed and we watched the

1993
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:48,580
fight to just talk while
the fights are going on.

1994
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,390
It's the most fun recordings
and we broadcast it.

1995
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,770
You're probably having
more fun doing that.

1996
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:56,470
She gets hundreds of
thousands of downloads.

1997
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:56,821
Wow.

1998
00:47:56,821 --> 00:47:57,790
See these crazy.

1999
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,970
I liked doing that almost as
much as I like being there,

2000
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,130
almost being there as the best.

2001
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:03,731
I mean,

2002
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:05,440
I don't get me wrong,

2003
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:07,430
I love my show and
talking about everything.

2004
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:07,720
You know,

2005
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,340
fucking Jackie Chan,

2006
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:10,540
like finger blasting and whatever.

2007
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,260
But I love getting
access to fucking go to,

2008
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,890
to the North Pole in and interviewing
like the Norwegian army general and

2009
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:18,401
getting,

2010
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:18,611
you know,

2011
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:19,600
I liked that and stuff too.

2012
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,823
And it's like,

2013
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,023
well,

2014
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,200
anytime I'm putting this,

2015
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:23,801
I'm like,

2016
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:24,131
you man.

2017
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:24,371
I'm like,

2018
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:27,700
I'll never fucking never
been out to anybody.

2019
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,790
Like I don't give a fuck blue,

2020
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,270
but at the same time I
don't have to do anything,

2021
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:31,570
you know?

2022
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:31,870
Right.

2023
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,990
You could just sit down and just chill.

2024
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:34,740
Yeah.

2025
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,940
You have what's really fuck you money.

2026
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,493
You really have it.

2027
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:38,951
I mean that's a,

2028
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:40,270
that's an expression you have.

2029
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:41,000
Fuck you money.

2030
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,471
It feels good.

2031
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,304
It does feel good.

2032
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,440
You're going to use that fuck you money.

2033
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,850
Use it to say fuck you.

2034
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,541
And when you,

2035
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,700
when you do a television
show with a compromise,

2036
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:48,791
you,

2037
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:49,001
hey,

2038
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:50,680
you gotta take down DVD Asa.

2039
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:50,951
Well,

2040
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:53,680
you got to stop doing an ar 15
up girl's butthole pictures,

2041
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,040
right?

2042
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,240
You automatically,

2043
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,860
you,

2044
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,720
you get rid of the whole point
of having fuck you money.

2045
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,950
You can't say fuck you.

2046
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,410
Who you are is just weird,

2047
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,700
unique artists.

2048
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:04,240
Dude,

2049
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:04,991
who likes doing,

2050
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,550
she like pushing boundaries.

2051
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,640
You like being open about everything from
prostitutes to sexual proclivities to

2052
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:13,840
overeating and diabetes.

2053
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,040
But that's you man.

2054
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,300
You're a good dude.

2055
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:16,540
You know,

2056
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,980
I like you have,

2057
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,540
I don't worry about guys like you getting
corrupted by the fucking grist for the

2058
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,140
mill.

2059
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,850
Get stuck in the machine
where they figured out,

2060
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:26,410
how can I make more
money off of David Choe?

2061
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,333
I got to make David,

2062
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,203
you know what they did with,

2063
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,500
here's a perfect example.

2064
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,300
You know what they did with
David had the Dave Chappelle,

2065
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,310
Dave Chappelle was doing
the fucking Chappelle show,

2066
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:37,270
which in my opinion is the greatest
sketch show of all time best the best.

2067
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,450
He's one of the funniest standup years
later we could still watch repeats.

2068
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,380
It's funny as shit.

2069
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,243
That guy,

2070
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,100
the blind white racist,

2071
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:48,910
who was a black guy is still one of
the greatest sketches of all the race

2072
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:53,911
trading Chinese taking the
Wu Tang clan and brilliant,

2073
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:54,491
brilliant,

2074
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,031
brilliant,

2075
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:55,864
brilliant show.

2076
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,000
They started telling him
he couldn't say nigger.

2077
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,430
They started telling him to
stop saying it and he was like,

2078
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:01,720
what are you talking about?

2079
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,441
They were like,

2080
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:05,660
we can get more money from advertisement
if you stop saying this or you stop

2081
00:50:05,661 --> 00:50:06,940
saying that or don't do this or do it.

2082
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,140
And that's when he went crazy
or maybe went sane and decided,

2083
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:11,471
you know what?

2084
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:16,471
I got some money and they
had a $50 million offer to
fucking renew and this and

2085
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:16,871
that.

2086
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:17,591
And he just said,

2087
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:18,161
fuck this.

2088
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:19,150
He went to Africa,

2089
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,930
tried to relax and find himself and came
back and he quit the fucking show and

2090
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:26,380
he quit the show because they were
turning him into something else,

2091
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:26,640
right?

2092
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,800
They were trying to take this

2093
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,000
uncensored,

2094
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:33,290
brilliant artistic mind
and make him a commodity.

2095
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:33,980
Right?

2096
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,910
And that's what happens,

2097
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:35,360
man,

2098
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,530
Duh.

2099
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:36,680
But that's their business.

2100
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,160
It's not,

2101
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,993
that's like,

2102
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,990
it's like being alone with a wolf and
the wolf eats you when it's hungry.

2103
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,520
Of course it's a fucking Wolf,

2104
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:43,760
right?

2105
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,720
It's what they do.

2106
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,510
It's like you can't be upset
at a wolf for eating you.

2107
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,340
That's,

2108
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,400
that's their nature.

2109
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,860
And the nature of people that run these,

2110
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,920
these production studios and networks,

2111
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:55,790
they're not evil.

2112
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,340
They just make money and
the way to make money.

2113
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,590
How much money can you get
from Toyota will Toyota,

2114
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,360
we'll give you x amount of money.

2115
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,980
If you don't have any swears,

2116
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,921
they'll give you,

2117
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:05,240
you know,

2118
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,060
x more if you cut out
this and don't do that,

2119
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:08,410
they'll,

2120
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,130
they'll sign on for three years.

2121
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:11,090
A three year commitment.

2122
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,680
Well that's the way that shit works.

2123
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:12,850
No,

2124
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:13,730
it's just about my nose.

2125
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:14,400
Well,

2126
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,620
I,

2127
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,170
I've been,

2128
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:15,441
you know,

2129
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:16,490
I've worked every job,

2130
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,080
I've worked in advertising,

2131
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:18,441
I've worked,

2132
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:19,400
I've done all that shit.

2133
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,150
When I,

2134
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,260
when I made the fuck you money,

2135
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:24,230
I sat down and I have five
guys that work with me know,

2136
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:27,020
and had a meeting and I said
the point of what we do,

2137
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,030
and it's never been in the specialty now,

2138
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,230
is to not make money.

2139
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:30,681
You know,

2140
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:32,270
I know I could sit here
and talk to you about like,

2141
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,570
should you turn into subscription
base or ads and listen to that.

2142
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,390
We've never had ads on my
show because I don't have to.

2143
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,433
And it's like,

2144
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,870
it would be nice if we made
stuff that did make money,

2145
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,800
but that is never,

2146
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,190
you know,

2147
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,570
the last three years.

2148
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,930
Like everything I do just like
hemorrhages and bleeds and money,

2149
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,003
but you know,

2150
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,500
I can sell one painting and
make that money back in one day.

2151
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,941
And you know,

2152
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:53,774
it's like

2153
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,580
people who have had this
discussion before when the,

2154
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,450
when they're at 77,

2155
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:01,250
11 buying a scratcher or super
lotto ticket and they're like,

2156
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:01,971
man,

2157
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:03,230
if I had $100 million,

2158
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:04,250
this was what I would do.

2159
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,320
But it's like in this country and I don't
want to go on a diatribe about greed

2160
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:08,631
or whatever.

2161
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:09,860
It's like when is it enough?

2162
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,270
Like when is it like,

2163
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,340
so you got to show,

2164
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,353
uh,

2165
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,160
that like the Chappelle
show and he wants to say,

2166
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:16,550
nigger,

2167
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,301
just let them say it.

2168
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,770
Like he feels good.

2169
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:19,730
He's allowed to say it.

2170
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:20,860
Well,

2171
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,990
it's like they are not Chappelle,

2172
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:23,191
so,

2173
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:27,030
right when you have people that
are not creative people or not,

2174
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,510
they're certainly not responsible for
his creative vision and they started

2175
00:52:30,511 --> 00:52:32,580
interfering with it and
trying to monetize it.

2176
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:32,780
Right?

2177
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,840
That's when it becomes a problem when it
isn't a problem is when you roll is the

2178
00:52:36,841 --> 00:52:38,460
artist is in complete control.

2179
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,450
Like a podcast,

2180
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,030
like your DVD,

2181
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:41,881
a podcast,

2182
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:45,270
or like Han dynasty or any of this other
shit you do like all of your paintings,

2183
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,770
no one's standing over you and go,

2184
00:52:46,771 --> 00:52:48,480
Dave stopped painting tits.

2185
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,830
You know you're painting vagina,

2186
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:50,081
you're poor,

2187
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:51,450
you're making women objects,

2188
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:52,111
you're doing this,

2189
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:52,944
you're doing that.

2190
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:53,221
You,

2191
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:53,400
you,

2192
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,260
you can't be you.

2193
00:52:55,261 --> 00:52:56,100
If that's happening,

2194
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,760
look,

2195
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,090
maybe some people are going to
criticize you and maybe you'll take that

2196
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:02,970
criticism to heart and it'll
change your opinion about things,

2197
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,920
which is totally honest and fine.

2198
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:05,970
If someone says,

2199
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,301
hey,

2200
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:06,451
no,

2201
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:06,991
hey Dave,

2202
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:08,130
I'm tired of you painting,

2203
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:08,341
blah,

2204
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:08,491
blah,

2205
00:53:08,491 --> 00:53:08,880
blah.

2206
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,060
Right?

2207
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,541
And then you go,

2208
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,400
you know what know?

2209
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,551
It's Kinda fun.

2210
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,660
I don't want anybody to feel bad,

2211
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:12,960
right?

2212
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,070
I'm just trying to express myself.

2213
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:16,050
Maybe I wasn't looking at
it from their point of view.

2214
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,120
And then you can sort of
alter your point of view.

2215
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:18,720
It's not,

2216
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,890
it's something negative about that.

2217
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:21,240
It's part of developing,

2218
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:21,841
maturing,

2219
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:22,441
growing,

2220
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:24,510
taking in all sorts of
different influences.

2221
00:53:24,511 --> 00:53:25,770
It's a part of being human being,

2222
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,100
right?

2223
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,130
But there's a big difference between
that and doing it only for money.

2224
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,310
And that's what happens when you get
attached to a network and it's not their

2225
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:33,030
fault,

2226
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,930
it's just what they do.

2227
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,390
But it's why like I've never,

2228
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,550
I've never talked to anybody
about selling this thing.

2229
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:39,810
I would never sell this thing.

2230
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,740
This is just,

2231
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,340
this is,

2232
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,450
we started this out,

2233
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,230
Brian and I go about the day that Howard's
a hundred percent fuck everything up,

2234
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:46,381
right?

2235
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:46,681
They'd say,

2236
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,850
you gotta Stop Smoking Weed,

2237
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,061
right?

2238
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:49,770
You guys got lit joints everywhere.

2239
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,633
You can't do that.

2240
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,151
What do you mean?

2241
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:51,601
Why can't we,

2242
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:52,434
it's California.

2243
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,820
I have a medical marijuana license,

2244
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:55,710
so w and then who gives a fuck?

2245
00:53:55,711 --> 00:53:56,011
Anybody?

2246
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:58,770
We have whiskey here all the
time and we complains about that.

2247
00:53:58,771 --> 00:53:59,130
Like,

2248
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,270
what are we complaining about?

2249
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,930
This w w th there's millions
of people that smoke weed.

2250
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:06,540
He told me that those people's
money is not worth anything,

2251
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:06,960
right?

2252
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,700
The we dollar is not real money,

2253
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:08,990
right?

2254
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:13,470
You've got to respect the fucking
stoner dollar were people I pay taxes,

2255
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:14,640
okay,

2256
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,780
I'm going to fucking NRA,

2257
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,500
goddammit.

2258
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,333
Right?

2259
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:23,010
There's a real problem when people try
to take creative ideas and turn those

2260
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:28,050
creative ideas into some
sort of a complete monetary,

2261
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:28,500
uh,

2262
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,333
venture.

2263
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,920
And that's what happens when you
get involved with a television show,

2264
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:32,670
right?

2265
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,390
It's just what it is.

2266
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,320
There's some sort of
compromise involved here.

2267
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,210
You don't have to do that.

2268
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,841
Here's the problem,

2269
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:37,021
Joe.

2270
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:39,330
It's like when I paint something,

2271
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,170
it's like,

2272
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,100
some people will see it.

2273
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,360
If I have it in an art gallery,

2274
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,410
I don't go to art galleries.

2275
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,960
It's like the spectrum
of media is like this,

2276
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:46,794
right?

2277
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,370
It's like at the top
is network television,

2278
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,571
like blockbuster,

2279
00:54:51,571 --> 00:54:52,470
Hollywood movies.

2280
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,000
And then at video games,

2281
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:56,250
or maybe video games is at
the top and then it's like,

2282
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,300
uh,

2283
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:57,691
you know,

2284
00:54:57,691 --> 00:54:59,010
music and then,

2285
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,431
you know,

2286
00:54:59,431 --> 00:54:59,941
books,

2287
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:00,510
comic books.

2288
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,800
And at the very bottom is art,

2289
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:02,160
right?

2290
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,540
So at the very top,

2291
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:04,560
there's the most censorship,

2292
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:07,860
there's the most like people
with their people involved.

2293
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:08,694
Um,

2294
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:09,991
you can't say this,

2295
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:10,461
you can't do that.

2296
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:11,520
Dolphin Tale two,

2297
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:12,610
right?

2298
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:17,610
And at the very bottom is
art where I can paint any,

2299
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,350
anything and no one cares.

2300
00:55:19,351 --> 00:55:20,670
And it's not literal,

2301
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:20,971
right?

2302
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:21,541
Not only that,

2303
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:23,700
it's a direct connection to the art,

2304
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,010
right?

2305
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,800
You have your hands on the brush,

2306
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,011
right?

2307
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:27,330
You're standing in front of the canvas,

2308
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:29,870
there's no one there and
it's alone in your warehouse,

2309
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:30,900
a solitary sport.

2310
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:34,850
No one's involved sort of like jerking
off a lot of cross hatching and,

2311
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,160
and you draw this thing and it means
whatever it means to whoever is,

2312
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,210
to me it means this to you.

2313
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:43,380
It means that it's like,

2314
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:44,780
you know,

2315
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,200
there's very little chances
of you becoming like a
fucking billionaire drawing

2316
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:49,711
comic books,

2317
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:50,490
but you know it,

2318
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,360
you get to say,

2319
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,880
what dollar can you put
on freedom like that.

2320
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:59,330
But now because this weird anomaly of
where I did make like all this money doing

2321
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:00,270
art,

2322
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,150
the floodgates have opened for me
to do all types of entertainment.

2323
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,980
And not to sound too like

2324
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,710
artsy or whatever.

2325
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,371
I look at,

2326
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:09,360
everything I do is art.

2327
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,800
I look at my podcast,

2328
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,730
my TV stuff.

2329
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,790
I bring that level of
expression and freedom to it.

2330
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:18,930
And then it just is not translating
well with the higher ups,

2331
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:19,411
I guess.

2332
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:20,244
And it's like,

2333
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,240
Hey,

2334
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,800
you could do whatever you want over here,

2335
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:25,060
but there's no higher ops pro.

2336
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,050
I know there isn't can all suck you down.

2337
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,183
Yeah.

2338
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,190
There's no higher ups man.

2339
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:37,470
I mean this all comes down to other
people in forensic influencing your,

2340
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,670
your creative vision.

2341
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,030
And you can't ever let that happen because
you create a vision is what makes you

2342
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:42,540
unique.

2343
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:42,691
You know,

2344
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,570
when I talked about being an artist or
wanting to be an artist in high school

2345
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,250
and having this bad art teacher,

2346
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:48,540
I mean,

2347
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:52,050
I honestly do feel bad for the dude
because he was really frumpy and he had a

2348
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:52,900
gut and it's,

2349
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:54,870
his fucking posture was bad.

2350
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:57,030
And he just was a guy
who just had no hope.

2351
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,330
And what he said to me,

2352
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,630
it was like I would draw
this stuff and he was like,

2353
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,610
you got to do like you,

2354
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,130
you're going to have to draw
things that you don't want to draw.

2355
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,761
And I said,

2356
00:57:05,761 --> 00:57:06,530
why?

2357
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:06,871
And he said,

2358
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:08,280
because you're going to
have to make a living.

2359
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,600
So if you're going to
have to make a living,

2360
00:57:09,601 --> 00:57:10,680
maybe going to work for,

2361
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:11,340
uh,

2362
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,001
this is the thing,

2363
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:12,834
the example to use,

2364
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,590
you're going to have
to draw a babies for a,

2365
00:57:15,591 --> 00:57:15,801
a,

2366
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:17,280
a diaper commercial.

2367
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:17,821
And I was like,

2368
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:19,230
but I want to be a comic book artist.

2369
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:20,071
And he's like,

2370
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:20,600
but you're not,

2371
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,090
may not make it as a convertible car.

2372
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:22,501
So I was like,

2373
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:23,370
Oh fuck this.

2374
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,620
So my senior year I didn't even take art.

2375
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,490
I was one of the best
artists in his class.

2376
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,621
There was me,

2377
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:29,450
this guy,

2378
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,930
I think his name's John Devor.

2379
00:57:30,931 --> 00:57:31,800
He was really good.

2380
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:32,700
And this Guy Kevin,

2381
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,050
who was also really good,

2382
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:34,680
these,

2383
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,550
these three guys.

2384
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:37,340
And we always used to
draw the same style stuff.

2385
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,460
I don't know if they became an artist.

2386
00:57:38,461 --> 00:57:39,270
I don't know what happened.

2387
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,103
Keep in touch with them.

2388
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:40,681
No,

2389
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:41,221
it was high.

2390
00:57:41,221 --> 00:57:42,054
School was weird.

2391
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,210
Fucking,

2392
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,450
I was such a social
misfit and high school.

2393
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:46,270
Do you ever do a

2394
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,090
portfolio day where you have like a,

2395
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,410
all your drawings and you go to like,

2396
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:50,830
uh,

2397
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:51,950
like Disney or something and

2398
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:52,740
no,

2399
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,940
I never got that far with it.

2400
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:57,090
So I don't even get to two as
far as like applying to colleges.

2401
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:57,500
When I,

2402
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,040
when I got out of high school,

2403
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,520
um,

2404
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,090
I went to art school for a year or two
and then I dropped out and I was just

2405
00:58:03,091 --> 00:58:03,630
like,

2406
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,280
how am I going to make
a living doing this?

2407
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:05,550
And I,

2408
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,370
and I got all my best
drawings and I went to,

2409
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:09,930
I think it was cal arts,

2410
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:10,764
it was like a,

2411
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,660
it's like a open call,

2412
00:58:12,661 --> 00:58:12,991
like in,

2413
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:15,360
it's like every single animation studio,

2414
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,190
every single advertising agency.

2415
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,510
And I got there and it's all these fucking
kids with all their art and there's

2416
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,350
really long lines to talk to a guy that
like has a pencil behind his ear and

2417
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:26,184
goes,

2418
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,140
work on this work on this.

2419
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,070
And I was like,

2420
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,970
fuck this.

2421
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:30,751
And so I was like,

2422
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:31,800
I'm not even gonna wait in this line.

2423
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:32,380
So I went,

2424
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,820
I went to go take a piss and I saw one
of the advertising guys get up and I

2425
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:37,710
followed him to the bathroom and I said,

2426
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,870
I pulled one of those
while his Dick's out.

2427
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:40,260
I'm like,

2428
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,441
Hey,

2429
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:40,980
look at,

2430
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,371
look at this,

2431
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:42,204
cross hatch penis,

2432
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:42,960
look at this.

2433
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,321
And he's like,

2434
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:43,561
Hey,

2435
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,000
you can't wait in line like everyone else.

2436
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:45,241
I'm like,

2437
00:58:45,241 --> 00:58:45,511
dude,

2438
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:46,261
I'm pleased.

2439
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:47,330
And he like looked over,

2440
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:47,581
he was like,

2441
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:48,360
Hey,

2442
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,193
that's pretty good.

2443
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:54,120
And so he's got his dick out
and a nice fat Dick Dude.

2444
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:55,740
No,

2445
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,190
he gives,

2446
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,300
he gives me his card and he goes,

2447
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:58,230
you're fucking dope man.

2448
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,150
You should come to my
office in Beverly Hills.

2449
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:03,060
And I was like either 20 or 21.

2450
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:03,894
And I was like,

2451
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:04,883
yes.

2452
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,990
And it's the,

2453
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,550
it's one of the biggest
advertising agencies in La.

2454
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,250
I show up there like with
a tie on and everything.

2455
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,020
And as I walked down the hallway,

2456
00:59:13,021 --> 00:59:14,640
it's like every movie poster.

2457
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,953
And uh,

2458
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:17,243
I was like,

2459
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,203
I made it.

2460
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,860
I'm fucking like young and I'm
going to make a living drawing.

2461
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:23,780
Like this is fucking crazy.

2462
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,720
So I think back then,

2463
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:27,620
I don't know how it is now.

2464
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,870
They would have all these artists draw in.

2465
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:30,650
Um,

2466
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,360
the style I forgotten drew Struzan,

2467
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:33,650
that's that star wars.

2468
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:34,484
Uh,

2469
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,960
they got painted all the star wars.

2470
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:41,600
These guys all draw that same style and
you'd draw the movie poster and then

2471
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:45,270
they give that to the photographer
and the photographer because you know,

2472
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,940
there's no art in movie posters now.

2473
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,540
Right.

2474
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,021
And this is,

2475
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm talking about fucking 20 years ago,

2476
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:51,920
so I'm sure it's different now.

2477
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:57,110
And it was a avalanche
movie with Chris Dawn.

2478
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:57,590
No.

2479
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:57,861
Crystal.

2480
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:58,221
Donald.

2481
00:59:58,221 --> 00:59:59,060
Crystal Donald,

2482
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:00,650
I think if the movie was called avalanche.

2483
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,160
Yeah.

2484
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,690
And so I sat in the room and I was like,

2485
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:03,471
this is so cool.

2486
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:05,120
I get to see a movie before it came out,

2487
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:05,780
you know?

2488
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,171
And I'm like,

2489
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:07,760
this movie fucking sucks.

2490
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:12,080
And then I'm sitting there watching
it with like six old guys with like

2491
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:13,700
cigarettes daily dangling
out of their mouth.

2492
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:13,970
And I'm like,

2493
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:14,780
all right guys,

2494
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,650
we need avalanches.

2495
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:18,920
We need this and this and we need
Chris O'donnell looking like this.

2496
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,000
And I'm like,

2497
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,990
this is amazing.

2498
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:21,171
You know?

2499
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:25,010
And I sit in a room and I draw Chris
O'donnell and there's a poster,

2500
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:25,730
vertical,

2501
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,121
vertical,

2502
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:26,751
vertical limit.

2503
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,584
There it is.

2504
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,900
I think I drew that Bill Paxton.

2505
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:30,853
Well that's what you do.

2506
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:31,883
Yeah,

2507
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,090
that's pretty exact.

2508
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,270
Willem defoe was the guy in the back.

2509
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,890
I don't remember who was that?

2510
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38,630
Glenn Scott Glenn.

2511
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:38,991
Oh,

2512
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:39,351
that guy.

2513
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:39,531
Yeah,

2514
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:39,830
he's,

2515
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:40,663
that guy is awesome.

2516
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,900
So I got all of their headshots,

2517
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,793
I'm drawing them,

2518
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,420
the art directors coming in and he's like,

2519
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:45,220
you know,

2520
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:45,530
it's,

2521
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,050
I mean he,

2522
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,360
he starts with the compliment Dave.

2523
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:47,781
That's great.

2524
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,361
Can you do it again?

2525
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:49,310
Like a little bit smirk,

2526
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,010
a little bit more heroic and then,

2527
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,993
um,

2528
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,290
not even a day in,

2529
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,100
I'm like,

2530
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,933
I hate this job.

2531
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,470
I just drew fucking Chris O'donnell
and same thing at the same thought.

2532
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:01,190
Then I'm like,

2533
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,360
how did this movie get made?

2534
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,960
Right?

2535
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,141
Like,

2536
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:03,681
it's horrible.

2537
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:03,980
Like,

2538
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,560
like who?

2539
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,393
Like,

2540
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,380
like why don't crystal,

2541
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:07,490
Donald's a beautiful man.

2542
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:08,910
I just want to see him.

2543
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,030
Right.

2544
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,220
It's a good date night movie.

2545
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,510
And so I already safe.

2546
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,800
I lasted at that job,

2547
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,670
you know,

2548
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,380
when you say like you got to draw shit,

2549
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,243
like yeah.

2550
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,790
The next one was like a Sandra Bullock
movie where she's an alcoholic,

2551
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,590
the 28 days or something.

2552
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,570
And you know that,

2553
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:24,261
that whole like,

2554
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:24,501
Hey,

2555
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:27,950
I'm somewhat part of show Biz and I'm
working and I'm making the good money.

2556
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,740
I walked into the guy's
office less than a month in.

2557
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,770
I said like,

2558
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,650
thank you for this honor.

2559
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,750
Like I appreciate it like this.

2560
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,190
I learned so much I can't do it.

2561
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:38,203
He's like,

2562
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,200
what are you talking about?

2563
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,580
Like why did you see that line?

2564
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,690
You see how many people would die?

2565
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,141
He's like,

2566
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:42,411
Dave.

2567
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:43,011
And he closes the door.

2568
01:01:43,011 --> 01:01:43,340
He was like,

2569
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,173
I'm going to tell you something.

2570
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,770
You remind me of me.

2571
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:46,461
Like 20 years ago,

2572
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:49,970
the fucking crazy hair you got like
that fucking punk rock attitude.

2573
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,520
If you stay here and
you do what I tell you,

2574
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,920
you could be running this
fucking place in like 20 years.

2575
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,853
And it was like,

2576
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:56,810
and I was like,

2577
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,520
oh well you only gave me a nice ego.

2578
01:01:58,521 --> 01:01:59,390
Boost the devil.

2579
01:01:59,450 --> 01:01:59,661
Yeah.

2580
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:00,140
And I'm like,

2581
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,120
I wonder if he said this to
all those guys out there,

2582
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:02,870
you know.

2583
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,150
And cause I was the
youngest guy there and I go,

2584
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,770
I can't even believe I'm telling you.

2585
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:07,260
Like,

2586
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,060
like I said,

2587
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,500
thank you for this opportunity.

2588
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,150
I can't do this though.

2589
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:11,541
I can't,

2590
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:11,721
like,

2591
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:13,610
I feel like art is my passion.

2592
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:14,010
I love it.

2593
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:15,170
I feel like I'm dying here,

2594
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,160
you know?

2595
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:16,730
Cause I thought,

2596
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:16,851
oh,

2597
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:18,320
I could draw Krystle Donal all day.

2598
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:21,900
And then at at night I
could draw whatever I want.

2599
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,430
Ar 15 is in buttholes,

2600
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:24,570
right?

2601
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,403
Muscle memory.

2602
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:30,370
I had just spent the entire day training
my hand to draw into drew Struzan style

2603
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,320
of Chris O'donnell.

2604
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,150
I get home and I want to do my shit.

2605
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:33,510
And I'm like,

2606
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,700
Oh fuck that butthole looks
like crystal with Donald's face.

2607
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,033
You know?

2608
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,100
So I tell the guy,

2609
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:38,311
go,

2610
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:38,461
hey,

2611
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:39,240
look,

2612
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,400
I can't believe this great
opportunity you gave me,

2613
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:41,940
but I'm going to,

2614
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,400
I'm going to have to
regretfully decline this thing.

2615
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:45,200
And he goes,

2616
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:45,440
oh,

2617
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,440
what are you going to do Dave?

2618
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,000
Draw your funny books.

2619
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,380
He didn't say it in that voice,

2620
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:50,400
but he's like,

2621
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:50,770
he's like,

2622
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,170
well,

2623
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,460
it's not like hardcore,

2624
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:53,821
but he's like,

2625
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:54,654
what are you going to do?

2626
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:55,620
And he's like,

2627
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,453
good luck with that.

2628
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,360
And I was like,

2629
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,200
you know what I,

2630
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,240
I've made at that young at that,

2631
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:02,010
it's,

2632
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:02,490
it's the,

2633
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,540
it's for me the saddest thing when I see
young people that have already given,

2634
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,410
and I'm like,

2635
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,790
that's the time you fight.

2636
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,630
That's the time that you should
try and fail and try again.

2637
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:14,520
And then it's like when
you get old you're like,

2638
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,510
at least I tried.

2639
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,633
It didn't work out,

2640
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:17,670
you know?

2641
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,330
So I said,

2642
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:18,781
look man,

2643
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:21,140
I'm going to go for it and if
I end up fucking broke or poor,

2644
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:21,541
whatever,

2645
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:22,500
then fuck it,

2646
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:22,801
you know?

2647
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:23,491
At least I tried,

2648
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:24,324
you know,

2649
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:24,840
and,

2650
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,690
and the next next job from
that was drawing a midgets and,

2651
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,130
and,

2652
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:30,270
and buttholes for Hustler.

2653
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:30,810
So I was like,

2654
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:31,500
yes,

2655
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,890
I get to at least draw what I want to
draw and buttholes for hostler yeah,

2656
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:38,970
worked for like Asian fever and the
whole Larry Flynt trying to monetize a

2657
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:39,840
creative vision.

2658
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,040
It's,

2659
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:40,873
it's always,

2660
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:41,450
it's,

2661
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:46,450
it's really important that you try to
figure out what is unique in your head and

2662
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:48,100
that what is in your head,

2663
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:49,350
how do you get it out?

2664
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:51,000
And if you want to bring up
the Chappelle show or anything,

2665
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:52,680
it's like this whole like,

2666
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,360
I don't want to start my own network.

2667
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:55,920
I don't want to start my
own publishing company.

2668
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:58,020
It's like I'm just going
to do whatever I want,

2669
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,810
knowing that it's not
gonna make any money.

2670
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,860
And then what always happens is
because it's so unique and whatever,

2671
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:05,760
it does make money.

2672
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,860
Oh that's so easy for you now Dave,

2673
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:08,671
cause you have fuck you money.

2674
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:09,000
I'm like,

2675
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,960
how do you think I got it?

2676
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,880
How do you think I fucking got it?

2677
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,460
It does still be working
for that advertising.

2678
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:15,691
Right,

2679
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:16,400
exactly.

2680
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,140
I take the chance when I had
nothing and it had nothing to nude.

2681
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,050
They say the rich and the poor have more
in common than the middle class because

2682
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:23,820
they both like if you're poor,

2683
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:24,061
you're like,

2684
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:24,241
Hey,

2685
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:25,080
I've got nothing to lose.

2686
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,610
If I get sued or whatever,

2687
01:04:26,611 --> 01:04:26,881
I'm like,

2688
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:30,360
they could take my fucking
toilet paper roll or whatever,

2689
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:30,840
you know?

2690
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,860
So I dunno,

2691
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,061
you look,

2692
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:34,320
you're not trying to make money.

2693
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:34,981
You have money.

2694
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:36,150
So if you're not trying to make money,

2695
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,080
it's really simple.

2696
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,760
It's like you just need a manager,

2697
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,770
someone to come along
and take care of her.

2698
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,000
I got us be creative.

2699
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:42,181
Yeah.

2700
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:43,110
I got a great manager.

2701
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:44,610
I got great people working with us.

2702
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:45,990
I've got a great personal trainer.

2703
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,180
My rib check out this painting.

2704
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,230
Tell me what you think about that.

2705
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,653
Um,

2706
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,200
it's,

2707
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,120
it's beautiful.

2708
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:54,330
Uh,

2709
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:59,160
Lance Joe just showed me a painting of
a beautiful snow mountain landscape with

2710
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,700
trees in the style of like Bob
Ross who want hear sound crazy.

2711
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,270
My six year old did that.

2712
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:07,320
Shut the fuck up by watching
one of those Bob Ross things?

2713
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:07,680
No,

2714
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,240
she just takes art class though.

2715
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:09,871
You fucking kidding.

2716
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:11,130
She's very talented.

2717
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,140
She's been doing art since
she was really little.

2718
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,300
Is this oil paint or what?

2719
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:14,911
Yeah,

2720
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,830
I got with her when she
was really little too.

2721
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:17,200
Uh,

2722
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,040
we sit down

2723
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,060
and do a lot of art together.

2724
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,350
She's talented.

2725
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,330
I got my art from my uncle.

2726
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,320
I got it from my family.

2727
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:24,580
My grandmother was talented.

2728
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:25,860
My uncle's talented.

2729
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:26,030
My,

2730
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:26,970
my uncle's an artist.

2731
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,490
Right.

2732
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,180
It's all just,

2733
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,590
it's,

2734
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:29,340
it's in the family.

2735
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,080
You know what I think about
when I see that it's like,

2736
01:05:31,081 --> 01:05:31,950
have you ever seen,

2737
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,020
this is going to sound bad,

2738
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:35,400
but have you ever seen Hitler's art?

2739
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:36,511
Yes,

2740
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,140
I have.

2741
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:37,450
Yeah.

2742
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:37,670
It's,

2743
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:38,070
it's,

2744
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:38,903
it's good,

2745
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:42,540
but it's very like you would think a
guy that is a murderer and like his

2746
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:43,141
murdered,

2747
01:05:43,141 --> 01:05:45,310
like millions of people would
have like a more hardcore,

2748
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,050
you know,

2749
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,150
it's like that's great
if you're six years,

2750
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,010
like first of all the
thing Joe just show me,

2751
01:05:50,011 --> 01:05:51,510
look like a grown adult.

2752
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:52,420
It freaks me out.

2753
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,850
The the mountains and
the snow in the mountains

2754
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,600
when you're at that age,

2755
01:05:57,601 --> 01:05:58,470
like the tiger woods,

2756
01:05:58,471 --> 01:05:59,071
Michael Jordan,

2757
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:00,450
like young person and like you're,

2758
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,291
you're learning,

2759
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,550
you're like Picasso or whatever.

2760
01:06:02,551 --> 01:06:03,810
Like you're learning,

2761
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:04,441
you're,

2762
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:09,390
I'm just technique techniques and just
getting all that stuff down perspective.

2763
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,920
You get it down and you're like,

2764
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:11,251
wow,

2765
01:06:11,251 --> 01:06:15,880
I can paint a tree with all the highlights
off the leaves and the dew drops in

2766
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,920
and that's great.

2767
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,300
That's like the time to do that.

2768
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:21,330
But then at some point
you have to be like,

2769
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:22,170
what's inside me?

2770
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:25,530
Is it really a landscape or do I
want to paint some crazy shit and I,

2771
01:06:25,531 --> 01:06:26,030
yeah,

2772
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,180
and so like she's great.

2773
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:30,300
She has the potential like
everyone has the potential.

2774
01:06:30,301 --> 01:06:30,620
Right.

2775
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,980
But they get to a point,

2776
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,360
it's like you discovered fighting,

2777
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:34,620
but if you never got into fighting,

2778
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,810
I think you would have
been a great artist doing,

2779
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,860
you know all your werewolves

2780
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,000
well why would have enjoyed it?

2781
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:42,450
I still love comic book movies
and I Love Comic Book Art.

2782
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,680
Like I love those like really glossy
comic book magazines and stuff.

2783
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:50,160
So like when I see Hitler's are nicely
like these landscapes and just shit,

2784
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:50,911
I'm like dude,

2785
01:06:50,911 --> 01:06:54,540
if you like went as hardcore and your
art as you did with killing people,

2786
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,220
like maybe you would have never become a,

2787
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:56,690
you know,

2788
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:00,440
did you see the thing that
was out recently about Hitler
taking math like Hitler

2789
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:03,110
apparently was like really in
the math sounds about right.

2790
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:03,940
Sounds about right.

2791
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,773
Yeah.

2792
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:09,200
There was some screaming
and he was on Meth,

2793
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,700
the adult rent.

2794
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:14,120
He was apparently a hypochondriac and he
took a bunch of different medications.

2795
01:07:14,121 --> 01:07:15,110
But one of them is he,

2796
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:15,963
he took math.

2797
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:16,670
Oh Wow.

2798
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,150
Yeah.

2799
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,110
Which totally makes sense.

2800
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:18,410
Right.

2801
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,190
That was the,

2802
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:22,130
one of the things they say with math
is that a completely corroded your

2803
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:22,700
judgment.

2804
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,230
Your judgment just goes out the window.

2805
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,250
He just killed Jews.

2806
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,173
Each kills

2807
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,130
those crazy speeches.

2808
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:32,480
He's probably meth to the tits.

2809
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,140
Wow.

2810
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,940
Probably didn't have any nerves at all.

2811
01:07:34,941 --> 01:07:38,600
That's why he was so intense and fucking
hair flopping around furious anger in

2812
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:39,140
his eyes.

2813
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:39,973
Yeah.

2814
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:40,680
That's,

2815
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,513
you watch one of his,

2816
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:41,930
yeah,

2817
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:44,450
Hitler was on crystal meth and I crazy.

2818
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,651
What's that website?

2819
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:46,484
Is that USA Today?

2820
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:47,160
Yeah.

2821
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:47,993
Well,

2822
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:50,000
according to a 47 page,

2823
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:50,940
I can't read that bull.

2824
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:51,220
Same.

2825
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:51,710
Sorry.

2826
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,820
Military dossier.

2827
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,800
He used to take bull semen,

2828
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:55,401
morphine,

2829
01:07:55,401 --> 01:07:56,360
tranquilizers,

2830
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,230
bull semen.

2831
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,800
Hmm.

2832
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,940
I don't think that did anything for him.

2833
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,350
But the crystal Meth,

2834
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,940
a pill that contain crystal meth and
other drugs depending on Hitler's.

2835
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:08,030
Have you ever seen a Kevorkian art?

2836
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,223
No.

2837
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,000
It's fucking crazy.

2838
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:11,451
He is.

2839
01:08:11,451 --> 01:08:12,180
Fuck.

2840
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,013
Well,

2841
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:13,860
you'd imagine.

2842
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:14,510
Yeah,

2843
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:17,840
but like makes you sort of
rethink like his motivation.

2844
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:19,430
Have you ever seen George Bushes aren't?

2845
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:20,240
Yes.

2846
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,200
It's fucking awesome.

2847
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,900
Him looking in the mirror.

2848
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:24,734
Have you seen that one?

2849
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,150
Looking at Kevorkian art.

2850
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,490
Pull up some of the more dark,

2851
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:30,140
it's all like death stuff,

2852
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,660
which is really kind of fucked up man.

2853
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,200
It's like he was really into like,

2854
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:37,543
wow.

2855
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:37,940
Yeah.

2856
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,773
Oh my God,

2857
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,150
look at that man.

2858
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:42,440
That's like demonic shit.

2859
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,190
It's a guy being pulled into the abyss
and you see eyeballs behind him and

2860
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:46,910
stuff.

2861
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:47,660
Jesus.

2862
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,820
But there's some other ones that
are even more disturbing than that,

2863
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:50,510
Jamie.

2864
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,510
There's like some like
dead body ones and shit.

2865
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:53,981
Don't get it.

2866
01:08:53,981 --> 01:08:54,171
Like,

2867
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:54,740
look at this.

2868
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,573
Look at this one.

2869
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,500
What the fuck is this man?

2870
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,633
Look at this.

2871
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,010
So Dude's sitting at a plate,

2872
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,090
a at a dinner.

2873
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:03,980
Guys went on the blitz going on here.

2874
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:04,814
It's okay.

2875
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,833
Zoom up again.

2876
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,720
It's just good to see the whole thing.

2877
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,890
It's a Roman soldier.

2878
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:10,611
He's smirking.

2879
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:10,970
He's,

2880
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:11,780
um,

2881
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,613
he's,

2882
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,560
the guy has his head to capitated.

2883
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,100
There's a bowl of what?

2884
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,270
Jewish stars,

2885
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,260
the Star of David.

2886
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:22,280
And then there's like what the f and the
salt and pepper Shaker or like rocket

2887
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:22,581
ships.

2888
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:23,361
Is that what's going on?

2889
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:24,194
Fucking crazy.

2890
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:25,640
The guy's got an apple,

2891
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:26,990
the guy's head is cut off.

2892
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:27,651
It's on a plate.

2893
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:28,910
There's an apple in his mouth.

2894
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:29,661
Okay.

2895
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:30,710
So let me ask you,

2896
01:09:30,711 --> 01:09:31,544
Joe,

2897
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,693
you,

2898
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,300
you have your show where you get
drunk and you critique UFC fights.

2899
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,490
You have this show you all
these forms of expression,

2900
01:09:38,491 --> 01:09:39,324
you have to stand up,

2901
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:40,830
stand up comedy every night.

2902
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,370
Do you think like art is like the best?

2903
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,520
Like not for like uh,

2904
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,040
like monetizing reasons
or fans or whatever.

2905
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,160
Just when I draw something and I expressed
them and I don't have to like write

2906
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:54,900
literally and I just go wow.

2907
01:09:54,901 --> 01:09:55,280
And that,

2908
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,580
that fucking breast stroke,

2909
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,380
it captures exactly what's going on.

2910
01:09:58,650 --> 01:09:59,850
Isn't that like the best feeling?

2911
01:09:59,851 --> 01:10:02,190
Like I don't know what's going
on in the Kevorkian Shit,

2912
01:10:02,191 --> 01:10:03,710
but that must guy,

2913
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,740
it must have had so much shit that like
that release of like painting shit like

2914
01:10:07,741 --> 01:10:08,551
that is just like,

2915
01:10:08,551 --> 01:10:09,810
it's so therapeutic to me.

2916
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:10,441
Like yeah,

2917
01:10:10,441 --> 01:10:13,440
there's definitely something beautiful
about creating something cause you know

2918
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:16,500
that like it didn't exist before
you put your attention to it.

2919
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:20,490
You put your attention to that piece of
paper or that piece of clay or whatever

2920
01:10:20,491 --> 01:10:21,900
you're creating and you,

2921
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,740
you made something out of
it and it existed because
you put your attention to it

2922
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,140
and whatever it is inside of you,

2923
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:28,830
right?

2924
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:29,281
Whatever.

2925
01:10:29,281 --> 01:10:31,590
Creativity is undefined,

2926
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,360
you're,

2927
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,010
you're God creating
something out of nothing.

2928
01:10:34,011 --> 01:10:34,310
You know,

2929
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,380
like there's nothing
here and you create it.

2930
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:39,320
And then like just not
to harp on it or sound,

2931
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:40,430
you know,

2932
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,460
it's just with the young people,

2933
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:43,671
you know,

2934
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:46,820
cause I'm sure young people talk
to you all the time and I don't,

2935
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:48,290
I don't want to sound delusional saying,

2936
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:48,471
oh,

2937
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:49,970
it's easy for you or guys like Joe.

2938
01:10:49,971 --> 01:10:54,860
But the saddest thing is when you enslave
yourself at such a young age and throw

2939
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:56,120
yourself into like,

2940
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:56,451
yes,

2941
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:58,370
there's people that need
to be parking meter cops,

2942
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:01,340
there's people that need to
be working at an ad agency,

2943
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:02,660
but it doesn't need to be you.

2944
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:03,860
It doesn't need to be me,

2945
01:11:03,861 --> 01:11:06,260
but it needs to be the person who's
listening to me that I'm saying it doesn't

2946
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:06,771
need to be you.

2947
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:07,610
It doesn't need to be you.

2948
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,960
There's a lot of fucking people,

2949
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:09,290
man.

2950
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:09,920
Right.

2951
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,960
And somebody will fall prey to that trap.

2952
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:12,411
This is,

2953
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:14,070
this is like my best advice on

2954
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,611
that whole thing.

2955
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:15,180
It's,

2956
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:15,420
yeah,

2957
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,590
there's people that fall in that trap.

2958
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:17,880
It's like you're young,

2959
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:21,240
you can fuck up and you'll still
be young like and then try again.

2960
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:24,000
And it's like I get,

2961
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:24,540
you know,

2962
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,430
I'm sure you have a lot of
people that are like your fans.

2963
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:26,730
They go,

2964
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:27,590
you did it and I,

2965
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,690
you're my idol and I worship you
and this and that and so you did it.

2966
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:32,100
So that makes me feel like I can do it.

2967
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,660
And my whole thing with that is

2968
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,860
like the whole like follow your dreams,

2969
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:39,210
definitely follow your dreams.

2970
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,800
You know like definitely go for it.

2971
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:41,820
Like your dreams and everything.

2972
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:44,580
But like what gets my dick really hard,

2973
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:49,230
it's like when I'm at Ihub and the guy
takes my pancake order and he's like,

2974
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:49,801
you know,

2975
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:51,630
we have three new
different syrups for that.

2976
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:52,860
And like if you do this,

2977
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:53,700
that's a better combo.

2978
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,280
And he knows his job and he runs
to get me the syrup and I'm like,

2979
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,080
this guy maybe doesn't want to be,

2980
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,000
I hope a waiter for his whole life,

2981
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,110
but the time he's here,

2982
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:02,700
he's passionate about it.

2983
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:05,130
He's bringing all of his energy to it.

2984
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:08,580
And then if I hop waiters and
ultimately what ends up doing,

2985
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:09,660
he's going to bring that,

2986
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,050
you know,

2987
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:10,883
it's like just,

2988
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:11,873
I like it.

2989
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,230
Try to do,

2990
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,910
not everyone's going
to be the best artist.

2991
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:17,180
Not everyone's going to be the best actor.

2992
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:17,570
Not every.

2993
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:21,300
It's like so when your dreams
get crushed or you know,

2994
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:25,380
it's like be fucking awesome at your job
even if it's not what you like wanted

2995
01:12:25,381 --> 01:12:25,741
to do.

2996
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:26,574
And then like,

2997
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:27,540
I don't know,

2998
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,510
I think about chefs a lot now because I'm
friends with a lot of celebrity chefs.

2999
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:33,270
That's not a fucking that you're serving.

3000
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:34,630
You make food for people.

3001
01:12:34,631 --> 01:12:36,240
That's not a glamorous thing,

3002
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:40,140
which like my friends like David Chang
and board and it's becoming more glam

3003
01:12:40,141 --> 01:12:42,630
because they took a shitty
job where it's like,

3004
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:43,380
fuck,

3005
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:47,370
I got to stand on my feet and where
these weird clog shoes all day and all

3006
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:47,560
these,

3007
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,080
Eh,

3008
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,650
this is too salty and take it back.

3009
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,820
It's like a shitty job.

3010
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,110
You're like a servant.

3011
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,010
But they took that job and
they made it glamorous.

3012
01:12:56,011 --> 01:12:59,580
They fucking brought their fucking
rockstar passion energy to it.

3013
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:00,450
And now it's like,

3014
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:01,171
you know,

3015
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:02,490
I went to a chef convention,

3016
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:02,850
uh,

3017
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:03,241
this thing,

3018
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:06,220
mad symposium in Copenhagen and I,

3019
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:11,160
I mean there's guys with like knife
tattoos and weird facial piercings and I'm

3020
01:13:11,161 --> 01:13:11,310
like,

3021
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:13,350
is this like a rockstar
convention or something?

3022
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:14,790
And so there are artists.

3023
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:15,151
Well,

3024
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:15,600
yeah,

3025
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,830
and they brought that to that.

3026
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:17,940
And so I'm just like,

3027
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,040
be fucking dope at your job,

3028
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:20,780
whatever it is.

3029
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:22,890
I think being a chef is being an artist.

3030
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:23,461
I really do.

3031
01:13:23,461 --> 01:13:28,170
I think it's cuisine is a form of art
and the different flavors that you can

3032
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:29,670
definitely in someone's mouth,

3033
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:30,360
there's this,

3034
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,230
there's an art to that.

3035
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:31,530
Without it.

3036
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:36,530
I really learned that from
Bordain watching a show
and the passion that he has

3037
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:38,450
for it,

3038
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:39,060
like eat,

3039
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,020
it's contagious.

3040
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:40,520
It makes you,

3041
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:40,781
yeah,

3042
01:13:40,781 --> 01:13:43,350
guys like [inaudible] brought that
to that brought to your attention.

3043
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:45,600
And so now it's like you
meet kids that are like,

3044
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,860
I want to be a chef when I grow up.

3045
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:47,694
And it's like that,

3046
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,410
that really didn't exist before.

3047
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,244
You know,

3048
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,280
everybody has something
that they're really into.

3049
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:55,080
Some people are really into riding horses.

3050
01:13:55,081 --> 01:13:56,910
I couldn't give a fuck
about riding horses.

3051
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,590
Some people are really into,

3052
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,161
you know,

3053
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:00,030
fill in the blank.

3054
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,210
Right?

3055
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:05,210
So it's a matter of what your personality
fits best with and trying to pursue

3056
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:06,240
it.

3057
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,200
One of the most insidious things where
it happens to young kids is not just the

3058
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:12,310
compromising early and
falling into a slave

3059
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,383
job.

3060
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,310
It's being saddled with debt,

3061
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,120
right?

3062
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,580
Being saddled with debt right off the bat,

3063
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,640
that it happens so fucking often,

3064
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,060
man.

3065
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,400
Right?

3066
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,400
So often kids go to school and then they
accrue fucking $300,000 in school debt

3067
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,340
and then they get out and they're fucked.

3068
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,100
They're slaying.

3069
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,350
They almost did it to themselves.

3070
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:32,720
Yeah.

3071
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,020
Well,

3072
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,250
like someone will tell them like,

3073
01:14:34,251 --> 01:14:34,650
look,

3074
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,400
college is in four years now
it's more like five to six years.

3075
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,820
You're going to be like a quarter mill
in the hole when you get out and we're

3076
01:14:40,821 --> 01:14:42,980
not going to teach you anything here
that's going to teach you how to make

3077
01:14:42,981 --> 01:14:43,430
money.

3078
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:46,280
You're just going to know
a lot about psychology,

3079
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:50,200
especially if you're doing something
technologically paced by the time you get

3080
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:51,610
out years later.

3081
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:52,901
Yeah,

3082
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:54,610
and a lot of these professors
are like dinosaurs.

3083
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:57,010
They're like teaching you some
shit that's like irrelevant now.

3084
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,030
Yeah,

3085
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:59,440
there's a lot of that for sure.

3086
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:03,760
And it's just also the idea of wanting
to figure out what you want to do with

3087
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:05,870
your life and having
to choose at 18 right?

3088
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,050
You're a baby when you're 18 years old,

3089
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:08,980
you're a baby,

3090
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:09,241
you're,

3091
01:15:09,241 --> 01:15:09,481
you're,

3092
01:15:09,481 --> 01:15:11,950
you've only been alive for 18 years.

3093
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:12,581
That's enough.

3094
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:15,100
It's not even anything
is your first and your,

3095
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,950
the last couple of years is the first
year you've been able to make your own

3096
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:18,660
decisions.

3097
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:19,240
Right.

3098
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,120
And all of a sudden you have to
choose the course of your life.

3099
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:23,230
Then you've got your parents harping,

3100
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:23,321
I,

3101
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:23,950
David,

3102
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,540
you should be a Dr. David,

3103
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:26,590
who should be a lawyer.

3104
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:27,550
David,

3105
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,301
you should do this.

3106
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:29,430
You should do that for the,

3107
01:15:29,431 --> 01:15:31,150
for the immigrant experience
a little bit hard.

3108
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,013
I mean every,

3109
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,570
well everyone who was an
American as an immigrant,

3110
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:37,850
so it's like that is that experience,

3111
01:15:37,851 --> 01:15:39,400
the guilt level for the Koreans.

3112
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:44,401
It's like I escaped from North Korea
for you to stick a gun in a girl's butt

3113
01:15:46,831 --> 01:15:47,664
hole and like,

3114
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:48,160
you know,

3115
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:48,821
they use that.

3116
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:52,000
They're like the tanks
and the fucking bombs.

3117
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:54,760
I had to dodge for you to
come here and do Hong Dynasty.

3118
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,440
Like did your family
come from North Korea?

3119
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:56,801
No,

3120
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:57,634
but I didn't say that.

3121
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,660
That's more dramatic.

3122
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,250
I'm sure someone,

3123
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:00,751
no,

3124
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:01,190
but you know,

3125
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:03,460
my dad was the fucking crazy escape story.

3126
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:04,271
My mom has it too.

3127
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:05,104
It's like,

3128
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,071
it's nuts,

3129
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:06,550
you know?

3130
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,620
And um,

3131
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,190
since you brought up debt,

3132
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:10,810
can I speak for it for one second?

3133
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,410
Like,

3134
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:12,243
but up debt,

3135
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:13,900
being in debt or whatever.

3136
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:16,200
So I used to,

3137
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:17,860
I used to do this show a thumbs up.

3138
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:20,830
I just did the fourth season a year ago.

3139
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,760
It's still not out yet.

3140
01:16:21,761 --> 01:16:22,750
But what is it?

3141
01:16:22,751 --> 01:16:25,390
It's just me hitchhiking across
America is still not out.

3142
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:25,720
It's,

3143
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,080
well,

3144
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,140
it's three seasons of it are out on vice
and then the fourth one is like still

3145
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:30,160
being edited or whatever.

3146
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:35,490
It's the whole premise of the show is
hitchhike from once point a to point B.

3147
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:36,693
Um,

3148
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:38,650
and you can't spend money on any,

3149
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,190
anything.

3150
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,660
Like it's just to show,

3151
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:41,801
Oh man,

3152
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:42,760
I'd love to have your life.

3153
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:43,481
I'd love to travel.

3154
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:43,691
I'm like,

3155
01:16:43,691 --> 01:16:45,130
I've been hitchhiking since I was 15.

3156
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,260
I've only almost got raped twice.

3157
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:47,920
That's it.

3158
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,060
That's the worst that's ever happened.

3159
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:49,983
Oh Man.

3160
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,000
Almost knock.

3161
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,200
How close a finger in
the blood doesn't count,

3162
01:16:53,201 --> 01:16:53,530
right?

3163
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:53,771
No,

3164
01:16:53,771 --> 01:16:54,604
I'm kidding.

3165
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:55,960
Or Am I,

3166
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,710
uh,

3167
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:57,550
so it's just,

3168
01:16:57,551 --> 01:16:57,910
you know,

3169
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:58,181
it's,

3170
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:02,710
it's weird now because I'm rich and I'm
on the side of the road begging for a

3171
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:03,240
ride.

3172
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:03,670
Um,

3173
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:04,930
but when I got to Detroit,

3174
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:06,213
um,

3175
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:06,610
basically,

3176
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:06,881
well here,

3177
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:07,714
let me just show you guys.

3178
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:09,050
I'm going to there,

3179
01:17:09,051 --> 01:17:10,250
I'm gonna bring out visual restaurants.

3180
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,060
Hadn't that bag.

3181
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,170
This is a Harry Kim.

3182
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,490
He's my partner on a,

3183
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,590
on a thumbs up or show.

3184
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,480
So you got a bag with his face on it.

3185
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,040
Yeah.

3186
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:18,370
Okay.

3187
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,203
Well I love him.

3188
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:20,121
You met,

3189
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:20,780
you had this made,

3190
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,490
so here's $100,000.

3191
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,710
This is a hundred thousand real dollars.

3192
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:24,831
Yeah,

3193
01:17:24,831 --> 01:17:25,880
there's a hundred thousand real dollars.

3194
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,530
I never felt $100,000 before.

3195
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,051
Oh Shit.

3196
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:28,670
It's Kinda heavy.

3197
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:29,390
Yeah.

3198
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,560
Damn fat bricks.

3199
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:36,380
I like,

3200
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,100
I like hip hop.

3201
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:37,520
Uh,

3202
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:37,970
Joe.

3203
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,660
Uh,

3204
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:43,660
so what I like to gamble
and when I got to Detroit,

3205
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:46,730
I didn't realize there was an MGM there.

3206
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,650
There's like MGM casino there.

3207
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,870
And so in the middle of filming,

3208
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:51,261
thumbs up,

3209
01:17:51,261 --> 01:17:52,094
season four,

3210
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,110
you know,

3211
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:53,330
I,

3212
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,950
I won 10 grand at the casino like,

3213
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,280
and what do I,

3214
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,071
what do I need that for?

3215
01:17:58,071 --> 01:17:58,700
You know,

3216
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,440
so I've,

3217
01:17:59,440 --> 01:17:59,960
I've never,

3218
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:04,220
I've never been in Detroit before or I
haven't been in Detroit and I don't know,

3219
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,150
since I was 15,

3220
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,730
you could buy Detroit for 10
grand and it looks horrible.

3221
01:18:07,731 --> 01:18:08,181
It's pretty bad.

3222
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:09,830
And I've been to these
third world countries,

3223
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,580
people like,

3224
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,001
Oh man,

3225
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,200
look it like Bosnia.

3226
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:12,711
And I'm like,

3227
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:13,880
look at America,

3228
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,710
it looks horrible.

3229
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,851
And I couldn't believe,

3230
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:19,760
I was so shocked by it because
you've heard stories about it.

3231
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:20,780
And I was like,

3232
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,970
I got filled with so much emotion.

3233
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:23,451
I was like,

3234
01:18:23,451 --> 01:18:23,630
you know,

3235
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:24,650
I'm just gonna hide this money.

3236
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,880
And I just like threw it
and like I hit it around,

3237
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,380
you know,

3238
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,900
like in like shitty areas
and just put up a tweet.

3239
01:18:29,901 --> 01:18:30,111
I said,

3240
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:30,321
hey,

3241
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:32,330
I just hit 10,000 in Detroit.

3242
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:33,493
And it's like,

3243
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,570
I heard about a guy doing that
in San Francisco and he's like,

3244
01:18:35,571 --> 01:18:35,841
Hey,

3245
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:36,441
if you find it,

3246
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:36,831
tweet it.

3247
01:18:36,831 --> 01:18:38,390
And it's like this big
social media experience.

3248
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:38,631
I'm like,

3249
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,010
I'm not doing a social media experience.

3250
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,173
I'm just like,

3251
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:41,840
Hey,

3252
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,010
I'm fucking hiding money.

3253
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:47,240
And then like I just walk around the
block and I tell all the homeless people,

3254
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:47,391
Hey,

3255
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:50,480
I just like through like 10 grand
and if you guys want to look for it,

3256
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:51,140
you know,

3257
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:52,490
and so that just give him the money.

3258
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:53,600
Why make it a fucking game?

3259
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:54,891
That's true.

3260
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:55,724
I don't know.

3261
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,133
Games are fun.

3262
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:57,560
You don't,

3263
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:57,861
people are like,

3264
01:18:57,861 --> 01:18:58,580
I don't want to play games.

3265
01:18:58,580 --> 01:18:58,791
I'm like,

3266
01:18:58,791 --> 01:18:59,241
I love playing.

3267
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:00,074
Games are fun.

3268
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:00,861
So anyways,

3269
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,180
the people who found the money,

3270
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:03,880
I'm sure it didn't tweet
about it and they're like,

3271
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,440
Eh,

3272
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:04,760
the,

3273
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,200
the backlash comes quickly.

3274
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:09,390
You fucking piece of Shit fucking
with poor people like that,

3275
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,050
this and that.

3276
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:10,390
I'm like,

3277
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,880
what?

3278
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,200
Because you didn't find the money,

3279
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:13,460
you know,

3280
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:17,420
so would it be fucking with people if
you said that you hid the money and who

3281
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:17,810
didn't?

3282
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:18,770
That's what they're implying.

3283
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,401
I'm like,

3284
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:19,631
what?

3285
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:20,421
Why would I do that?

3286
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:21,350
That's dumb,

3287
01:19:21,351 --> 01:19:21,591
you know?

3288
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:23,030
So I,

3289
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,560
well I like fucking with people,

3290
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:26,930
but whenever I do shit with money,

3291
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:27,620
I just get,

3292
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:27,870
you know,

3293
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:28,371
just give it away.

3294
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:28,730
I don't,

3295
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,810
I don't want to fuck with,

3296
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:30,201

3297
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:30,441

3298
01:19:30,441 --> 01:19:31,960
here's a hundred had to get away.

3299
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:32,181
I'm like,

3300
01:19:32,181 --> 01:19:33,020
I'm not doing that.

3301
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,630
So I'm a hoarder.

3302
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,530
I don't know if you know that.

3303
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:37,210
Yeah.

3304
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:37,510
My,

3305
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:38,000
my,

3306
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,510
the House that I live in is actually
half the size of this room and I've lived

3307
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:43,430
there for 15 years and it's just,

3308
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,740
people don't understand
it cause they're like,

3309
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:50,270
you could live in a like a fucking
mansion and have your own island and

3310
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,571
whatever.

3311
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:51,020
And I'm like,

3312
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:51,321
yeah,

3313
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:52,850
but I don't care.

3314
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,660
You know,

3315
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,800
so I haven't gambled since like,

3316
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,180
you know,

3317
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:59,870
since I went to Rehab for gamble gambling
and had my heart attack and all that

3318
01:19:59,871 --> 01:20:00,260
stuff,

3319
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,250
when did this happen?

3320
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,920
35 so three years ago now,

3321
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,510
he went to Rehab for gambling.

3322
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:06,650
I couldn't stop man.

3323
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:07,350
And,

3324
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,640
and,

3325
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,720
and what they had done with the limits,

3326
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:10,891
because in Vegas,

3327
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:11,461
like the most,

3328
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:12,630
you can bet on certain things.

3329
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:15,870
It's like 25,000 a hand on
blackjack or whatever is,

3330
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:18,690
they raised it for me because they knew
how much money I was worth and I could

3331
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:20,400
bet a quarter million a hand on project.

3332
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,520
So it could go pretty quickly.

3333
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:24,150
I mean,

3334
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:24,983
the shifts like,

3335
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:25,261
oh,

3336
01:20:25,261 --> 01:20:26,310
I just won 10 million.

3337
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:26,491
Oh,

3338
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:27,540
I just lost everything.

3339
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:27,811
You know,

3340
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:28,710
how much did you lose?

3341
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,200
This is where the mercury
poisoning comes in.

3342
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,520
Like the,

3343
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:37,650
the height of my Vegas experience was
like staying at the penthouse in every

3344
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:38,401
single casino.

3345
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:39,810
Like all the high roller casinos,

3346
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:44,010
a Harem of whores in each one and just
going downstairs and like winning 5

3347
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:44,490
million here.

3348
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,170
Going to like the next one,

3349
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:46,981
going upstairs.

3350
01:20:46,981 --> 01:20:48,270
Fucking like 10 girls in a row,

3351
01:20:48,271 --> 01:20:48,961
going downstairs,

3352
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:50,040
winning 10 grand.

3353
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,540
What's the most you've
ever paid a prostitute?

3354
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:52,920
Uh,

3355
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,170
the most money I ever paid a whore.

3356
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,633
Um,

3357
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,350
I like to say prostitute cause I'm classy.

3358
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:58,951
Oh sorry.

3359
01:20:58,951 --> 01:20:59,370
Sorry.

3360
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:00,330
Notice how I say that.

3361
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,410
The,

3362
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:03,680
the,

3363
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,513
the,

3364
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,960
the most I ever offered a sex worker was,

3365
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,250
um,

3366
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,083
10 grand.

3367
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,953
She wasn't,

3368
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,251
this is a,

3369
01:21:11,251 --> 01:21:12,510
this is some vampire shit.

3370
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,240
This is like when
someone's not a sex worker.

3371
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:15,691
Yeah.

3372
01:21:15,691 --> 01:21:16,051
It's like,

3373
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:16,470
hey,

3374
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,220
like,

3375
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,000
hey,

3376
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,311
not in.

3377
01:21:18,311 --> 01:21:20,250
The Asian guys don't
want to fuck you at all.

3378
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,820
Like I have no desire to fuck
you and you're really crass.

3379
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,440
You're a Douche bag your crude.

3380
01:21:25,441 --> 01:21:25,711
And I go,

3381
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:26,011
okay.

3382
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:26,844
So since,

3383
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,620
since I'm not denying any of that,

3384
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:31,080
um,

3385
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,580
so this is real money.

3386
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:33,810
Like this isn't a joke.

3387
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:34,980
Like I'll,

3388
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,251
you know,

3389
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:35,820
I'm going to,

3390
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,260
I'm going to turn you into a horror.

3391
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:38,323
I'm sorry,

3392
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,600
I'm going to turn you into a sex worker.

3393
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,340
Did you say that to her?

3394
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:40,500
Yeah,

3395
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,790
it's actually all in this book.

3396
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:42,931
Oh yeah.

3397
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:43,200
This,

3398
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,490
this book is all water colors and the
text messages with women that people have

3399
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,770
no idea that cause they don't believe me.

3400
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:50,910
See my color chart here,

3401
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:54,240
it tells you what you are
stripper or a single mom,

3402
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,293
like whatever.

3403
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,500
Can I read one just to
show him my favorite one?

3404
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:02,820
Did it with text messages?

3405
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:07,910
We converted or you did it I to I uh oh
this one was a telephone because I met

3406
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:10,410
her.

3407
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,190
This is a,

3408
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:13,620
this is a text message
between me and a billionaire.

3409
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,340
Okay.

3410
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:14,911
I like,

3411
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:16,710
at some point I just stopped
selling my paintings.

3412
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:17,360
I was like,

3413
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,510
I just either give them to freedom,

3414
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:22,260
my friends or you can look it up for
free on Instagram or you can buy my books

3415
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:24,690
that are cheap or you can go
out and look at the murals.

3416
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,770
I did like I didn't,

3417
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:28,980
I'm not on this planet to make
really expensive art for rich people.

3418
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:29,750
You know,

3419
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:30,583
so this guy like,

3420
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:31,850
and you tell a rich guy,

3421
01:22:31,851 --> 01:22:32,790
he can't buy a painting.

3422
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,713
He's like,

3423
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:34,831
yeah,

3424
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:35,251
how much?

3425
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:36,360
So I write to him,

3426
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:37,591
he goes,

3427
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:38,880
I don't know how much higher I can go.

3428
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,800
180,000 is my final offer.

3429
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:42,180
I don't know what else you want.

3430
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,250
No response for me.

3431
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:44,671
Okay,

3432
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:45,060
okay,

3433
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:45,870
I get it.

3434
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,860
You don't care about money,

3435
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,450
but I saw you hit it off with my wife.

3436
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:49,284
How much,

3437
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,690
how much did that for
a night with her and I,

3438
01:22:51,691 --> 01:22:52,050
right.

3439
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:52,411
I don't know.

3440
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:53,244
Let me get my,

3441
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,800
let me get her lips off my Dick
Right now and I'll ask her.

3442
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:59,760
So it's like this is shit that
happens that like people are like,

3443
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:00,571
no it didn't.

3444
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:01,620
And so he has,

3445
01:23:01,621 --> 01:23:01,950
he got,

3446
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:02,850
is he playing,

3447
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,410
I mean is this guy serious?

3448
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:05,244
Is he playing around?

3449
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,200
You know like when you get
to that level of money,

3450
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:12,790
like I know rich guys that like pay
dudes to fuck their wives and like just,

3451
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:13,421
it gets weird,

3452
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,050
you know,

3453
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:14,231
hey,

3454
01:23:14,231 --> 01:23:15,064
I was getting there.

3455
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,390
Tell me about this girl,

3456
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:17,470
this $10,000 girl.

3457
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,510
So she's doesn't believe me.

3458
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,430
And then I take a picture,

3459
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:21,611
I go,

3460
01:23:21,611 --> 01:23:23,110
I'm holding 10 grand right now.

3461
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:23,951
And she goes,

3462
01:23:23,951 --> 01:23:24,401
fuck you.

3463
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:27,280
You piece of shit like you think
you think like you can buy me.

3464
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,183
I go,

3465
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:28,901
all right,

3466
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:29,111
fine.

3467
01:23:29,111 --> 01:23:29,800
Whatever.

3468
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,880
I don't think much about it.

3469
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:33,560
She calls me two months
later and the text is months,

3470
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:35,410
two months later and
that whatever happens,

3471
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,780
whatever happened in her life or whatever,

3472
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:38,950
two months goes by.

3473
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,090
I Dunno.

3474
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:40,540
Month maybe,

3475
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:40,840
I don't know.

3476
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,340
I have no idea that the text is,

3477
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,200
is the offer still good?

3478
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,630
I don't even know who the girl is.

3479
01:23:46,631 --> 01:23:47,050
I go,

3480
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:47,883
who is this and what?

3481
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:48,730
What are you talking about?

3482
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,020
She calls me and she goes,

3483
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:52,390
you offering me 10 years and I go,

3484
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,260
no,

3485
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:56,230
it's five grand now you piece.

3486
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:56,501
I go,

3487
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:58,440
I offered you 10 grand
when I was horniest.

3488
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,230
Then I was like,

3489
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:01,090
I was playing a game and
I wanted it that bad.

3490
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:01,924
I'm like,

3491
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,120
I'm like no vagina.

3492
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,040
The most any man should ever
pay for a vagina is two grand,

3493
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,750
like most the most like,

3494
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:11,610
you know,

3495
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:13,810
but what about that Robert
Redford movie with Demi Moore?

3496
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:15,363
They should,

3497
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,500
they should remake it with the two grand.

3498
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:22,060
It's like I played this game.

3499
01:24:22,061 --> 01:24:22,930
It's says dumb game,

3500
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:23,530
but you know,

3501
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:25,300
I've played with awesome
people in our show.

3502
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:29,860
It's like someone who's not a
horror person who has a regular job.

3503
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,470
Bartender fucking,

3504
01:24:32,471 --> 01:24:32,801
I don't know,

3505
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,310
something where you make like you're,

3506
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,340
you're middle class.

3507
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,350
What does it cost for a
person who's not a prostitute,

3508
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:42,483
who is single,

3509
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,400
who has a normal job to
just go up to them and go,

3510
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,380
I will pay any amount
of money to fuck you.

3511
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:49,330
Is it the Robert Redford
movie isn't a million?

3512
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:52,450
And like I go for normal chick,

3513
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,350
like,

3514
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,651
I don't know,

3515
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:54,371
20 grand,

3516
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:55,270
maybe 10 grants,

3517
01:24:55,271 --> 01:24:55,851
30 grand,

3518
01:24:55,851 --> 01:24:56,420
something like,

3519
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:59,140
as long as they know that no one's going
to find that and no one will ever find

3520
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:01,900
out did it someone to shame.

3521
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,170
Right.

3522
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:05,860
And that's the real problem with the
whole idea of prostitution is the shame.

3523
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,330
And every girl I asked,

3524
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,201
they're like,

3525
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:08,561
I dunno,

3526
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:09,250
five grand,

3527
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:09,851
three grand,

3528
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:10,361
two grand.

3529
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,990
I'm like,

3530
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:11,471
Whoa,

3531
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:12,910
I shot it way too high.

3532
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:15,640
Like all the guys always say
something like 20 and up,

3533
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:16,180
right?

3534
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,200
All the girls that are,

3535
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:18,670
maybe it's the women and all the guys.

3536
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:20,110
If you want to fuck the guy.

3537
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:21,101
No,

3538
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:21,161
no,

3539
01:25:21,161 --> 01:25:21,400
no.

3540
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,330
When I asked guys,

3541
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,510
what do you think the
number was now this girl,

3542
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,130
when you said now it's five grand,

3543
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:27,791
what'd she say?

3544
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:28,750
Then she said,

3545
01:25:28,751 --> 01:25:29,620
go fuck yourself.

3546
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,940
Then she didn't have no,

3547
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:34,420
then she called me back and then she came
and she fucked me and then she didn't

3548
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,940
take the money and she left
and I thought she'd forgotten.

3549
01:25:36,941 --> 01:25:37,211
I said,

3550
01:25:37,211 --> 01:25:38,044
hey,

3551
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:38,891
you didn't take the money.

3552
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:39,511
It's still on the thing.

3553
01:25:39,511 --> 01:25:39,821
She said,

3554
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:44,821
go fuck yourself and then we have a weird
and we still fuck now we have a weird

3555
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:45,660
relationship.

3556
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:50,650
Good kid giving out freebies
basically attracted to you.

3557
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:51,430
I don't know.

3558
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,263
I'm sort of a strange,

3559
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,830
this is the worst answer,

3560
01:25:53,831 --> 01:25:55,300
but when you say what's
the most ever paid?

3561
01:25:55,301 --> 01:25:56,920
It's with my soul and time.

3562
01:25:56,970 --> 01:25:58,790
Like I mean money.

3563
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,610
When money's no object for me,

3564
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:04,910
it's when people wasting my fucking time
and they play games with me and they

3565
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:06,080
suck my life force out.

3566
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:07,310
That's what cost me the most.

3567
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:07,710
No,

3568
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:11,700
I want to get into something with you
because you were involved in this gigantic

3569
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:12,750
fucking controversy,

3570
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,080
right?

3571
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,580
And knowing you,

3572
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:19,320
I know you and I know the
way you communicate and I
know the way you fuck around

3573
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:21,690
with things and the way
you talk about things.

3574
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:27,050
You told a story on your podcast DVD
asa about getting a massage therapist to

3575
01:26:28,321 --> 01:26:29,310
give you a blow job,

3576
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:29,880
right?

3577
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,680
And by forcing her head on face,

3578
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:33,320
face face,

3579
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,350
fucking her face,

3580
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:35,160
fuck.

3581
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:38,580
And everybody decided
that you were a rapist,

3582
01:26:38,581 --> 01:26:41,130
that you had raped her and that you know,

3583
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:41,890
you,

3584
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:46,110
you faced this massive
amount of backlash online.

3585
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:46,711
All right.

3586
01:26:46,711 --> 01:26:47,150
Well

3587
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:47,983
of all like,

3588
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:53,390
because I do the news like for
vice or vice and to see like if I,

3589
01:26:53,391 --> 01:26:56,810
if I interview a Norwegian general
or something and he says something,

3590
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,610
we fact check it.

3591
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:00,500
We fact check the fact and it's like,

3592
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:00,681
oh,

3593
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:01,340
okay.

3594
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:04,790
And then it's like we're presenting
ourselves as news people.

3595
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:06,890
It has to be accurate now.

3596
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:08,510
People who just like some,

3597
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:09,321
I don't know,

3598
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:10,250
like the TMZ,

3599
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:11,150
Paris Hilton,

3600
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:15,020
Perez Hilton type of shit where it's
like we heard this and then they just,

3601
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:15,854
it's all like,

3602
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,150
this guy's a piece of shit.

3603
01:27:17,151 --> 01:27:19,430
And it was just all gossip rumor stuff.

3604
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,070
I'm not even trying to defend myself.

3605
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:24,800
Like I totally fucked up on that end.

3606
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:25,490
My Shit,

3607
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,540
your shit is live.

3608
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,560
My Shit is not live.

3609
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:28,813
Um,

3610
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:30,860
when I record a show,

3611
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,160
I record usually five to six hours,

3612
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:37,460
three shows back to back
because we're not around a lot.

3613
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:40,910
And you really one a week.

3614
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,290
Well yeah,

3615
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,690
we did two a week for a year and a half.

3616
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:45,830
And then it's like,

3617
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:48,260
hey,

3618
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,280
the show,

3619
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:50,690
I don't know,

3620
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,790
like I know the first time I came
on your show and you're like,

3621
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:54,320
I don't like to talk about
my wife for my family,

3622
01:27:54,321 --> 01:27:54,711
this and that.

3623
01:27:54,711 --> 01:27:56,120
And like that's where you draw the line.

3624
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:57,350
My thing is I don't have a line,

3625
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:00,260
like I'll talk about
anything and I noticed that,

3626
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:01,103
um,

3627
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:02,590
my,

3628
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:03,020
my life,

3629
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,360
I started to like lay
in true artists forum,

3630
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,090
be extremely self destructive.

3631
01:28:08,091 --> 01:28:11,420
Forget about like talking about
heads of companies and this and that.

3632
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:12,254
It's like,

3633
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:12,861
wow,

3634
01:28:12,861 --> 01:28:13,790
I'm really like,

3635
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,571
oh my God,

3636
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:16,070
this girl that I just met won't fuck me.

3637
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:19,310
Oh I heard you say horrible
stuff about like this and that.

3638
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,890
Like I'm throwing myself
under the bus constantly,

3639
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:22,280
you know,

3640
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,113
with my own show.

3641
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,630
And we'll you doing it to get a reaction
when you were doing all this stuff.

3642
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:30,200
Basically what happened was
my friend who's a lawyer said,

3643
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:30,711
dude,

3644
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:32,240
you're getting into a lot of trouble.

3645
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:33,980
And when I say so I'm like,

3646
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:36,020
here's a show I don't have to do at all.

3647
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:38,060
It's costing me money,

3648
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:38,953
time,

3649
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,411
headache.

3650
01:28:39,411 --> 01:28:41,270
There's like weird stalkers
hanging out outside,

3651
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:41,541
you know,

3652
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:43,070
it's like it was getting bad.

3653
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:43,760
Um,

3654
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,860
it was ruining my life and,

3655
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:46,851
and everyone's like,

3656
01:28:46,851 --> 01:28:47,661
why are you doing it?

3657
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:47,961
And I'm like,

3658
01:28:47,961 --> 01:28:48,681
cause it gets,

3659
01:28:48,681 --> 01:28:50,710
it feels good because it's
impulsive because I like it,

3660
01:28:50,711 --> 01:28:51,420
you know?

3661
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:51,790
Um,

3662
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,401
so he goes,

3663
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:52,671
look,

3664
01:28:52,671 --> 01:28:55,070
there's a lot of people that
you're talking about that,

3665
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:56,510
that they don't want
you to talk about them.

3666
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:56,870
Right.

3667
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:57,621
They have real lives.

3668
01:28:57,621 --> 01:28:58,520
They have real jobs.

3669
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:03,760
I'd say almost every like celebrity we've
had on our show is asked to take the

3670
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:06,600
show down or have it
ever did except for Joe.

3671
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,493
Joe was cool.

3672
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:08,400
Um,

3673
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:08,821
but,

3674
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:09,240
uh,

3675
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:09,631
he said,

3676
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:10,464
look,

3677
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,590
if you want to tell a story about like,

3678
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,980
let's say Michael Jordan,

3679
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:14,791
I don't know Michael Jordan,

3680
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:16,260
but like say you were
friends with Michael Jordan,

3681
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:21,261
you want to tell a story about Michael
Jordan and it's not say a famous white

3682
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:23,040
baseball player.

3683
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,660
So then it's like still a famous person,

3684
01:29:24,661 --> 01:29:25,110
you know,

3685
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,650
he's like changed the race if the
point of the story isn't who it is and,

3686
01:29:28,651 --> 01:29:29,640
but what happened,

3687
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:29,910
right.

3688
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:31,920
And change the race changed the,

3689
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:32,754
um,

3690
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,223
uh,

3691
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:38,800
when it happened and changed like as many
details without fucking up your story,

3692
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:39,643
you know?

3693
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:44,660
And so it was our third show of the
day and my show is like chaotic.

3694
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,091
I mean,

3695
01:29:45,091 --> 01:29:47,610
you've been on and there's like six
people talking over each other at the same

3696
01:29:47,611 --> 01:29:48,330
time.

3697
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:50,790
And I was trying to tell the story
and no one was opinion attention.

3698
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,050
And I don't listen.

3699
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,070
Like when this show ends,

3700
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:54,000
do you listen to yourself?

3701
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:54,360
No,

3702
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,620
I never listened to myself.

3703
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,720
And that was the one
time where I was like,

3704
01:29:57,721 --> 01:29:57,901
man,

3705
01:29:57,901 --> 01:29:58,800
these guys aren't listening.

3706
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,090
So I exaggerated a little eye every,

3707
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,550
all the bad shit that happened to me.

3708
01:30:02,551 --> 01:30:03,151
I deserved it.

3709
01:30:03,151 --> 01:30:06,180
I never should have told
the story the way I told it.

3710
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:08,490
I should've never like whatever.

3711
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:10,080
Okay,

3712
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:10,380
yeah.

3713
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:10,900
Anyways,

3714
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,340
I'm like,

3715
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:11,701
whatever.

3716
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:12,461
I'm not a rapist.

3717
01:30:12,461 --> 01:30:13,460
And so it was like,

3718
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:13,621
oh,

3719
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:14,490
that's what all rapists,

3720
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:14,660
they,

3721
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,930
I'm not a fucking rapist.

3722
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:17,220
Like I've never like,

3723
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,160
and then people started bumping
me in with Terry Richardson.

3724
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:20,820
I'm like,

3725
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:24,060
nobody came out of the woodwork because
I don't fucking treat people like that,

3726
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:24,870
you know?

3727
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:25,703
And it's like,

3728
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:27,061
oh,

3729
01:30:27,061 --> 01:30:27,930
he faced fucked her.

3730
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:28,764
I'm like,

3731
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:30,930
the number one thing,

3732
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:36,170
because I have been in prison five times
is everyone because of growing up with

3733
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:37,380
like these movies,

3734
01:30:37,381 --> 01:30:37,921
American meat,

3735
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:38,580
whatever.

3736
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,600
Whenever I go to jail is,

3737
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:40,434
I'm like,

3738
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,101
I'm not black.

3739
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:41,641
I'm not white.

3740
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:44,820
I'm the minority in prison who
someone's going to try to rape me,

3741
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,720
you know?

3742
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,010
So then I think then the,

3743
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:51,150
would you rather get fucked in
your mouth or your ass or you know,

3744
01:30:51,151 --> 01:30:53,220
like those kinds of questions and yeah,

3745
01:30:53,221 --> 01:30:54,390
I've been to prison five times.

3746
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:55,470
No one's ever tried to,

3747
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,340
I dunno,

3748
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:58,350
really tried to fuck my ass or face,

3749
01:30:58,351 --> 01:30:58,711
fuck me,

3750
01:30:58,711 --> 01:31:00,420
but disappoint you a little bit.

3751
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:01,260
I felt a little bit,

3752
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:01,650
you know,

3753
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:01,891
I'm like,

3754
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:02,460
come on,

3755
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,330
not a bad looking guy,

3756
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:05,130
but the show ended and uh,

3757
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,960
and my manager comes in and goes,

3758
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,640
do you ever listen to your own show?

3759
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:08,821
I go,

3760
01:31:08,821 --> 01:31:08,971
no.

3761
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:09,720
He goes,

3762
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,430
that was the worst sounding.

3763
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,031
Like,

3764
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:12,331
he goes,

3765
01:31:12,331 --> 01:31:13,150
I know you,

3766
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:13,550
you,

3767
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,520
you sort of exaggerated
and told that story weird.

3768
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:17,040
Like you should just cut that out.

3769
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:17,280
I'm like,

3770
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,390
well then I would be a hypocrite.

3771
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:20,370
Just put it out and no
one gives a shit anyways.

3772
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,301
Then,

3773
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:21,720
you know,

3774
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,650
like all these blog,

3775
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,960
gossiping bullshit and they
blow it out of proportion.

3776
01:31:24,961 --> 01:31:25,794
And I'm like,

3777
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:26,431
well,

3778
01:31:26,431 --> 01:31:28,260
the show that I created
in the first place,

3779
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:31,530
like what happened was I wouldn't the,

3780
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:32,970
when all this Facebook shit happen,

3781
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,730
I went on Howard stern where I
talked for two hours unedited.

3782
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:36,270
Right.

3783
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:37,103
And it was live.

3784
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:41,610
Then I went on Barbara Walters and she
butchered my thing and just took out like

3785
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,810
tidbits of pots.

3786
01:31:42,811 --> 01:31:43,290
Contact.

3787
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:43,531
Yeah.

3788
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:44,071
And I was like,

3789
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:44,761
fuck this.

3790
01:31:44,761 --> 01:31:49,200
I'm going to have my own show where no
one can ever fuck with me because it's

3791
01:31:49,201 --> 01:31:50,490
going to be from my perspective.

3792
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,800
And what I did was I fucking shot myself.

3793
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:54,263
I'm like the only,

3794
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:59,440
I'm the only person ever fucking person
in a sex scandal where there's no victim

3795
01:31:59,701 --> 01:32:00,534
except for myself.

3796
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,200
And I did it to myself.

3797
01:32:02,201 --> 01:32:03,034
I'm like,

3798
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,990
there's no fucking one coming forward.

3799
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:05,291
They're like,

3800
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:05,650
wait,

3801
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:06,670
the feminist is like,

3802
01:32:06,671 --> 01:32:09,700
wait til this chick comes forward and
we're going to all get behind her and pay

3803
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:11,620
her legal fees because Dave's rich.

3804
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:12,250
And I'm like,

3805
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,240
no one's coming forward.

3806
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:14,260
Like there's nobody there.

3807
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:15,094
It's like,

3808
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,510
like the girl likes me,

3809
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:18,670
I face fuck her like
every week now it's like,

3810
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,580
it's like face fucking is not rape.

3811
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:21,910
It's like,

3812
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:22,820
ah,

3813
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,673
it's like fun.

3814
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:27,400
Like you know what happens when
you don't want to face Facebook?

3815
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:28,780
Somebody you bite their dick off.

3816
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:29,560
That's what happens.

3817
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,240
Like that can happen.

3818
01:32:31,241 --> 01:32:32,074
That is an option.

3819
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:33,143
Um,

3820
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,080
so like when you were doing it,

3821
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:35,621
is it just,

3822
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:38,800
you just get caught up in the moment
and you just trying to be entertaining?

3823
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:43,720
Are you trying to to just to be
controversial and be exciting?

3824
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,793
I just got,

3825
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,460
I just got,

3826
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,380
I was really tired and this is like,

3827
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,910
this is exactly what happened.

3828
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:49,360
Everyone,

3829
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,480
no one that I was losing
control of the show and like,

3830
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:52,810
look,

3831
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:53,471
everyone always goes,

3832
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:54,460
why don't you just do your own show?

3833
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:55,690
You fucking talk forever.

3834
01:32:56,010 --> 01:32:56,310
Why?

3835
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:57,280
Why don't you do show like,

3836
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:57,970
you know,

3837
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,850
Adam Corolla or Joe's where it's just
like you and like one other person or two

3838
01:33:00,851 --> 01:33:01,280
other people.

3839
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,860
Why do you have like 10 guys on your show?

3840
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:03,610
You know?

3841
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:05,350
And so I was just losing
control of the show.

3842
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:05,951
It was tired.

3843
01:33:05,951 --> 01:33:06,850
It was late and I was like,

3844
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:10,840
I'm going to say something a little bit
more exaggerated so that bill perk up

3845
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:11,170
their ears,

3846
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:11,970
which it did.

3847
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:12,221
They're like,

3848
01:33:12,221 --> 01:33:13,054
oh,

3849
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,530
and then look,

3850
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:18,700
and then the shitstorm
started and it's like,

3851
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,493
I was like,

3852
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:21,310
well,

3853
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:21,941
who cares?

3854
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:22,780
Like I didn't do it.

3855
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:24,940
I didn't do anything
from their point of view.

3856
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:26,010
Of course,

3857
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:29,340
the point of view of people that are
listening to that and you know the,

3858
01:33:29,341 --> 01:33:32,590
the whole concept of rape
culture or you're promoting the,

3859
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:32,790
well,

3860
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:34,270
can I just say during that whole thing,

3861
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:35,280
Joe is like the,

3862
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:39,730
like the only one of like my celebrity
buddies that like call me and was like

3863
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:40,450
just,

3864
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,290
he was a good friend.

3865
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:42,370
So thank you for that.

3866
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:42,551
Well,

3867
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:43,384
you're welcome.

3868
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,291
You know,

3869
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:45,124
first of all,

3870
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,320
I don't know if you raped somebody,

3871
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:49,000
but I don't think you ever would.

3872
01:33:49,001 --> 01:33:49,620
He just,

3873
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,081
I can't,

3874
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:51,070
I could be wrong.

3875
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,030
Obviously it could be wrong,

3876
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:56,710
but I listened to your explanation of
it and I know what it's like when you're

3877
01:33:56,711 --> 01:34:00,010
doing a podcast because sometimes
you just trying to be entertaining.

3878
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,960
I seen people exaggerate stories.

3879
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:02,321
I know,

3880
01:34:02,321 --> 01:34:02,770
I know.

3881
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,040
I've been on podcasts before where
people have told stories that I know what

3882
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:09,520
really happened and they're trying to
make it better by adding a little to it.

3883
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:10,840
But the way you did it,

3884
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:11,910
if you any crazy.

3885
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:12,090
Yeah.

3886
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,890
If you and me went through some
crazy shit and like we were like,

3887
01:34:14,891 --> 01:34:17,500
let's talk about it
without getting in trouble.

3888
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:20,890
Then we have to change some details
and dance around and turn into a rape

3889
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:21,813
session.

3890
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:27,310
But to the people that listen to it,

3891
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:29,200
I kind of see their point,

3892
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:29,501
oh,

3893
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:31,830
when I went to 100% when
I went back and heard it,

3894
01:34:31,831 --> 01:34:32,664
it sounds horrible.

3895
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:33,360
Right?

3896
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,180
That's why I was like,

3897
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:35,590
everyone who like got down on me,

3898
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,121
I'm sorry,

3899
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:42,070
like I deserve like knowing who I am
and then like hearing like that thing,

3900
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:42,791
I was like,

3901
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:43,271
whoa,

3902
01:34:43,271 --> 01:34:44,110
that sounds bad.

3903
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:45,220
Like so,

3904
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,180
you know,

3905
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:46,990
but my,

3906
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:47,651
my defense,

3907
01:34:47,651 --> 01:34:49,000
my delusional defense of like,

3908
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:49,901
but I didn't do it.

3909
01:34:49,901 --> 01:34:52,030
It's like if I said anything,

3910
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:52,990
it just sounds,

3911
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:56,020
anytime anyone sounds
tries to defend themselves,

3912
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:56,801
it sounds horrible.

3913
01:34:56,801 --> 01:34:57,111
I was like,

3914
01:34:57,111 --> 01:34:57,591
whatever.

3915
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:58,020
I mean,

3916
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:58,370
I know,

3917
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,840
I totally understand what you're saying.

3918
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:00,300
So,

3919
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:00,590
um,

3920
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:03,350
and I understand it from a point
of someone who does podcasts too,

3921
01:35:03,351 --> 01:35:07,940
that you can say things sometimes that
you don't mean it even you just trying to

3922
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:12,970
be fun or titillating or in your case
trying to be really controversial to

3923
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:14,550
change,

3924
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:16,460
change the tone of the room.

3925
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:17,330
You just fucked up.

3926
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:17,811
You know,

3927
01:35:17,811 --> 01:35:20,630
Patrice O'Neal was talking about
something once we was talking about people

3928
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:23,570
trying to be funny that sometimes
people say like really offensive things,

3929
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:28,700
that they're trying to be funny and it
fails and they're a horrible person and

3930
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:28,911
he's like,

3931
01:35:28,911 --> 01:35:32,150
but if they said something that
wasn't offensive and funny and it,

3932
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,730
and it succeeded and made you laugh,

3933
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:36,680
it's comes from the same place.

3934
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:39,830
It comes from this place of trying
to make something entertaining.

3935
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:40,330
Well,

3936
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:42,650
we say make mistakes when
you're doing things live.

3937
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:42,991
Look,

3938
01:35:42,991 --> 01:35:44,660
you've been on our show and then once I,

3939
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:44,821
I,

3940
01:35:44,821 --> 01:35:45,361
I want,

3941
01:35:45,361 --> 01:35:47,430
I need to go back to the
North Korea America thing.

3942
01:35:47,431 --> 01:35:48,264
It's like,

3943
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,250
I know I'm not a murderer.

3944
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,240
I know I'm not a racist.

3945
01:35:51,241 --> 01:35:54,120
So why can't I say like
aids jokes or it's like,

3946
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,021
I get it now.

3947
01:35:55,021 --> 01:35:55,380
It's like,

3948
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:55,561
oh,

3949
01:35:55,561 --> 01:35:56,130
well you are,

3950
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:57,120
you have a responsibility.

3951
01:35:57,121 --> 01:35:58,260
People will hear that and think,

3952
01:35:58,290 --> 01:35:58,591
you know,

3953
01:35:58,591 --> 01:36:01,140
it's like when I'm with asa
and we're not on the air,

3954
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:02,910
and we were just saying the
worst shit to each other.

3955
01:36:02,911 --> 01:36:03,151
It's like,

3956
01:36:03,151 --> 01:36:03,970
who cares?

3957
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:06,010
You're also dealing with Asa Akira,

3958
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,050
who's like one of the most
hardcore of hardcore porn stars,

3959
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:10,010
right?

3960
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:14,300
So like her tolerance level and
that's what she thinks is funny and

3961
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,010
controversial is so different.

3962
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,311
Well,

3963
01:36:16,311 --> 01:36:19,490
that's what has happened is hanging out.

3964
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:20,570
And I'm not blaming us.

3965
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:23,900
It's like I have a lot of porn friends
and I have a lot of this Yoshi,

3966
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:25,490
like a lot of disturbed people.

3967
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,400
And so when we fuck with each other,

3968
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:29,001
you know,

3969
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:29,840
and you know,

3970
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:31,020
comedians and like,

3971
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:35,210
like you start to forget that
there's normal people out there,

3972
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,460
but they don't know.

3973
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:36,740
Yeah.

3974
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:37,190
You're like,

3975
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:38,170
oh well like that.

3976
01:36:38,171 --> 01:36:38,420
Like,

3977
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:38,691
you know,

3978
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:41,270
me and my friends when
we get together horrible.

3979
01:36:41,271 --> 01:36:42,104
Like,

3980
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,753
like this is,

3981
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,400
I told you about Steve Lee,

3982
01:36:45,401 --> 01:36:46,101
Anne and bill.

3983
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:47,570
Bill Poon doing the Macau brothers.

3984
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,670
So Steve's the lead singer of my band now,

3985
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:52,340
I started a band called Mochi with
money mark from the Beastie boys.

3986
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,740
Steve never gets laid,

3987
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:56,240
he fucks a pocket pussy every night.

3988
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:56,930
All right?

3989
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:59,090
And so I say,

3990
01:36:59,091 --> 01:36:59,660
hey dude,

3991
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:00,010
if,

3992
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:01,580
if something happens with our band,

3993
01:37:01,581 --> 01:37:02,091
you're going to start,

3994
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:02,781
you're the lead singer,

3995
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,220
you're going to start
getting late all the time.

3996
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:07,100
And you put pussy way up on a pedestal.

3997
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:09,050
Like he gets so distracted.

3998
01:37:09,051 --> 01:37:11,120
If a girl likes one of
his photos on Instagram,

3999
01:37:11,121 --> 01:37:11,630
he's like,

4000
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:11,901
Dave,

4001
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:12,320
look at her.

4002
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:12,920
And I go,

4003
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:13,753
hey,

4004
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,640
like you gotta you got to concentrate
on like learning these lyrics.

4005
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:17,120

old school.

4011
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:24,740
Like when I was in the
height of my gambling,

4012
01:37:24,741 --> 01:37:29,741

4015
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,260

4016
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:34,310

01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:49,101

4059
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:16,363
And uh,

4060
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:16,920
you ever see,

4061
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,180
this is a little bit off topic,

4062
01:38:18,181 --> 01:38:22,560
but you ever see that Seinfeld where
the guy converts to Judaism so he could

4063
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:23,670
tell jokes.

4064
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:27,090

4069
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:34,230
but it's so cute.

4070
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:34,411
I go,

4071
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:34,591

4072
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:35,700
Steve's got a really cute bud.

4073
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:36,271
And she goes,

4074
01:38:36,271 --> 01:38:37,320
should I stick my finger in it?

4075
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,221
And I go,

4076
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:38,371
yeah,

4077
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:39,030

4078
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,391
And he goes,

4079
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:39,541
no,

4080
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:39,721
no,

4081
01:38:39,721 --> 01:38:40,141
don't do it.

4082
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:40,621
Exit only.

4083
01:38:40,621 --> 01:38:41,281
But he's still fucking,

4084
01:38:41,281 --> 01:38:41,991

4085
01:38:41,991 --> 01:38:42,824
she goes,

4086
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:44,970
she spits a looking at his ass and I go,

4087
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,220
I'm going to stick my finger in his ass.

4088
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:50,550
So I stick my finger in his ass and I go,

4089
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,170
can I start saying fat jokes?

4090
01:38:52,171 --> 01:38:52,801
Now I'm like,

4091
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:55,300
I'm pretty much gay Yak.

4092
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:56,131
Hey,

4093
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:57,480
you can't say fag.

4094
01:38:57,481 --> 01:38:57,810
And I go,

4095
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:58,620
but I'm,

4096
01:38:58,620 --> 01:38:59,940
I did something gay right now.

4097
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:01,103
Um,

01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:02,490
so I dunno.

4099
01:39:02,491 --> 01:39:03,324
It's like,

4100
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:03,811
yeah,

4101
01:39:03,811 --> 01:39:05,250

4102
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:07,680
your level of like what is acceptable?

4103
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:08,370
Come back.

4104
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:09,720
I tell people this shit.

4105
01:39:09,721 --> 01:39:10,471
And then we found out,

4106
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:13,920
find out that bill who
fucked like 30 hookers can't,

4107
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,690
he's 53 he can't come.

4108
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,171
I go,

4109
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:16,890
what do you mean?

4110
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:17,580
He goes,

4111
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:22,380
I don't use my hands and I wear women's
underwear and I use the tightness of the

4112
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:23,490
band around my boner.

4113
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:26,280
And I talked back and forth
until I come and I go,

4114
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,650
what the fuck are you talking about?

4115
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,230
So then we made another TV show
that we haven't filmed yet,

4116
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:32,550
which is,

4117
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:32,941
I go,

4118
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:33,420
wait,

4119
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:34,590
so when you fuck hookers?

4120
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:35,730
Yeah,

4121
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:36,061
I go,

4122
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:37,170
that doesn't feel good to you.

4123
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:38,040
He goes,

4124
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,460
no,

4125
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:39,960
I go then white calm.

4126
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:40,800
Then why don't you call me?

4127
01:39:40,801 --> 01:39:41,041
He goes,

4128
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:41,750
well,

4129
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,800
and cycle you're thing is psychological.

4130
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:44,600
You,

4131
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,210
you,

4132
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:45,661
what is it?

4133
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:46,370
He's like,

4134
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:46,830
I got to go.

4135
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:49,410
Is it something like where you feel like
the girl doesn't deserve your calm or

4136
01:39:49,411 --> 01:39:50,130
something?

4137
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:54,120
So I made a whole new TV show for him
called girlfriend experience and I'm

4138
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:57,420
sending him to Columbia and
I paid a model like that.

4139
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:59,550
Looks like Sophia Vergara Bill.

4140
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:00,900
If you're listening like you know,

4141
01:40:00,901 --> 01:40:02,010
not the most attractive guy,

4142
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:04,080
like a short,

4143
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:05,970
like I'm very fat,

4144
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,180
nerdy looking Asian guy with a girl.

4145
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:10,710
Like basically I told the girl,

4146
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,330
you can't ever talk about money.

4147
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:16,620
You have to trick them and pretend like
you're his girlfriend for 30 days and

4148
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:17,830
then see if he finally come.

4149
01:40:17,831 --> 01:40:19,290
So it's like the whole TV show.

4150
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,870
If you fuck 30 hookers
and you don't basically,

4151
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,273
sorry,

4152
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:24,360
that's my life now.

4153
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:25,590
So that feels normal.

4154
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,230
So when I talk about this
shit with you are my friends,

4155
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,011
it's like whatever.

4156
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:29,491
That's weird.

4157
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:31,820
We just talked about
Asian guy that works in,

4158
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:34,230
in women's panties to come
in and then you're like,

4159
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:34,681
oh wait,

4160
01:40:34,681 --> 01:40:36,510
maybe this isn't polite
dinner conversation.

4161
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:40,340
Maybe like my world views a little
bit skewed and it's a little,

4162
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:40,661
you know,

4163
01:40:40,661 --> 01:40:41,494
it's like,

4164
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:42,930
you know,

4165
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:43,441
it's like,

4166
01:40:43,441 --> 01:40:44,274
um,

4167
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:45,680
you know,

4168
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:49,260
I'm not the best person to bring to like
a dinner party with wives and stuff,

4169
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:49,770
you know,

4170
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:51,090
like yeah,

4171
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:52,330
that's a,

4172
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:54,280
that's definitely not polite

4173
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,091
dinner conversation.

4174
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:55,331
Right.

4175
01:40:55,331 --> 01:40:56,164
So it's like,

4176
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:56,800
I dunno.

4177
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,521
And you've been on our show.

4178
01:40:57,521 --> 01:40:58,354
It's like when,

4179
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:01,540
when you go in the room and the doors
close and then everyone just starts

4180
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:02,740
fucking did you just like,

4181
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:03,430
you're like,

4182
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:05,080
you forget that another world exists.

4183
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:05,500
You know,

4184
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,210
when everybody starts
talking about crazy shit.

4185
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:07,480
Yeah.

4186
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:11,020
You sort of like get into that
mode and it becomes acceptable.

4187
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:14,080
Like if you're around people that never
swear and someone walks in the room and

4188
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:14,591
says fuck,

4189
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:14,831
it's like,

4190
01:41:14,831 --> 01:41:15,664
oh right.

4191
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:16,660
Oh my goodness.

4192
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:16,841
Right.

4193
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:18,790
But if you're around people
that are constantly swearing,

4194
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:19,750
you don't even,

4195
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,470
it doesn't even like
this conversation here,

4196
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,180
but nothing,

4197
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,290
nothing's registered.

4198
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:23,970
Right.

4199
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:27,370
And you'll save this fucking
this or that means nothing.

4200
01:41:27,371 --> 01:41:29,140
But if the president said it in a speech,

4201
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:30,670
you personally be like,

4202
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:31,121
whoa,

4203
01:41:31,121 --> 01:41:32,140
he just said fuck.

4204
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,460
And so I was like,

4205
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,140
you get used to,

4206
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:35,530
maybe I gave myself too much credit.

4207
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:35,830
I'm like,

4208
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:36,221
Hey,

4209
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:36,940
I have,

4210
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,020
I've developed my,

4211
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:38,360
you know,

4212
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:41,410
I've branded myself as a fucking crazy
artist guy and I can do anything.

4213
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:41,740
And I'm like,

4214
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:41,861
oh,

4215
01:41:41,861 --> 01:41:42,430
I guess not.

4216
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:42,890
You know,

4217
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:43,690
it's like,

4218
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,471
you know,

4219
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:45,970
like when you tell
someone you're an artist,

4220
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:49,480
like it's sort of like free
that you can do whatever.

4221
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:50,560
Like I find out rape,

4222
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:52,620
that's where I know you're victimized.

4223
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:53,460
Found out.

4224
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:54,060
Yeah.

4225
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:56,260
Like you made a mistake.

4226
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,260
My whole thing is like I'm around a lot,

4227
01:41:59,290 --> 01:41:59,660
you know,

4228
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,930
and I'm not saying this
at all to get sympathy,

4229
01:42:01,931 --> 01:42:03,460
but like I get raped all the time.

4230
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,760
I like women grab and touch me and do
shit to me that I don't want and it

4231
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:08,080
doesn't count because
I'm a guy and I'm not,

4232
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:10,150
I'm not even please,

4233
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:10,541
please.

4234
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:14,170
I'm not saying it all because like
I like it whether it's rape or not,

4235
01:42:14,171 --> 01:42:14,590
it's like,

4236
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:14,861
yeah,

4237
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:15,611
I got molested,

4238
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:16,180
all this shit.

4239
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:16,870
It's like,

4240
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:19,830
how's it molesting you
if you like it because I,

4241
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,490
because I don't want
it and then it's like,

4242
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:22,001
I like that.

4243
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:22,600
I don't,

4244
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,930
Joe are we sit as a whole that we can't
have conflicting emotions at the same

4245
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:26,590
time.

4246
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:28,870
I love and hate you at the same time.

4247
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,220
Know when it starts I'm like,

4248
01:42:30,221 --> 01:42:32,650
I definitely don't want this
chick to be touching me.

4249
01:42:32,651 --> 01:42:33,484
And then it's like,

4250
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:34,360
then it feels good.

4251
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,440
Well I'm a sick person,

4252
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,270
I'm a sick demented person.

4253
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:40,330
And what that was part of what you were
talking about when you were talking

4254
01:42:40,331 --> 01:42:41,440
about this experience,

4255
01:42:41,441 --> 01:42:45,850
like you were talking about the fact that
it might be kind of rapey was what got

4256
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:50,470
you off and you were saying
that again you're a brown,

4257
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:54,460
a bunch of fucking perverts for also
was trying to take it to the next level

4258
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:55,031
also was like,

4259
01:42:55,031 --> 01:42:56,080
so you're a rapist and I was like,

4260
01:42:56,081 --> 01:42:56,501
yes,

4261
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:57,130
I'm a rapist.

4262
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:57,820
And it's like,

4263
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:58,181
no,

4264
01:42:58,181 --> 01:42:58,960
I'm not a rapist.

4265
01:42:58,960 --> 01:42:59,793
But it's like I don't,

4266
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,000
I know I'm not so I'm joking.

4267
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:06,370
You kind of forget also that a lot of
other people that don't understand your

4268
01:43:06,371 --> 01:43:06,891
sensibility,

4269
01:43:06,891 --> 01:43:07,810
you going to be listening to this.

4270
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:08,290
Right,

4271
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:08,920
exactly.

4272
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,780
You assume that the people that get it,

4273
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:11,560
I like,

4274
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:12,640
like on my message board,

4275
01:43:12,641 --> 01:43:13,361
my message board,

4276
01:43:13,361 --> 01:43:15,190
it's like this ridiculous
message board and some,

4277
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:17,430
some of the subjects are just so like,

4278
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:21,280
but everybody kind of understands
the tone of the boards or they'll say

4279
01:43:21,281 --> 01:43:24,430
something really fucked up and if
it was on any other message board,

4280
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:26,140
people might like read it and go,

4281
01:43:26,141 --> 01:43:28,150
what the fuck did this guy just said?

4282
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,620
But it became normal.

4283
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:30,100
Well,

4284
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:30,933
yeah,

4285
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:32,410
I still am not there yet.

4286
01:43:32,411 --> 01:43:33,880
It's like when I have,

4287
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,240
when I get new fans from like
being on the boarding show,

4288
01:43:37,241 --> 01:43:40,090
or if I'm reporting the
next cold war coming,

4289
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,290
that's serious shit.

4290
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,670
And then they come over,

4291
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:43,090
they're like,

4292
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:43,241
oh,

4293
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:44,170
I liked this guy owner.

4294
01:43:44,171 --> 01:43:44,441
What else?

4295
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:45,370
He's up to rape.

4296
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:45,910
And they're like,

4297
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:46,690
Whoa,

4298
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:47,590
fuck,

4299
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:48,580
uh,

4300
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:48,941
you know,

4301
01:43:48,941 --> 01:43:49,774
so it's like,

4302
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:50,650
I don't know,

4303
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:52,700
but they'll figure it
out eventually that sale.

4304
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:53,540
I mean,

4305
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:54,201
you still,

4306
01:43:54,201 --> 01:43:54,561
you,

4307
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:55,550
you're still doing the same shit.

4308
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,413
Can I say something

4309
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:57,403
that it's like,

4310
01:43:58,700 --> 01:43:59,610
if someone's not a rape,

4311
01:43:59,611 --> 01:43:59,871
is it,

4312
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:00,460
and it's like,

4313
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:01,293
it's,

4314
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:05,360
it's such a huge fucking thing to
call someone that when they're not,

4315
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:05,811
and it's like,

4316
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:08,000
you're literally like
ruining that guy's life.

4317
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:09,990
But how would they know
that you're not a rapist?

4318
01:44:09,991 --> 01:44:10,710
That's the problem.

4319
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:11,730
They would assume that you are,

4320
01:44:11,731 --> 01:44:14,490
I saw people that I
know call you a rapist,

4321
01:44:14,491 --> 01:44:14,910
and I was like,

4322
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:15,121
oh,

4323
01:44:15,121 --> 01:44:15,680
this is a man.

4324
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,880
Like you don't even know me.

4325
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:17,670
It's like,

4326
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:19,140
but they're basing it on what you said.

4327
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:20,700
It's your fault.

4328
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:22,200
It's,

4329
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,550
we both agreed zero defense,

4330
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:24,413
no fault.

4331
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,321
From what I said,

4332
01:44:25,321 --> 01:44:26,280
it sounds horrible.

4333
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,450
You know me mean you're like Dave,

4334
01:44:27,451 --> 01:44:27,810
just,

4335
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:28,643
I know,

4336
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,730
I know your whole thing,

4337
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:29,961
right?

4338
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:32,240
But your style of community
and I know that Shell,

4339
01:44:32,241 --> 01:44:33,180
which is crazy.

4340
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:35,040
I love your show.

4341
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,060
I love your show.

4342
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:37,400
I loved the Han Dynasty Shit.

4343
01:44:37,401 --> 01:44:42,360
I level is wacky shit you do because I
really think you want to sit in the rape

4344
01:44:42,361 --> 01:44:42,790
stuff.

4345
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:46,230
I really think it's important to have a
guy like you out there just pushing the

4346
01:44:46,231 --> 01:44:46,800
boundaries.

4347
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,570
I think what you said about Jackie Chan,

4348
01:44:48,571 --> 01:44:49,291
it's funny,

4349
01:44:49,291 --> 01:44:51,510
but it's fucking important because in,

4350
01:44:51,550 --> 01:44:54,000
in terms of like identifying and

4351
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:57,180
communicating about racism,

4352
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:57,481
right?

4353
01:44:57,481 --> 01:44:58,920
That's a real racist thing.

4354
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,420
And for a person who's Asian,

4355
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:02,040
that's gotta be kind of fucked up.

4356
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:02,730
It is.

4357
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:03,600
It is kind of fucked up.

4358
01:45:03,601 --> 01:45:04,434
And it's like I just,

4359
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:05,550
Charlie Sheen out there,

4360
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:07,260
it's banging hookers and it's like,

4361
01:45:07,261 --> 01:45:07,790
Yay,

4362
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:08,623
Code Charlie.

4363
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,840
But then you do it.

4364
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:10,260
It's like,

4365
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:10,471
oh,

4366
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:11,340
Dave's creepy.

4367
01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:11,681
But it's,

4368
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:12,290
it's the,

4369
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:15,840
the people that like come
at me the most Asian women,

4370
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,130
they're mad at you.

4371
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:18,010
They're mad at me and says,

4372
01:45:18,011 --> 01:45:18,900
your phone and white checks,

4373
01:45:18,901 --> 01:45:19,734
that's fine,

4374
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,530
but you're all Asian all the time.

4375
01:45:22,531 --> 01:45:23,890
But this is what it's done on the grave.

4376
01:45:23,891 --> 01:45:24,300
It's like,

4377
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:24,551
oh,

4378
01:45:24,551 --> 01:45:25,560
this day full of Shit,

4379
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,680
this and this and this.

4380
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,030
So like I said,

4381
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:29,800
during the height of that,

4382
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:31,660
like crazy Vegas era,

4383
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,840
I would be going to Vegas all the
time with like a hundred grand,

4384
01:45:34,841 --> 01:45:37,090
$1 million in like a
pillowcase in my backpack.

4385
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:38,590
It's much that looks like

4386
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:38,890
this.

4387
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:41,100
Went to Vegas with $1 million a year,

4388
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:41,890
all the time.

4389
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:42,723
All the time.

4390
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:46,090
And so as the most money
I've ever seen in my life,

4391
01:45:46,091 --> 01:45:46,630
by the way,

4392
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:48,670
I've never seen $100,000 check this out.

4393
01:45:48,671 --> 01:45:49,504
Watch Joe.

4394
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:49,920
I,

4395
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:50,320
I,

4396
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,410
I'm cleaning my room for the first time
in seven years since I lived in the,

4397
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,310
my hoarders nest.

4398
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:55,060
It's just,

4399
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:55,990
it's just filthy.

4400
01:45:56,290 --> 01:45:57,670
I find a shoe box and I'm like,

4401
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:58,533
Oh,

4402
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,890
a hundred grand from the Vegas era.

4403
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,083
And I go,

4404
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:01,980
fuck,

4405
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:02,350
you know,

4406
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:03,183
critter,

4407
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,380
I don't want to get into how
much should he does for me.

4408
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:10,180
But I sat here tearing them down about
what a horrible personal trainer he does

4409
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:11,860
shit that like,

4410
01:46:11,861 --> 01:46:12,850
I can't even talk about here.

4411
01:46:12,851 --> 01:46:13,670
That's like the,

4412
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:14,260
he's the,

4413
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:14,860
he's my,

4414
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:16,190
I love him shovels hole.

4415
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:17,353
So I just,

4416
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,251
I just gave him this,

4417
01:46:18,251 --> 01:46:18,551
I was like,

4418
01:46:18,551 --> 01:46:19,870
you take this because
you're the fucking man.

4419
01:46:19,871 --> 01:46:20,081
He's like,

4420
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:21,100
I don't want you to dirty money.

4421
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:22,203
He's like,

4422
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:22,630
I don't,

4423
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:23,170
I don't want to get,

4424
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:23,591
I'm not,

4425
01:46:23,591 --> 01:46:24,280
I'm not a whore.

4426
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:26,230
Like I'm not going to get
paid for the whatever.

4427
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:26,710
So I was like,

4428
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:28,690
let's do it for all the people that go,

4429
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:29,380
if I was,

4430
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:32,920
I know $100,000 in $1 million,

4431
01:46:32,921 --> 01:46:33,580
but it's like,

4432
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:34,180
it's just money.

4433
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:34,581
It's get,

4434
01:46:34,581 --> 01:46:35,530
get a kid out of debt.

4435
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:37,810
And so all these people complaining,

4436
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,021
well,

4437
01:46:38,021 --> 01:46:39,280
if I was rich or this and that,

4438
01:46:39,281 --> 01:46:41,890
or it's easy or because I did,

4439
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,070
so this hundred grand cash like this,

4440
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,270
I'm just going to give it to someone.

4441
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,920
It's not like some weird like,

4442
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:48,131
oh,

4443
01:46:48,131 --> 01:46:50,850
fill out this form and we half or
when he's going to give it to you,

4444
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:55,500
but you have to go around the United
States and you've got to do all that.

4445
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:59,580
Critter put all these clues in
place and immediately they're like,

4446
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:00,181
well,

4447
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:01,230
we're not rich like you.

4448
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:01,501
I go,

4449
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:05,190
I've traveled around the United
States for nothing and they're like,

4450
01:47:05,191 --> 01:47:07,500
oh well like we have lives,

4451
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:07,981
we have jobs.

4452
01:47:07,981 --> 01:47:08,490
I go,

4453
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:10,890
it's $100,000 that's why you would do it.

4454
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,083
And so,

4455

guy is serious or not.

4458
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:20,870
So I'm putting a hundred grand up in
this critters cross country cash contest

4459
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:21,870
scavenger hunt.

That's what it's called.

4461
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:23,520
10 people are playing.

4462
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:25,350
Only 10 10 people are playing.

4463
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,760
I bet this more now.

4464
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:27,360
Well,

4465
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,571

4466
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:32,460
I mean I wanted to hitters cross country
cash contest caught all the details are

4467
01:47:32,461 --> 01:47:33,360

4472
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:40,080
Here's the problem with that.

4473
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,150
Your DVD asa page.

4474
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:44,050
Anybody can go there and just find no,

4475
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:47,490
the contest is the only thing on
the thing that you can't fuck with.

4476
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:49,590
You can't fuck with that threat level.

4477
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,210
You could do it right now.

4478
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:52,470
You still to change a threat like yeah,

4479
01:47:52,471 --> 01:47:52,741
sure.

4480
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:53,051
Why not?

4481
01:47:53,051 --> 01:47:55,140
I remember when that was like a big deal.

4482
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,570
Like every dab haven't been talking
about this lately with my friend.

4483
01:47:57,571 --> 01:47:59,790
My threat levels that what
orange all the time man.

4484
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:00,360
It's bad.

4485
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:01,560
Do you remember when it
was like that though?

4486
01:48:01,561 --> 01:48:04,500
Like everyday you just look at the news
and the terrorist threat level that was

4487
01:48:04,501 --> 01:48:08,460
closer to like nine 11 and it was so
ridiculous and it makes people like uneasy

4488
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:09,294
and stuff.

4489
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:10,163
That's the point of it.

4490
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,530
And it's also a good thing
for the news right here.

4491
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,500
Threat levels at orange,

4492
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:13,800
right?

4493
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:14,633
Mother fuckers,

4494
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:15,510
right?

4495
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:16,710
Goddamn Arabs.

4496
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:17,610
Joe,

4497
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:18,180
I love you.

4498
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,770
I love you to be a
fucking awesome guy man.

4499
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:20,460
You're really,

4500
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,293
you're a good dude.

4501
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:22,403
I really,

4502
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,870
it helps me to come on the show
and talk to you about this stuff.

4503
01:48:24,871 --> 01:48:26,940
Cause I know like you go through
a lot of the similar shit,

4504
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:28,950
like everyone wanted to know like,

4505
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:33,270
like why I'm so common the last three
months it's because I took my showdown and

4506
01:48:33,271 --> 01:48:35,670
it's not for any reason that people think.

4507
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:39,960
It's like literally like I was sitting
at home one day and like there was a

4508
01:48:39,961 --> 01:48:41,550
glitch on our website and they're like,

4509
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:43,020
oh the next episode can't count.

4510
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:43,591
Go up tomorrow.

4511
01:48:43,591 --> 01:48:43,861
I'm like,

4512
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:44,071
why?

4513
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:44,340
He's like,

4514
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,320
oh we got to call a
guy and fix this thing.

4515
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:49,860
And then I was just sitting there and
thinking I was reading a comic book and I

4516
01:48:49,861 --> 01:48:50,694
was like,

4517
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,830
I don't have to do this.

4518
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:54,360
Like I don't have to do this.

4519
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:56,370
And like I don't know
what your fans are like,

4520
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:57,750
but like my fans are horrible.

4521
01:48:57,751 --> 01:48:58,091
Like that's,

4522
01:48:58,091 --> 01:48:59,490
so that's my critters her today.

4523
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:00,810
I knew if I showed this money,

4524
01:49:00,811 --> 01:49:02,820
like maybe someone's going
to drive here right now.

4525
01:49:02,821 --> 01:49:03,240
So,

4526
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:03,480
you know,

4527
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,640
I think that you,

4528
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:08,580
you're always going to have some
horrible people that are out there.

4529
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:09,901
First of all,

4530
01:49:09,901 --> 01:49:10,711
you have great fans.

4531
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:13,010
Cause every time I do
your show I go outside,

4532
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:13,831
I go to supermarket,

4533
01:49:13,831 --> 01:49:14,081
they're like,

4534
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:14,851
heard you won Joe.

4535
01:49:14,851 --> 01:49:15,930
And there's so nice.

4536
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:17,850
Our fans are fucking great too.

4537
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:21,330
But then there's like that handful of
like if I talk about something then

4538
01:49:21,331 --> 01:49:24,030
they'll definitely go
out of their way to like,

4539
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:27,900
like if I try to like mask the girl that
I'm talking about without giving away

4540
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:28,680
your identity,

4541
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,750
they'll put the clues together,

4542
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,630
figure out who it is,

4543
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:31,883
call her and be like,

4544
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:32,041
hey,

4545
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:33,450
Dave said horrible shit about you.

4546
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:37,260
They're usually wrong and
they just live to sabotage me.

4547
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,190
Why do you think that is?

4548
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,860
I honestly try to figure that out.

4549
01:49:40,861 --> 01:49:42,750
Like I don't watch a lot of television,

4550
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:43,320
but like,

4551
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:45,990
you know how there's like
all this like reality TV,

4552
01:49:45,991 --> 01:49:49,210
the Kardashians and all this shit and
the housewives and people were like,

4553
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,910
I hate this show but
I can't stop watching.

4554
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:55,540
I really feel like there's
people that hate me,

4555
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,190
that watch everything I do.

4556
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:58,270
I could be wrong about this.

4557
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:00,530
And then like just,

4558
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:01,960
I get excited and I am like,

4559
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:02,201
cool,

4560
01:50:02,201 --> 01:50:03,460
I have a show where I
could talk about anything.

4561
01:50:03,461 --> 01:50:04,181
I talk about it.

4562
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:05,050
And then I find out,

4563
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:07,930
like we did a couple episodes
in big bear and I was like,

4564
01:50:07,931 --> 01:50:08,410
cool,

4565
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:12,340
we're doing shows in big bear while we're
doing the shows in big bear because we

4566
01:50:12,341 --> 01:50:13,810
said that someone went online,

4567
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:15,820
found out the address of the thing,

4568
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:17,500
blasted it on the line,

4569
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,210
wrote the manager and said,

4570
01:50:19,211 --> 01:50:19,361
Hey,

4571
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:24,361
there's a disgusting porn
star and a fucking rapist
artists they're doing any on

4572
01:50:25,271 --> 01:50:26,080
the landlord calls us.

4573
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:26,470
And he's like,

4574
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:27,303
Hey,

4575
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,323
like what?

4576
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:30,640
What's the like we're trying to have this,

4577
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:34,450
like we spent million dollars building
this like nice resort honeymoon,

4578
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:38,560
big bear ranch and you guys are
turning it into what it was this post,

4579
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:41,500
the internet controversy or pre after,

4580
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:42,363
after.

4581
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:43,743
Um,

4582
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:45,010
so I'm just like,

4583
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:46,240
what the fuck am I doing?

4584
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:46,660
Right?

4585
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:50,680
Like you gotta assume that then
people are looking at you as a target.

4586
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:51,580
They're going after you.

4587
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:52,061
Right.

4588
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:52,270
And,

4589
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:53,230
but I'm also like,

4590
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:54,011
like I said,

4591
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:58,000
I don't need to be put making painting
this bright fucking bullseye on me all

4592
01:50:58,001 --> 01:50:58,834
the time.

4593
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:59,651
So I was like,

4594
01:50:59,651 --> 01:51:00,250
you know what,

4595
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:02,620
I'm just going to take a
vacation now to take a break,

4596
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,540
but we're back.

4597
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:05,590
We're all going to do it again.

4598
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:05,801
Well,

4599
01:51:05,801 --> 01:51:06,281
it's up there.

4600
01:51:06,281 --> 01:51:06,810
There's that,

4601
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:08,280
there's are disgusting DVD.

4602
01:51:08,281 --> 01:51:10,750
Say Wikipedia page.

4603
01:51:10,751 --> 01:51:12,370
And I used to recording new episodes.

4604
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:13,120
Yeah,

4605
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:13,360
I mean,

4606
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,530
well the thing is I never stopped.

4607
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:15,790
I never stopped recording.

4608
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:19,690
Like I never like we
have like 30 50 episodes.

4609
01:51:19,691 --> 01:51:21,250
I don't even know the entire time.

4610
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:21,920
You just recording them,

4611
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,753
not releasing them.

4612
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:23,561
W Yeah,

4613
01:51:23,561 --> 01:51:24,970
if someone shot me in the head today,

4614
01:51:24,971 --> 01:51:25,790
I'd have like,

4615
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:27,900
like a year's worth of podcasts.

4616
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,620
You can't stop this shit motherfucker.

4617
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:34,600
You can't stop this shit DVD.

4618
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:35,443
Say forever.

4619
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:36,360
Fuck man.

4620
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,500
People that are going to be very happy.

4621
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:40,280
People were very bummed out on
my website and my message board.

4622
01:51:40,281 --> 01:51:41,970
People were very bummed out
that you took your show down.

4623
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:42,721
Well,

4624
01:51:42,721 --> 01:51:43,530
I'm like,

4625
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,130
I'm always like,

4626
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:45,090
who gives a shit?

4627
01:51:45,091 --> 01:51:45,301
Like,

4628
01:51:45,301 --> 01:51:46,134
you know,

4629
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:47,110
we'll give a shit.

4630
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:48,450
But you got to understand,

4631
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:49,020
okay,

4632
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:50,120
as your friend this,

4633
01:51:50,121 --> 01:51:50,600
this,

4634
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,460
this persona that you've created,

4635
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,360
you who you are,

4636
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:54,540
you,

4637
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:57,240
your actual human existence where you are.

4638
01:51:57,390 --> 01:51:58,440
And then on top of that,

4639
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:03,480
all the hyperbole and exaggeration and
fun and chaos and all the stuff that

4640
01:52:03,481 --> 01:52:03,961
you're doing,

4641
01:52:03,961 --> 01:52:07,470
all the machine guns in
buttholes and all this chaos,

4642
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:12,770
you're automatically going to attract a
certain amount of unsavory attention and

4643
01:52:12,961 --> 01:52:13,351
learned that,

4644
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:13,620
no.

4645
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:13,771
Well,

4646
01:52:13,771 --> 01:52:16,290
it's also plus people are fucking haters.

4647
01:52:16,291 --> 01:52:19,270
There's a lot of years out there and
there's a lot of people be stronger.

4648
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:22,660
They want to not like something they,

4649
01:52:22,661 --> 01:52:26,010
they're looking for something to distract
them from the miserable existence that

4650
01:52:26,011 --> 01:52:27,060
they're caught up in or,

4651
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:28,650
and there's also people that think,

4652
01:52:28,651 --> 01:52:29,100
hey,

4653
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,150
this guy's a piece of shit.

4654
01:52:30,151 --> 01:52:30,984
Rapist.

4655
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:32,070
I have a target now.

4656
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:33,630
And then they go after
you because of that.

4657
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:33,781
Well,

4658
01:52:33,781 --> 01:52:34,614
how do you deal with it?

4659
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,660
My dog done not a red
piece of shit rapists.

4660
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:36,840
Well,

4661
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,100
I'm not saying you're a
very nice person to say,

4662
01:52:39,110 --> 01:52:39,450
be nice.

4663
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:41,070
I know you have crazy fans,

4664
01:52:41,071 --> 01:52:42,390
so it's to get crazy people.

4665
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,820
You're always going to get
a certain amount of them in.

4666
01:52:43,821 --> 01:52:44,190
Right.

4667
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:45,380
I try.

4668
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,640
One of the reasons why,

4669
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:50,300
I mean I assume one of the reasons why
the people that liked the show are so

4670
01:52:50,301 --> 01:52:50,571
nice.

4671
01:52:50,571 --> 01:52:51,440
My fans are so nice.

4672
01:52:51,441 --> 01:52:54,530
It's because I'm a nice person and
you can also fuck them up by just,

4673
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:55,460
it doesn't matter.

4674
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:56,350
People could shoot you.

4675
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,920
You know the people we say [inaudible]
old go kick people's asses.

4676
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:01,310
That doesn't last.

4677
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:01,730
You know,

4678
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:02,480
you pick KP,

4679
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,141
people's acids,

4680
01:53:03,141 --> 01:53:03,891
they don't like that.

4681
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:04,431
They shoot you,

4682
01:53:04,431 --> 01:53:04,971
they stab you,

4683
01:53:04,971 --> 01:53:05,960
they run you over the car.

4684
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:07,130
Just be nice.

4685
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:08,023
Like if you,

4686
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:11,420
martial arts is supposed to be
about developing your character,

4687
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:16,280
about figuring out how you
overcome difficult obstacles
and how that makes you a

4688
01:53:16,281 --> 01:53:17,114
better person.

4689
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,470
That's what it is for me.

4690
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:19,070
Right?

4691
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:20,720
So it's not about that,

4692
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:24,170
but it's also about being confident so
you don't have to worry about is many

4693
01:53:24,171 --> 01:53:25,010
people kicking your ass.

4694
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:27,140
There's always going to be some people
that can kick your ass no matter who you

4695
01:53:27,141 --> 01:53:27,860
are really.

4696
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:28,420
Right.

4697
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,710
Unless you're at the top of the fucking
heat and then you're only at the top of

4698
01:53:30,711 --> 01:53:31,910
the heap for a certain amount of time.

4699
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:34,610
Then when Cain Velasquez beat
the fuck out of Brock Lesnar,

4700
01:53:34,611 --> 01:53:35,211
everybody was like,

4701
01:53:35,211 --> 01:53:36,170
Jesus Christ.

4702
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,290
You can be a guy like Brock
Lesnar somewhere out there.

4703
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:42,800
This is bad ass dude with brown
pride tattooed on his chest.

4704
01:53:42,801 --> 01:53:44,360
He just beats the shit out of you.

4705
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:46,910
Always be someone that's always
gonna be someone most likely.

4706
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:52,330
But I think you put out a certain energy
and you get back a certain energy.

4707
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:57,890
That's the metaphor I said in high
school I fought like almost every weekend

4708
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,761
didn't win.

4709
01:53:58,761 --> 01:54:00,500
90% of them still did it.

4710
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,000
So it's like that's,

4711
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:04,250
if that's a says anything about you,

4712
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,140
there's nothing.

4713
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:07,340
I mean,

4714
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,020
short of like putting a bullet in my head,

4715
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:10,640
there's nothing like you,

4716
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:13,640
you getting in that that black guy putting
you in a thing and humiliating you.

4717
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:16,070
It's like I've been embarrassed,

4718
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:16,820
humiliated.

4719
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:17,900
I've been called a rapist.

4720
01:54:17,901 --> 01:54:22,901
I've lost love and finance and
anything bad you can do to me.

4721
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:25,100
I've been in jail,

4722
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:26,900
I've almost gotten raped.

4723
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:27,201
You know,

4724
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:27,470
like,

4725
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:30,320
it's like there's nothing you can do to
me that I haven't done worse to myself,

4726
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:30,790
you know?

4727
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:30,971
Did,

4728
01:54:30,971 --> 01:54:32,620
but you've grown from all this stuff,

4729
01:54:32,621 --> 01:54:33,040
right?

4730
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:33,731
I think so.

4731
01:54:33,731 --> 01:54:35,280
Have you grown from this
personal experience?

4732
01:54:35,281 --> 01:54:36,114
Does that make sense?

4733
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,670
I think so.

4734
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:37,720
The rapist experience

4735
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:39,760
Vr,

4736
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,900
the VR virtual rape is experienced.

4737
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:43,000
Um,

4738
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:43,550
yeah.

4739
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:46,510
You know that putting that out there now,

4740
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:49,510
even though it's an innocent look
and you're trying to entertain,

4741
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:49,760
look,

4742
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,560
when I like the,

4743
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:53,980
the standup thing that
I threw up on Vimeo,

4744
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:55,610
it's like the first time I tried it like,

4745
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:56,300
um,

4746
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:57,320
you could see I'm shaking,

4747
01:54:57,321 --> 01:55:00,440
I'm trying to find words
like I broadcasting,

4748
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:01,880
I don't know how many episodes are up now,

4749
01:55:01,881 --> 01:55:03,440
like 600 or something like,

4750
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:05,060
and you've been on TV.

4751
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:05,390
I like,

4752
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:05,930
I,

4753
01:55:05,930 --> 01:55:10,340
I've been a quiet guy drawing werewolves
my whole life and I've just started to

4754
01:55:10,341 --> 01:55:11,180
do this shit.

4755
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:12,920
I'm trying to figure out who I am.

4756
01:55:12,921 --> 01:55:13,400
I'm trying to,

4757
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,233
you know,

4758
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,083
I'm,

4759
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:17,380
I'm learning and I don't mind,

4760
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:19,370
I don't mind people
judging me as I learned.

4761
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,680
And I know that's going to
happen with the haters and stuff,

4762
01:55:21,681 --> 01:55:22,491
but it's like,

4763
01:55:22,491 --> 01:55:22,671
look,

4764
01:55:22,671 --> 01:55:23,391
if you want to hit on me,

4765
01:55:23,391 --> 01:55:23,691
go ahead.

4766
01:55:23,691 --> 01:55:24,260
I'm like,

4767
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:26,540
I'm sorry if it didn't turn out
exactly the way you want it.

4768
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:27,650
I'm sorry if I offended you.

4769
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,580
Actually I'm not,

4770
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:29,750
I'm not sorry if I offended you,

4771
01:55:29,751 --> 01:55:31,070
but it's just like,

4772
01:55:31,071 --> 01:55:31,311
you know,

4773
01:55:31,311 --> 01:55:31,700
I'm learning,

4774
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:32,720
I'm learning.

4775
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:35,930
I have my heroes like stern
and whoever growing up,

4776
01:55:35,931 --> 01:55:38,420
it's like there's a
little bit of emulation,

4777
01:55:38,421 --> 01:55:39,141
but then there's also like,

4778
01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:40,400
I want to be my own person.

4779
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:41,570
So I'm trying,

4780
01:55:41,571 --> 01:55:41,751
you know,

4781
01:55:41,751 --> 01:55:42,950
I'm trying to figure out my,

4782
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,670
and in the meantime,

4783
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:44,851
like,

4784
01:55:44,851 --> 01:55:45,091
yeah,

4785
01:55:45,091 --> 01:55:45,631
I'm falling,

4786
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:46,291
I'm failing here.

4787
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:48,300
So I hopefully I'm learning
from this experience.

4788
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:49,290
It was also the,

4789
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:50,543
there's an,

4790
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:55,170
I dunno if there's an art or a skill to
being in the public eye and expressing

4791
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:57,450
yourself because I have
not mastered that yet.

4792
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:00,190
The shit that we all do,

4793
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:00,821
and I know,

4794
01:56:00,821 --> 01:56:01,061
you know,

4795
01:56:01,061 --> 01:56:02,560
you hang around with guys that I know,

4796
01:56:02,561 --> 01:56:03,161
like Bobby,

4797
01:56:03,161 --> 01:56:04,060
who's fucking crazy,

4798
01:56:04,061 --> 01:56:04,990
Bobby Lee's crazy.

4799
01:56:05,170 --> 01:56:05,601
And there's,

4800
01:56:05,601 --> 01:56:09,070
there's shit that Bobby and I have done
just hanging out at the comedy store to

4801
01:56:09,071 --> 01:56:10,030
make each other laugh.

4802
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:14,170
Well Bobby said like ridiculously
dark fucked up shit and I'll,

4803
01:56:14,171 --> 01:56:15,250
how a laughing.

4804
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:16,890
I know he's not being on it,

4805
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:21,900
but if anybody else came along it didn't
know Bobby and heard him say that it

4806
01:56:22,211 --> 01:56:23,200
can be misconstrued.

4807
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:25,420
And when you're broadcasting
it to the whole world,

4808
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:26,473
you're inviting,

4809
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:31,060
you're inviting a bunch of people who
don't know you as a human or you know.

4810
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:31,770
Yeah,

4811
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:31,981
no,

4812
01:56:31,981 --> 01:56:32,550
that's,

4813
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:33,300
I mean you,

4814
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,133
if that,

4815
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:35,940
what you just said is a
commercial for my show.

4816
01:56:35,941 --> 01:56:39,660
It's like we say some fucking
horrible shit and it's like if you're,

4817
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:40,560
if you're part of the family,

4818
01:56:40,561 --> 01:56:41,580
if you're part of the whole,

4819
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:42,181
like you,

4820
01:56:42,181 --> 01:56:42,781
you're in on it,

4821
01:56:42,781 --> 01:56:43,411
then you get it.

4822
01:56:43,411 --> 01:56:44,460
If you're just like,

4823
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:44,731
oh,

4824
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:45,750
I saw him on Hbo,

4825
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:46,351
let me check them out.

4826
01:56:46,351 --> 01:56:46,711
And you're like,

4827
01:56:46,711 --> 01:56:49,170
what the fuck did I just hear right now?

4828
01:56:49,171 --> 01:56:49,620
You know,

4829
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:53,970
you should hire someone to go over
all the DVD ass as you do them.

4830
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:55,890
And then at the end of the episode go,

4831
01:56:55,891 --> 01:56:56,760
what do you got for me?

4832
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:56,971
Well,

4833
01:56:56,971 --> 01:56:57,650
you said your rave,

4834
01:56:57,650 --> 01:56:57,900
someone,

4835
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:58,021
Oh,

4836
01:56:58,021 --> 01:56:58,890
I definitely didn't do that.

4837
01:56:59,090 --> 01:57:00,030
Let me explain.

4838
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,410
I was bullshitting there.

4839
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:01,741
Well,

4840
01:57:01,741 --> 01:57:02,221
you know,

4841
01:57:02,221 --> 01:57:05,420
you said you robbed gangsters and you
fucked him in the ass with a Dildo.

4842
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:05,671
Well,

4843
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:06,820
I didn't write,

4844
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:07,850
but I can't talk about,

4845
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:10,250
I didn't,

4846
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:12,470
I don't need to hire anyone DVD.

4847
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:13,031
Say If,

4848
01:57:13,031 --> 01:57:13,621
if you,

4849
01:57:13,621 --> 01:57:14,454
uh,

4850
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:15,760
if you go to Dva,

4851
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,700
say.com you can,

4852
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:19,500
or like listen to it
on iTunes or whatever,

4853
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:20,490
but if you want to watch it,

4854
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:21,540
it's on that Vidmar site now.

4855
01:57:21,541 --> 01:57:22,374
Cause like,

4856
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,120
I don't want to censor anything.

4857
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,530
We broadcast from an insane,

4858
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:26,401
insane asylum.

4859
01:57:26,401 --> 01:57:27,234
Now.

4860
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:29,880
It's from a real incentives
outside of the insane asylum.

4861
01:57:29,881 --> 01:57:30,720
And so it's like,

4862
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:31,440
Hey,

4863
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,273
guess what?

4864
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:32,790
We're always,

4865
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:33,630
I'm fucking crazy.

4866
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:35,480
How do you get to an insane look?

4867
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:36,840
Look at the thing right now.

4868
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:37,800
Okay.

4869
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:38,280
Hey,

4870
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,500
big bucks gets you whatever
you need for Wally.

4871
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,500
Check it out.

4872
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:41,841
Where,

4873
01:57:41,841 --> 01:57:42,750
where does it say it?

4874
01:57:42,910 --> 01:57:43,140
This,

4875
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,640
this is a whole thing now.

4876
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:45,540
It's all black techs.

4877
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:46,620
Ever since the show started,

4878
01:57:47,330 --> 01:57:49,050
your entire website changed.

4879
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:49,751
Um,

4880
01:57:49,751 --> 01:57:50,551
I'm looking for it.

4881
01:57:50,551 --> 01:57:50,731
Where,

4882
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:51,560
what am I looking at?

4883
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,190
I'm just hit like a,

4884
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:56,130
so we're calling it all the old shows.

4885
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:56,580
It's,

4886
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:58,070
it's the new DVD ACA.

4887
01:57:58,110 --> 01:57:59,610
So it's like saga to,

4888
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,080
and then if you just click on it,

4889
01:58:01,081 --> 01:58:02,180
you'll see what the inside of the,

4890
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:04,170
this is a shit website,

4891
01:58:04,171 --> 01:58:04,650
buddy.

4892
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:05,190
It's horrible.

4893
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:05,461
Okay.

4894
01:58:05,461 --> 01:58:08,520
Saga to saga to chapter one,

4895
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:09,930
the ranch part.

4896
01:58:09,931 --> 01:58:11,940
W Sardines,

4897
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,460
chapter two,

4898
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:15,683
sardines.

4899
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:15,871
Here,

4900
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:16,740
I'll show you what it looks like.

4901
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:19,733
Um,

4902
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,150
but what are we looking for here?

4903
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:21,391
Oh yeah.

4904
01:58:21,391 --> 01:58:23,310
Just play it off of youtube
or Vimeo or whatever.

4905
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:24,383
I'll show you the,

4906
01:58:24,610 --> 01:58:27,870
they're all inside of the insane probably
crashing right now because all the

4907
01:58:27,871 --> 01:58:28,704
people going to that,

4908
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:30,660
that's probably what's happening.

4909
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:33,510
You probably got thousands of
people visiting it right now.

4910
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,171
Yeah.

4911
01:58:34,171 --> 01:58:36,390
I mean we put it up on youtube,

4912
01:58:36,391 --> 01:58:38,550
but it's censored and
then we have it on video.

4913
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:41,200
Me uncensored the episode two.

4914
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:44,350
Right now there's a
chick with like 34 g's,

4915
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:44,741
or I don't know,

4916
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:47,260
the biggest real tits
I've ever seen in my life.

4917
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:48,430
So a lot of people watching them,

4918
01:58:48,431 --> 01:58:49,740
they kept flopping out.

4919
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:50,583
Yeah.

4920
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:51,221
Yeah.

4921
01:58:51,221 --> 01:58:52,054
That's what's going on.

4922
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,193
Um,

4923
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:55,660
so how did you get you,

4924
01:58:55,661 --> 01:58:58,750
so you paid them to let you get into this?

4925
01:58:58,751 --> 01:58:59,111
I said,

4926
01:58:59,111 --> 01:58:59,944
look man.

4927
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:01,510
Instead of like you said like,

4928
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:02,020
oh that's,

4929
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:04,030
that definitely crossed my mind.

4930
01:59:04,031 --> 01:59:04,300
I was like,

4931
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:05,230
I'm just going to hire someone.

4932
01:59:05,231 --> 01:59:06,064
We're not live.

4933
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:06,760
Right.

4934
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:07,690
We're delusional.

4935
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:11,470
We say dark shit at the end of
that episode have like a lawyer go,

4936
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:13,840
hey that you guys went too far.

4937
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:14,380
And I'm like,

4938
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:14,710
good.

4939
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:16,390
Like that always makes me feel good.

4940
01:59:16,391 --> 01:59:16,840
Like,

4941
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,200
you know,

4942
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,850
I'm 40 I'm 38 years old.

4943
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:21,700
I just started a punk band
with Steve Lee and whatever.

4944
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:23,170
My Dad heard it and he's like,

4945
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:26,530
I've never been more embarrassed
of you in my head cause it,

4946
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:30,970
cause I have a Korean song where I was
like [inaudible] it's like you want to

4947
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:31,640
eat my farts,

4948
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,411
you want eat my part?

4949
01:59:32,411 --> 01:59:33,244
And he's like,

4950
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,960
you're a grown man.

4951
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:37,720
You're a grown man and
you just didn't like that.

4952
01:59:37,721 --> 01:59:40,240
His soul disgraceful to my country.

4953
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:41,290
You're my son.

4954
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,280
And he's like,

4955
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:43,710
I'm begging you as you're,

4956
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:44,591
I'm a fucking grown man.

4957
01:59:44,591 --> 01:59:44,840
He's like,

4958
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,420
I'm begging you as your father.

4959
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:47,680
Take that song down.

4960
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:48,400
And I'm like,

4961
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,233
yes,

4962
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:49,631
yes,

4963
01:59:49,631 --> 01:59:50,470
I did something right.

4964
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:50,741
You know,

4965
01:59:50,741 --> 01:59:51,574
it's like,

4966
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:55,150
so instead of having
a guy paid to be like,

4967
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:58,180
take this episode down or edit this thing,

4968
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:58,870
I'm like,

4969
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:01,510
let's just broadcast live
from a fucking insane asylum.

4970
02:00:01,511 --> 02:00:03,220
I don't think that's a
real disclaimer though.

4971
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:06,700
Come on the show.

4972
02:00:06,730 --> 02:00:07,563
I know.

4973
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:07,901
I know.

4974
02:00:07,901 --> 02:00:11,060
It's not Joe 51 50 right?

4975
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:16,510
Somebody have one of your employees just
go over everything with a fine tooth

4976
02:00:16,511 --> 02:00:19,090
comb and then apologize at
the end of every episode.

4977
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:23,710
I just do everything as it as if one of
these nut jobs is going to kill me one

4978
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:24,010
day.

4979
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:25,180
And she said the stack,

4980
02:00:25,181 --> 02:00:26,800
the podcasts that show shows,

4981
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:28,810
this is all the,

4982
02:00:28,811 --> 02:00:31,150
the negative nut jobs are all post this,

4983
02:00:31,151 --> 02:00:31,570
right?

4984
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:31,811
No,

4985
02:00:31,811 --> 02:00:32,350
I mean this is,

4986
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:32,591
I mean,

4987
02:00:32,591 --> 02:00:34,330
I've had critter for for a few years now,

4988
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:34,560
right.

4989
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:34,841
But I mean,

4990
02:00:34,841 --> 02:00:36,880
the negative nutjobs the escalator.

4991
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:37,690
I've,

4992
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:39,400
I've had haters in my entire life.

4993
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:40,170
You know,

4994
02:00:40,170 --> 02:00:43,780
people look at you like you're
not just a talented artist.

4995
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:47,410
You're talented artists that got
some crazy break where you you,

4996
02:00:47,411 --> 02:00:49,480
but let's traded the Facebook offices.

4997
02:00:49,610 --> 02:00:50,410
He gave you a shitload.

4998
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:53,170
I'm not gonna deny that the
Facebook thing was a crazy break,

4999
02:00:53,171 --> 02:00:57,400
but I've made millions of dollars in
like everything I've ever wanted to do.

5000
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:58,181
And so it's like,

5001
02:00:58,181 --> 02:01:01,690
did I get a crazy break over and
over again or did I just bust my ass?

5002
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:03,910
And like you don't just fucking go for it.

5003
02:01:03,911 --> 02:01:06,640
You know you've been very successful end,

5004
02:01:06,670 --> 02:01:07,150
right?

5005
02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:07,920
You've got a crazy break.

5006
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:08,411
Oh yeah.

5007
02:01:08,411 --> 02:01:09,760
I've been very successful and that,

5008
02:01:09,761 --> 02:01:11,590
and then so when anything
happens they're like,

5009
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:12,160
oh well,

5010
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:12,660
like I said,

5011
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:13,570
the way I started the show,

5012
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,531
oh well he's rich.

5013
02:01:14,531 --> 02:01:14,801
I'm like,

5014
02:01:14,801 --> 02:01:16,630
well what about my entire life?

5015
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:17,681
Up until then,

5016
02:01:17,681 --> 02:01:22,300
like was that a to marginalized people
love to find some way where you're not

5017
02:01:22,301 --> 02:01:23,134
better than that.

5018
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:27,010
The difference with the Facebook thing
in my life before was nobody knew how

5019
02:01:27,011 --> 02:01:27,844
much money I had.

5020
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:29,530
So when they went to my hoarder's house,

5021
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:30,850
like I had millions already.

5022
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:33,430
I already sold out a million
dollar art show in London.

5023
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:35,080
I had millions from gambling.

5024
02:01:35,530 --> 02:01:36,130
And like,

5025
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:37,810
but nobody knew and I was like,

5026
02:01:37,811 --> 02:01:39,890
so I can still like that's the best.

5027
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,180
It's the best Combo.

5028
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:42,830
You get to live a normal life,

5029
02:01:42,831 --> 02:01:44,360
but you're fucking Richard Shit.

5030
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,910
And then so you were rich
before the Facebook shit.

5031
02:01:46,911 --> 02:01:48,800
Even when I didn't have
hundreds of millions,

5032
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:50,390
but I had a few million and I was like,

5033
02:01:50,391 --> 02:01:50,721
cool,

5034
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:52,280
that's more than I ever
thought I would make.

5035
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:54,500
I'm selling paintings for
a couple of hundred grand,

5036
02:01:54,501 --> 02:01:55,334
like it was awesome.

5037
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:56,900
I go to Vegas and went a hundred grand.

5038
02:01:56,901 --> 02:01:57,410
It was like,

5039
02:01:57,410 --> 02:01:58,490
it was a very good life.

5040
02:01:58,940 --> 02:01:59,840
But now it's like,

5041
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:00,530
you know,

5042
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:03,530
if I go public now it's like
gimme my email right now.

5043
02:02:03,531 --> 02:02:04,221
It's Jimmy money.

5044
02:02:04,221 --> 02:02:04,850
Give me money,

5045
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:05,500
give me money.

5046
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:06,410
Do you ever get people money?

5047
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:06,801
No.

5048
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:07,634
Never.

5049
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,180
I hide it.

5050
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:08,630
I didn't.

5051
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:09,463
Well yeah,

5052
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:11,690
I have all my $100,000
I'm going to give away,

5053
02:02:11,691 --> 02:02:12,524
but they don't.

5054
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:13,250
I have to.

5055
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:14,870
I'm making you work a little bit for it.

5056
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:16,010
The clues,

5057
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:17,330
the fucking clues.

5058
02:02:17,331 --> 02:02:21,320
Recruiters cash contest or like the
dumbest like easiest clues ever.

5059
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:22,101
I was like,

5060
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:24,770
I want to make it all cryptic like
the game and make it super hard.

5061
02:02:24,771 --> 02:02:25,490
And I was like,

5062
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:25,671
no,

5063
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:27,440
I'm literally forced
feeding you the answers.

5064
02:02:27,441 --> 02:02:27,561
Like,

5065
02:02:27,561 --> 02:02:27,651
well,

5066
02:02:27,651 --> 02:02:29,240
what if more than one person finds it?

5067
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:30,410
We have a whole thing.

5068
02:02:30,411 --> 02:02:31,244
It's like,

5069
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:32,151
first of all,

5070
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:33,470
everyone thinks I'm hiding cash.

5071
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:33,741
I'm like,

5072
02:02:33,741 --> 02:02:34,940
I already learned from the Detroit thing.

5073
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:35,810
I'm not hiding cash.

5074
02:02:35,811 --> 02:02:36,740
I'm just going to give it to you.

5075
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:37,611
I'm hiding clues,

5076
02:02:37,611 --> 02:02:39,020
which is a red dot.

5077
02:02:39,021 --> 02:02:41,180
That critter spray painted at nearby the,

5078
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:43,670
the place you go there,

5079
02:02:43,671 --> 02:02:46,830
you take a selfie of yourself
in front of the clue with uh,

5080
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:47,270
uh,

5081
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:48,350
a current newspaper.

5082
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:50,150
And then the first 10 people,

5083
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:51,950
they get the points and at the end,

5084
02:02:51,951 --> 02:02:53,150
whoever has the most points.

5085
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:53,991
And right now,

5086
02:02:53,991 --> 02:02:54,441
like I said,

5087
02:02:54,441 --> 02:02:57,290
there's only like 10 people playing
and it's like the points are scattered.

5088
02:02:57,290 --> 02:02:58,310
So it's like anyone's game.

5089
02:02:58,790 --> 02:03:00,380
And I'm going to announce
the winner on Halloween.

5090
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:02,150
And then on November 2nd,

5091
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:03,313
I'm just going to,

5092
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:04,940
like on November 2nd,

5093
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:05,991
November 2nd,

5094
02:03:05,991 --> 02:03:06,824
two years ago,

5095
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:07,970
this is what happened.

5096
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:08,600
I went,

5097
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:10,040
you ever do an Ama on reddit?

5098
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:10,910
Yes.

5099
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:13,550
So I didn't even know what reddit was.

5100
02:03:13,551 --> 02:03:14,001
And everyone's like,

5101
02:03:14,001 --> 02:03:15,070
it's the front page of the Internet.

5102
02:03:15,071 --> 02:03:15,561
It's so I go,

5103
02:03:15,561 --> 02:03:15,921
okay,

5104
02:03:15,921 --> 02:03:16,790
so what does that mean?

5105
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:17,690
And they were like,

5106
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:18,351
you up vote.

5107
02:03:18,351 --> 02:03:18,531
And I,

5108
02:03:18,531 --> 02:03:19,610
and I learned what read it was.

5109
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:20,061
So I said,

5110
02:03:20,061 --> 02:03:21,230
I'm going to do an Ama.

5111
02:03:21,231 --> 02:03:21,860
I'm like,

5112
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:22,490
hey everyone,

5113
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:23,181
I'm David Choe.

5114
02:03:23,181 --> 02:03:23,811
I'm an artist.

5115
02:03:23,811 --> 02:03:24,561
They used to be a thief.

5116
02:03:24,561 --> 02:03:25,281
I'm a gambler.

5117
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:26,800
I want all this Facebook money that Dah,

5118
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:26,951
Dah,

5119
02:03:26,951 --> 02:03:27,410
Dah,

5120
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:28,243
asks me anything.

5121
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:33,850
I answered everyone's questions for 24
hours straight with live video response

5122
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:39,070
with a cast of 200 of my
friends and actors in midgets
and porn stars and chefs.

5123
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:40,910
And everyone I knew.

5124
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:43,010
And everyone was like,

5125
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:44,331
what just happened?

5126
02:03:44,331 --> 02:03:45,021
It would be a kid like,

5127
02:03:45,021 --> 02:03:45,501
hey Dave,

5128
02:03:45,501 --> 02:03:46,940
what's your favorite place to eat?

5129
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,690
I Dunno,

5130
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:48,890
let me ask Anthony Bordain.

5131
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:49,851
And he'd be like,

5132
02:03:49,851 --> 02:03:50,930
what the fuck?

5133
02:03:51,030 --> 02:03:51,863
I and I,

5134
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:52,970
so they knew that it was live.

5135
02:03:52,971 --> 02:03:53,630
I go right,

5136
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:54,463
I dunno,

5137
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:54,920
uh,

5138
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:55,671

5139
02:03:55,671 --> 02:03:56,504
seven to like,

5140
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:57,170
and they were like,

5141
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:57,801
oh my God,

5142
02:03:57,801 --> 02:03:58,521
he's talking to me.

5143
02:03:58,521 --> 02:03:59,240
You know?

5144
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:00,650
So the next day,

5145
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:01,940
like people started going,

5146
02:04:01,941 --> 02:04:02,361
fuck,

5147
02:04:02,361 --> 02:04:04,880
did you see this mother fucker
blew up the Internet yesterday?

5148
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,440
Everything got taken down.

5149
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:08,120
Everything on Youtube,

5150
02:04:08,121 --> 02:04:09,050
everything on Vimeo,

5151
02:04:09,051 --> 02:04:10,430
everything on live wire,

5152
02:04:10,431 --> 02:04:11,900
everything on red tube.

5153
02:04:11,901 --> 02:04:12,650
Like we,

5154
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:13,880
we put shit everywhere.

5155
02:04:13,881 --> 02:04:16,730
Like reinfected the whole
Internet for like 24 hours.

5156
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,990
It got taken down.

5157
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,093
Why?

5158
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:20,233
Um,

5159
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:21,681
I don't know.

5160
02:04:21,681 --> 02:04:24,920
It was just like tits ass,

5161
02:04:24,921 --> 02:04:25,460
but like,

5162
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:26,293
I dunno like,

5163
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:29,030
but I rent red tube is like a porn site.

5164
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:29,340
Yeah.

5165
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:31,370
So we put up the more racier shit there.

5166
02:04:31,371 --> 02:04:31,671
I don't,

5167
02:04:31,671 --> 02:04:32,180
I don't know.

5168
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:33,740
I don't know if it's haters over there,

5169
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:34,370
but it's like,

5170
02:04:34,370 --> 02:04:35,120
and then they,

5171
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:36,050
for like two years,

5172
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:38,400
they made my name unsearchable on Vimeo.

5173
02:04:38,401 --> 02:04:39,450
Like if you typed in my name,

5174
02:04:39,451 --> 02:04:41,910
like any like art video
or anything I've done.

5175
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:43,163
So I was like,

5176
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:45,390
I started getting paranoid and whatever.

5177
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:47,970
So then that's why I love
like [inaudible] whatever.

5178
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,830
Like I sound like I'm doing
a huge commercial for them,

5179
02:04:49,831 --> 02:04:52,080
but like I love them because
you could do whatever I want.

5180
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:56,190
So this year I'm going to
do a fucking live podcast.

5181
02:04:56,191 --> 02:04:59,520
That midnight starting
November 2nd for three hours.

5182
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:03,470
Then I'm going to go on a reddit and I'm
going to answer everyone's questions.

5183
02:05:03,471 --> 02:05:07,500
Same style with like hundreds
of my friends have actors,

5184
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,210
fucking famous people,

5185
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:10,350
support stars,

5186
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:12,480
everything for 14 hours straight.

5187
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:16,980
Then I'm going to fucking have us live
event where my band plays and we're going

5188
02:05:16,981 --> 02:05:18,270
to fucking have a huge party.

5189
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:21,180
And then at midnight I'm going to fucking,

5190
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:22,073

5191
02:05:22,110 --> 02:05:22,950
or close to midnight.

5192
02:05:22,951 --> 02:05:27,660
Like at nine I'll do another three hour
live podcasts and then I'm going to give

5193
02:05:27,661 --> 02:05:28,770
this fucking money to somebody.

5194
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:30,990
So 24 hours straight,

5195
02:05:30,991 --> 02:05:31,561
no sleeping.

5196
02:05:31,561 --> 02:05:33,140
I'm going to need red
bull or some shit that

5197
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:35,843
you should come by.

5198
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:36,451
Yeah.

5199
02:05:36,451 --> 02:05:37,170
What day is it going to be?

5200
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:38,820
November 2nd I'm going to be,

5201
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:39,210

5202
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:39,910
we'll talk.

5203
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:40,670
It's okay.

5204
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:40,810
I'm,

5205
02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:41,100
I'm,

5206
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:41,890
I might be able to do that.

5207
02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:42,570
Yeah.

5208
02:05:42,570 --> 02:05:43,590
Come by for like an hour or something.

5209
02:05:43,591 --> 02:05:44,310
That sounds crazy.

5210
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:44,560
Yeah.

5211
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:44,821
It'll,

5212
02:05:44,821 --> 02:05:45,600
it'll be fun.

5213
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,680
It sounds like chaos.

5214
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:47,340
Yeah.

5215
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:47,850
I'm like,

5216
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:48,111
I'll,

5217
02:05:48,111 --> 02:05:48,540
I'll like,

5218
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:49,930
I'll answer anyone's question.

5219
02:05:49,931 --> 02:05:50,101
You know,

5220
02:05:50,101 --> 02:05:50,934
like on the,

5221
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:51,780
the reddit thing,

5222
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:55,080
they ask like crazy questions
and then like if you ignore them,

5223
02:05:55,081 --> 02:05:55,890
they just up voted.

5224
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:57,130
So it's like the,

5225
02:05:57,131 --> 02:05:58,590
the number one question or something.

5226
02:05:58,591 --> 02:05:58,740
Right,

5227
02:05:58,740 --> 02:05:58,950
right,

5228
02:05:58,950 --> 02:05:59,520
right.

5229
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,100
I Dunno,

5230
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,933
it's,

5231
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:02,250
but once again,

5232
02:06:02,250 --> 02:06:03,150
don't have to do it.

5233
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:04,140
Like the pain,

5234
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:04,880
like the torture,

5235
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:07,050
but you enjoy all the chaos.

5236
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:07,990
You definitely enjoy it.

5237
02:06:07,991 --> 02:06:08,630
I live in it.

5238
02:06:08,630 --> 02:06:09,420
I live in,

5239
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:09,810
yeah,

5240
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:10,020
that's,

5241
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:11,760
I think that's why you live
in a tiny little place.

5242
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:15,300
He didn't move to some
suburban neighborhood in
Beverly Hills and set up shop

5243
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:16,134
and some nice,

5244
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:16,381
you know,

5245
02:06:16,381 --> 02:06:18,060
have a manicured lawn.

5246
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:19,460
You live like a crazy person.

5247
02:06:19,461 --> 02:06:21,120
It's manufactured misery,

5248
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:21,781
you know,

5249
02:06:21,781 --> 02:06:22,890
the whole lot miserable.

5250
02:06:22,891 --> 02:06:23,670
You're not miserable.

5251
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:24,480
It's miserable.

5252
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:25,230
In what way?

5253
02:06:25,230 --> 02:06:25,740
It's,

5254
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:27,210
it's smells so bad in there.

5255
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:28,120
There's,

5256
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:29,730
there's cockroaches,

5257
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:30,600
ants.

5258
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:31,141
But why,

5259
02:06:31,141 --> 02:06:31,980
why do that then?

5260
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:34,470
Because you know,

5261
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:35,051
you and me,

5262
02:06:35,051 --> 02:06:35,884
we could talk about like,

5263
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:36,091
oh,

5264
02:06:36,091 --> 02:06:37,980
you should eat kale and this and that.

5265
02:06:37,981 --> 02:06:38,370
But it's like,

5266
02:06:38,370 --> 02:06:40,320
I know at the end of the day
what I'm really going to do.

5267
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:41,820
And so if I sit here and go,

5268
02:06:41,821 --> 02:06:42,301
hey Dave,

5269
02:06:42,301 --> 02:06:43,890
forget all this fucking bullshit.

5270
02:06:43,891 --> 02:06:44,730
You've talked up until now,

5271
02:06:44,731 --> 02:06:45,660
your podcasts,

5272
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:46,590
TV bullshit.

5273
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:47,423
You're an artist.

5274
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:48,210
Okay,

5275
02:06:48,210 --> 02:06:50,430
so let's talk real talk
about you being an artist.

5276
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,120
How much have you actually
painted in the last 10 years?

5277
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:55,253
Not that much.

5278
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:56,161
Okay.

5279
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:57,480
Let's look at your entire life.

5280
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,400
When have you painted the most?

5281
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:01,380
When I was in jail in Japan,

5282
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:03,330
when I was in a cold,

5283
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:05,370
miserable place in China with no Internet,

5284
02:07:05,371 --> 02:07:06,270
no cell service.

5285
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:07,710
So the,

5286
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:08,310
the,

5287
02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:11,820
the combining factors of all these
places is that it was always cold,

5288
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:15,900
no internet and no cell
service and no one else around.

5289
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,920
So isolation,

5290
02:07:16,921 --> 02:07:21,921
cold and miserable and just that's
what it takes now because I,

5291
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:23,880
I am easily distracted,

5292
02:07:23,881 --> 02:07:25,170
addictive person so I can't,

5293
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:28,530
and I do have a lot of options
for pussy that I never had before.

5294
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:33,860
I do have all these things and it's
why do Joe's cross crosshatching of a

5295
02:07:34,741 --> 02:07:35,574
werewolf would like,

5296
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,710
that takes a long time
and I have it in my head,

5297
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:39,121
oh man,

5298
02:07:39,121 --> 02:07:40,030
I want to paint this thing.

5299
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:43,240
There's going to be a million little
people and they get this crazy tripped out

5300
02:07:43,241 --> 02:07:43,840
idea.

5301
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:46,720
It's going to take me like a week to
draw that the way I want to draw it.

5302
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:49,900
And then there's a playboy
model that wants to suck,

5303
02:07:49,901 --> 02:07:53,020
might left ball and a pen
house model that wants a sec,

5304
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:54,100
my right ball.

5305
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,173
And I'm like,

5306
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:55,960
hmm.

5307
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:56,741
Tough decision.

5308
02:07:56,741 --> 02:07:58,240
It's like wait,

5309
02:07:58,390 --> 02:07:59,290
that's what you know,

5310
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:02,170
drawing my whole life was the only
thing that brought me attention.

5311
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:05,560
And now I have everyone's attention
so let me fuck the whole world.

5312
02:08:05,610 --> 02:08:06,443
But isn't it?

5313
02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:08,240
It's like,

5314
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:09,073
you know,

5315
02:08:09,110 --> 02:08:14,110
so you were talking earlier about
your favorite thing is to create,

5316
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:16,863
but there's a,

5317
02:08:17,420 --> 02:08:19,950
there's a self destruct
thing that distracts you.

5318
02:08:20,430 --> 02:08:20,671
Okay,

5319
02:08:20,671 --> 02:08:20,931
let me,

5320
02:08:20,931 --> 02:08:21,631
let me backtrack.

5321
02:08:21,631 --> 02:08:22,464
Let me backtrack.

5322
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,170
My favorite thing is creating and pussy.

5323
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:26,333
So,

5324
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:27,150
and let me,

5325
02:08:27,150 --> 02:08:28,350
and let me just ask you this Joe,

5326
02:08:28,830 --> 02:08:30,000
cause cause you're in it,

5327
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:31,110
you're a comedian like,

5328
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:37,490
like the whole white Wa like is the
great art always come from misery.

5329
02:08:37,491 --> 02:08:38,990
It's like Jim Carrey,

5330
02:08:38,991 --> 02:08:42,050
Eddie Murray like do you
have to be miserable?

5331
02:08:42,410 --> 02:08:43,100
You don't,

5332
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:48,100
I believe you can make really good art
if you're well adjusted and you're happy

5333
02:08:48,981 --> 02:08:49,814
and whatever.

5334
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:53,900
But I'm talking about the great shit
that transcends time and whatever those

5335
02:08:53,901 --> 02:08:54,980
people are suicidal,

5336
02:08:54,981 --> 02:08:55,940
miserable fucks.

5337
02:08:56,060 --> 02:08:57,770
And then speaking just for me,

5338
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:01,970
because I know my best stuff
always came from rejection,

5339
02:09:01,971 --> 02:09:02,804
hatred,

5340
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:03,830
getting dumped,

5341
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:05,750
living in miserable conditions.

5342
02:09:06,350 --> 02:09:07,890
There's nothing about living

5343
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:12,940
in a 20 story like our 20 bedroom fucking
mansion in Beverly Hills with pools in

5344
02:09:13,641 --> 02:09:14,780
playboy models hanging around.

5345
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:15,950
That makes me want to create,

5346
02:09:16,550 --> 02:09:19,690
that makes me want to find getting
your ball sack by playboy playmates.

5347
02:09:20,210 --> 02:09:22,970
It's still the most amazing paradise ever.

5348
02:09:22,971 --> 02:09:27,130
It's not staying in suites and
Vegas and bang a $10,000 hookers.

5349
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:30,110
You talking girls in the fucking
you that never was sex workers,

5350
02:09:30,111 --> 02:09:30,381
sex,

5351
02:09:30,381 --> 02:09:31,214
sex worker side.

5352
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:32,480
I didn't say horror at least.

5353
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:33,783
Uh,

5354
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,550
I,

5355
02:09:34,550 --> 02:09:37,130
I'm not trying to change your opinion.

5356
02:09:37,210 --> 02:09:37,430
Right?

5357
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:39,760
But what I'm trying to say is you,

5358
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:41,990
you love a lot of different things,

5359
02:09:41,991 --> 02:09:44,450
but you definitely have a
self destructive streak.

5360
02:09:44,451 --> 02:09:45,284
But I don't,

5361
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:49,040
when I was a kid and I was doing standup
when I first started doing standup,

5362
02:09:49,041 --> 02:09:49,970
one of the things that I thought is,

5363
02:09:49,971 --> 02:09:50,300
man,

5364
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:51,620
I don't ever want to get enlightened,

5365
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:51,921
right?

5366
02:09:51,921 --> 02:09:52,731
Because if I get enlightened,

5367
02:09:52,731 --> 02:09:53,840
it's gonna fuck up my comedy.

5368
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:54,051
Oh,

5369
02:09:54,051 --> 02:09:57,260
where's my comedy was always my favorite
comedy was always like Sam Kennison and

5370
02:09:57,261 --> 02:09:58,094
Richard Pryor.

5371
02:09:58,130 --> 02:09:59,990
Troubled people are dirty people.

5372
02:10:00,350 --> 02:10:01,700
And I was always thinking like,

5373
02:10:01,701 --> 02:10:02,031
man,

5374
02:10:02,031 --> 02:10:05,150
you can never like achieve a
certain amount of enlightenment
because then you'll

5375
02:10:05,151 --> 02:10:07,430
never be able to do like the great comedy.

5376
02:10:07,670 --> 02:10:08,210
But I don't,

5377
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:09,260
I think that's a trap.

5378
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:09,501
Well,

5379
02:10:09,501 --> 02:10:10,131
check this out.

5380
02:10:10,131 --> 02:10:10,500
Like

5381
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:11,250
I'm at my,

5382
02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:12,210
I'm at my warehouse,

5383
02:10:12,211 --> 02:10:13,200
we're in the wintertime,

5384
02:10:13,201 --> 02:10:14,730
it's freezing and I'll be painting.

5385
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:15,721
And I,

5386
02:10:15,721 --> 02:10:17,910
and I remember thinking like,

5387
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:18,953
wow,

5388
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:20,580
it's two in the morning.

5389
02:10:20,581 --> 02:10:21,420
I'm miserable.

5390
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:22,171
Oh Wow.

5391
02:10:22,171 --> 02:10:23,850
I have a heated fireplace.

5392
02:10:24,390 --> 02:10:26,310
A woman just playing with their vagina,

5393
02:10:26,311 --> 02:10:29,700
waiting for me to go in there in a
beautiful house in Beverly Hills.

5394
02:10:30,150 --> 02:10:30,241
Oh,

5395
02:10:30,241 --> 02:10:31,440
I'm going to call it quits for tonight.

5396
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:33,920
Now I'm there still painting.

5397
02:10:33,921 --> 02:10:34,311
And I'm like,

5398
02:10:34,311 --> 02:10:34,790
wow,

5399
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:35,750
it's two in the morning.

5400
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:36,613
I'm miserable.

5401
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:37,490
And guess what?

5402
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:39,590
My house in Korea town still miserable.

5403
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:40,760
I'm just going to keep painting,

5404
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:41,690
you know,

5405
02:10:41,690 --> 02:10:44,180
so that to know that that comfort,

5406
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:45,080
like I say it all the time,

5407
02:10:45,081 --> 02:10:46,670
comfort is the killer of creativity.

5408
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:48,500
Like to know that that's there.

5409
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:50,630
Like it's not that I can't
paint something good,

5410
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:52,130
like something good is
still being painted,

5411
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:56,360
but it's not going to have the
level of intensity of like it know,

5412
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:58,880
being completely miserable and awesome.

5413
02:10:58,940 --> 02:10:59,291
Awesome.

5414
02:10:59,291 --> 02:10:59,480
Set.

5415
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:00,920
Exactly the same thing you said right now.

5416
02:11:00,921 --> 02:11:01,754
She's like,

5417
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:04,280
people try to make me feel
bad for being a porn star.

5418
02:11:04,281 --> 02:11:04,610
She's like,

5419
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:05,331
I love fucking,

5420
02:11:05,331 --> 02:11:06,860
I love sex and that I've offered her,

5421
02:11:06,861 --> 02:11:07,694
I was like,

5422
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:08,180
you know,

5423
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:09,770
cause we have dark spots in our past.

5424
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:13,640
Like I think there's a huge age gap
where I don't remember where I'm like,

5425
02:11:13,641 --> 02:11:14,750
is that why I'm so fucked up?

5426
02:11:14,751 --> 02:11:16,460
Did I get raped or molested or whatever?

5427
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:17,630
And she has the same thing.

5428
02:11:17,631 --> 02:11:18,010
So I,

5429
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:18,310
I,

5430
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:19,910
I go do lots of,

5431
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,260
uh,

5432
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:22,190
rich white people,

5433
02:11:22,191 --> 02:11:23,600
kind of enlightening,

5434
02:11:23,630 --> 02:11:23,961
you know,

5435
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:26,690
wellness camps and shit like that where
I'm always the only Asian guy in the

5436
02:11:26,691 --> 02:11:27,524
youngest guy there.

5437
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:28,551
And I said to her,

5438
02:11:28,551 --> 02:11:28,821
I was like,

5439
02:11:28,821 --> 02:11:28,941
hey,

5440
02:11:28,941 --> 02:11:29,990
if you ever want to do that stuff,

5441
02:11:29,991 --> 02:11:30,350
I'll off,

5442
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:30,560
you know,

5443
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:31,940
I'll pay for your therapy
and this and that.

5444
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:32,773
And she's like,

5445
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:35,870
I don't want to go and then
learn something and become
enlightened and then find

5446
02:11:35,871 --> 02:11:37,910
out that I actually hate
myself in hate porn.

5447
02:11:38,150 --> 02:11:39,590
So she's enjoying her life.

5448
02:11:39,591 --> 02:11:40,820
She's enjoying her life right now.

5449
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:41,341
Well,

5450
02:11:41,341 --> 02:11:42,680
people are very adaptive,

5451
02:11:42,681 --> 02:11:42,980
man.

5452
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:43,370
Right?

5453
02:11:43,370 --> 02:11:46,640
We're very malleable and we change
to our environments and you can,

5454
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:50,210
you can become comfortable and happy and
a lot of different weird circumstances.

5455
02:11:50,211 --> 02:11:51,860
And if you find a good state,

5456
02:11:51,861 --> 02:11:53,360
a lot of times people like this is,

5457
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:54,230
I'm good.

5458
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:55,250
I don't need no enlightenment.

5459
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:55,730
I don't need,

5460
02:11:55,730 --> 02:11:57,680
I don't even know consciousness expanding.

5461
02:11:57,681 --> 02:11:58,580
I'm good right here.

5462
02:11:59,060 --> 02:11:59,391
Well,

5463
02:11:59,391 --> 02:12:00,260
I'll tell you right now,

5464
02:12:00,261 --> 02:12:01,480
like I'm this,

5465
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:03,950
this a lot of people is
like really discipline.

5466
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,510
My friends and people close to me.

5467
02:12:05,511 --> 02:12:06,260
Like they're like,

5468
02:12:06,260 --> 02:12:10,460
oh well so sad and there
I only fuck hookers now.

5469
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,601
Like I don't,

5470
02:12:11,601 --> 02:12:12,620
like I've given up,

5471
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:13,633
like,

5472
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:16,250
I don't even want to say given up
because I am adaptive in this could,

5473
02:12:16,490 --> 02:12:18,260
what I'm telling you right
now could change tomorrow.

5474
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:19,580
But as of right now,

5475
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:22,400
I am working on animation TV shows,

5476
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:23,900
my podcast painting,

5477
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:24,980
working on my next book.

5478
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:25,640
It's like,

5479
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:29,480
there's no time in there for a real
relationship for kids I can afford.

5480
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:30,231
Like when you say,

5481
02:12:30,231 --> 02:12:32,150
why don't you just buy the best trainer,

5482
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:33,170
the best nutritionist?

5483
02:12:33,171 --> 02:12:33,341
I go,

5484
02:12:33,341 --> 02:12:34,070
guess what?

5485
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:35,930
I'm paying for the best pussy.

5486
02:12:35,931 --> 02:12:36,051
Like,

5487
02:12:36,051 --> 02:12:36,261
oh,

5488
02:12:36,261 --> 02:12:37,220
well you got to pay for it.

5489
02:12:37,310 --> 02:12:37,551
I go,

5490
02:12:37,551 --> 02:12:38,030
yeah,

5491
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:38,780
I'm rich.

5492
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:39,051
Yeah,

5493
02:12:39,051 --> 02:12:39,711
but they don't love you.

5494
02:12:39,711 --> 02:12:40,544
I go,

5495
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:42,830
you could've fooled me
the way these women said,

5496
02:12:42,831 --> 02:12:43,660
my Dick,

5497
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:44,710
like the woman,

5498
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:46,760
the woman who sucks my Dick,

5499
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:47,780
like that's in love with me,

5500
02:12:47,781 --> 02:12:52,781
that wants to have my children like you
when you give a woman fucking $2,000 and

5501
02:12:53,151 --> 02:12:57,170
she needs it and she knows if she sucks
it really good that there's 2000 bucks

5502
02:12:57,171 --> 02:12:58,004
coming the next week.

5503
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,870
She's sucking it like
she's in love with you.

5504
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:04,370
Like it's like that Dick is like her
lifeline and it's feels pretty good.

5505
02:13:04,371 --> 02:13:05,204
And guess what?

5506
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,350
And you've heard this before,

5507
02:13:06,590 --> 02:13:08,420
you're not paying them for that
and you're paying them to leave.

5508
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:11,480
So I get my dick sucked amazingly.

5509
02:13:11,481 --> 02:13:15,010
Like the chick is in her
honeymoon phase like this,

5510
02:13:15,110 --> 02:13:16,730
like the fucking veins on my Dick,

5511
02:13:16,731 --> 02:13:19,430
or like a lifeline UV into her system.

5512
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:22,640
Then she leaves and I
spend all night writing,

5513
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:23,540
drawing,

5514
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:24,320
creating.

5515
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,480
There's no like you were up all night.

5516
02:13:26,481 --> 02:13:27,081
You didn't call,

5517
02:13:27,081 --> 02:13:29,210
you didn't check in when
you need to take me out.

5518
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:30,103
And I'm like,

5519
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:32,580
I am fucking so much right now.

5520
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:34,170
Still fulfilling my,

5521
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:35,580
my sexual needs,

5522
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:36,414
sexual needs.

5523
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:37,590
And then at the end of the night,

5524
02:13:37,591 --> 02:13:39,720
I cap it off with another bull
job from a different drug.

5525
02:13:39,721 --> 02:13:40,554
It's like,

5526
02:13:40,670 --> 02:13:41,010
I'm,

5527
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:42,480
I'm sorry if that upsets you.

5528
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:43,583
If you're like,

5529
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:44,071
oh,

5530
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:44,570
well,

5531
02:13:44,570 --> 02:13:45,361
and it's the women,

5532
02:13:45,361 --> 02:13:45,931
they get upset,

5533
02:13:45,931 --> 02:13:46,260
they go,

5534
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:48,510
I don't see anything wrong
with what you're doing.

5535
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:49,111
This is why,

5536
02:13:49,111 --> 02:13:49,531
first of all,

5537
02:13:49,531 --> 02:13:50,001
I don't either.

5538
02:13:50,001 --> 02:13:50,940
Totally voluntary.

5539
02:13:51,150 --> 02:13:52,380
Everybody's voluntary.

5540
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:52,850
No,

5541
02:13:52,850 --> 02:13:54,750
no one's doing anything
against their will.

5542
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:56,160
They want the money.

5543
02:13:56,300 --> 02:13:57,390
You want to get your Dick sucked.

5544
02:13:57,420 --> 02:13:58,650
It's an awesome exchange.

5545
02:13:58,690 --> 02:13:59,160
Yeah.

5546
02:13:59,160 --> 02:13:59,521
You know,

5547
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:03,450
I have a real problem with prostitution
being illegal and this is coming from a

5548
02:14:03,451 --> 02:14:04,350
guy was daughters,

5549
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:06,090
but I don't want my
daughters to be prostitutes,

5550
02:14:06,091 --> 02:14:08,460
but I also don't want them
working at fucking Denny's.

5551
02:14:08,730 --> 02:14:09,001
I don't,

5552
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:09,590
I don't want them.

5553
02:14:09,590 --> 02:14:11,660
But working as a garbage people.

5554
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:11,761
Well,

5555
02:14:11,761 --> 02:14:12,181
like I said,

5556
02:14:12,181 --> 02:14:13,860
the women I'm fucking aren't like,

5557
02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:16,140
I mean they're sex workers.

5558
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:18,120
They're not like hookers
I find on the street.

5559
02:14:18,121 --> 02:14:18,931
Or like I go online,

5560
02:14:18,931 --> 02:14:19,621
they're just people.

5561
02:14:19,621 --> 02:14:21,060
I know that I've offered them money.

5562
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:21,601
Oh,

5563
02:14:21,601 --> 02:14:23,070
so there's like created,

5564
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:23,963
I created them.

5565
02:14:24,090 --> 02:14:24,550
Wow.

5566
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:25,710
We only work for you.

5567
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:27,023
Well who knows?

5568
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:28,033
Maybe.

5569
02:14:28,090 --> 02:14:29,910
Maybe I lit something up inside.

5570
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:31,760
That's a great gig though few,

5571
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:32,251
I mean,

5572
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:32,910
look,

5573
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:37,030
there's a friend that I'm
paying you money to go get up.

5574
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,640
Go like get away from me.

5575
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:39,180
Yeah,

5576
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:40,380
I really like you.

5577
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:40,921
You know,

5578
02:14:40,921 --> 02:14:42,900
it's not just like where's the
money and looking at the clock,

5579
02:14:42,901 --> 02:14:43,111
it's like,

5580
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:43,890
I like you.

5581
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:44,723
We had a good time,

5582
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:45,633
uses money,

5583
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:48,330
go to real estate school or
whatever you're going to do.

5584
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:50,040
But I need my time now.

5585
02:14:50,130 --> 02:14:51,960
That's what I'm paying for as a rich guy.

5586
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:53,340
I value my time.

5587
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:54,960
And that's why when you said earlier,

5588
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:56,280
what's the most you've ever paid?

5589
02:14:56,281 --> 02:14:58,440
It's like when I do fall
in love and catch feelings,

5590
02:14:58,680 --> 02:14:59,970
the worst STD you can catch,

5591
02:15:00,250 --> 02:15:01,083
it's like a,

5592
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:02,010
it's like,

5593
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:02,843
oh fuck,

5594
02:15:03,810 --> 02:15:07,500
I just wasted three months with the bitch
that just fucked with my shit and like

5595
02:15:07,501 --> 02:15:09,580
is like trying to like
play games with you,

5596
02:15:09,590 --> 02:15:10,650
me and fuck me over.

5597
02:15:10,650 --> 02:15:11,050
And it's like,

5598
02:15:11,050 --> 02:15:11,701
can happen,

5599
02:15:11,701 --> 02:15:12,020
right?

5600
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:12,141
Yeah.

5601
02:15:12,141 --> 02:15:12,990
It can happen.

5602
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:16,230
It can really happen and it can really
fuck you up if you get involved with

5603
02:15:16,231 --> 02:15:17,310
someone who's manipulative,

5604
02:15:17,311 --> 02:15:18,180
who wants to control,

5605
02:15:18,290 --> 02:15:19,140
and I live in La,

5606
02:15:19,141 --> 02:15:19,650
dude,

5607
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:20,311
I live in La,

5608
02:15:20,311 --> 02:15:20,910
you know,

5609
02:15:20,910 --> 02:15:21,743
and you've got money,

5610
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:23,160
so you're a target.

5611
02:15:23,470 --> 02:15:24,150
I look Joe,

5612
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:25,260
I feel like a catch.

5613
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:28,020
I feel like I'm a soldier and
I'm like in a war and I'm like,

5614
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:29,970
Chris Rock has this joke,

5615
02:15:29,971 --> 02:15:30,210
right?

5616
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:31,043
He's like,

5617
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:32,310
you don't wanna be the first anything.

5618
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:34,020
You don't want to be the
first black president.

5619
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:36,240
You don't wanna be the first
back black baseball player.

5620
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:36,840
He's like,

5621
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:37,920
I'm butchering his joke right now.

5622
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:38,430
But he's like,

5623
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:39,720
do you want to be Jackie Robinson?

5624
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:40,291
Nigger,

5625
02:15:40,291 --> 02:15:42,630
nigger this or you want to be
dealt with Darryl strawberry,

5626
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:43,620
coke,

5627
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:44,453
blonde whores.

5628
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:47,640
So like when I'm sitting here going,

5629
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:48,090
hmm,

5630
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:50,970
who was the only Asian guy that
fuck the white chick on TV?

5631
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:53,310
It's like one Guy Stephen
you and it's like,

5632
02:15:53,610 --> 02:15:55,380
we're like sort of the first everything,

5633
02:15:55,381 --> 02:15:55,830
you know.

5634
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:57,300
So it's a little bit stressful.

5635
02:15:57,301 --> 02:15:58,134
I'd rather be,

5636
02:15:58,680 --> 02:15:59,310
I'd rather like,

5637
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:01,020
I'd rather be like 10 other weird,

5638
02:16:01,021 --> 02:16:02,670
wacky Asian guys and then like,

5639
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:03,500
you know,

5640
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:04,590
and Jackie Chan doesn't count.

5641
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:07,890
I'd rather be like number
10 or 20 down the list,

5642
02:16:07,891 --> 02:16:08,161
you know,

5643
02:16:08,161 --> 02:16:09,690
like I don't want to be
the guy in the forefront,

5644
02:16:09,691 --> 02:16:10,524
but guess what?

5645
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:11,880
I'm not complaining at all.

5646
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:12,541
I am complaining,

5647
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:13,231
but I'm here.

5648
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:14,580
I'm going to do my job and,

5649
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:16,500
and I'm going to do it as best I can.

5650
02:16:16,501 --> 02:16:16,800
You know,

5651
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,650
it's like I had to
armchair psychoanalyze you.

5652
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:26,390
I would say that you spend a lot of
time conflicting with other people's

5653
02:16:27,001 --> 02:16:29,860
expectations and everything
is very conflicted.

5654
02:16:29,950 --> 02:16:30,160
But

5655
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:30,461
why?

5656
02:16:30,461 --> 02:16:33,070
Because you seem so free
when you do your own thing.

5657
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:34,270
But now this is the question,

5658
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:34,690
right?

5659
02:16:34,690 --> 02:16:37,540
Is part of what makes you enjoy your life.

5660
02:16:37,541 --> 02:16:42,541
The fact that you reject these other
people's expectations and their,

5661
02:16:42,721 --> 02:16:46,540
their definitions of you and you
get to live free on your own end.

5662
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:48,340
You're proving that you're successful,

5663
02:16:48,341 --> 02:16:49,390
you're creating great art,

5664
02:16:49,570 --> 02:16:50,500
you're having fun.

5665
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:52,330
You're podcast is well received here.

5666
02:16:52,331 --> 02:16:53,740
You're getting all this attention.

5667
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:59,080
You're David motherfucking show on top
of the fact that all these people want

5668
02:16:59,171 --> 02:16:59,650
you,

5669
02:16:59,650 --> 02:17:00,910
your dad's calling you,

5670
02:17:00,911 --> 02:17:02,560
you're embarrassing our country.

5671
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:04,000
You're fucking everything up.

5672
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:05,110
Girls are mad at you.

5673
02:17:05,111 --> 02:17:06,310
You're like fucking hookers.

5674
02:17:06,311 --> 02:17:07,360
You're a piece I shed.

5675
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:11,110
And meanwhile you're creating all this
great art and you're living in chaos and

5676
02:17:11,111 --> 02:17:11,930
squalor.

5677
02:17:11,930 --> 02:17:13,750
You've got George Constanza,

5678
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:14,471
I'm the guy,

5679
02:17:14,471 --> 02:17:15,251
not that guy.

5680
02:17:15,251 --> 02:17:16,000
I'm the guy,

5681
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,080
David fucking show.

5682
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:17,980
Um,

5683
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:18,670
I,

5684
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:19,210
this is,

5685
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:20,110
you're going to laugh.

5686
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:24,670
So recently I was having sex with this
girl that has a lot of lines on her

5687
02:17:24,671 --> 02:17:25,210
hands,

5688
02:17:25,210 --> 02:17:25,870
like lines,

5689
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:26,621
like not wrinkles,

5690
02:17:26,621 --> 02:17:27,940
but a lot of these lines.

5691
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:28,571
So I said,

5692
02:17:28,571 --> 02:17:28,890
hey,

5693
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:29,360
that's like,

5694
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:30,193
like a lot,

5695
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:31,480
like hundreds of unusual,

5696
02:17:31,481 --> 02:17:32,051
unusual.

5697
02:17:32,051 --> 02:17:32,351
So I said,

5698
02:17:32,351 --> 02:17:33,070
hey,

5699
02:17:33,070 --> 02:17:34,240
you've ever been to a palm reader?

5700
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:35,201
So she said No.

5701
02:17:35,201 --> 02:17:35,501
So I said,

5702
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:36,180
let's go to palm earnest.

5703
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:37,900
So we went to the palm
reader and I was like,

5704
02:17:37,901 --> 02:17:38,111
fuck,

5705
02:17:38,111 --> 02:17:39,130
I'll get my palm read too.

5706
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:40,211
And she goes,

5707
02:17:40,211 --> 02:17:40,601
what are you,

5708
02:17:40,601 --> 02:17:40,871
I go,

5709
02:17:40,871 --> 02:17:41,500
I'm lefthanded.

5710
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:41,741
She goes,

5711
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:42,850
let me see your right hand first.

5712
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:44,500
And so I flipped my
hand over and she goes,

5713
02:17:44,501 --> 02:17:45,334
wow,

5714
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:48,280
very enlightened internally inside,

5715
02:17:48,281 --> 02:17:49,540
like not much bothers you.

5716
02:17:49,541 --> 02:17:50,710
Very evolved like,

5717
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:51,521
and I go,

5718
02:17:51,521 --> 02:17:51,851
okay.

5719
02:17:51,851 --> 02:17:53,560
And she goes to flip over your left hand,

5720
02:17:53,590 --> 02:17:53,910
Shia,

5721
02:17:53,910 --> 02:17:54,743
whoa.

5722
02:17:55,240 --> 02:18:00,240
Externally you fucking complain about
everything and you whine and you bitch and

5723
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:03,230
your mouth is very blunt
and you get in a lot,

5724
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:04,360
a lot of trouble.

5725
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:06,250
And it's like I didn't
grow up around Koreans.

5726
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:07,360
I grew up around Jews.

5727
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:09,280
So that whole like Larry David humor,

5728
02:18:09,281 --> 02:18:11,170
like the whole woody Allen Shit.

5729
02:18:11,171 --> 02:18:12,220
That's what I grew up around.

5730
02:18:12,221 --> 02:18:13,031
So yeah,

5731
02:18:13,031 --> 02:18:15,640
I can shit sit here and like
fucking complain about everything,

5732
02:18:15,641 --> 02:18:16,780
but at the end of the day,

5733
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:18,093
you're right,

5734
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:18,820
it doesn't,

5735
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:19,930
it doesn't fucking bother me.

5736
02:18:19,931 --> 02:18:20,920
I am very free.

5737
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:24,450
I can just in one second say fuck
this podcast and just quit it.

5738
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:24,660
Like,

5739
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:25,180
ah,

5740
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:29,260
but I'm saying is I think part of
what makes you happy is this battle.

5741
02:18:29,980 --> 02:18:30,551
Definitely.

5742
02:18:30,551 --> 02:18:31,690
Well that's just being Korean.

5743
02:18:31,691 --> 02:18:33,040
I mean there's nothing
I could do about that.

5744
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:36,250
Korean makes you want to
a fighting chance things.

5745
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:36,550
I

5746
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:38,080
talked to Bordain about this on the show.

5747
02:18:38,081 --> 02:18:40,690
It's like they probably
have it in every culture,

5748
02:18:40,691 --> 02:18:41,620
their own version of it.

5749
02:18:41,621 --> 02:18:43,810
But in Korea it's called
Han and it's like,

5750
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,770
it's like genetic.

5751
02:18:44,830 --> 02:18:46,360
It's like you're just like,

5752
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:51,070
I have a friend who has adopted a Korean
son and he has his own kid and he goes,

5753
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:52,810
my normal kid is just,

5754
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:53,050
you know,

5755
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:53,920
cause he's rich and he's like,

5756
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:56,890
he all my kids have everything
they could ever want,

5757
02:18:57,310 --> 02:18:58,540
but this Korean one,

5758
02:18:58,990 --> 02:19:01,360
he just wakes up with a scowl
on his face every morning.

5759
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:02,171
I go,

5760
02:19:02,171 --> 02:19:02,441
yeah,

5761
02:19:02,441 --> 02:19:04,100
welcome to fucking Korea dude.

5762
02:19:04,101 --> 02:19:07,120
Like it's like you're
just like David Chang.

5763
02:19:07,121 --> 02:19:07,901
He's the genetics.

5764
02:19:07,901 --> 02:19:08,740
He's one of my best friends.

5765
02:19:08,741 --> 02:19:10,120
He's like my twin brother.

5766
02:19:10,121 --> 02:19:10,840
And he,

5767
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:12,580
he does like with cooking
what I do with art,

5768
02:19:12,581 --> 02:19:16,180
like just fucking goes at
it and he's very successful.

5769
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:17,440
He's like on the cover of time.

5770
02:19:17,441 --> 02:19:21,040
And all these magazines and the best
chef in the world and all this shit.

5771
02:19:21,041 --> 02:19:22,090
And when I hang out with them,

5772
02:19:22,810 --> 02:19:26,260
I mean he makes me look like
it's just piss and vinegar,

5773
02:19:26,261 --> 02:19:27,260
like fucking her.

5774
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:27,861
I go,

5775
02:19:27,861 --> 02:19:28,250
why

5776
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:29,120
are you so angry?

5777
02:19:29,330 --> 02:19:29,561
I said,

5778
02:19:29,561 --> 02:19:29,901
I'm like,

5779
02:19:29,901 --> 02:19:31,130
you talking to me right now?

5780
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:32,083
And he's like,

5781
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,940
come on dude.

5782
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:34,790
It's like all the keep
GNR bloat or whatever.

5783
02:19:34,791 --> 02:19:39,650
But it's Korea is a small island or
thought Ireland's a small country that's

5784
02:19:39,651 --> 02:19:44,651
been invaded by Japanese and fucking
Chinese and everyone's always trying to

5785
02:19:44,991 --> 02:19:45,741
take over Korea.

5786
02:19:45,741 --> 02:19:48,980
So it's like almost like a evolution,

5787
02:19:48,981 --> 02:19:52,430
like builtin hate system of
just being born like right,

5788
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:53,760
right.

5789
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:54,550
Took one day.

5790
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:55,101
Workers,

5791
02:19:55,101 --> 02:19:55,790
man,

5792
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:56,623
hard work.

5793
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:57,710
It's like,

5794
02:19:57,711 --> 02:20:00,800
I don't know that there's a lot of
similarities between Jews and Koreans.

5795
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:04,220
I think on that end know I
grew up with a lot of Koreans.

5796
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:04,571
Yes.

5797
02:20:04,571 --> 02:20:05,980
So you know what I'm
talking about environment,

5798
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:07,610
you know what I'm talking about right now.

5799
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:09,020
I mean I was,

5800
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:10,980
I was around Koreans constantly.

5801
02:20:10,981 --> 02:20:11,690
They're loud.

5802
02:20:11,690 --> 02:20:12,110
You know.

5803
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:17,110
The other thing about him is I've never
met more people like as a group that are

5804
02:20:17,331 --> 02:20:21,290
more dedicated to hard work and
like if you don't work hard,

5805
02:20:21,291 --> 02:20:23,750
if you're not miserable from
working hard all the time.

5806
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:24,140
Right.

5807
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:25,250
He felt like a piece of shit.

5808
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:25,640
Right?

5809
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:26,570
Like I had a friend,

5810
02:20:26,750 --> 02:20:27,660
he was on the national,

5811
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:28,281
my friend junk,

5812
02:20:28,281 --> 02:20:28,540
sick,

5813
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:28,821
junk.

5814
02:20:28,821 --> 02:20:29,420
Sick Chang.

5815
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:29,690
Yeah.

5816
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:30,351
He was a,

5817
02:20:30,351 --> 02:20:34,580
he was a national taekwondo champion and
at the same time he was going through

5818
02:20:34,581 --> 02:20:35,750
his fucking residency,

5819
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:37,140
medical residency.

5820
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:38,780
So this guy was always tired.

5821
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:40,730
This is how I would see him like this.

5822
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:41,751
Always tired.

5823
02:20:41,751 --> 02:20:44,440
And then he was just fucking workout
really all for it and then be exhausted.

5824
02:20:44,610 --> 02:20:49,490
He would be at school and he was training
so he would like be studying all day

5825
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:51,020
and then he would run upstairs.

5826
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:52,880
You run up the flight of
stairs at the university.

5827
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:54,830
He was constantly tired,

5828
02:20:54,831 --> 02:20:56,000
constantly miserable.

5829
02:20:56,090 --> 02:20:59,230
But he felt like if he
didn't live like that right.

5830
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:00,260
And I have to be happy,

5831
02:21:00,261 --> 02:21:01,040
that's in me,

5832
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:01,821
that's in my blood.

5833
02:21:01,821 --> 02:21:01,981
And,

5834
02:21:01,981 --> 02:21:05,840
and so let me take it straight down
to comedy and let me get racist for a

5835
02:21:05,841 --> 02:21:06,674
second.

5836
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:07,753
I mean,

5837
02:21:08,090 --> 02:21:08,721
people ask,

5838
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:09,321
I'm sure they ask you,

5839
02:21:09,321 --> 02:21:10,210
who's your favorite comedian?

5840
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:10,610
I'm like,

5841
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:10,851
okay,

5842
02:21:10,851 --> 02:21:12,620
forget specifics.

5843
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:13,700
Who's your favorite comedian?

5844
02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:14,900
Blacks.

5845
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:16,190
Jews and Koreans.

5846
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:17,411
Koreans.

5847
02:21:17,411 --> 02:21:17,540
What?

5848
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:17,960
Koreans?

5849
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:18,111
Well,

5850
02:21:18,111 --> 02:21:19,070
it's like Bobby Lee.

5851
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:19,920
Like,

5852
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,221
okay.

5853
02:21:20,221 --> 02:21:23,030
So if I take it just to Asians,

5854
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:26,180
there's not like Chinese comedian.

5855
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,000
I mean there are,

5856
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:27,350
right.

5857
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:28,850
But there's no Japanese big.

5858
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:30,320
It's like all the big car.

5859
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:34,040
Funny Comedians that are successful
in America are Bobby Lee,

5860
02:21:34,041 --> 02:21:35,150
Doctor Ken Jong.

5861
02:21:35,151 --> 02:21:35,690
Like they're all,

5862
02:21:35,690 --> 02:21:36,523
they're all crying,

5863
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:37,130
you know?

5864
02:21:37,130 --> 02:21:39,140
But I think it's like this persecution.

5865
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:39,850
Yeah.

5866
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:40,120
Why?

5867
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,290
Why is so Japanese big comedians?

5868
02:21:42,291 --> 02:21:45,620
I mean if I can't think of one right
now or why aren't there huge Chinese and

5869
02:21:45,621 --> 02:21:48,320
why or why are there so
many Jewish comedians?

5870
02:21:48,570 --> 02:21:50,390
It's just in here long persecution.

5871
02:21:50,391 --> 02:21:52,070
This torment part of the culture.

5872
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:55,100
This why is Howard stern miserable?

5873
02:21:55,101 --> 02:21:56,570
Why is Jerry Seinfeld miserable?

5874
02:21:56,571 --> 02:21:58,010
Why is Larry David miserable?

5875
02:21:58,100 --> 02:21:59,210
There's so rich.

5876
02:21:59,570 --> 02:22:01,940
You have nothing to complain
about your billionaire.

5877
02:22:01,941 --> 02:22:03,230
You have y.

5878
02:22:03,530 --> 02:22:05,720
And that's like sort of like
what you're asking me right now.

5879
02:22:05,721 --> 02:22:06,950
I don't know why I'm so angry.

5880
02:22:06,951 --> 02:22:07,784
It's just there,

5881
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:08,840
but it's like,

5882
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:10,670
it's just like,

5883
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,070
I don't know how to define like,

5884
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:13,430
I don't know why Jews are so funny.

5885
02:22:13,431 --> 02:22:14,750
I don't know why Koreans are so funny.

5886
02:22:14,751 --> 02:22:16,400
I don't know why blacks were so funny,

5887
02:22:16,401 --> 02:22:17,870
but what did they have in common?

5888
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:18,801
Persecution.

5889
02:22:18,801 --> 02:22:19,634
Persecution,

5890
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:24,910
misery and don't you think though
that like as Japanese and Chinese as

5891
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:26,400
generations

5892
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:28,350
go on and they become more assimilated,

5893
02:22:28,351 --> 02:22:29,700
especially because of the Internet,

5894
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:32,670
you're going to see more
and more Chinese comedians,

5895
02:22:32,671 --> 02:22:35,430
more Japanese comedians that
things along those lines.

5896
02:22:35,431 --> 02:22:38,850
Don't you think like as they become
more entrenched in the art form?

5897
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:39,601
Yeah,

5898
02:22:39,601 --> 02:22:40,110
maybe.

5899
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:40,531
Who knows?

5900
02:22:40,531 --> 02:22:41,070
I don't know.

5901
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:43,920
Did you could be a comic and
I'm not bullshitting you laugh.

5902
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:44,590
I love that.

5903
02:22:44,590 --> 02:22:45,030
I love it.

5904
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:45,451
Called you.

5905
02:22:45,451 --> 02:22:46,860
After I saw that video,

5906
02:22:47,070 --> 02:22:47,311
I'm like,

5907
02:22:47,311 --> 02:22:47,551
dude,

5908
02:22:47,551 --> 02:22:48,780
that shit is really funny.

5909
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:49,321
Thanks Joe.

5910
02:22:49,321 --> 02:22:50,154
I appreciate it.

5911
02:22:50,670 --> 02:22:54,770
That's your first time on stage with
those notes that you had on a table you

5912
02:22:54,771 --> 02:22:55,650
wanted to talk about.

5913
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:56,580
I doubled.

5914
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,810
My whole thing is always,

5915
02:22:58,550 --> 02:22:58,950
you know,

5916
02:22:58,950 --> 02:23:01,710
for me that's horrifying because you know,

5917
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,570
in the same way comedy solitary,

5918
02:23:03,630 --> 02:23:06,020
you're not up there with anyone unless
you're like smothers brothers and your

5919
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:07,080
comedy duo or something.

5920
02:23:07,081 --> 02:23:07,914
But it's like,

5921
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:09,860
I didn't want to have an act like,

5922
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:10,950
like when I come here,

5923
02:23:10,951 --> 02:23:11,784
like it's like,

5924
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:12,691
I was like,

5925
02:23:12,691 --> 02:23:15,500
I just wanted to make everyone sure
that I've actually given this away,

5926
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:17,040
this money and that's all I'm like.

5927
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:18,180
And then everything else I'm like,

5928
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:19,410
we'll just riff.

5929
02:23:19,690 --> 02:23:20,100
Right?

5930
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:21,360
It's like you can just,

5931
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:22,320
you know,

5932
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:22,801
I had,

5933
02:23:22,801 --> 02:23:23,634
so I was like,

5934
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:25,110
I want to go up there with no act.

5935
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:27,090
And then like I started
like writing stuff down,

5936
02:23:27,091 --> 02:23:27,630
but it's,

5937
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:28,470
whenever I write stuff,

5938
02:23:28,471 --> 02:23:29,850
it just ends up being like dicks.

5939
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:33,330
He's been drawing the whole time we've
been on this pie cross crosshatching the

5940
02:23:33,331 --> 02:23:33,680
ball.

5941
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,990
There's a dick with comscore,

5942
02:23:35,991 --> 02:23:36,824
it and out of it,

5943
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:38,760
this is the whole time
he's been on his podcast,

5944
02:23:38,761 --> 02:23:39,450
he's been drawn.

5945
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:40,410
So in the auction,

5946
02:23:40,411 --> 02:23:41,370
that piece off,

5947
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:42,533
ladies and gentlemen,

5948
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:43,830
if you see the uh,

5949
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:47,080
the closeup of me doing the comedy special
and it looks like I wrote some flash

5950
02:23:47,081 --> 02:23:47,470
cards,

5951
02:23:47,470 --> 02:23:48,780
they're all just drawings of Dicks,

5952
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:49,753
like on the side,

5953
02:23:49,970 --> 02:23:51,810
it's just so that's all that that was.

5954
02:23:51,830 --> 02:23:52,060
Yeah.

5955
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:53,100
And so I'm like,

5956
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:54,733
I'm like,

5957
02:23:54,780 --> 02:23:57,750
when I see the black guys on the corner,

5958
02:23:57,751 --> 02:23:59,250
like hit on every single girl,

5959
02:23:59,251 --> 02:23:59,520
they're like,

5960
02:23:59,520 --> 02:23:59,731
Hey,

5961
02:23:59,731 --> 02:24:00,564
what's up?

5962
02:24:00,820 --> 02:24:01,653
And I'm like,

5963
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:02,041
dude,

5964
02:24:02,041 --> 02:24:02,910
does that really work?

5965
02:24:02,911 --> 02:24:03,271
And they're like,

5966
02:24:03,271 --> 02:24:03,661
no.

5967
02:24:03,661 --> 02:24:05,970
But the one time it
works out of a hundred,

5968
02:24:05,971 --> 02:24:06,541
it's worth it,

5969
02:24:06,541 --> 02:24:07,200
you know?

5970
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:08,033
So when,

5971
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:08,460
when,

5972
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:09,090
when I was,

5973
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:09,923
you know,

5974
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:11,790
thinking about doing stand up or whatever,

5975
02:24:11,791 --> 02:24:12,624
I'm like,

5976
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:13,351
okay,

5977
02:24:13,351 --> 02:24:14,070
so if I get,

5978
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:15,390
if I bomb like the worst,

5979
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:16,011
like bill,

5980
02:24:16,011 --> 02:24:18,890
you suck and they throw oranges or I
don't know what they throw tomatoes,

5981
02:24:18,930 --> 02:24:19,410
tomatoes,

5982
02:24:19,410 --> 02:24:20,101
do they really do that?

5983
02:24:20,101 --> 02:24:21,070
I don't know her.

5984
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:22,613
It's like,

5985
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:23,821
okay,

5986
02:24:23,821 --> 02:24:24,400
so what,

5987
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:24,870
like hey,

5988
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:26,040
I already like pain.

5989
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:26,730
Like,

5990
02:24:26,730 --> 02:24:26,971
you know,

5991
02:24:26,971 --> 02:24:28,020
it's like win win for me.

5992
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,011
If I'm humiliated,

5993
02:24:29,011 --> 02:24:29,310
I'm like,

5994
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:29,850
oh,

5995
02:24:29,850 --> 02:24:30,391
I tried it,

5996
02:24:30,391 --> 02:24:30,910
I sucked.

5997
02:24:30,910 --> 02:24:32,670
So I just was like,

5998
02:24:32,671 --> 02:24:33,001
fuck it.

5999
02:24:33,001 --> 02:24:33,781
I'm going to go for it.

6000
02:24:33,781 --> 02:24:34,330
And I,

6001
02:24:34,330 --> 02:24:34,930
I,

6002
02:24:34,930 --> 02:24:35,311
I was like,

6003
02:24:35,311 --> 02:24:35,941
I don't want to act.

6004
02:24:35,941 --> 02:24:37,140
I know I'm talking to college students,

6005
02:24:37,141 --> 02:24:40,080
so I'll try to like stay on
college topics and how dumb it is.

6006
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:41,310
But um,

6007
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:41,980
yeah.

6008
02:24:41,980 --> 02:24:43,050
Who did that with you?

6009
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,430
What do you mean is just you,

6010
02:24:44,431 --> 02:24:44,970
it was just you.

6011
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:45,051
Yeah,

6012
02:24:45,051 --> 02:24:46,740
it was just me who organized that show.

6013
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:47,780
Um,

6014
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:51,720
so I get asked to colleges to
talk about like art and whatever.

6015
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:51,990
Right.

6016
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:52,410
And I,

6017
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:53,243
and I never do it.

6018
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:55,740
I used to do it a long time
ago and then it's like,

6019
02:24:57,130 --> 02:24:57,420
you know,

6020
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:57,960
someone's like,

6021
02:24:57,960 --> 02:25:02,100
David's very like almost like motivational
Tony Robbins kind of speaking kind of

6022
02:25:02,101 --> 02:25:02,401
shit.

6023
02:25:02,401 --> 02:25:03,234
And I was like,

6024
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:04,560
like some Tom who shit be like,

6025
02:25:04,561 --> 02:25:04,891
main,

6026
02:25:04,891 --> 02:25:05,730
you'll make my money.

6027
02:25:05,731 --> 02:25:07,550
And um,

6028
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:08,550
you know,

6029
02:25:08,550 --> 02:25:09,510
cause I know how to make money.

6030
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:10,080
Like if,

6031
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:12,600
if you stripped away
everything took all my money,

6032
02:25:12,601 --> 02:25:14,460
I could go out and figure
out how to make money again.

6033
02:25:14,461 --> 02:25:14,680
Like,

6034
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:17,550
it's not like I'm very
confident with that.

6035
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:19,230
So I'll,

6036
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:20,010
you know,

6037
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:20,791
when they approached me,

6038
02:25:20,791 --> 02:25:21,121
they were like,

6039
02:25:21,121 --> 02:25:21,391
hey,

6040
02:25:21,391 --> 02:25:22,110
we would like to speak,

6041
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:22,380
you know,

6042
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:23,213
you'd like to speak at,

6043
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:24,280
it's very prestigious.

6044
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:25,113
Bill Clinton,

6045
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:26,240
Dave Chappelle,

6046
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:26,861
Michael Moore,

6047
02:25:26,861 --> 02:25:27,571
all these people did it.

6048
02:25:27,571 --> 02:25:28,404
And I was like,

6049
02:25:28,450 --> 02:25:28,631
well,

6050
02:25:28,631 --> 02:25:29,291
what do you want me to do?

6051
02:25:29,291 --> 02:25:29,591
And they're like,

6052
02:25:29,591 --> 02:25:30,850
talk about whatever you want.

6053
02:25:30,851 --> 02:25:31,660
I go,

6054
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:32,920
well then I'm going to try stand up.

6055
02:25:32,921 --> 02:25:33,370
And they're like,

6056
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:33,611
oh,

6057
02:25:33,611 --> 02:25:34,600
we didn't know you were a comedian.

6058
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:34,781
I go,

6059
02:25:34,781 --> 02:25:35,614
I'm not.

6060
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:36,250
And they go,

6061
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:36,700
ah,

6062
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:37,540
this is awkward.

6063
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:38,081
And I go,

6064
02:25:38,081 --> 02:25:38,914
well,

6065
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:40,061
what do you mean?

6066
02:25:40,061 --> 02:25:41,110
Like you're going to tell jokes and stuff?

6067
02:25:41,111 --> 02:25:41,401
And I was like,

6068
02:25:41,401 --> 02:25:41,590
yeah,

6069
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:42,423
sure.

6070
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:43,900
And they're like,

6071
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:44,740
um,

6072
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:45,221
yeah.

6073
02:25:45,221 --> 02:25:45,611
All right,

6074
02:25:45,611 --> 02:25:46,060
cool.

6075
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:48,190
So you'd wear a nice red suit.

6076
02:25:48,310 --> 02:25:48,940
Yeah.

6077
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:49,870
And since I did that,

6078
02:25:49,871 --> 02:25:51,340
I did it five more times.

6079
02:25:51,341 --> 02:25:52,000
And it's like,

6080
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,930
it's so fun.

6081
02:25:52,931 --> 02:25:53,470
I can't,

6082
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:54,670
did you do it in Hawaii with Bobby?

6083
02:25:54,671 --> 02:25:55,710
And I did it in Hawaii.

6084
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:57,100
He that fucking asshole.

6085
02:25:57,470 --> 02:25:58,660
So he's like,

6086
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:00,280
before,

6087
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:00,911
before the show,

6088
02:26:00,911 --> 02:26:01,744
he's like,

6089
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:03,183
David,

6090
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:03,800
I can't,

6091
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:04,930
you're like a weird Warhol,

6092
02:26:04,931 --> 02:26:06,400
like artsy fucking faggy dude,

6093
02:26:06,401 --> 02:26:06,760
I get it.

6094
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:09,880
But you don't speak
the language of comedy.

6095
02:26:10,210 --> 02:26:12,370
You don't speak like I need a real,

6096
02:26:12,371 --> 02:26:13,420
I need a real opener,

6097
02:26:13,421 --> 02:26:14,254
Dave,

6098
02:26:14,460 --> 02:26:16,870
that you and my fucking brother
touching each other's dick.

6099
02:26:17,290 --> 02:26:18,123
He's like,

6100
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:19,330
you don't,

6101
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:21,880
I need the audience to get
ready for when I get on stage.

6102
02:26:21,881 --> 02:26:25,810
Like I don't want you up there doing some
weird artsy fucking fake rape shit or

6103
02:26:25,811 --> 02:26:26,171
whatever.

6104
02:26:26,171 --> 02:26:29,140
Like I need a real comedian and I go,

6105
02:26:29,141 --> 02:26:29,980
fuck you dude.

6106
02:26:29,981 --> 02:26:30,341
Fuck you.

6107
02:26:30,341 --> 02:26:31,360
You're such a piece of shit.

6108
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:32,963
And he goes,

6109
02:26:33,030 --> 02:26:34,390
oh you know it was last minute.

6110
02:26:34,391 --> 02:26:36,100
He couldn't find anyone and I said,

6111
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,420
hey fuck face.

6112
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:38,583
Guess what?

6113
02:26:38,770 --> 02:26:40,390
I've seen your standup 10 times.

6114
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:41,800
I have your act memorized.

6115
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:44,560
I'm going to do your exact
act before you got to go.

6116
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:46,140
What the fuck are you
going to do about it?

6117
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:47,231
And his face changes.

6118
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:50,020
It goes because I thought he
thought that's me being delusional.

6119
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:51,400
I thought he thought it would be funny.

6120
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:52,331
He's like,

6121
02:26:52,331 --> 02:26:53,164
don't do that Dave.

6122
02:26:53,470 --> 02:26:54,303
I go,

6123
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:54,881
he goes,

6124
02:26:54,881 --> 02:26:58,150
that's like me going to your like if I
had an art show or if you had an art show

6125
02:26:58,151 --> 02:27:00,790
and I had like the counterfeit
of that right next door.

6126
02:27:00,791 --> 02:27:01,031
I'm like,

6127
02:27:01,031 --> 02:27:01,271
cool.

6128
02:27:01,271 --> 02:27:04,300
Then I would just paint something
else like you as a real comedian,

6129
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:07,990
if I just sabotage your whole act should
be able to go up there and talk about

6130
02:27:07,991 --> 02:27:09,880
weird Hawaiian shit or like anything,

6131
02:27:09,881 --> 02:27:10,120
you know?

6132
02:27:10,120 --> 02:27:11,790
Cause he's funny enough and I,

6133
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:13,000
that's me being a weird guy,

6134
02:27:13,001 --> 02:27:14,650
like trying to push him and he's like,

6135
02:27:14,651 --> 02:27:15,484
please don't do that.

6136
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:16,031
And I'm like,

6137
02:27:16,031 --> 02:27:16,600
I'm not going to do that.

6138
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:17,433
You asshole.

6139
02:27:17,530 --> 02:27:19,060
So I go up and he's just like,

6140
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:19,961
can you do it?

6141
02:27:19,961 --> 02:27:20,950
Can you do 10 minutes?

6142
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:21,401
I'm like,

6143
02:27:21,401 --> 02:27:21,940
dude,

6144
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:25,930
I did two hours at UCLA without fucking
any notes or anything like this.

6145
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:27,490
And they had to kick me off the stage.

6146
02:27:27,491 --> 02:27:28,510
I could have gone for hours.

6147
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:33,610
And I hear those like Chapelle and those
guys do like the 14 hour legs are never

6148
02:27:33,611 --> 02:27:33,870
good.

6149
02:27:33,870 --> 02:27:34,120
Yeah.

6150
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:34,870
Yeah.

6151
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:36,910
So I go up there and I,

6152
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:40,240
and it's me and I did it like a smothers
brothers comedy routine with his

6153
02:27:40,241 --> 02:27:40,541
brother.

6154
02:27:40,541 --> 02:27:43,540
Like we just riffed off each other and
all the weird shit that happened just on

6155
02:27:43,541 --> 02:27:44,410
the flight to Hawaii.

6156
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:47,950
And so we're just killing and he's on
the side of the stage and he's like,

6157
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:48,911
it was like a movie.

6158
02:27:48,911 --> 02:27:49,960
It's like kid him off the stage.

6159
02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:50,801
They are fucking killing.

6160
02:27:50,801 --> 02:27:51,640
I don't want to follow that.

6161
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:52,240
And I was like,

6162
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:53,050
yes.

6163
02:27:53,050 --> 02:27:55,090
He didn't want to follow
you and want to follow us.

6164
02:27:55,091 --> 02:27:56,020
If you're listening right now,

6165
02:27:56,021 --> 02:27:57,850
Bobby fucking motherfucker.

6166
02:27:58,070 --> 02:27:58,690
Wow.

6167
02:27:58,690 --> 02:27:59,800
Fucking killed your ass.

6168
02:27:59,801 --> 02:28:01,050
You Little Bitch Bob.

6169
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:04,000
No Bobby's but Bobby killed after us.

6170
02:28:04,001 --> 02:28:04,834
He's the fucking,

6171
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:05,860
I love him.

6172
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:06,150
It's,

6173
02:28:06,150 --> 02:28:06,520
he's,

6174
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:07,660
he's just fucking,

6175
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:09,080
that's what I'm talking about.

6176
02:28:09,250 --> 02:28:10,270
He goes for it and you know,

6177
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:10,691
yeah.

6178
02:28:10,691 --> 02:28:11,710
Bobby Lee's the real deal.

6179
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:13,240
He's really crazy.

6180
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:14,680
The first time I met Bobby,

6181
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:15,850
I'm at Bobby.

6182
02:28:15,850 --> 02:28:16,181
Fuck.

6183
02:28:16,181 --> 02:28:21,181
It was like the nineties and Bobby and
it was in San Diego and he wasn't on mad

6184
02:28:21,891 --> 02:28:22,310
TV,

6185
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:23,480
wasn't doing anything back then.

6186
02:28:23,481 --> 02:28:26,240
He was just doing stand up at
the comedy store in La Jolla.

6187
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:26,720
Yeah.

6188
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:31,720
This is probably like shit
95 or [inaudible] 96 maybe,

6189
02:28:32,091 --> 02:28:32,450
I dunno.

6190
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:33,530
Long time ago.

6191
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:33,890
Right.

6192
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:34,820
And it was with a bunch of comics,

6193
02:28:34,821 --> 02:28:38,300
went to a strip club and she's Mexican
Gang Bangers to the Strip club and one of

6194
02:28:38,301 --> 02:28:41,360
them had long hair and
tattoos on his face.

6195
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:46,160
It was the 90s you had tattooed tears
on his face and he had eyes like he had

6196
02:28:46,161 --> 02:28:46,611
these eyes,

6197
02:28:46,611 --> 02:28:47,211
you'd looked in them.

6198
02:28:47,211 --> 02:28:49,670
You knew this motherfucker
had seen some shit.

6199
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,350
I don't know if he'd kill people.

6200
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:51,800
Right.

6201
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:52,341
I don't know.

6202
02:28:52,341 --> 02:28:53,180
I don't know what I mean.

6203
02:28:53,181 --> 02:28:53,901
I'm just guessing.

6204
02:28:53,901 --> 02:28:54,740
But if I had a guest,

6205
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:55,371
fuck yeah,

6206
02:28:55,371 --> 02:28:56,080
he's killed people.

6207
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:56,390
Right.

6208
02:28:56,390 --> 02:29:01,390
And Bobby somehow or another
insulted him by talking to his girl,

6209
02:29:01,521 --> 02:29:02,630
like there was a girl that like,

6210
02:29:02,631 --> 02:29:04,910
maybe it was his girlfriend
who was a dancer there.

6211
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:09,320
And Bobby talked to the girl and
the guy stood up and Bobby was like,

6212
02:29:09,321 --> 02:29:10,071
fuck these bitches.

6213
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:10,904
They don't know shit.

6214
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:11,120
Right.

6215
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:11,330
You know,

6216
02:29:11,330 --> 02:29:11,570
like,

6217
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:12,080
and,

6218
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:12,770
and I was like,

6219
02:29:12,770 --> 02:29:13,700
you're going to get me killed.

6220
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:14,833
I go,

6221
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,860
we're leaving right now.

6222
02:29:15,861 --> 02:29:19,040
You come in with me or I'm fucking
leaving you here and me and I think it was

6223
02:29:19,041 --> 02:29:20,060
Jimmy Schubert with myth.

6224
02:29:20,270 --> 02:29:23,570
We ran outside and jumped
in my car at a toilet,

6225
02:29:23,571 --> 02:29:24,220
a supra,

6226
02:29:24,220 --> 02:29:24,391
right.

6227
02:29:24,391 --> 02:29:28,130
We jumped in my fucking car and Bobby
like barely made it in time to get into

6228
02:29:28,131 --> 02:29:29,690
the back seat and we took off.

6229
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:30,830
I'm like,

6230
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:31,820
we're going to get shot,

6231
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:31,951
right?

6232
02:29:31,951 --> 02:29:34,400
Like I know the look of
people that will shoot you.

6233
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:34,671
Right.

6234
02:29:34,671 --> 02:29:36,350
And that guy will fucking shoot you.

6235
02:29:36,351 --> 02:29:36,620
Right?

6236
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:37,460
I'm pretty sure.

6237
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:38,420
But he,

6238
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:39,470
in a similar way,

6239
02:29:39,471 --> 02:29:40,304
he has that,

6240
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:41,990
this weird Korean energy and like,

6241
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:42,170
uh,

6242
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:42,950
like a real artist,

6243
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:43,840
like a real self.

6244
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:44,451
Like he says,

6245
02:29:44,451 --> 02:29:45,021
destructive,

6246
02:29:45,021 --> 02:29:45,401
complete,

6247
02:29:45,401 --> 02:29:46,460
super self destructive.

6248
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:49,990
Told some stories on a podcast
about going down to Mexico on the,

6249
02:29:50,070 --> 02:29:52,190
in the middle of Filming Mad TV.

6250
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:53,540
He would leave the set,

6251
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:54,560
go down to Mexico,

6252
02:29:54,561 --> 02:29:55,394
do drugs.

6253
02:29:55,490 --> 02:29:57,080
It was carrying a fucking kitchen knife,

6254
02:29:57,410 --> 02:30:00,350
get hookers come back gacked
out of his fucking mind,

6255
02:30:00,351 --> 02:30:01,580
holding onto the knife.

6256
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,230
Just completely wired to the
gills like at Mad TV globally.

6257
02:30:05,231 --> 02:30:06,770
The giant knife on him.

6258
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:08,600
He's just so fucking great.

6259
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:09,771
But yeah,

6260
02:30:09,771 --> 02:30:11,420
