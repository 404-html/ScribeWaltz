1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,680
There it goes.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:06,681
welcome to another stream.
Broadcast me motherfucker.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,000
Gotcha.
One.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,690
We only did one week.
We didn't fuck anything up and that was 

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:14,690
yesterday.
Yesterday.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,160
We completely had it together.
Joining me this week is my good pal.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,510
The very funny Mr.
Bill,

8
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,970
Burr,
Bill Burr laser gentlemen.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,920
What's up Joseph?
Do you might know bill from all sorts of

10
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,600
television,
standup comedy things,

11
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,620
the Chappelle show,
blah,

12
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:25,920
blah,
blah,

13
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:26,060
blah.

14
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,090
Well,
I was one of the funniest guys out 

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,090
there.
I love the 80 strikes back.

16
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,340
That's on the IMD CMDB page.
I'll have a failed pilot for some reason

17
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:38,290
on my imdv page were 10.
It didn't even air and somebody will.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,110
We'll start there

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,800
talking about anything we're sponsored 
by the fleshlight is a fleshlight.

20
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,870
Have you ever seen one of these bill 
burr

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,200
flesh colored flashlight.
Now this what it is,

22
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,470
Bill burrs.
You Fuck it?

23
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,740
That's the butthole versions.
Patenting Technologies.

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,550
Fingers frequent.
Okay.

25
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:00,690
You jerk off though,
right?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,970
I mean I assume right constantly.
Now why wouldn't I?

27
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,480
They would one on the way up to your 
house.

28
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,990
This is all about rubbing one out a 
fucking tool to masturbate with its 

29
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,030
instead of your hand.
It's a fake vagina.

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,390
This is the saying that you shouldn't,
you shouldn't,

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,440
you know,
I'm not against it,

32
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,630
but it's just odd.
You handing it to me the first minute.

33
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,660
He won't just try to see how you react.
Oh,

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,790
I hope you got a good read.
Yeah,

35
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,620
it's get a good gauge.
Now I'm into.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm into porn.
I liked the videos and that type of 

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,471
thing,
but I got to admit like if that's just 

38
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:36,930
those sex toys,
it's like very serial killer.

39
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,400
Like were you just sort of fucking,
uh,

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,950
a part of somebody?

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,990
There's nothing else there.
I know what you mean.

42
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,900
You went to the butcher and you're like,
yeah,

43
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,790
just give me a slice.
A crutch.

44
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,010
This isn't,
it doesn't have to lose pussy.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,710
It looks exactly like a pussy.
The Pussy one does.

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,780
It really doesn't have to.
It just has to be a whole.

47
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,180
Maybe you'd feel doesn't look like a,
a that doesn't,

48
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,490
that doesn't look like a button.
Hold it up to the camera.

49
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:02,190
That doesn't look like a bubble.
I think it needs a little work.

50
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,390
If it was a girl with a butthole that's 
got a problem because that sucker's not 

51
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:13,101
air tight,
you know that there's a little hole in 

52
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:14,310
there keeping after you ruined it last 
night.

53
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,840
I've never fucked,
fucked the vagina one.

54
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,930
I have never fucked the next CD.
I have never fucked this.

55
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,200
You just hold something up that'll get 
into Walmart.

56
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,590
They're the only ones left.
Fleshlight.com.

57
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,560
If you want to sell something,
go to fleshlight Dotcom and buy it.

58
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:33,860
But you know,
we were disturbed because uh,

59
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,150
we went to the website,
we could not find a black one.

60
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,170
They have only pink fake vaginas now.
You know what,

61
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:43,100
you could go both ways on that one that,
that,

62
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,750
that is either racist or white people 
get offensive.

63
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,850
Can get offended.
Like how come you're slicing up white 

64
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,301
women and turning that into little 
plastic pillowy things for people to 

65
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:56,850
fuck.
You know,

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,700
it should have like a swirl,
like a jet popping,

67
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,020
like there's

68
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,080
old putting or it's like vanilla and 
chocolate.

69
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,170
That's not bad.
The Zebra one,

70
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,530
hear my fucking mouth one,
two and yeah,

71
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:13,531
that other ones.
So you can finally have like a fake 

72
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:13,590
Banaji was fake mouse licking your 
balls,

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,000
whatever that is.
The flesh,

74
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,440
flashlight,
whatever you called.

75
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,660
It isn't a kind of creepier than it 
actually does.

76
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,650
Look like a vagina.
Look,

77
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,680
if it was green or something like that,
maybe it'd be easier to fuck.

78
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Dude,
that doesn't load enough to think about 

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:28,860
it.
Being a serial killer is sort of a thing

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,430
that really doesn't look like anything.
It doesn't.

81
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,230
It doesn't,
but the vagina one does.

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,540
It really does.
Fourth grade and made that you just as a

83
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,950
good father be like,
oh yeah,

84
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,700
I can see that.
Totally does you?

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,320
You have a lot of talent.
You encourage them.

86
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,590
We were saying yesterday that it's funny
that they sell the butthole version and 

87
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,170
the vagina version and what if the 
butthole version just so out,

88
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:53,171
shoulda vagina version.
They just canceled making them because 

89
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:53,171
nobody wanted to fuck her vagina.

90
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,190
Like 10 percent extra for the vagina.
Joe,

91
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:02,191
next time you fuck.
I try taking it out like fish in the 

92
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,851
bucket and it fucking it out of the 
plastic thing that with your hand so 

93
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:05,830
much better.
Really.

94
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,720
Brian has a tip,
but health.

95
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,340
He's like the Martha Stewart or fake the
tip.

96
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,530
You like review sex toys?
No,

97
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't review sex toys.
Only technology shit,

98
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,730
but I should.
I should have reviewed it.

99
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,400
You should totally do a full it version 
of a review.

100
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,430
When you fuck the flashlight,
I take the food blog to the next show 

101
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:26,430
us.
Show us she fucking it.

102
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,440
But you don't want.
We don't have to see your dick or 

103
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,951
anything,
but we should know that you really are 

104
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:32,951
fucking like you're naked.
No,

105
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,430
not even.
Take a picture right after you're done 

106
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,300
and we'll try to get the level of 
satisfaction.

107
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,220
Just feel my face the whole time using 
it,

108
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:44,221
but that's it.
Is there a fucking thing on this earth 

109
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:44,221
that's more disgusting than another 
dudes?

110
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:45,370
Loads.
If you think about it,

111
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,470
if you ever touched you in the guy 
pissing on you or shooting a load on 

112
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,161
you,
no brainer longer and you have a wash 

113
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,740
cloth right there and a stand up shower,
it's over really quickly.

114
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,510
That might be better.
Just a pool.

115
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,030
You just might be better when he's 
writing quicker.

116
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:05,540
It's just like get it done,
wipe it off.

117
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,720
You're not like sitting there for two 
minutes getting pissed off.

118
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,780
See what you're saying.
You get a laugh at the guy's face and 

119
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:12,780
he's like,
I see what you're saying,

120
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,830
but to me it's a dude just shot a load 
on me and I can't deal with it.

121
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,990
I can deal with the dude pissing on me.
That's an act of aggression.

122
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,730
A guy shooting a load on me.
He's like,

123
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:21,220
that guy basically just fucked me.
You know what I'm saying?

124
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,990
It just snapped from below.
You know?

125
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,620
It's just,
maybe it's just an accident.

126
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,950
He's marking me.
So an accident is how you usually market

127
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,720
animals usually use Peter Marks.
That's okay.

128
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:35,380
That's all.
Like I said,

129
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,320
that's an act of aggression and act of 
aggression.

130
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,540
Urinating on me would not offend me 
nearly as much as dropping a load on me.

131
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,650
That's just me though.

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,970
Honestly.
Things that I don't really think of.

133
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,190
What if it feels a long beard?
You know?

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,440
That's what I'm saying.
Asparagus,

135
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,500
pis,
four hours sitting in Yankee stadium,

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,640
drinking beer in the hot sun.
You're not.

137
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,040
You're not a sports fan

138
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,370
at all.

139
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,380
The only sport I was good at besides a 
mixed martial arts and boxing is pool.

140
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,830
I watched professional pool,
which is completely.

141
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,180
I actually am watching the NBA finals 
and I have to have the game on mute 

142
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,800
because I'm convinced the announcers 
hate my team and I.

143
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,840
It just.
It gets insane.

144
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,430
Do people get so fucking mad if they 
feel like someone's doing bias 

145
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,661
commentary?
I get so much shit from dudes who are 

146
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,150
angry at me because I called the fight.
As I see it,

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,080
I try to be as objective as possible and
have like no one's my favorite.

148
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,950
I don't want anybody in particular when 
I just want it to happen.

149
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,690
I have a bunch of guys that I love 
watching when they fight because they're

150
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:37,890
good,
but I don't,

151
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,390
I try to never like root for somebody so
I do my best to stay objective,

152
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:42,570
but I

153
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,710
cold like a fucking see it,
some tooth kid crazy just because 

154
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,940
they're so emotionally invested like me 
with the Celtics.

155
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,610
I want them to win and like,
you know,

156
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,560
like I haven't gotten invited to hey,
come on down and watch,

157
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,240
watch game seven.
It's like I can't,

158
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,750
I can't fucking deal with all these.
I'm going to sit there by myself and I 

159
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,551
have to watch it on mute.
I can't be around a bunch of other 

160
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,901
people because there's going to be 
people there who don't give a fuck or 

161
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:11,200
they or they're going to be rooting for 
another team and I will literally have 

162
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,160
rage.
No,

163
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,050
I've really been examining it,
like what's silly?

164
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,110
It is silly.
I heard somebody told me that I think 

165
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,480
Jay Leno said was I wasn't into sports 
and he was just like,

166
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:25,481
wait,
why do I care if the peanuts beat the 

167
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:25,481
Kangaroos and you know,
something like that.

168
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:26,360
And it just really sort of was like,
yeah,

169
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,490
why do I give a shit?
It's a trick.

170
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,070
People think that that the NBA finals 
are rigged.

171
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,560
Like the Kardashians going on tmz saying
the whole thing is rigged is going on.

172
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,700
Kim Kardashians,
Robert Kardashian.

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Robert Carnegie I think is the brother 
of Kim and he's like going on saying 

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
like,
you know,

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,250
the source that family,
one of the guys.

176
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,980
And so they got to reexamine the Warren 
Commission next,

177
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,240
take another peek at the Zapruder film.
Come on.

178
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Really the thing.
So the conditions looked into the moon 

179
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,331
landing.
Doesn't somebody off that in the 

180
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:01,331
Kardashians?
Married to an NBA player though.

181
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:01,590
There were.
Yeah,

182
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,670
that is true.
And the NBA also had a ref that got 

183
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:06,740
busted with mob ties.
And I love how they acted.

184
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,740
Like he was the only one I was just 
like,

185
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,580
you wouldn't notice that if you will.
Refereeing with them is 10 everybody up.

186
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:14,300
You know,
like if,

187
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,910
if he bet the under and everybody's like
falling out.

188
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:18,860
And I mean I know that's an 
exaggeration.

189
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:20,100
Every one of the easiest

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,420
games to fix,
you know,

191
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:23,160
they had a problem with that with 
professional pool,

192
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,280
with professional pool.
The only one time that a sports book 

193
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,060
ever put a line on the event,
I forget what casino was in it,

194
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,290
it was at,
but it was in vegas and it was a big 

195
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,290
tournament.
These guys are grinding.

196
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,290
They're out there,
you know,

197
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,810
professional pool player,
don't make much money,

198
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:38,250
you know,
even the best in the world.

199
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,720
So they,
uh,

200
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,530
there was an underdog.
This Guy Mike Lebron,

201
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,980
he hadn't won a big tournament like that
in a long time.

202
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,360
So they all got together and said,
Hey Mike,

203
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,470
Guess what,
you're one of the tournament,

204
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:51,471
we're going to fucking bet on you.
And they all threw in and everybody 

205
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:51,471
dumped and they all,
they all dumped.

206
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:51,540
Mike.
Lebron won.

207
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,420
They cleaned up and the bookies never 
put a line on pool again.

208
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,920
And they,
uh,

209
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,170
and

210
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,990
they,
they obviously figured it out.

211
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,920
Oh fucking everybody knew their driving 
balls into the rail.

212
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,720
They're fucking supposed to get out ball
in hand.

213
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:04,010
They don't get out.
They scratch,

214
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,600
you know,
there was a bunch of shots were digital.

215
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,950
They will obviously bad,
well you know,

216
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:14,951
they do their best,
but these guys a high level pros don't 

217
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:14,951
miss very often,
you know,

218
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:19,570
so they can fuck up and take a bad path 
on purpose and a path that gives them a 

219
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,720
high percentage of getting stuck behind 
balls or something like that.

220
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,120
So they make errors on purpose and you 
look at it and you're like,

221
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,890
why the fuck would that guy play that 
like that?

222
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:27,470
Like this guy's a top of the food chain 
world champion,

223
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,240
a snooker player got busted recently for
a taking a 300,

224
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,770
three,
300,000

225
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:38,770
euro bribe who's taken a bribe to a to 
dump a bunch of matches and this guy was

226
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,010
like one of the very best in the world.

227
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,680
He's like a top line and snooker players
make big bank.

228
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,090
But apparently it's accountable.
What was his vice money?

229
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,460
Took it.
I just want the money.

230
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:50,170
You know,
he,

231
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,560
he said that they've done it before and 
you know,

232
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,320
they got this guy on hidden camera and 
shit.

233
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,720
It was pretty,
pretty devastating for the whole sneaker

234
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,270
community because he's like one of their
starburst,

235
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,040
but all eight people who are in the 
community over there,

236
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,740
Bro,
you don't understand and giant snickers,

237
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:05,060
this crazy game.
It's like pool,

238
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:10,061
but it's played on a giant table at 12 
by six and the pockets are really small 

239
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:14,951
and the balls are really small and 
they're colored and I don't know the 

240
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,651
exact with mushrooms on the table.
It's not from the 70 percent of that 

241
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,220
bumper pool or something like that.
I do remember bumper pull.

242
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,420
That shit was ridiculous.

243
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,460
They had like little mushroom trees or 
something in the middle.

244
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,710
Little rubber ones to bounce it off it 
because you didn't have space for a real

245
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,711
table,
so you get one of these goofy fucking 

246
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:32,711
things was only 10.
You had to make it more difficult.

247
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:32,711
That's right,
yeah.

248
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:37,001
That was the seventies.
Everybody put some sort of reference to 

249
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:40,661
drugs right on the table.
Pool has always had a problem with 

250
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,170
people gambling dumping money.
That's like a common thing amongst,

251
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,200
amongst guys who bet like guys will back
pool players and the pool players were 

252
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,350
dumping and cut up the money because 
they know where they're going to win,

253
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,480
you know,
so that whole world,

254
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:55,481
the world of gambling,
when you get gambling involved with 

255
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:55,481
anything and there's a lot of gambling 
on pro basketball,

256
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,440
I would just assume it's rigged,
wouldn't you?

257
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,020
Yeah,
I mean,

258
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,760
you know,
I would think uh,

259
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,900
well I think the players make too much 
money and so it's very hard like that.

260
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,750
And the way,
the way to definitely do it is some sort

261
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,751
of authority figure on the court,
like know referee and umpire or 

262
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:13,910
something like that.
Given band halls.

263
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,930
I went to the game when a Kevin Garnett 
hurt his knee against Utah,

264
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:21,380
which I'm sure you still have on 
videotape essentially talking about poop

265
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,030
fan.
I don't even know those humans.

266
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,920
The referees were literally dictating 
the pace of the game and it made like,

267
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,010
no,
I'm trying to equate it to what you do.

268
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:36,011
Be like a guy had no stand up and all of
a sudden he was great at stand up and 

269
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:36,470
then five seconds later again,
oh yeah,

270
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,470
he doesn't have any.
It would,

271
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,540
it wouldn't make,
wouldn't be.

272
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,630
It's not consistent.
They will call and everything.

273
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:42,250
Everything,
everything.

274
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,090
And then you could just see them loosen 
up the reins.

275
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Then a guy would like literally take a 
dude's head off and they just had no 

276
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,120
blood no foul.
And then all of a sudden it was like,

277
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,010
did these guys bet as us.
It was almost like they bet like a 

278
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,640
specific.
I don't know what it was,

279
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:56,620
but it was one of the weirdest called 
Games

280
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,160
hasn't been busted for that though,
right?

281
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,050
Referees have been busted for doing 
things.

282
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,130
Well,
they had,

283
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:04,730
they had that referee and uh,
I'm sure if,

284
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,660
if other ones got busted,
maybe they kept it quiet.

285
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:09,960
I have no idea as usual,
I have like one story and then EPA comes

286
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,980
law,
spread it out over every sport to start 

287
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980
pontificating,

288
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,180
more interested in conspiracy theorists 
that I know because Bill Burr,

289
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,700
you'll start talking to him about it and
then five minutes and he'll.

290
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,070
He'll admit that he doesn't know what 
the fuck he's talking about.

291
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:25,750
He saw a youtube video like,
what's this?

292
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,070
What's up with this gps?
I'm one of the people.

293
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,050
He doesn't use GPS.
I called him to give him directions.

294
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,200
I go,
you got gps thinking,

295
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,610
I'm just going to give him my address.

296
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,500
Nah,
I got a Thomas Guide,

297
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,320
fucking Thomas Guide like a goddamn 
pioneer and like a pencil and eraser and

298
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,210
you're like putting compass like 
directions on.

299
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,250
So you guys are acting like I'm churning
butter.

300
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,890
You guys both had one like fucking five 
years ago.

301
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:48,990
Didn't show.
Yeah.

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,080
Well I did.
I get here.

303
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,990
I was on the issue

304
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,380
early,
early on with the GPS.

305
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:59,610
I had the first gps was a CD based GPS.
It was cd rom base,

306
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,440
so it only.
I only had a map of Los Angeles.

307
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,900
I've never even used those books.
I think I've just always used like 

308
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,961
mapquest and stuff and maybe before that
my mom would like write down the 

309
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,721
directions on like a Napkin,
but when I first moved here I had it 

310
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,390
written down on an envelope,
get here.

311
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,040
There was no problems.
It's very easy when I first moved to La,

312
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,340
but I haven't had one a long time for 
la.

313
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,560
That just seems impossible.
It is impossible.

314
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,970
There's so many.
You don't want to think,

315
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,971
don't use your brand.
Let the computer do a British woman 

316
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:30,010
telling me what to do.

317
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,910
GPS,
you think the GPS is possibly dangerous?

318
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I think it's a waste of money.
Then also one of my many non researched 

319
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,880
opinions is I just don't like that,
that the fact that there's some sort of.

320
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,880
I Dunno what they beam a signal up to a 
satellite.

321
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:52,881
It Burns back down through the 
atmosphere and into my fucking car and 

322
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:53,820
then somebody talking to me.
Actually,

323
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:57,810
I think it doesn't mean anything out.
I think it just is like a receipt like a

324
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,410
at you and it picks up what it's being 
beamed at.

325
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,840
You as the time of that say,
yeah,

326
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,870
I don't want to.
I don't want stuff always beamed at me.

327
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,940
No,
you're getting it no matter what you're 

328
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:11,940
getting right now you're getting into

329
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,840
see that if you receive it,
there's a beam coming at you.

330
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,760
Okay.
If there's something to receive it,

331
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:19,660
like a box,
like some sort of gps box car,

332
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,490
but all that's doing is receiving 
something that's already there.

333
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,160
If your brand is going to be affected by
it,

334
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,880
it's getting effected by what's already 
there.

335
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,000
No matter of the box.
You guys don't.

336
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:28,250
I,
I,

337
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,840
I have led.
I've led on the inside of my thing.

338
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,870
You guys.
I'm going to die earlier because you 

339
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:35,870
guys don't want to fucking use a Thomas 
Guide.

340
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,180
Why would you think the GPS would be 
dangerous though?

341
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:40,640
It's like the radio being dangerous or 
there's Wifi.

342
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:42,450
We're doing this word broadcast in the 
shelters.

343
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,110
Big

344
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,980
bottle.
You're drinking now.

345
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,330
It's more dangerous.
It is.

346
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:48,690
If you leave in classic Bar Room Point,
right?

347
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:51,490
They're plastic bottle is more danger.
Really.

348
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,390
Did you just got done doing research on 
that then?

349
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:53,880
Yeah,
yeah,

350
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:54,920
yeah,
it is.

351
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,970
Because actually,
like he said,

352
00:14:55,971 --> 00:15:00,971
if you keep it in your car and heat up,
being heated up in a warehouse,

353
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,710
hopefully done but,
but they say that if you leave one of 

354
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,091
your car and it gets really hot out,
it actually releases chemicals that 

355
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:10,091
especially for men are not good for you

356
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,920
if you have.
Even if it's just in here,

357
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:14,850
just the fact that it's in a plastic 
insert,

358
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,840
the chemicals are in the plastic.
Well now you're on my page.

359
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,440
I like how you're concerned about this.
That's what I'm saying.

360
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,610
You're not concerned about anything and 
don't agree with that dude.

361
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,900
You're gonna fucking die.
It always ends up going to that.

362
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,960
By the way,
he just quit cigarettes like a month 

363
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:31,960
ago.
So.

364
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh,
there you go.

365
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,760
Uh,
a buddy of mine,

366
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:38,810
I had a buddy of mine was giving me shit
when I went.

367
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,420
I was about ready to head out.
A friend of mine was a long story.

368
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,960
I won't name names what the fuck I was 
doing.

369
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,760
I was doing something.
We were going to go celebrate.

370
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:49,310
We're going to go get shit faced.
So this guy is married.

371
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,800
He has a kid,
so then he and he used to be a fuck up,

372
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:53,420
so I'm not married,
I don't have any kids,

373
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:55,190
and he sends me.
That sends me a text.

374
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:55,790
He was like,
you know,

375
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,960
dude,
it's pretty funny.

376
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,410
You know how like how,
how things turned out.

377
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,470
He's like,
I'm married and I have a kid now and a 

378
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,020
responsibility and you're still out 
partying and it's just like,

379
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,950
it's just one of those fucking people 
just because you have a kid,

380
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,170
they think that automatically makes you 
responsible.

381
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,380
You're still a fuck up.
You just have.

382
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,740
You're just passing it on now.

383
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,860
Well,
what's really funny is the nobility that

384
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:26,861
they attach to it,
and this is coming from someone who has 

385
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,811
two children,
but I used to get so annoyed when I 

386
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,050
would talk to people who had kids and 
they would compare their life to my life

387
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,830
there,
but like,

388
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:31,610
well look at you.
You know,

389
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:33,530
you're just a single guy just running 
around being the same.

390
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,830
But what the fuck do we have to make 
people?

391
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,960
Is there a shortage of fucking human 
beings?

392
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,880
There's 6 billion of us.
All right.

393
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:45,881
There's plenty of people,
you're not more noble because you're 

394
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:45,881
raising a person.
I commend you for it.

395
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:46,660
I hope you enjoy it.
I hope you,

396
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:51,661
you know,
you really commit to it and you raise a 

397
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:51,661
good person that doesn't turn out to be 
a fucking psycho,

398
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,210
but it doesn't make you a more noble 
person because you have a child.

399
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:58,211
Yet,
some of them think that they're more 

400
00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:02,201
just are doing the right thing.
They're not being silly with their life 

401
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:02,201
like it's so slow.

402
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:07,080
Guy Really wanted to go out and get 
wasted and he was jealous that I can 

403
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,180
continue to live my sad,
lonely life sticking in your face.

404
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,420
It's funny,
single person so that I.

405
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,370
But he's a good shit though because I 
called him up the next day.

406
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:15,880
I'm like,
dude,

407
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:21,150
you fucking failed a drug test like six 
months ago and you took a header up,

408
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,280
your front steps,
walking your dog down the street and you

409
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:29,281
had a red mark looking like fucking 
Jimmy Snooker and you're giving me shit.

410
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,020
Jimmy's.
He comes with a Jimmy slicker reference.

411
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:39,021
The superfly.
Remember that he would get on the top 

412
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:39,021
row and all that scar tissue.
Love you,

413
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,990
Joe.
He did have that scar tissue.

414
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:45,780
That's what the old school guys would 
cut their own forehead to bleed.

415
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,350
Oh yeah.

416
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,750
You know,
he's,

417
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:48,820
he's,
he's a,

418
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,890
he's to the rock.
The Rock is somehow related to superfly 

419
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,160
snuck,
I think.

420
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,070
I think that was his uncle.
You really,

421
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,410
if you could send me name me a cooler 
uncle.

422
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,340
The Jews.

423
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,070
Yeah.
Especially if you turn out to be a 

424
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,070
wrestler herself.
He was,

425
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,070
um,
Jimmy superfly snuck.

426
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,830
It was my favorite when I was in high 
school.

427
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:11,831
He was my number one.
Bob backlund was pretty good because he 

428
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:11,831
had a real wrestling stance.
I appreciated that.

429
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,310
He went in there and looked like he 
really knew how to wrestle.

430
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:14,840
He would arm drag dudes and shit.

431
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,410
You know,
like a lot of the characters.

432
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,070
It's almost like a joke writer hate and 
a performer,

433
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,430
you know,
he's in there doing like the was a real 

434
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:26,430
wrestler.
You know,

435
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:26,850
what really sucks about wrestlers 
wrestling,

436
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,940
one of the toughest sports in the world,
but there's no professional avenue for 

437
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:31,940
it.
They tried it,

438
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,930
they tried to professional wrestling 
league a few years back,

439
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,670
but nobody wanted to watch it.
It just,

440
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,830
it hasn't caught on when things haven't 
caught on.

441
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:41,220
It's very hard to get them to catch on 
unless it's something fucking crazy.

442
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:46,221
Like mixed martial arts.
Mixed martial arts is so crazy and so 

443
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:46,221
primal.
The ones that started getting on TV,

444
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:46,560
everybody's like,
Whoa,

445
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:47,670
Holy Shit.
You know,

446
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,700
it just gets everybody in.
You're not going to get that from 

447
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,531
wrestling.
But wrestling is easily more exciting 

448
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:54,531
than a lot of sports that are already on
TV,

449
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:54,531
including,
you know,

450
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:56,820
soccer soccer's not as exciting as 
wrestling to me.

451
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,340
I would way rather watch like really 
good.

452
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,370
Well actually I can defend soccer.
Not American American soccer is like if 

453
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,770
la plays like DC,
the Columbus crew again,

454
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,130
it's horrible.
It's horrible.

455
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,160
But international level soccer is pretty
good.

456
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,390
Yeah,
because now you're dealing with like the

457
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:15,310
shit talk and goes to a whole nother 
level.

458
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:18,370
You're talking,
there's wars one in lost between the two

459
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:21,490
teams.
There's Holocaust genocide,

460
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,270
that's true and fundamental and they're 
singing songs,

461
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:26,320
you know,
they go nuts.

462
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:31,321
They got the Elton John Scarves on would
you hit what's going on in there in 

463
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:31,321
Africa?

464
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,340
There's a,
I forget what country it is in Africa,

465
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:34,710
but two people have been killed in a 
bunch of,

466
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:39,711
been arrested for watching the World Cup
because it's like super extreme Muslim 

467
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:44,631
village that has a very extreme 
interpretation of the Koran and 

468
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:44,880
apparently the Koran does not allow 
gambling,

469
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,090
does not allow any sort of games and 
does not allow dancing and any of those 

470
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,000
things they'll lock you up for.
So this is considered basically no gain,

471
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,260
no happiness.
So they go and go door to door in 

472
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,650
arresting people for watching the World 
Cup.

473
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,480
Brian,
did you google that real quick?

474
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,730
Tell me what the fuck that is,
by the way,

475
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:04,170
how's that coffee taste?
It's great.

476
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,150
It's coming out of an animals,
but I'm loving that.

477
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,460
Really?
This is really good.

478
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Isn't it smooth?
There's a coffee called Kopi Luwak and 

479
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,310
it comes from the butthole of a thing 
called a palm civet.

480
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,600
This animal that eats coffee,
beans and shits amount and they go 

481
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,550
through the Gi tract,
the digestive track,

482
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,790
and they pull these,
uh,

483
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,840
these little beans out of his shit,
cleaned them up and sell them and they 

484
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,450
see they make coffee.
Adam in the coffee super smooth because 

485
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:33,510
get an insect the and no,
it's like a cat,

486
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,820
like a civic notice of it is,
is this big?

487
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,850
Fucking not bad.
It's a little bit yet.

488
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,240
This is bullshit.
No,

489
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,870
no,
it's true.

490
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,580
It's totally true.
Called Kopi Luwak.

491
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,730
Luw Ak.
It's not a cat.

492
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,140
Cat's a civic,
but it looks like a cat.

493
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,100
You know,
it's got a long tail.

494
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:50,770
It's like this weird animal that eats 
coffee beans.

495
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,920
So it eats the beans,
shits amount and then somehow or 

496
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,191
another,
I guess there were thought the beans 

497
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,081
were worth too much money.
Let these animals eat and like fuck 

498
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:01,081
that.
Let's not let them go to waste.

499
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:01,390
Like somebody must be desperate when 
they first tried it,

500
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,780
but now it's worth like a lot of money.
I probably wouldn't have tried it and 

501
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:06,780
let's discuss them with them.
What had been this Coffee Cup.

502
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,700
But then it has,
it has it added a new flavor,

503
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,320
changes the,
it makes it more mellow.

504
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,790
It makes it taste better.
It really does.

505
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,050
It's good.
Not that good.

506
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:20,040
I like my favorite coffees from Hawaii,
but uh,

507
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,090
I'm stuck it in his armpit.
Did you find the story?

508
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,090
Yeah.
Said Somalians are going underground or 

509
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,090
watched band soccer.
Is that what you're talking about?

510
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,390
There was a bunch of arrest to because 
of Somalia is fucking buck wild man.

511
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,370
You know,
that people's postcard of Somalia,

512
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:41,620
those guys that are just jacking people 
every day out there.

513
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,730
I know that we remember those guys.
Do you know what they're doing?

514
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,720
You know the whole thing about Somali 
pirates,

515
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,370
you know,
they're,

516
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:49,860
they're high on a drug.
They take this thing called cat.

517
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,330
It's like a plant that they,
uh,

518
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:55,120
they chew like the leaves of this plant 
and it's a narcotic.

519
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,120
It's like,
like crystal meth for like the boy 

520
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,120
soldiers over there.
I don't know what's the boy soldiers.

521
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,170
That's like when you're eight years old,
but you're a soldier.

522
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,950
Oh,
well yeah.

523
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:05,290
I mean there's the war out over there.
It's incredible.

524
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,590
You see dudes with like hyenas on chains
and they're carrying around fucking 

525
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,760
rocket launchers to on the streets.
I mean someone like Liberia,

526
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,080
like some of the videos about you ever 
seen the vice guide series online?

527
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,250
These guys that go to the,
some of the craziest fucking places in 

528
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:23,250
the world and you see someone the 
nuttiest shit,

529
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,810
like they went to the Arctic circle with
this guy who lives up there in a fucking

530
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,270
cabin in the arctic circle and then Hans
Caribou all day.

531
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,540
That's all he does is he hunts and eats 
and and eats sort of happens when you 

532
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,051
tap out.
This guy's been there for 30 years 

533
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:37,051
though.

534
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:37,630
It's really fascinating.
But anyway,

535
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:42,631
they went to North Korea and they also 
went to Liberia in Liberia is fucking 

536
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,860
crazy.
They are the first of all,

537
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:47,160
there's been.
There's been war in Liberia forever.

538
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,170
Liberia was basically founded the,
from what I understand is they had 

539
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,441
American slaves.
They let go and they sent them back to 

540
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,790
Africa and they formed Liberia and the 
UN was there until really recently,

541
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,380
like 10,
20 years ago or something like that.

542
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,500
And now they're gone.
And the place is just chaos,

543
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,740
it's just war and cannibalism is running
rampant.

544
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,480
They're eating each other left and 
right.

545
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,470
They sell like human food on the corner 
like human meat and people don't know it

546
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,590
and they buy it and guys turn people in 
and there's this one guy,

547
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,830
his name was general but naked because 
he would go to war and he would get 

548
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,630
buttoned naked and he believed that he 
could not be killed because he would eat

549
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,110
the blood and flesh of an innocent child
of the enemy.

550
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,050
So they would go to the enemy's camp,
they would steal a child,

551
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,340
killed the child and eat,
eat,

552
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,370
eat a piece of his fucking heart because
they felt like they wouldn't be able to 

553
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:35,710
die in combat.
This is a god that's alive right now.

554
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,640
It sounds like a plan.

555
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,770
No.
Realize how fucking crazy the world can 

556
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:43,770
be until you watch what's going on in 
Africa.

557
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,010
Uh,
yeah.

558
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,620
I mean,

559
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,950
I dunno,
I,

560
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,870
I take a lot of comfort in knowing that 
I can only die once.

561
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,610
How do you think?
What did I don't think like you,

562
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,630
you work out too much.
You wouldn't be worth.

563
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,130
He is the job like a flank steak,
you know,

564
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,890
just some tough piece of meat.
You don't want to.

565
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,820
You want be more ideas will be 
delicious.

566
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,850
Oh,
you'd be like veal and he could sell 

567
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:11,990
them for days.

568
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,500
If you think about the way Africa is 
right now with a lot of countries like 

569
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,530
Liberia and Somalia,
it really is like the apocalypse.

570
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,900
Like if that was going on right here,
if that was over here,

571
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:22,200
if we,
if we were in,

572
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:22,970
in,
you know,

573
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,040
in fucking North Hollywood,
there was gangs that were eating each 

574
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,290
other and fucking shooting at each other
and walking down the street with hyenas.

575
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,070
We would go,
okay,

576
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,600
the end is here.
This is the end.

577
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Yeah,
but you know what I love about that 

578
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:37,640
shit.
Those are the guys who win all these.

579
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,040
Who's that?
Not Bill bixby.

580
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,090
What the hell's the name of that guy?
The guy with the.

581
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,210
He's been riding a bicycle out here 
forever.

582
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,410
Solar panels in Bill Bixby,
a Ed Begley Jr.

583
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm bad with the names and show.
Yeah,

584
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,500
he,
he's goIng to be at the apocalypse.

585
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:56,940
Comes.
He's going to be fucked.

586
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,960
I have this theory that people who 
gather all this shit for it.

587
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:05,160
If you don't have a,
you need a militia because if you don't,

588
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:08,190
all you're doing is you're just turning 
your house into a supply room.

589
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,450
A target for the toughest guys who'd 
come down the block and then just take 

590
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:13,450
it from you.
My car,

591
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:18,530
my car has like walkie talkies in it.
It's got fucking like every single 

592
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,720
thing.
I like sleeping bags just in case I've 

593
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,430
had to escape this city real quick,
but it's starting to get retarded.

594
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,580
Like I haven't like batteries that could
recharge by this sign and stuff like 

595
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,271
that.
Do you realize the level of heads up 

596
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:34,611
that you.
How on the inside you'd have to be that 

597
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:36,090
this entire city wouldn't be like 
gridlock of people leaving?

598
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:36,740
Yeah.

599
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,590
Yeah.
Oh,

600
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:42,591
this city would be the worst ever.
They don't even know how many people in 

601
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:42,591
la.
That's why I won't fill out the census.

602
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:42,890
They're like,
you know,

603
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:45,060
filling out the census so you fit the 
fuck is the point.

604
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,480
There's about $20,
million mexicans that you don't have a 

605
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,921
count on,
like they literally have no idea how 

606
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,331
many mexicans are here.
It's fucking just a flat out guests and 

607
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:56,790
I'm not shitting on mexicans.
Yeah,

608
00:25:56,791 --> 00:26:00,840
I would do the goddamn same thing.
My grandparents were immigrants.

609
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,760
I would be.
I got no problem with immigration.

610
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,490
I don't even believe in countries.
I think the whole thing is ridiculous.

611
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,020
I mean,
I think if they came over here,

612
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:08,010
yeah,
I would fuck things up,

613
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:09,060
but you know what?
It's really.

614
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:14,061
That's how it's supposed to be.
You're not supposed to keep people 

615
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:14,061
impoverished in a shitty place just 
because you know you,

616
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:18,901
you know,
you claim this patch of dirt and don't 

617
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:18,901
let them over here.
I think that's ridiculous.

618
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:22,570
You know,
if there weren't countries and you were 

619
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:22,570
just allowed to just sort of cruise 
around,

620
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:22,570
like where would you go?

621
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,240
That would be the problem was things 
would.

622
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:30,290
they would level out.
The problem is you let people go and 

623
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,971
move to wherever they want and people 
are always going to move to the place 

624
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:34,190
where it's better and they're going to 
abandon their shitty place,

625
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,370
but if you don't allow them,
they have to stay in a shitty place and 

626
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:39,370
make their shitty place better,
which they never going to fucking do.

627
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,500
So you ensure that there's always going 
to be levels of people.

628
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,980
The only way to keep levels other than 
that is just fuCking be heavily armed.

629
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,250
You have to be armed to the teeth.
Your whole town would have to be an 

630
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,250
armory,
you know,

631
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,740
like literally if you wanted to keep 
people out,

632
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,740
you would have to like constantly be 
shooting people constantly.

633
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:56,190
THe weapons

634
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
they have now,
it's,

635
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:02,201
it's,
I just love how they've been stealing 

636
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:04,821
money from our paychecks to basically 
invent these weapons that will make it 

637
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:06,090
impossible for.
They'll never be another revolution.

638
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,020
No,
other than,

639
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:07,980
you know,
is doing it right.

640
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:10,650
Is that guy out there in the carolinas,
the blackwater guy,

641
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,250
whatever.
Whatever the fuck it's called when we're

642
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,270
talking about it,
that bill bixby guy on that fucking dude

643
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:23,460
who he buys like oldf sixteens and old 
tanks and he basically,

644
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:28,461
they're saying if he wanted to,
could take over the white house in all 

645
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,660
of dc by the time they fucking 
responded.

646
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,120
Who the fuck Is this guy?
He's fucking iza.

647
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,340
No

648
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,860
black water.
So this is a private contractor.

649
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,200
I believe.
Jesus christ.

650
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,760
I can't believe you haven't heard of the
guy.

651
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,070
Well,
I know the.

652
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,800
There's a one

653
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,900
comedy central has a development deal 
with.

654
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,000
He's still,
he's the final guy in show business.

655
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,150
He was funny.
They would do it.

656
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,110
Yeah.
He has like a.

657
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,170
He's got like his own thing.
It.

658
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,630
Did it come up,
prince,

659
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,040
isn't that a guy that got popped for 
murder?

660
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,810
He's uh,
he's being processed from.

661
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,230
Well,
he,

662
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,000
he's the guy.
He actually has his own hit basically.

663
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:08,840
I,
from what I've heard,

664
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:13,841
has his own militia and actually hired.
He gets hired out by the us government 

665
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:17,270
for them to go over there when they want
to do some covert extra filthy shit.

666
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,280
This is the worst.

667
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,760
I have a friend who went over there who 
worked for who he worked for blackwater.

668
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,500
He went over there twice to two seconds 
ago.

669
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:25,710
You asked me who they were.
No,

670
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,550
I know who blackwater is.
I don't know who this guy is that stores

671
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:31,190
all these weapons.
And the head guy.

672
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Well I have a friend who he was,
he was a sniper in the marines and when 

673
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,510
he got out he went back over.
He went back,

674
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,880
I think he went to both Afghanistan and 
Iraq,

675
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,910
but he definitely went to Afghanistan.
He went twice for money because he was 

676
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,840
opening up a gym and mixed martial arts 
gym and he needed some cash.

677
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,470
So It just went over there for a few 
months and he made some ridiculous 

678
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,440
amount of money,
like something like $10,000

679
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,910
a month or something like that.
It was a lot of money.

680
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,190
So for him,
and they'd go over for a couple months,

681
00:28:58,191 --> 00:28:59,540
make 30 grand,
you know,

682
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,570
did he do like the stereotypical go up 
in the bell tower he had.

683
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,710
He was in a bell tower.
There was times where he was in the 

684
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,710
tower.

685
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,370
Uh,
it's erik prince is the owner of a 

686
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:12,370
blackwater,
so I'm guessing that's,

687
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,320
that's the guy that's in trouble,
right?

688
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:18,350
Right.
And he's like fleeing and he's in 

689
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,110
trouble.
They had to take him down because he got

690
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:24,111
too powerful because he could basically,
that guy could write out any sort of 

691
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,070
uprising,
any sort of craziness to me went crazy.

692
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,090
Whatever.
It's just like,

693
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:35,091
yeah,
well I got guns and an endless bag of a 

694
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:35,091
snow peas,

695
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:38,520
a bunch of mercenary loyalty based 
forever.

696
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,820
You know,
you've been paying these guys to do all 

697
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:43,820
these for you overseas.

698
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,530
They're all murderers for you and you 
know,

699
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:45,970
you keep those guys on the line and say,
hey,

700
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:47,020
you know,
we're gonna run this shit,

701
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm going to take care of you.
You take care of me,

702
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,230
you know,
semper fi motherfucker,

703
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,240
black water for life,
the whole deal.

704
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,120
And then they go down,
they can defend it.

705
00:29:55,121 --> 00:30:00,121
But then when it always ends up 
happening is eventually is somebody 

706
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:03,211
always wants you to title.
So someone would want to be him and 

707
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,510
that's how it goes down.
It goes down to Mexico,

708
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,430
the drugstore,
you know,

709
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,640
it's just a matter of time before 
something happens with one of those 

710
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,041
fucking guys.
You've got a guy who's got that much 

711
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,721
power,
that many jets and fucking machine guns 

712
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:15,721
and tanks and shit.
It's going to get a little nutty.

713
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:15,850
I.
You start using them.

714
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,850
You know what I mean?
It's like you bought a bag of fireworks.

715
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,850
Just going to stick them in the corner.
you better wait till the next 4th of 

716
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,390
July.
You're not occasionally going to light 

717
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:27,390
off and mad.
oh,

718
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:27,900
they like to use them.
Have you ever seen,

719
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,970
this is the first time in human history 
or rather in the history of the United 

720
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,850
States,
so we've had to deal with mercenaries.

721
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,730
We haven't had merce rent mercenaries in
this country in a long,

722
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:37,990
long,
long fucking time.

723
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,290
This whole like giant mercenary 
corporation sort of a thing.

724
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,750
This is very recent.
This is just chaney and bush.

725
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,000
They didn't use birth scenarios during 
clinton.

726
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,180
There was no mercenaries during the 
jimmy carter days.

727
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:49,810
You know,
this is,

728
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,970
this is some crazy shit.
Chaney and bush,

729
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:54,940
the hall and oates.
The fact that they can hire these people

730
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:56,890
to go do shit that you're not supposed 
to do.

731
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,040
They can ship.
It's not in the geneva convention.

732
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,510
shit.
That's totally who I know we have,

733
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:04,730
but we haven't been doing this openly,
you know,

734
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,770
company to do it.
They go,

735
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,560
well,
I think it's definitely for that,

736
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,620
but I think it's like when wrestling 
finally just came out and said it's 

737
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620
sports entertainment.
They like,

738
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,840
oh right.
You know,

739
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,880
we hired these guys for some filthy 
shit.

740
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:17,440
What he wanted from us.
it's entertaining though,

741
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:18,340
right?
yeah.

742
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:21,040
And they changed it to wwe.
He it the name of black water.

743
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,870
What does it now?
I don't know.

744
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,300
Something short.
Something happier.

745
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,430
Bunny rabbits incorporated clearwater 
fresh,

746
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,130
fresh drinking water for everybody.
Babies r us.

747
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,240
Yeah.
Arrowhead.

748
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,060
We love the children.
that's what they changed it to.

749
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,380
Yeah,
they're.

750
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:39,780
I dunno.
It's.

751
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,000
There's two schools of thought.
One is the world is a fucked up place.

752
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,730
Look at what's going on in africa.
Look what's going on in the middle east.

753
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,260
Don't you want somebody over there 
protecting you?

754
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,030
They're just trying to keep America 
cool.

755
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,430
Keep our stAndard alive.
Keep our standard of living the same.

756
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,680
I see that argument too,
but then you know,

757
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:57,940
you see the also the other argument,
I don't believe in that whole that those

758
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:00,910
guys have to live the way they live.
So I live the way I live.

759
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:03,700
It's still those guys on top can have as
much as they have.

760
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,940
Well that's definitely much more likely.
that's what was pissing me off the other

761
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:10,290
day like,
but I think they also do keep it is,

762
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,980
it's a twofold argument.
One,

763
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:16,981
it's like they keep conflict going on 
and the more conflict that keep going 

764
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:19,861
on,
the more we're going to need government 

765
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,001
and we're more,
we're going to need protection when 

766
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,981
that's been proven that the create 
conflict in other parts of the world in 

767
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:25,090
order to control different regions.
They'll arm someone if their enemy is,

768
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:30,091
you know,
the other side and they'll fuck with 

769
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:30,091
things and they manipulated it.
But all that bullshit where they go,

770
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:35,051
where they say,
well they justify like sweatshop labor 

771
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,910
and moving factories out of the us and 
you know,

772
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,670
they just went around the unions and 
then they,

773
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,130
they just justified

774
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,090
it by saying,
you know,

775
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:45,380
and they always say in order to compete 
in a global economy,

776
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:50,381
it's like fuck you.
It's like in order for you to have to 

777
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:50,381
get another yacht,
you know what I mean?

778
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:51,460
You can't legally pay a child,
you know,

779
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,950
whatever the fuck they pay over there.
I'm in America.

780
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,510
Yeah,
you can't do it.

781
00:32:56,511 --> 00:33:01,511
So they just went around all of that 
shit and then they stuck all of 

782
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:04,380
everybody's in cubicles.
Now the to is day because we were just 

783
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,010
talking about the military before.
We were talking about the military.

784
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:08,780
Now we're talking about,
I'm talking about corporations,

785
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:14,290
I'm talking about big business where I 
think corporations are at the annual 

786
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,200
every quarter they have to show a profit
there at the end of what,

787
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,320
of legal ways to do it.
So now they're just straight up 

788
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,740
beginning to steal like my fucking bank.

789
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,800
That's taking 28 bucks a month out of my
account for no reason.

790
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,480
I didn't even notice.
You know,

791
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,890
on the road one of those fucking 
accounts.

792
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:30,410
You just have a couple hundred.
But I finally said,

793
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:32,690
dude,
why you take a 28 bucks out of this?

794
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:34,370
And they did it on the.
On the laptop.

795
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,540
Oh yeah,
we shouldn't be doing that.

796
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,020
All right,
well I've had this for five years.

797
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:39,800
Let's go back.
And they go on.

798
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,700
Unfortunately sir,
our records only go back four months.

799
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,760
He had that convenient.
I bet if I was getting 28 bucks from 

800
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:47,760
you,
you know the other way,

801
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,920
I bet they would fucking go back to the 
sixties.

802
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,980
SaMe thing happened to me and it was 
three months and this is what they said 

803
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:53,980
to me.
I said,

804
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,860
I said,
what if I bring in all my records?

805
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,300
What if I bring in all my records?

806
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,040
And then they go,
so it was still,

807
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,870
we're only going to reimburse you for 
months.

808
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,400
I go,
I got that.

809
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:02,660
That's,
that's ridiculous.

810
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,260
and then the guy at the bank was,
well the bank looks at it like that's on

811
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,250
you,
right?

812
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,760
Because I didn't send you to pay 
attention that they're stealing,

813
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,020
stealing from me,
paying attention.

814
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,910
What he was basically saying what he was
basically saying was lawyer up.

815
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,380
Yeah.
So you're up buddy.

816
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:23,410
Go ahead.
Pretty much how it works is that's why 

817
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:23,410
you have 30 days,
you know for credit card,

818
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,101
you have 30 days to return shit.
You have 30 days to make sure all these 

819
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,681
charges are correct.
Once you get past 30 days and then 

820
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:29,681
you're pretty much screwed.
So they,

821
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:31,400
they do other shit where if you say one 
of these guys,

822
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,950
I pay off my balance every month and you
think you're getting them,

823
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,160
this is what they do is if a,
if you pay it three days before it's a.

824
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,770
This guy was telling me it ends up being
late because they send it somewhere else

825
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:44,630
to be processed.
They deliberately,

826
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,170
they artificially delay it.
So by the time it does get to the right,

827
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:55,690
it's messed up.
And this is another one of those other 

828
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,341
things.
Someone told me that in a starbucks and 

829
00:34:57,341 --> 00:34:57,341
then I got,
I got,

830
00:34:57,341 --> 00:35:00,371
I got three quarters away through the 
sentence and I realized I didn't have 

831
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:00,371
any official.
Right.

832
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:04,850
I do know that there has to be something
our official because nowadays you can 

833
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,591
write a check and within hours that 
check clears your bank and I'm like 

834
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:10,200
that's a check and it's going through in
two hours.

835
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:10,680
And they're like,
yes,

836
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,490
this is,
you know,

837
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,600
technology has changed in the banking 
system so this is new.

838
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,080
But yet if you try to pay something off 
or do something like that,

839
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:23,081
it's like immediately or.
I mean it takes like three days on your 

840
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:25,460
transfer funds takes like three days.
What is it makes no sense.

841
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,520
It can be bad artificial,
however long they can hold onto your 

842
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,130
money.
They make interest off your money too.

843
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,340
So I guess if you think about that,
if they hold onto your money and extra 

844
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,040
few days before they do something and 
you add that up

845
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,640
over,
you know,

846
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,270
the million people they have in their 
bank and the 365 days a year,

847
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,480
that practice probably nets them a 
significant amount of money if you look 

848
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,770
at 28 bucks from every shit

849
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,170
may who doesn't check for a fucking 
year.

850
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,500
And I didn't notice when it until it 
went under a thousand bucks because I 

851
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:55,500
knew I had a thousand something in 
there.

852
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,780
It was one of the thing counts I had 
back east.

853
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,350
Um,
so I came out here and I was always 

854
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:03,350
meaning to close that out.
And I was like,

855
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,890
I had like 1200 bucks is something in it
and I don't.

856
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,900
And then all of a sudden I'm out here 
for like a year and a half and all a 

857
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,071
sudden I get my statement and it was 
like down to like 900 something bucks 

858
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:15,891
and that is on me.
It is on me because I didn't realize 

859
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:15,900
that your bank could fucking steal from 
you.

860
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:16,800
And then just say,
well,

861
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:17,850
you know,
go fuck yourself.

862
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:19,440
That's your fault.
Tell you what,

863
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,690
we'll give you like 80,
90 bucks back.

864
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,280
No,
they gave you.

865
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,510
They gave you like three months back.

866
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,300
I don't even know if they did the guy 
steady what?

867
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:32,301
I walked out disgusted and then the nba 
final started read their circus and I 

868
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:33,120
started watching that and I never 
followed up.

869
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,130
There's actually something that just 
passed you guys,

870
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,440
especially the audience might want to 
check this out.

871
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,450
I used to be a credit card,
like a bank or a credit card could like 

872
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,730
if you had an ax,
seven charges go through at the same 

873
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,281
time,
they can take out all those seven 

874
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:49,281
charges and in charge you seven 
overdraft fees.

875
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:50,580
That's how they used to be able to do 
it.

876
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,760
But something just passed recently that 
you could tell your credit cards and 

877
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,880
your bank that you.
If there's no money in your account,

878
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:01,881
you are not allowed to pull money out.
so they're tryIng to trick you into 

879
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:02,700
signing and going,
no,

880
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:03,660
let's keep it the old way.

881
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,970
So they'll call you up or they'll tell 
you like,

882
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:06,900
hey,
you know,

883
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,730
you want to make sure all these charges 
go through,

884
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:09,510
right?
Yeah.

885
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:14,511
Well you need to accept the.
That letter was that new letter is so 

886
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,560
don't blow it off till all your credit 
card companies know that if there is no 

887
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,241
money in the account,
you don't want it to go through and 

888
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:23,241
you'll save yourself all those over.
You'll,

889
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,500
you'll never have an overdraft again.
Forcing overdraft fees on people.

890
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,350
They're trying to.
They're trying to go back to the old way

891
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:33,351
where you'd have seven things go through
like a $3 charge and then you get 

892
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,470
charged $39 for an overdraft fee.
You're like,

893
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:37,750
well why did it go through?
I had no money in my account,

894
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,330
you know,
made a deposit to cover it.

895
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:42,420
They let they input the deposit last,
right?

896
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,320
And then bam,
bam,

897
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:43,560
bam.

898
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,450
And they nail it.
Well,

899
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,460
it deposit takes 90 days to go through 
where the charge only takes three 

900
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:49,830
seconds.
Yeah.

901
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:51,780
So sorry.
I know,

902
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,460
I understand.
There's nothing we can do.

903
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:54,540
I love that.
That's what you always get.

904
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,920
There's nothing we can do.
I'm sorry.

905
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,540
I don't know.
I like,

906
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,620
I got on a plane ticket the other day 
and I show up and all of a sudden I 

907
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,350
don't have a seat reservation.
Had one on the way out.

908
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,350
Well it's oversold.
Well I didn't do that.

909
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:11,770
And then the.
And then the lady has like an attitude 

910
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:11,870
with me and it's like,
what the fuck?

911
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,160
I spent full $500 bucks.
They asked me where I wanted to sit.

912
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:19,550
I picked out the fucking seat and I was 
told to have a reservation.

913
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:20,520
And then you oversaw

914
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,010
with a car.
You.

915
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,360
If somebody pays for a car and you go,
okay,

916
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:27,220
your car is waiting for you and the guy 
comes down.

917
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,030
No,
no,

918
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,160
it was oversold.
I oversold.

919
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:31,150
It should be against the law.
I,

920
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,460
I wanted to make sure I sold the car.
So I sold it twice.

921
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,670
Yeah,
but that's not even as bad because you 

922
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:38,670
can get in your

923
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,190
car and fucking drive home.
Be imagine if they go to interrupt you.

924
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,470
I know we oversold whatever car you 
have.

925
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,500
So they had to come and take yours and 
took it away and you're fucking sitting 

926
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:46,500
in your house going,
yeah,

927
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:46,500
but I,
I have to go to the airport.

928
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,430
I'm sorry sir.
There's nothing we could do.

929
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,480
How can they do that?
I don't.

930
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:55,490
I don't care if they're losing money.
How can they sell more seats than there 

931
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:55,490
are seats?
That should be.

932
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:55,870
That should be.

933
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:00,990
I think they fought.
They figured out a way to have like 10 

934
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:06,271
years ago when used to go on the road,
how many times was the seat next to 

935
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:06,271
empty?
All the time.

936
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:09,250
Occasionally you'd get the whole row and
curl up back in the good old days.

937
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,710
The good old good old days.
When does that happen now?

938
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,270
And it never happens now because they'll
always say like,

939
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,810
the cancel flights together.
There you go.

940
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,950
Don't give a fuck.
That's right.

941
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,280
And they'll just give away tickets to 
people that were like,

942
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:22,860
hey,
you get a free ticket if you,

943
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,520
you know,
just wait til the next flight.

944
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:29,521
So they're not actually overselling it 
because they don't get rid of those 

945
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:29,521
tickets for you.
You know what though?

946
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:32,370
The way I look at it that you have to 
have fucking airlines or I wouldn't have

947
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,860
a job.
I literally need airlines to get along.

948
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:35,110
No,
no.

949
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,110
I'm not saying people don't.
I'm not against airlines.

950
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:39,750
I'm not telling me I have whatever.
Then I don't,

951
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,690
I,
I hate that too.

952
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:43,980
But whatever the fuck they have to do to
stay in business for us.

953
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:48,981
For comics.
Could you imagine if you had a fucking 

954
00:39:48,981 --> 00:39:48,981
drive to all your gigs?
Could you imagine if you have a drive?

955
00:39:48,981 --> 00:39:51,000
If you had a New York gig?
Okay.

956
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:53,460
I got a gig on friday in New York,
so it's monday.

957
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:56,520
I'm packing up my car.
Could you fucking imagine?

958
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,420
No,
you don't be great.

959
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:02,470
Would be immediately how regional.
All our comedy boston jokes.

960
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,380
When I,
uh,

961
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,250
there was a chain like seven slash 11 
called christie's.

962
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,440
You remember that?
I'll never forget the first time I did a

963
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,880
gig outside of boston.
I went to,

964
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,940
I think it was like New Hampshire and I 
had some stupid joke about winning the 

965
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,841
lottery.
How nobody respects you that you move 

966
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:21,841
into a rich neighborhood and they're 
like,

967
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:21,841
what do you do?
I'm a doctor,

968
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:22,870
I did this.
I'm a brain surgeon.

969
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:23,530
What do you do?
I say,

970
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,600
oh,
I went to christie's,

971
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:24,990
like,
you know,

972
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,080
meaning I got a lottery ticket.
It wasn't even a good fucking job to 

973
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,701
begin with.
And then I went up to New Hampshire and 

974
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:32,701
I told the joke and I'm like,
I went to christie's.

975
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:35,060
That was the first time I used to 
reference that nobody fucking got.

976
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,240
And I remember that high five.
You were gone by then the high five gig 

977
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,260
where it was at the top of the only 
skyscraper.

978
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:42,580
And like manchester,
New Hampshire.

979
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

980
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:45,680
And I,
I

981
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,910
balls.
I used to do a lot of local material 

982
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,350
when I was living in boston because it 
would kill,

983
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:58,470
you know,
so he jokes about girls and revere with 

984
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,980
a big bulletproof hairdos and yeah,
a lot of like regional shit.

985
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,660
And then when I would go on the road it 
was like,

986
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,840
I was disarmed,
like none of my references would work.

987
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,450
I will tell revere beach joke and you 
would get like,

988
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,280
recognition,
laughter and boston,

989
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,960
but when you're on the road,
they just,

990
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,220
okay,
where's the joke?

991
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,850
I remember those guys and they'd have 
to,

992
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,570
they'd go down to jersey and they'd be 
like,

993
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,180
what's the equivalent to revere beach 
down here?

994
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:18,720
Yeah,
you got,

995
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,860
you got to regionalize all your 
references.

996
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,750
The only time that's happened lately,
lately is up.

997
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,670
If I go over to europe and uh,
I was saying to somebody the other day,

998
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,350
one of the few things that,
not only,

999
00:41:30,351 --> 00:41:35,351
I didn't have to change,
but fucking was a reference to a,

1000
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,610
um,
a ric flair.

1001
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,940
Really ric flair.
That's how big those guys are.

1002
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,030
Wow.
Fucking destroyed in london,

1003
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,610
dublin and glasgow.
Scotland.

1004
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,330
Well,
they have a lot of american,

1005
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,340
uh,
american culture over there.

1006
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,420
England especially.
I find it english american comedians 

1007
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,510
translate way quicker to england in 
england due to american.

1008
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,740
Yeah.
We're,

1009
00:41:58,741 --> 00:41:59,640
we're like,
yeah,

1010
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:02,640
we're stuck with snobs over here.
We hear like a british accent.

1011
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,300
English.
Yeah.

1012
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:09,301
But I mean,
but I'm saying like the comedy doesn't 

1013
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:10,300
translate as well.
They have a very specific type of humor.

1014
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:12,070
But they get ours,
you know?

1015
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:18,050
Yeah.
I don't know what I feel like I felt 

1016
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,050
when british comedians,
comedians,

1017
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,660
comedian over there,
I either love him or I not only do,

1018
00:42:21,661 --> 00:42:26,661
I not like them,
but I feel like they're like 15 years 

1019
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:26,661
behind the time,
which is

1020
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:30,850
because nice over there.
It's almost like the attitude they have 

1021
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,091
as a country,
as a culture hampers their ability to 

1022
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:34,790
stand up because real standup,
there's a part of real estate.

1023
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,380
And it was like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1024
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,730
You know,
they don't have that.

1025
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,740
They don't,
they don't get.

1026
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,700
But somehow it comes out in the music 
though.

1027
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,730
Like it always seems like,
you know everything from like the sex 

1028
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:45,790
pistols to fuckin ozzy osborne,
these elders,

1029
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,310
these baroque angry fucking dudes 
fighting too.

1030
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:51,980
There's a lot of tough mma guys would 
come out of the uk somehow.

1031
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,840
I'm trying to think of.
They're more poLite.

1032
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,720
There's something about their humor.
It's just like,

1033
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,230
you know what It is?
It's cheeky.

1034
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,320
Isn't that the word that she is cheeky?
I don't know.

1035
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:03,200
What it is is just some of them were 
really good,

1036
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,020
but some of them are just,
it just doesn't,

1037
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
you know,
and I think first of all,

1038
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,760
those style of comedy that you and I 
come from too,

1039
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,720
you get very spoiled at a certain 
particular type of colleague.

1040
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,990
Boston comedy is a very specific kind of
comedy.

1041
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,230
If you stop and think about how many 
good comics have come from boston,

1042
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,720
you know,
jay leno came from boston.

1043
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:28,721
Steven wright came from boston guys that
people don't know that it probably 

1044
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:29,960
better than 90 percent of the fucking 
people that are like big name comics.

1045
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:33,200
Like gavin don gavin's,
one of the funniest guys ever walked the

1046
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,730
face of the earth.
Yeah,

1047
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,530
he's,
he's a monster.

1048
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,330
He's a,

1049
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,650
I think it's all like the east coast,
I think all the way down to like dc,

1050
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,200
the amount of guys.
But I.

1051
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,700
But I also think because we're from 
boston doesn't have to leave.

1052
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,230
They didn't leave.
Those guys stayed there.

1053
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,780
No one left boston.
The big monsters.

1054
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:57,950
Steve sweeney,
kenny rogers sang those.

1055
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,020
Don gavin,
Mike Donovan when I was a kid.

1056
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:02,100
Okay.
And I will,

1057
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:07,140
when I first started doing open mics 
there and those guys were all the 

1058
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,830
national headliners or the local 
headlines rather they'd be at nick's and

1059
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:09,360
they'd be it.
The connection.

1060
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,930
I remember sitting there watching those 
guys and they would have like some like 

1061
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,711
national guy would come through like 
billy crystal and billy crystal would 

1062
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:19,590
come through and they would put on dawn 
gavin,

1063
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:24,710
steve sweeney and fucking and lenny 
clarke in a row and then bring up billy 

1064
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:27,630
crystal.
And they did it on purpose.

1065
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:28,170
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1066
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,510
They knew that the level of comedy was 
so high there.

1067
00:44:30,511 --> 00:44:32,010
And these guys were doing 20 minutes

1068
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,260
tight to say 20 minutes to do it for 
doing.

1069
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,140
A lot of them were doing local 
references.

1070
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,160
Dude,
I don't give up.

1071
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,150
If you put on for local headliners in 
front of me,

1072
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,730
a farm on the rug fucked.
You're fucked.

1073
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,520
You're fucked for first couple of 
minutes until you can get them into your

1074
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:49,490
groove.
But people love local shit.

1075
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,220
AnD boston,
especially boston is such a city that in

1076
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,570
love with being from boston.
So it's done.

1077
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,900
It was one of my favorites.
His name doesn't get brought up,

1078
00:44:57,901 --> 00:45:01,440
but not a novel topic that he used to do
that joke about,

1079
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,690
uh,
had some,

1080
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
he,
his comedy was so blue collar and I was 

1081
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,000
coming up,
uh,

1082
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,480
you know,
working in warehouses and stuff.

1083
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,310
It was where my,
both my parents were professional,

1084
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:12,190
white collar,
but I,

1085
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:15,450
I was a moron,
so fucked up in schools.

1086
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,450
So I had like blue collar job.
So his comedy was just right out over 

1087
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:20,450
the place.
He did something.

1088
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,300
He had some sort of back and forth with 
the boss and he made this reference,

1089
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:29,330
you know,
basically tell him the boss to go fuck 

1090
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:29,330
himself.
He said I'll take a 20 minutes,

1091
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,861
shit on the clock if I want to.
And I fucking fell out because it was 

1092
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:35,940
always that lazy fuck wouldn't help 
unload the trucks.

1093
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:40,941
He had every god damn trick in the book 
and how to somehow make that eight hour 

1094
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:44,331
day go by.
And one of them was when he had grabbed 

1095
00:45:44,331 --> 00:45:46,701
the herald and the globe to go take a 
shit and it would somehow take like 

1096
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:49,860
fucking 40 minutes everyday.
Donovan was a,

1097
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,570
here's another one.
He's a master.

1098
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,210
There was a bunch of guys that were 
around back then.

1099
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,990
I mean,
they're still around.

1100
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm sure don,
wouldn't you?

1101
00:45:56,001 --> 00:46:01,001
If you live in boston,
you could probably find them headline 

1102
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:01,001
and somewhere and he's still doing 
comedy,

1103
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:01,001
I'm sure.
Right?

1104
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:03,270
I know he ran a foul into the irs for a 
bit.

1105
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,650
He owed a lot of those guys that were 
working for cash for a long time.

1106
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,030
They weren't paying taxes on it.
I didn't hear anything about that.

1107
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,420
They were all up to date.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1108
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:13,170
YeaH,
you're right.

1109
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,070
You know what?
I miss her.

1110
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,580
I miss her.
I think those,

1111
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:17,940
those guys out in long island.
I think some of them did.

1112
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,750
I miss.
Oh,

1113
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,140
here's another one that doesn't get 
brought up.

1114
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,160
Teddy bears.
Ron,

1115
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,160
do you ever get a chance to teddy,
but holy shit,

1116
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,020
that guy was good.
Let me tell you something.

1117
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:33,021
I saw that guy in 1988.
I was at an open mic night and it was 

1118
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:33,870
one of the first time.
So I thought about quitting comedy.

1119
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,190
It was an open mic night and I went up 
and I,

1120
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,200
you know,
I did my little five minutes of fucking 

1121
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,200
nonsense,
stupid,

1122
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,290
terrible,
bad comedy,

1123
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,500
just trying to make people laugh,
didn't know what the fuck I was doing 

1124
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,500
and didn't go so good.
You know,

1125
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,880
those early sets.
It was like one of my third or fourth 

1126
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:52,880
sets,
so not so good,

1127
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:52,880
clumsy,
you know,

1128
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,861
maybe one lab and then I fuck it up with
a sweat punchline and I just didn't 

1129
00:46:57,861 --> 00:46:59,970
known as known teddy bears.
Ron goes up and

1130
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,930
so fucking smooth,
smooth and relaxed and the way he would 

1131
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:11,070
talk just like mesmerizing and I had 
heard about his tonight show,

1132
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:14,520
fucking said he had just done the 
tonight show and somebody had a video of

1133
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:17,310
it and they played the video and he 
plays the piano.

1134
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,920
Does like this,
talks about commercials and he plays the

1135
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,920
piano and talk someone.
It's so fucking smooth and so good.

1136
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,330
You would look at them and go,
okay,

1137
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:29,331
this guy's going to be gigantic.
This is going to be bigger than than 

1138
00:47:29,331 --> 00:47:29,350
robin williams.
He's going to be the biggest stand comic

1139
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:29,860
at the country.

1140
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,530
Never left boston to stayed.
They all stay in.

1141
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,190
I don't.
Yeah,

1142
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:35,950
they will.
They would.

1143
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:41,330
It was like townies but a but comedians,
but that they all got work.

1144
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:44,440
They all got work in boston.
They didn't have to leave.

1145
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:47,130
See when they were working at nick's 
comedy stop and they were working at,

1146
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,910
you know,
stitches and all these different clubs.

1147
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,560
They could hop around from club to club.
Like there's a that,

1148
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,710
that,
that,

1149
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,420
that documentary in France.
Alameda did stand up,

1150
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:56,650
stood up and,
and you know,

1151
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:58,690
lenny clarke talks about all the 
different sets that he did.

1152
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:00,200
He would do all these different sets of 
nyt now.

1153
00:48:00,201 --> 00:48:01,840
We'd go from here to there and are there
and they're,

1154
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,300
they're enclosed.
They'd be making 1500 bucks a night.

1155
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,920
Yeah.
And he just hire a driver.

1156
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:11,030
Has to wait outside and do all the sets.
What I love about those guys is there 

1157
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,340
was almost like a height requirement to 
like,

1158
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:14,230
they will all like fucking six,
two,

1159
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,450
three huge guys.

1160
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,400
And they could like literally would have
like a keg of beer over one shoulder and

1161
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:26,401
like an eight ball in their hand.
And we'll just be going from club to 

1162
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:29,341
club destroying and flow all the way 
just to keep that buzz going.

1163
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,130
And then.
And then at the end of the night do it.

1164
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,600
I heard some fuck that.
That backroom at nick's man.

1165
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:37,880
Someone offered to pay me and coke.
What?

1166
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,490
Yeah.
They would offer to pay you in coke.

1167
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,890
That was the deal.
Did they do coke?

1168
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,810
Oh no,
we can pay in coke.

1169
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,640
No,
I'll take.

1170
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,390
I'll take fuck.
Like I thought that was a joke.

1171
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:54,391
I didn't realize they pay you and coke.
They will offer to pay you and coke and 

1172
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:58,160
a lot of guys.
Did a lot of guys get some of the money 

1173
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,380
in coke because I guess are comedians 
and porn stars to two careers.

1174
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,310
I couldn't get paid and coke if I had to
come down to it.

1175
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,560
I would say probably bands too.
Probably a lot of bands.

1176
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:08,980
A portion of the boxers back in the day 
they'd give you some chips.

1177
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:10,750
You ever see that?
I know it's just a photo op thing.

1178
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:12,880
Be able to see that,
that great picture of sonny liston.

1179
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,190
Yeah.
Where he's a.

1180
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,240
It looks like he just knocked somebody 
out and he's sitting there still in his 

1181
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:19,240
box of trunks.
Hands taped up.

1182
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,580
I think his hands were on,
but I haven't had to been a promotional.

1183
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,880
Even even those mob guys be like,
come on sunday,

1184
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:28,881
let's get this shit.
Don't you think the starting on boston 

1185
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:35,551
was like one of the best places you 
could have ever chose to begin your 

1186
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:35,620
comedy career?
I think about that a lot.

1187
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,170
So whenever I think about that,
because when did You start?

1188
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,850
What year?
I started in march of 92.

1189
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,330
Uh,
it was like twentY three,

1190
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:48,331
almost 24,
so I started a little bit late and I 

1191
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:51,080
remember just some of the times like 
when I've gone on the road and uh,

1192
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,960
and you meet the young,
the up and coming guys like,

1193
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:57,961
yeah,
the comedy scene here sucks and blah 

1194
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:57,961
blah blah blah blah.
Like,

1195
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,620
like it sucks sO bad,
like don't even know what to do.

1196
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,170
And you always tell them what,
just go out and start a room.

1197
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,890
Like some of them like the scene so bad 
they don't even think of doing that.

1198
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:07,050
It's like what even start roaming 
psycho,

1199
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,990
pick a fucking sports bar that does no 
business on a monday,

1200
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:14,110
tuesday and tell them that you're going 
to get people in here,

1201
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,180
you know,
lie to him that you know you're going to

1202
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:21,181
get people to come in to watch these 
fucking open microbes do five minutes 

1203
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:22,690
each day.
The first time I ate my fucking balls on

1204
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:27,691
stage,
I was still in this place like kelly's 

1205
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,250
something or rather and reading or north

1206
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,780
reading,
it doesn't exist anymore.

1207
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:34,781
This comedian Jack Lynch booked it and 
there would literally be like a bruins 

1208
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:34,781
game on

1209
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,260
tv and they wouldn't shut the game off.
Fuck no,

1210
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,970
no.
You got to do comedy over the game.

1211
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,980
And The volume for the game was still 
onto.

1212
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,900
yeah,
a lot of those gigs down the cape.

1213
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:47,901
I did a lot of those gigs and you'd find
out the fucking game was on why you got 

1214
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:47,901
there.
Like fuck the game.

1215
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:48,600
I'm going to leave the game on.
That was like an always an issue.

1216
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:53,670
You're going to lead the game and if 
they said we're going to turn the game 

1217
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,670
off,
they would turn the game on.

1218
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,230
Everybody goes,
what the fuck you fucking shot.

1219
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,790
Who shot in the foot?
And then you would have to go do comedy 

1220
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:01,790
for a bunch of people were angry at you 
for shutting the gate.

1221
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,560
It was brutal.
and I remember,

1222
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,290
yeah,
the second question,

1223
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,380
other than,
are you going to,

1224
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,040
uh,
are you going to shut the game off?

1225
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,570
Is,
is there a stage?

1226
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,180
That was another thing.
So you jusT stand.

1227
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,790
You just stand right over there too.
and I remember doing a gig.

1228
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,950
this is how green we,
where it was me,

1229
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,140
al del,
benny,

1230
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:25,290
patrice o'neil,
and I want to say dane cook was on it 

1231
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,910
and we was Bobby Kelly,
I think it was his gig that he booked.

1232
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:31,450
We were so green and years later I 
finally figured it out.

1233
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,690
They gave us this microphone.
It was a lapel mic.

1234
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,460
So he had to go up and do comedy with 
just like a lapel on,

1235
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:42,160
like we were doing letterman but we were
so green.

1236
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:43,900
We didn't know that you clipped it on 
cereal.

1237
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:45,310
All standing there.
Holding.

1238
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,180
Holding a lapel mic.
I remember patrice.

1239
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:50,920
He's like fucking six five.

1240
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,730
Hold on because I remember.
That's right.

1241
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,280
Dell benny benny was hosting is like,
what the fuck is up with this mike?

1242
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,410
This is the smallest mike ever.
Look,

1243
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:02,890
I'll put up my hand in his mouth and 
we're all laughing at them like yeah,

1244
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:07,891
what a half fast fucking gig.
And we were so stupid that we didn't 

1245
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:08,030
understand what it was and like he would
let it out,

1246
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,880
would bring me up and then hand me the 
mic,

1247
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:13,570
like a tea cup at this pinkies out 
picking out and that would just be like,

1248
00:52:13,571 --> 00:52:15,070
hey,
keep it golf out.

1249
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:20,310
And my dad was.
He was preTty nuts growing up with like 

1250
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:20,310
three fingers up in the air holding this
thing.

1251
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:22,770
Have you done standup on a talk show 
with a lapel mic?

1252
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,330
Yeah,
I actually really like it.

1253
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,450
Do you ever thought about going Bobby 
Brown style onstage?

1254
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:30,690
Y'all ready for this?
I know chris titus does that titus,

1255
00:52:30,691 --> 00:52:32,910
whereas like a headgear thing,
I don't like that.

1256
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,780
I don't like jackets and I don't like

1257
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,050
and I hate,
I don't know how you do comedy,

1258
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,340
but the jacket on,

1259
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,540
I don't mind it if it's cold.
If it's cold,

1260
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:43,730
I'll wear a jacket.
Zipped bottle.

1261
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,160
I can wear a zip up,
but the sport coat,

1262
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,190
it just doesn't move with the shirt.
I wore a sport coat the first time I 

1263
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,941
went on stage because I thought that's 
how you're supposed to dress out of 

1264
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:57,480
sport.
Coat with the sleeves rolled up like 

1265
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,591
this.
I was talking about that miami vice tee 

1266
00:52:59,591 --> 00:53:01,211
shirt and a wacky tee shirt.
Tee shirt with like a silly smile on it 

1267
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:01,211
because I thought that's how you and a 
pen.

1268
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,860
I had like a button or something on my 
fucking sports coat.

1269
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,900
Did you get to see chris rock on linda 
the other day?

1270
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:08,690
Just.
That was so great.

1271
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:13,400
What happened?
It just fucking with j dot lee with last

1272
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:18,401
time I was here there's a dude with red 
hair and started saying that kevin the 

1273
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,380
band guy and the guy's like,
man,

1274
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,070
that's cold.

1275
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,160
Because it was pretty funny.
He attacked.

1276
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,980
He was uncomfortable.
He kept on going into it.

1277
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,160
You could tell jay when you're like,
that is one of the most amazing things 

1278
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,130
I've ever seen.
How he got that show back?

1279
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,130
Oh yeah.
It's crazy.

1280
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,490
I don't.
I don't disagree with them.

1281
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,030
Now,
look,

1282
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,160
you know everybody puts it this way.
Look,

1283
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,800
the guy was on top,
he was fucking number one,

1284
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:51,830
number one,
and they come along and say we're going 

1285
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,891
to lose you or they were going to lose 
conan unless we give him the tonight 

1286
00:53:53,891 --> 00:53:54,210
show,
so we want to give him the tonight show.

1287
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,140
And he was like,
whaT?

1288
00:53:55,141 --> 00:53:57,330
Fucking really?
You've got to take my gang away from me.

1289
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,290
And so he goes,
okay,

1290
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,270
all right.
I'm a and under duress.

1291
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,790
He offers to give up the gig in five 
years,

1292
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,990
but he's number one number.

1293
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,530
Brilliant.
I think he's brilliant.

1294
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:09,570
He was number one,
so he gets kicked off.

1295
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,120
They put this new guy,
the new guy is bombing.

1296
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:13,410
He's eaten dick.
Okay.

1297
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:16,290
That's what no one wants to talk about.
Conan o'brian on the tonight show wasn't

1298
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:21,291
that good?
But that's bullshit because linda is 

1299
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:21,291
doing the exact same ratings right now 
as as.

1300
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:22,600
No,
no,

1301
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:27,650
no.
What we're going to go back to that 

1302
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,031
dropped substantially.
It dropped substantially from where it 

1303
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:29,550
was before.
From where it was when linda was hosting

1304
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:33,000
it to conan.
Hold on,

1305
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:38,030
hold on a second.
They fuck conan by not letting them do 

1306
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:38,030
any of us.
Couldn't do the masturbating.

1307
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,350
Bear couldn't do all these different,
different sketches.

1308
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,500
Couldn't do triuMph.
The insult dog couldn't do any of that 

1309
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:45,500
shit.
Alright.

1310
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,490
Because it's 11:00
show they fucked if when jay leno got 

1311
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,091
the tonight show,
if he had to follow Johnny Carson 

1312
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:54,120
bombing for an hour.
Totally right about that.

1313
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,190
But that's like if a comedian bombs in 
front of you,

1314
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:04,370
right for an half hour in front of you.
I mean you got to jack the tonight show 

1315
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:10,311
because of the tonight show was always 
the late night show where guys would go 

1316
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:11,520
on and all the guests would go on and it
would be like an important spot.

1317
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:14,550
Will the 10:00
spot became just as important.

1318
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,190
So he was like siphoning off guests,
like,

1319
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,080
you know,
you couldn't have a guy who's promoting,

1320
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:24,081
you know,
mel gibson goes on jay leno show and 

1321
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:24,081
then goes on tonight show as well.
No,

1322
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:26,250
you're only gonna have one of the other 
is all about with atlanta.

1323
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,990
So the brilliance of it was jay bombing 
actually fucked conan conan here.

1324
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,680
We had this show for like six months 
before they were started going like,

1325
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:38,850
all right,
let's get this guy out.

1326
00:55:38,851 --> 00:55:40,750
And he got it back now I think,
uh,

1327
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,740
I think taking,
it was a brilliant away from it.

1328
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,200
I think it was a brilliant,
brilliant.

1329
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:50,170
The way jpl played it was absolutely 
brilliant and I don't know,

1330
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,290
I'm not saying bond on purpose,
but the way he played it,

1331
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:52,590
like,
yeah,

1332
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:53,040
yeah,
sure,

1333
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,930
I'll do it.
And then the twelfth hour,

1334
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,570
yeah I'm going to leave but I'm not 
retiring.

1335
00:55:57,571 --> 00:56:00,770
and then they freaked the fuck out.
So like he knows,

1336
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,660
I don't know how we look at it.
Like I understand jay being like,

1337
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:04,710
look,
I the number one show,

1338
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:07,020
what are you kicking me off?
Or he's totally right about that.

1339
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,750
But I also,
I don't look at conan like he failed,

1340
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:14,010
like calling got fucked.
He got fucked.

1341
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:19,100
I completely agree.
But what I'm saying is you've got to 

1342
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,100
realize that jay leno had the number one
spot.

1343
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,800
He was number one in the late night wars
before they gave it to conan.

1344
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:23,980
So why would he

1345
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,860
give a fuck if they gave the show to 
call and offered it back to him?

1346
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:29,030
Why would he not take it him?
I,

1347
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:29,930
I don't,
you know,

1348
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:35,010
but everybody's making it out.
Like jay is this asshole for taking 

1349
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:35,010
conan's job.
I go,

1350
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,340
gone and took his job.
Conan's not a,

1351
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,260
he's not a poor man.
he's a rich man.

1352
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,790
Like we're really

1353
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,610
worry about the most fucked up about it 
is.

1354
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,460
And keeps saying don't feel bad for me.
He made it.

1355
00:56:44,461 --> 00:56:47,550
He made a great little a.
He said a great little thing on his last

1356
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:48,300
episode.
He said,

1357
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:49,890
don't be cynical,
you know,

1358
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,430
blah,
blah blah.

1359
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,920
I hate people who were cynically said 
this really positive thing,

1360
00:56:52,921 --> 00:56:55,620
don't feel bad for me.
Played fucking free bird with the band.

1361
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:01,010
Went out like a man and that was it.
He's never bitched about it or any of 

1362
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:01,920
that type of shit.
Fucking Million dollars.

1363
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:03,600
I think that was super smooth things 
over.

1364
00:57:03,601 --> 00:57:04,770
I see.
No matter what kona does,

1365
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:07,630
he's an asshole.
No,

1366
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,800
I'm gay,
but he gave a lot of that money.

1367
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:13,110
He gave a lot of that money out to 
people he worked with.

1368
00:57:13,111 --> 00:57:14,940
No,
they want it to fucking move back.

1369
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,120
He felt bad for those guys.
The only thing that I find annoying 

1370
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,481
about jay leno is acting as though he 
isn't a shrewd businessman.

1371
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:25,040
That whole.
I mean,

1372
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:30,050
I know I'm going to do that,
but that's how he wants to portray 

1373
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:30,480
himself.
That's fine.

1374
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:35,510
That's what I'm saying.
That's the only thing that fucking 

1375
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:35,510
annoys you about.
The whole thing

1376
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,940
annoyed me was when everybody's making a
big deal at jay's taking conan's job,

1377
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,120
but conan took jay's job,
took johnny's job.

1378
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:42,830
He fucking forced him out.
Did he really?

1379
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,340
I don't know about that.
How did you force him out of that 

1380
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:48,340
fucking book?
I read.

1381
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,410
I read the late shift.
Had a fucking book I read.

1382
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,470
I read though the fucking late shift.
Plus,

1383
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,500
I read how much people pay attention to 
these late night.

1384
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,110
No,
but this.

1385
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:58,420
This is the thing though,
if if,

1386
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,430
if jay only got,
first of all,

1387
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:03,100
jay without johnny bomb and in front of 
them going on,

1388
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:05,770
if they're like fucking er and seinfeld 
and all those hit shows,

1389
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:09,220
do it still took him 18 months.
Remember,

1390
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:10,720
letterman was kicking the shit out of 
it.

1391
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:11,010
Yeah.
Yes.

1392
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,420
Until you got hugh grant on,
right?

1393
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,600
It took them 18 months,
only six fucking months and he's got to 

1394
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,900
follow the previous host eaten his balls
for a half hour in front of them.

1395
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,610
It was,
it was bullshit.

1396
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,030
They should have just this idea.
It was a ridiculous idea.

1397
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:29,640
They were just afraid to let go and 
conan was like,

1398
00:58:29,641 --> 00:58:31,080
look,
I want the fucking tonight show.

1399
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:36,170
And they didn't want to give it to them.
They go back and forth and so they give 

1400
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:36,900
it to them to get shot.
That jason's numbers we're going to drop

1401
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,750
in.
FIve years is going to be pushing 60.

1402
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,810
Who's you know,
who's going to want to watch?

1403
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,000
This is the dumbest thing ever.
A guy's gonna.

1404
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,410
What did Johnny Carson got better as he 
got older?

1405
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,480
That's ridiculous.
This is what I think.

1406
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:53,481
I think kona is going to be way better 
off on a network that just lets them do 

1407
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:53,481
whatever the fuck he wants.

1408
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:54,660
I think tbs show,
dude,

1409
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:59,661
he owns that show.
He's going to be so much that he's 

1410
00:58:59,661 --> 00:58:59,790
brilliant and you know w when conan is 
at its best,

1411
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,970
when you get to see how funny it is,
like you ever see that the one's gifts 

1412
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,400
he did about a baseball.
A bunch of people who play baseball like

1413
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,680
a,
like 18 hundreds.

1414
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:09,080
Baseball.
They have like a vent.

1415
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,120
They were vintage clothes.
They make the wrong and I saw this 

1416
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:14,920
fucking genius.
Hilarious because he just goes balls out

1417
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:16,050
and it's just him,
you know,

1418
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:19,770
it's just him being funny.
If I guarantee you they fucked with them

1419
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:21,920
too much.
When they switched them to 11:00,

1420
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,020
they probably cut all the,
the,

1421
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:25,330
the,
like the meat in the.

1422
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,390
Anything controversial out of his 
monologues or out of his sketches.

1423
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,280
They probably stopped him from doing a 
lot of shit.

1424
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,210
Yeah.
And he saId when he left,

1425
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:35,880
don't feel bad for me and people are 
still saying that he's a,

1426
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:37,510
he's whining,
which I don't get.

1427
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:37,980
I mean,
he did.

1428
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:39,990
He did jokes about an in,
in his model level.

1429
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,790
What fuck you supposed to do.
Yeah.

1430
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:44,320
It's just sitting there talking about 
maybe you're going to get replaced.

1431
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:45,840
She's supposed to go out there and be 
like,

1432
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:47,340
hey,
do you see the earthquake in Haiti?

1433
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:48,670
It was funny when the,
uh,

1434
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,950
had a car,
I think it was a bugatti,

1435
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,310
a Million dollar car.
And they play the rolling stones,

1436
00:59:53,311 --> 00:59:58,311
get no satisfaction.
And there was a sketch just to spend 

1437
00:59:58,311 --> 00:59:58,311
money.
Oh yeah,

1438
00:59:58,311 --> 00:59:58,311
yeah,
yeah.

1439
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,680
Which I'm sure is bullshit,
but it's still pretty funny.

1440
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,060
That's pretty funny that he did it like 
that.

1441
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:08,180
Speaking of that,
I was watching one of those car 

1442
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,180
auctions,
uh,

1443
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,180
the other,
uh,

1444
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,901
yesterday.
And I'm just sitting there looking at 

1445
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:12,330
all these awesome old cars that I would 
love to own.

1446
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,740
And as the price kept going up and up 
and up on some fucking like ferrari,

1447
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,590
it just was just,
I,

1448
01:00:18,591 --> 01:00:22,200
I started to resent the people in the 
crowd like at these,

1449
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,090
the bankers.
Is this what they did with the trulia?

1450
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,090
Who the fuck has the money?
There was some,

1451
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,890
if you can bring it up for your 
listeners,

1452
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:33,600
there's a fucking car in 1958 that bmw 
made.

1453
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:37,890
It was designed by a guy who actually 
was in refrigerating or whatever.

1454
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:43,070
Literally the front of the car fucking 
opens up like a refrigerator and you 

1455
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:43,710
walk out the front and there's one back 
door.

1456
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:46,350
It's like a mini car.
Be a 1950.

1457
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,750
I think it's a bmw 600.
A 319.

1458
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,300
There it is.
Bring that thing up.

1459
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:52,620
Okay.
What the fuck?

1460
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,390
It's a hunk of shit.
It's the ice.

1461
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:58,280
I s e t t a 1915.

1462
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:59,590
Oh,
I've seen that before.

1463
01:00:59,591 --> 01:01:02,560
I seen one of those little mini.
It looks just like it.

1464
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:05,310
There's one in this european magazines

1465
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:11,450
spin around so he can see it.
So basicallY I guess got one wiper in 

1466
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:11,980
the front.
It's a five year old kid,

1467
01:01:11,981 --> 01:01:15,280
get licensed to drive the thing.
So this guy paid like 11 grand for like,

1468
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:15,750
hey,
you know,

1469
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:19,120
I'm hoping to get 30,
35,

1470
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,370
35,
42 fucking thing.

1471
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:23,260
Went for 67,
five,

1472
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:24,840
$67,000

1473
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,440
for that $67,500
for that hunk of shit.

1474
01:01:28,441 --> 01:01:30,780
Guys like jay leno closed car collected 
dudes.

1475
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:35,781
They like to have like old cars,
like rare old cars with jay's monies 

1476
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:37,170
clean.
He didn't stand up.

1477
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:38,430
He's doinG that.
I'm talking about these,

1478
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,450
these other fucking guys.
It's like if you're not famous.

1479
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:45,460
No.
Who's in the audience where they got 

1480
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:45,460
their money from?
What are they all invented?

1481
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:45,460
Playstation.
Do they own farms?

1482
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,820
They fucking.
They sell lcd electronics.

1483
01:01:47,821 --> 01:01:48,360
Who knows?

1484
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,230
That's what I'm saying.
Well,

1485
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,800
let me ask you,
what are these fucking banker?

1486
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:53,770
Spend all that money I'll do.
They took a trillion dollars.

1487
01:01:53,771 --> 01:01:56,080
Where did it go?
The at the fucking car auctions.

1488
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,440
The aMazing thing about that whole 
banker thing,

1489
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:01,380
the whole bailout was that those guys 
still wanted bonuses.

1490
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,430
They still wanted bonuses even though 
their bank failed and the government had

1491
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:08,830
to give them billions of dollars though 
fucking

1492
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,210
houses.
They got the bailout money that kept it.

1493
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,940
Then they're fucking guys like me.
Twenty eight bucks a month.

1494
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:18,970
Our records only go back four months and
they kept the money and they got the 

1495
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,640
fucking houses back to do again.
They're going to do it again,

1496
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,970
is sweating.
They should get the death penalty.

1497
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:29,150
You touch a kid,
you fuck with an animal or you make old 

1498
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,211
people eat dog food for the last 15 
years of their life when they thought 

1499
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:32,211
they were going to live in their 
houseboat or their dreams,

1500
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:37,100
you should be fucking murdered publicly.
Bernie madoff did start him.

1501
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,230
Bernie madoff is a lightweight.
He's a lightweight,

1502
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:41,820
fucked over million.
That's nothing,

1503
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,070
but he was the only fucked over six 
people.

1504
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,980
These guys fucked over a whole country.
It sex.

1505
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,390
Look it up.
It's on wikipedia.

1506
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:51,390
Now.
Bernie madoff,

1507
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,220
bernie madoff.
It's a sacrificial lamb.

1508
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,860
That guy should be killed too,
but he was the guy like.

1509
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:00,470
The funny thIng is is people look at 
bernie madoff and they look like they.

1510
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,560
Well,
they took down one of the bankers who 

1511
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:05,560
not a banker,
he was,

1512
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,810
he was like a fucking an investment 
bank.

1513
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I don't want to talk in a bus.
He was like one of those private guys 

1514
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,771
like joel,
I know what to do with your fucking 

1515
01:03:15,771 --> 01:03:17,391
money.
He didn't have like an atm that you 

1516
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:17,391
could use.
He was,

1517
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:17,930
he was one of those guys,
the smith barney guys,

1518
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:19,880
right.
I fucked a lot of employees is stupid.

1519
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:25,850
well,
he fucked a bunch of people that should 

1520
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:25,850
have known better.
You know,

1521
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:25,850
there was a lot of people that were in 
the business.

1522
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:30,081
That's when I just liked it.
I always thought fucked other rich 

1523
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:30,081
people.

1524
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:30,081
Yeah,
we fucked up most rich.

1525
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:32,480
But he fucked also a bunch of,
like different,

1526
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,680
uh,
jewish,

1527
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:35,600
uh,
groups that had charities.

1528
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:38,060
He fucked charities over.
He fucked a lot of people over.

1529
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,530
But uh,
he was,

1530
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,200
he was fucking over people that were in 
the whole,

1531
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:42,870
the,
the,

1532
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,820
the,
the industry,

1533
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:48,821
the financial industry.
So they should have known what he was 

1534
01:03:48,821 --> 01:03:49,700
doing was fucked up and they still will 
but look at the returns and so they just

1535
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:51,920
dove in even though none of it made 
sense.

1536
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,200
There was people that were calling for 
an investigation into his,

1537
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:57,320
his from like years and years ago,
and they ignored it and just kept going.

1538
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:01,390
I think I was the fucking head of the 
fcc at one point in time or what does it

1539
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,580
change?
What was he the head of nasdaq?

1540
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,720
Was it nasdaq?
He was the head of,

1541
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,020
I think he was the head of nasdaq and 
the not fcc.

1542
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:14,060
He's the head of nasdaq and this fucking
guy goes on to be the biggest ponzi 

1543
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,550
scheme mastermind in the history of the 
country.

1544
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,520
I mean that's pretty incredible.
A guy that like worked in the system,

1545
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,950
he must've known that it's impossible to
figure it out.

1546
01:04:21,951 --> 01:04:24,050
like I always,
I never paid attention.

1547
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:29,051
Like I look at the stock market,
I see all those numbers going back and 

1548
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:29,051
forth and I'm wondering what the fuck is
all that?

1549
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:29,680
What does that even mean?
You know,

1550
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,770
somebody knows to crap table.
It seems like it's all bullshit,

1551
01:04:33,771 --> 01:04:38,771
but look,
obviously there's this alan greenspan 

1552
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:38,771
guy seems very bright.
He's got everything under wraps.

1553
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:42,400
Someone knows until this whole financial
collapse came along and this bernie made

1554
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:43,130
off thing,
came along.

1555
01:04:43,131 --> 01:04:43,760
I was like,
oh,

1556
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,590
they don't even know.
Nobody even knows.

1557
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,910
Nobody knows how this thing works.

1558
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:47,760
No,
it's,

1559
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:53,230
it's a,
it's a belief system that's crazy that 

1560
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,090
you have to believe that it worked.
I started reading,

1561
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,370
I started reading up on it and I 
started,

1562
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,390
you know,
as I always do,

1563
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:05,391
I read a little bit and then I start 
pontificating and then two follow up 

1564
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:06,210
questions that in my whole argument 
falls on the ground.

1565
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,760
But after reading a little bit more,
I've read that book,

1566
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:11,430
the case against the fed.
And uh,

1567
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:16,431
I stopped talking to people about it 
because it's like if I really start 

1568
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:18,340
informing people and everybody knows 
this whole is gonna fucking collapsed.

1569
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:23,341
So I just became part of the line that I
liked,

1570
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,500
lIke people going to put your money in 
the bank.

1571
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:31,501
it's safe that it's insured up to 200 
really and you're going to go with 

1572
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:35,701
insurance companies.
The only people that's fucking more 

1573
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:35,701
corrupt.
Yeah,

1574
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:35,701
it's insured until it isn't.

1575
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:40,470
The craziest thing is when you go to New
York in times square and you said that 

1576
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,171
one building that has the national debt 
and how it's accumulating and it's just 

1577
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:47,071
spinning.
Just add an extra fucking zero to it 

1578
01:05:47,071 --> 01:05:47,071
recently.

1579
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:47,740
Oh yeah.
No,

1580
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,410
they coming around.
They had a,

1581
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:51,230
like,
we hit a point,

1582
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,320
the legal amount of debt we're allowed 
to have.

1583
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:59,321
So we didn't know what the fuck to do.
So they had a quick meeting and then 

1584
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:01,160
they just doubled.
It just doubled.

1585
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,640
So now it's not a problem.
No,

1586
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:05,660
it's only halfway there now.
So,

1587
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:06,530
um,
yeah,

1588
01:06:06,531 --> 01:06:09,140
do what I gotta admit like this.
There's a lot of terrifying things about

1589
01:06:09,141 --> 01:06:14,141
living out here in los angeles,
living in a city that is in a bankrupt 

1590
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:14,860
state with the,
you know,

1591
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,150
it doesn't really have a water supply.
Technically.

1592
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:22,420
You live in a fucking desert.
The property is like a really overrun 

1593
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,530
and all that crazy.
A drug cartel shit.

1594
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:27,350
Emmy is essentially a couple of years 
rapidly.

1595
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,330
It's right down the fucking street

1596
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:34,890
drive.
It's like if you live in in Afghanistan 

1597
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:34,890
and the war is two hours away,
he'd be like,

1598
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:35,590
wow,
we're pretty close to the sheer.

1599
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:36,190
You know what I'm saying?

1600
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,600
They take a road trip.
You want to go to the war today?

1601
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,130
Yeah.
Literally.

1602
01:06:40,131 --> 01:06:42,860
Especially when you're in san diego.
Whenever I'm down in san diego,

1603
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,330
you're fucking half an hour from 10 
walnuts.

1604
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,330
Unsettling and those,
those,

1605
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:47,800
you know,
something.

1606
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:52,810
This,
something that I wish there was a 

1607
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,510
mexican comedian here right now.
I really just thought it was because of 

1608
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,270
this call will be barcelona one I've 
always wondered is why they got so 

1609
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:01,360
offended by that sign that has the 
running.

1610
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,360
Mexicans don't running family across the
street.

1611
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,230
Why is that offensive?
We don't want to run over you.

1612
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:14,330
people are embarrassed because they're 
embarrassed by the idea that mexicans 

1613
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:14,330
have to get into this country that way

1614
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,550
and oh,
I get it.

1615
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:20,580
It's embarrassing.
It's not realistic because there's only 

1616
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,430
three people in the field.
It's embarrassing.

1617
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:24,110
The whole idea about Mexico being that 
close,

1618
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,240
you know,
it's got to be embarrassing.

1619
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:31,241
There's no other place in the world that
I know of where there's a first world 

1620
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:31,241
country connected to a third world 
country.

1621
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,640
You know what the fuck is this solution?
See If you open the borders and you let 

1622
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,640
people go everywhere that they.
Like I said,

1623
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,140
this is not gonna last,
this,

1624
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,410
this standard of living that we have in 
America.

1625
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,260
It wouldn't be the same if we had open 
borders and anybody could just immigrate

1626
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,270
to America,
it would get fucked quick.

1627
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,500
yeah.
You goTta have the gated community a.

1628
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:54,370
Well that's what the United States is.
It's like a big fucking gated community.

1629
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,720
well,
I don't think you should just be able to

1630
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:56,380
walk.
I can.

1631
01:07:56,381 --> 01:07:58,280
I like,
we get a lot of shit for that.

1632
01:07:58,281 --> 01:07:59,000
I mean,
can I just.

1633
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:04,350
Can you just walk into France some 
places you can pretty much go anywhere 

1634
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,400
you want if you wanted to.
You know what I'm saying?

1635
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:07,460
Legally,
can I just.

1636
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,500
Can I just start living in France?
I don't know.

1637
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,010
I know I can go there and visit and get 
fucking do it.

1638
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,330
I could actually.
That's one of my things I really want to

1639
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:22,331
do is I want to,
I would love to become fluent in and be 

1640
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:26,831
able to speak french and then go over 
there and act as the ignorant american 

1641
01:08:26,831 --> 01:08:26,870
just to hear the shit.
Yeah,

1642
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:31,670
just act as dumb as I plan my ex eiffel 
tower.

1643
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Ain't that big mona lisa's sitting there
all expressionless my ex fucking whoop 

1644
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:43,390
blonde hair.
My ex just blonde hair girl but could 

1645
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:43,610
speak spanish.
So it was great.

1646
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:48,630
She like,
she would have her own fond just going 

1647
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,630
in,
You know,

1648
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,400
listening to people talk about her when 
she walked by and stuff.

1649
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,340
But she ain't did shit to ship a bust 
them,

1650
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:52,940
huh?
Oh,

1651
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,100
nonstop.
She would bust them all the time.

1652
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:57,950
Like we'd be waiting in line at el lpo 
local and they would say like looking at

1653
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,840
chicks tits or something like that.
She'd be like,

1654
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,310
what the fuck are you talking about?
But like,

1655
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,440
you know,
back in spanish or she was giving me her

1656
01:09:03,441 --> 01:09:08,441
phone number.
I don't know if you hit like single de 

1657
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,250
gado.

1658
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,060
No,
I got the rosetta stone.

1659
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,910
A spanish speaker one,
you want to learn spanish?

1660
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,580
Yeah,
dude,

1661
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:18,950
I got it in christmas.
oh,

1662
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:19,220
eight,

1663
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,080
right on the plastic.
Still on it.

1664
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:27,310
It's like an elliptical machine for me.
It's like those fucking mavis baking 

1665
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:31,371
learned how to type.
I buy those fucking things every couple 

1666
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:31,371
of years old.
They've got learn how type program.

1667
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:31,720
Virtually.
I'm alert type.

1668
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,650
I use I type quick,
but I use fucking three fingers.

1669
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:39,890
I use like these two in this one and 
I'll go every now and then I'll throw 

1670
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:43,251
this motherfucker in the mix,
maybe three fingers on this hand and I 

1671
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:46,300
kind of moved to two on this hand so I 
don't use the whole burn victim type,

1672
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,860
like a fad.
My hand smash with hammers,

1673
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,390
but I always say I'm going to eventually
get that fucking mavis bacon.

1674
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:55,080
I'm going to get on it

1675
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,410
though you.
You'll be like,

1676
01:09:56,411 --> 01:10:00,240
I'm really surprised at some of the shit
that I finally like.

1677
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:05,290
The only thing I ever worked on was 
being a comedian because I thought it 

1678
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:05,500
was going to solve all my problems.
People are going to see me on stage.

1679
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:08,390
He's funny and every going to stop 
fucking with me and everything was gonna

1680
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:13,410
work out and then what ended up 
happening is the only thing I was 

1681
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:13,410
remotely decent that was being a 
comedian.

1682
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,010
So I finally learned how to start fixing
shit.

1683
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,700
Like what kind of shit did I fix my 
toilet and one in New York.

1684
01:10:18,701 --> 01:10:20,980
I got a tenant back there and he was 
bitching about something.

1685
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,430
We got this fucking awful landlord.
He always comes in,

1686
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:26,800
I swear to god with used parts from 
other,

1687
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:32,160
other apartments and they never worked.
So I just looked in the back like I was 

1688
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,510
just picturing how dumb he looks yet he 
knows how to do it.

1689
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:35,740
So I just,
I don't know what I did.

1690
01:10:35,741 --> 01:10:37,730
I went on youtube and watched a couple 
of videos,

1691
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:41,560
a toilet.
It's basic and I just sorta figured shit

1692
01:10:41,561 --> 01:10:41,980
out.
Um,

1693
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,290
and I listened,
I flushed it,

1694
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:46,990
I looked,
I figured out what the flapper.

1695
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,870
It's a fucking $8 flapper and then I got
it.

1696
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:51,130
Now it's like,
fuck,

1697
01:10:51,131 --> 01:10:52,440
how does this go in?
And he's just like,

1698
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:57,450
just,
it's almost like when I got better at 

1699
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:58,210
computers where I stopped freaking out 
and I just was like,

1700
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:01,090
just stop,
take in information,

1701
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,770
process it and think that's what I 
fucking it.

1702
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,670
Second,
I wish I had the time,

1703
01:11:06,671 --> 01:11:11,671
the patients and the interest to build 
my own car because I would love to get 

1704
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:12,440
one of those kits.
Corvette,

1705
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:17,030
who can do that now?
The body's good on fucking toss at 3:50.

1706
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:20,130
I wish they didn't do it with bondo.
It's off the mask.

1707
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:22,630
On the old jeep kits,
you remember the old jeep kits.

1708
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:24,390
You could buy a kit and build your own 
army.

1709
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:26,070
Jeep,
remember it was like a thousand bucks or

1710
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:27,520
something like that.
They still have costs.

1711
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:32,990
And you can take a kit car like a noble.
I remember they used to sell the noble 

1712
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:34,170
in America,
but you couldn't buy with a powertrain.

1713
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,490
You couldn't buy with an engineer to put
your own engine.

1714
01:11:36,491 --> 01:11:41,491
You're on powertrain in it.
so it's basically like a do it yourself 

1715
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:41,491
fucking car

1716
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:41,700
guy,
uh,

1717
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,430
who had a friend in this state I used to
live in.

1718
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,290
I'm not going to say where,
but uh,

1719
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:51,530
back in the day that jeep cj seven,
they basically kept the same chassis,

1720
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:55,410
body,
all that shit for like fucking 15 years,

1721
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,750
so he had some old piece of shit.
One,

1722
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,840
so he did was he went out and he stole a
brand new one and just parked them side 

1723
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:08,250
by side in his garage and just took 
apart the new one and put all the new so

1724
01:12:08,251 --> 01:12:13,251
all the numbers still match whatever the
numbers are supposed to be like on the 

1725
01:12:13,251 --> 01:12:14,400
frame and all that to everything matched
and he just,

1726
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:19,401
he did like a,
like plastic surgery and he just took 

1727
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:22,611
all the new shit that he needed a,
I think he had to keep his engine block 

1728
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:26,870
and there was the frame or something 
like gearheads would know what he would 

1729
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:27,210
have to do with the,
the rest of the stuff.

1730
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:32,270
Then he just took like,
he had like a welt and he was like a 

1731
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:32,270
welding thing and he just sort of cut it
into pieces

1732
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:36,530
of remember the greatest scape when they
would just drive the dirt on the bottom.

1733
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,960
Yeah.
We just sort of dumped shit here or 

1734
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:41,960
there.
If you just have a piece of a frame,

1735
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,600
they're not going to give a fuck or you 
know,

1736
01:12:42,601 --> 01:12:44,220
I don't even know what it is.
How do you prove it?

1737
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,300
Yeah,
I mean,

1738
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,410
yeah,
I mean I didn't really.

1739
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:50,220
I mean I don't have the mechanical know 
how to say exactly what he did,

1740
01:12:50,221 --> 01:12:52,020
but I.
But I said what did he do with the extra

1741
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:57,021
shit?
And it was basically yet he cut it down 

1742
01:12:57,021 --> 01:12:57,021
into smaller pieces.

1743
01:12:57,021 --> 01:13:00,100
You can't fucking build a car today.
Like you can't build a new 2011 shelby 

1744
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:03,040
mustang convertible.
You can't build it now with no.

1745
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:06,590
But when you can do and there's so much 
shit going on.

1746
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,540
It's like,
it's so complicated.

1747
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,250
You know,
it's not like the old days,

1748
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:10,910
you know,
if you,

1749
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,490
if you in the old days,
if you're fucking engine blew,

1750
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,320
you could replace your engine,
you know,

1751
01:13:15,321 --> 01:13:20,321
all you need is like a crane and a buddy
knew what the fuck he was doing and you 

1752
01:13:20,321 --> 01:13:20,321
know,

1753
01:13:20,321 --> 01:13:23,040
but it was also much more like my first 
card I had,

1754
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:26,520
I had a ford ranger and I actually 
learned if I wanted to go,

1755
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:30,000
I just didn't have the balls to do it 
because I didn't have a friend who could

1756
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:32,040
fix the problem,
you know what I mean?

1757
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,500
So I had to keep it very light.
I was like a hygienist,

1758
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:37,310
but like working on fucking car,
I,

1759
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:38,470
you learned,
you know,

1760
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:41,670
changing the oil is the first thing.
Then You learn how to change the belts,

1761
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,730
then you start doing the spark plugs and
you get the timing light.

1762
01:13:44,731 --> 01:13:47,980
And I got right to the point where I was
going to start fucking with the,

1763
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:51,480
I dunno what trying to do like the 
pistons and shit and maybe I'll,

1764
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:56,481
uh,
I'll try to get some more horsepower in 

1765
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:56,481
this.
And I was just like,

1766
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:56,481
phil,
it's a fucking ford ranger,

1767
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:57,070
two wheel drive.
what are you at?

1768
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:02,430
I'm happy.
Just be happy that it says that is 

1769
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:05,911
running a change once.
And I dumped it into the sewer and 

1770
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:07,900
dumped it into one of those.
That was legal.

1771
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,900
I didn't even think I was 17 years old.
I was.

1772
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:11,980
And,

1773
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,230
and as I'm dumping in,
this guy walks by,

1774
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:14,620
he goes,
yeah,

1775
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:16,750
that's a good place for that.
I thought,

1776
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:17,380
yeah,
that's a good place.

1777
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,460
And I thought about like,
oh,

1778
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:21,190
he's making fun of me.
Oh my god,

1779
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:22,300
I'm a douche bag.
God,

1780
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:24,820
why did I think it was okay to pour the 
oil and it's fucking drink.

1781
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,660
And then I thought that fucks with me 
today.

1782
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:30,460
Really still still.
I think about it sometimes I think about

1783
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,320
sometimes that I poured oil into the 
drain,

1784
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:34,330
like a retard and that this guy came by 
and go,

1785
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:35,230
yeah,
that's a good place with that.

1786
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,490
And then I was so dumb.
I was like,

1787
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:37,360
yeah,
it is a good place for it.

1788
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:37,570
Right?

1789
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:42,640
It fucks with you because you're into 
the environment or because he made you 

1790
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:42,640
look stupid because I was a retard,
not because it made me look stupid.

1791
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:47,650
I was stupid.
He probably thinks the same thing like 

1792
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:47,650
that asshole.
I can't probably still.

1793
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,050
It's probably dead.
That'll fuck.

1794
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,560
There's a long time ago you were 
uninformed because you're uninformed.

1795
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,050
He becomes an old facility and old.
Fuck you.

1796
01:14:57,051 --> 01:14:58,700
You piece of shit makes it funnier.
You know?

1797
01:14:58,701 --> 01:15:02,420
There's so many weird things like that.
That gentleman,

1798
01:15:02,421 --> 01:15:07,421
he's probably passed away.
There's so many weird things like that 

1799
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:08,660
that you're not allowed to dispose of 
like that to monitor water.

1800
01:15:08,661 --> 01:15:09,830
Man.
It gets into the ocean,

1801
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:11,970
but the crazy thing is that the oil

1802
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,570
put in is nothing compared to what's on 
the fucking road every day.

1803
01:15:14,571 --> 01:15:15,800
I mean,
everybody's leaking oil.

1804
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:17,300
You're driving up and down the street at
range,

1805
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,050
goes in the gutter,

1806
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,270
right?
Yo shout,

1807
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,730
justify it.
any way you have to justify it.

1808
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:24,520
I told you I'm ashamed to this day.
One time I was in,

1809
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:29,530
I was fishing and dump it in the woods 
really has taken because I didn't.

1810
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,450
I didn't smell as bad as that river.
I didn't know.

1811
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,670
I didn't know that you weren't supposed 
to do that.

1812
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:39,671
And then.
But then I figured out they had this 

1813
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:39,671
place down the street near the fire 
department.

1814
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:41,720
They had this big giant thing that you 
just,

1815
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:46,730
you just dumped your oil and right back 
in the day when there wasn't a computer 

1816
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:46,730
chips and it was easy.

1817
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,930
I was in the,
uh,

1818
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:52,990
I was in the charles river fishing once 
and it was right across the street from 

1819
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,331
my house where I lived in boston and I 
saw this bubbling in the water and I 

1820
01:15:56,331 --> 01:15:56,331
couldn't figure out what the fuck it 
was.

1821
01:15:56,331 --> 01:15:56,670
I was looking,
I was like,

1822
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,650
something's like bubbling,
like water's coming up.

1823
01:15:58,651 --> 01:16:03,651
It's kind of crazy.
And then I saw a rubber and then I 

1824
01:16:03,651 --> 01:16:04,050
realized that what I was looking at with
shit,

1825
01:16:04,051 --> 01:16:09,051
some of it was shed broken sewer pipe 
that was pouring directly into the 

1826
01:16:09,051 --> 01:16:13,401
river.
So every time people flush their toilet 

1827
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,600
shit and piss and rubbers and tampons,
which is floating in this,

1828
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:19,380
in this fucking river,
disgust and finished medicine.

1829
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,700
Oh,
it was so nasty.

1830
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,110
And I went for a little bit further 
down.

1831
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,750
There was a waterfall at the bottom of 
the waterfall that was foam.

1832
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:27,750
It was so much chemicals in the water 
that had made like a thick,

1833
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:30,330
white and yellow foam at the bottom of 
the water.

1834
01:16:30,331 --> 01:16:30,480
Yep.

1835
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:31,450
There you go.
That's,

1836
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:36,480
that's.
You know what's worse is like a baby 

1837
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,210
diapers in parking.
Lots of like target.

1838
01:16:37,211 --> 01:16:42,211
The other day was that there were just 
these little squares where they like 

1839
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:42,550
change the diaper and they're laying on 
the ground stuff.

1840
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,950
I got out and stepped right on it.
It was just like.

1841
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,590
It's just like everywhere.
I see it all the time now.

1842
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,290
The bourbon landmine,
I apologize for that.

1843
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:56,340
That's a big thing to do.
I guess you don't want to keep it in 

1844
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:56,340
your car when you drive home.

1845
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,960
My car always has diapers in it.
My wife takes these diapers,

1846
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,090
wraps him up and he's little bombs and 
leaves them there.

1847
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,270
And then I hop in my car,
lyn shift funds,

1848
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,290
a little diaper bombs everywhere,
little piss bombs.

1849
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:07,860
They're everywhere.
They're all fucking house.

1850
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,010
That newborn smell,
it's

1851
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:15,010
not that bad.
My two year old has some pretty stinky 

1852
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,081
poops,
but you know at this point the kids 

1853
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:17,081
probably going to like fucking 
mcdonald's.

1854
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:18,490
No starting to screw up their colon 
itam.

1855
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,050
I don't serve them shitty food.
Fuck that.

1856
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,510
She gets.
She gets fries and stuff occasionally in

1857
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:28,511
ice cream occasionally,
but for the most part she eats healthy 

1858
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:31,540
food.
If you get them into eating shitty food 

1859
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:31,540
or get make shitty food,
a big deal,

1860
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:31,790
make it exciting.
You know,

1861
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:36,791
make it something special.
Now that's why mcdonald's is a fucking 

1862
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:36,791
playground.
He dragged my mcdonald's.

1863
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:40,811
She's sees these bright colors and tubes
and slides and shit and they just want 

1864
01:17:40,811 --> 01:17:41,570
to go in there.
But the foods,

1865
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,880
if I ever have kids,
I'm gonna.

1866
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,020
I'm gonna.
Feed him shit food,

1867
01:17:44,021 --> 01:17:48,600
make them fat so I can feel it can be,
feel better about myself.

1868
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,710
You know.
See the first person I've ever seen feed

1869
01:17:50,711 --> 01:17:52,300
their kid octopus.
I was like,

1870
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,400
whoa,
octopus.

1871
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,280
That's ridiculous.

1872
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:59,780
Enjoys it.
She asked for octopus and people like 

1873
01:17:59,780 --> 01:17:59,780
your fucking kids asking for octopus.
I can't.

1874
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,960
That's too fishy.
Too chewy.

1875
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,770
Do I ever eat octopus sushi?
Yeah,

1876
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:05,180
I've,
I've,

1877
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,450
I've Tried to mess.
Delicious.

1878
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,380
Yeah,
I love it now.

1879
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,000
That's,

1880
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,460
that's when like the,
the hardcore japanese guys given you the

1881
01:18:11,461 --> 01:18:13,200
fucking heads up.
like you know what you're doing.

1882
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:18,780
Like the closer it is,
that means you're really into nasty 

1883
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:18,780
shit.
I,

1884
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:21,360
that's my other favorite food.
I'm the classic american sushi.

1885
01:18:21,361 --> 01:18:21,870
I'm like,
yeah,

1886
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,770
let me get a yellow tail hand roll.
Spicy California roll.

1887
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,110
Yeah,
telling the fish tuna roll.

1888
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,600
I keep it real.
Put salmon,

1889
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:31,920
salmon,
avocado.

1890
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:36,921
I keep it really a me too.
That's even like eel eel roll I liked 

1891
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,910
but I just kinda,
that's just something to like tonight is

1892
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,920
standard.
I don't have any sort of guilt when I 

1893
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,741
eat that even though they're dying off.
But elijah just seems like an 

1894
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:48,360
unnecessary one to,
to eat really eel sauce.

1895
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,500
I don't like it

1896
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:54,530
ill because of the sauce.
I only like sushi that you don't need 

1897
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:55,300
sauce for like look yellow tail tuna,
that kind of shit.

1898
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,640
How,
how bad are the tuna going extinct?

1899
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,540
Is that like a big deal?

1900
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:04,420
I don't know.
Everything's going extinct because 

1901
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:04,420
there's too many fucking people and we 
keep.

1902
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:09,580
The problem is is they make too much 
money off of us like we're not like 

1903
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,520
we're not.
People were these things they make money

1904
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:13,370
off of so they need as much of us around
against that.

1905
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,620
All,
all,

1906
01:19:14,621 --> 01:19:16,820
all the animals are going to come back.
When the robots,

1907
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:18,140
when the robots take over,

1908
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:19,580
it'd be like,
I am legend.

1909
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:21,140
Deer running through the streets of 
manhattan.

1910
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,190
That kind of shit.

1911
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,070
I don't think it'd be that bad debt 
because they'll keep manhattan,

1912
01:19:25,071 --> 01:19:27,050
but it'll definitely be like in jersey,
jersey,

1913
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:27,920
we'll all grow over.

1914
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,800
I wenT to Colorado.
People are useless.

1915
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:34,850
I went to Colorado and I was living 
there for four months and when I came 

1916
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:35,570
back a deer had decided to make my 
backyard home in la,

1917
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:40,690
this right out here,
and every day this deer would be 

1918
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:40,690
wandering through my yard,
chewing grass,

1919
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:41,990
and they just decided to.
Since nobody was here,

1920
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:43,820
there's no noise.
They just started moving in.

1921
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,090
Interesting.
Soon as I moved back in,

1922
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:51,100
she stopped coming around,
but she could literally jump that fence 

1923
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:51,100
six feet high and it's fucking a wrought
iron.

1924
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,130
She'd jump right?
Oh yeah,

1925
01:19:52,131 --> 01:19:53,510
they got it.
It's got to be eight feet.

1926
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:55,820
I got a buddy of mine has a,
has a problem with that,

1927
01:19:55,821 --> 01:19:58,910
so he's got this eight foot my cheek.
You're really not that naval.

1928
01:19:58,911 --> 01:19:59,410
He'd say,
no dude,

1929
01:19:59,411 --> 01:20:02,570
I got a kitten and the name at the deer 
come in.

1930
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:03,500
Yeah,
they really do.

1931
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:05,830
They hop right over six foot fence.
It's incredible to watch it.

1932
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:08,190
So I just fly through the air,

1933
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,990
but they were moving in and they were 
ready to take over.

1934
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,790
You goT a gun range out here?
Uh,

1935
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:15,330
I got a fake pig that I shoot arrows 
into.

1936
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,410
Can we do that after the podcast?
So you teach me how to do that shit once

1937
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,060
you down.
I'm learning how to.

1938
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,420
A couple of things.
I'm learning how to pick a lock on.

1939
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:24,960
Yeah,
I'm going to be.

1940
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:29,961
Then when those urban survivor guys,
whenever you'd like a thousand degrees 

1941
01:20:29,961 --> 01:20:29,961
in this room really is.
Let me just turn on the.

1942
01:20:29,961 --> 01:20:31,600
I just talked to these people.
I turned the ac.

1943
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,580
I'm learning how to pick a lock on 
youtube.

1944
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,320
I'm trying to learn how to hot wire a 
car.

1945
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:38,940
Youtube is great for that shit.
Yeah,

1946
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:39,750
you can.
Fuck dude.

1947
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:43,020
I've taught myself how to play guitar,
play drums.

1948
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,160
I've watched people get knocked out,
get kicked in the balls,

1949
01:20:47,161 --> 01:20:51,140
hide a camera into the toilet paper roll
thing and cited that in the bathroom.

1950
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,450
I found out how to do that.
Oh really?

1951
01:20:52,451 --> 01:20:57,451
Yeah.
You can become a real fucking creep up 

1952
01:20:57,451 --> 01:20:57,451
on youtube and all that.

1953
01:20:57,451 --> 01:21:00,800
That's what I love about the internet.
You really can just become the person 

1954
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:00,800
that you.
If you feel like you know,

1955
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,660
I want to be a better read.
You can go to wikipedia and see what 

1956
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:09,831
morons think about the subject that you 
want to learn about or if you want to 

1957
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:09,831
add a little creepy shit to your,
to your,

1958
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,700
uh,
to your personality,

1959
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:16,701
you can do that.
I want to learn how to pick a fucking 

1960
01:21:16,701 --> 01:21:16,701
luck just so I can do it.
Yeah,

1961
01:21:16,701 --> 01:21:20,470
because I.
Because I only know the credit card 

1962
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,470
technique where you slide it in and that
never works,

1963
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:24,320
you know?
Were you surprised that they was 

1964
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:24,320
showing?
I was watching somebody like,

1965
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:24,840
firstly you have to know like how a lock
works,

1966
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,140
like what it is in there and this person
is really,

1967
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:32,160
you know,
like the little clip on thing from the 

1968
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,621
pen.
They'd somehow jam that in there and 

1969
01:21:33,621 --> 01:21:34,020
then take like a hairpin.
I'm so full of shit I didn't,

1970
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:39,021
haven't learned.
I watched somebody do it and I want to 

1971
01:21:39,021 --> 01:21:39,021
try it.
That's basically it.

1972
01:21:39,021 --> 01:21:41,880
But the overhead is I have to buy a lock
so I haven't quite committed to it.

1973
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:44,150
You know what?
I'm going to buy the lock and it's going

1974
01:21:44,151 --> 01:21:46,650
to sit right on top of my fucking learn 
how to speak spanish.

1975
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,800
I figure if I'm going into a log,
I might as well took the door and a 

1976
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,440
martial art training

1977
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,610
bag.
It's not going to move or hit you back.

1978
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:57,400
It's not hard to kick a door.
Right?

1979
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:59,420
Those are easy.
That's why it's funny when you see a guy

1980
01:21:59,421 --> 01:22:01,350
like on those fucking,
those uh,

1981
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,770
videos of cops breaking the doors and 
the guy looked,

1982
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,480
especially the old school ones from the 
sixties.

1983
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,700
You guys kicking the door over and over 
again to kick it,

1984
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:11,370
to break doors or all doors are raising 
come.

1985
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,370
He's not able to do it because he's a 
faggot.

1986
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:15,050
well,
there you go.

1987
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:18,280
I never understood why they own window.
There is something about.

1988
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:20,930
Yeah,
literally he likes sex with the same.

1989
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,820
Where's my water?
Yours.

1990
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,770
This is empty.
I to take a chance.

1991
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,830
There's one last time.
Mine was right there.

1992
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:33,740
You don't want to take a chance.
You're the one who busted out the fake 

1993
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:34,140
asshole admitted into this podcast.
Well,

1994
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:35,630
I don't mean when I say faggot,

1995
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,970
it was in a gay man.
You mean pussy?

1996
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,870
Yeah.
That's one of my words.

1997
01:22:40,871 --> 01:22:43,880
I will not give up no matter how much 
people give me shit about know now.

1998
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:45,460
Louis ck,
he's got that big chunk on it.

1999
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,470
I have a problem with that.
That word to me is not a gay slur.

2000
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,930
You know what really drives me crazy 
when they're saying you can't say gay,

2001
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:57,510
but you can't say that's gay,
like it's offensive or insensitive.

2002
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,940
Well,
didn't always mean joyful and beginning.

2003
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:01,990
It made you know,
like,

2004
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:02,360
have a

2005
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:05,980
gay happy gay nineties,

2006
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
the 18 nineties and change.
There'll be sexual and why can't they 

2007
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:15,181
accept that?
It also means lame because a certain 

2008
01:23:15,181 --> 01:23:17,530
groups own words.
What if you spell it g h e y,

2009
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:21,550
gaze zone,
gay jewish people own holocaust,

2010
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,770
you know,
that whole thing.

2011
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,100
Jim jefferies.
Dope.

2012
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,320
Were you on the hand wiping after the 
show?

2013
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,560
Was it,
were you on the show when jeffries was 

2014
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:31,560
talking about is uh,
oh yeah,

2015
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:31,560
yeah,
yeah.

2016
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,370
Ridiculous.
Is that he wanted a jim jefferies,

2017
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:38,450
hilarious comedian.
One of the name is a dvd alcoholic cost 

2018
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:40,600
the up and apparently the defendant,
a bunch of jewish people.

2019
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:43,420
They got super upset.
I think it offended the,

2020
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:47,350
the ones who are in the group.
I think generally speaking,

2021
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:50,050
most people don't give a shit.
I don't know about that.

2022
01:23:50,051 --> 01:23:55,051
I would say that a lot of people who are
jewish probably have a problem with 

2023
01:23:55,051 --> 01:23:55,051
that.

2024
01:23:55,051 --> 01:23:55,300
People are very,
very sensitive to that.

2025
01:23:55,750 --> 01:24:00,750
Now they don't want you to cracking 
jokes on something that fucked up their 

2026
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:00,750
whole,
you know.

2027
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:04,920
Well,
he explained it and he didn't even need 

2028
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:04,920
to explain it.
I get it.

2029
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:05,020
I didn't think he was making fun of 
jewish people.

2030
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:10,021
He was saying like,
he's drinking so much that he's a 

2031
01:24:10,021 --> 01:24:11,860
holocaust having a holocaust of alcohol.
You can't own a word.

2032
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,510
I mean it just calling something a whoa.
Look,

2033
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,560
what would they need another word for 
what happened to the jews in nazi 

2034
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:19,560
Germany?
I mean,

2035
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,980
it's a horrible,
horrible thing and it is a holocaust,

2036
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:24,220
but it's not the only holocaust.
You can't own that word now.

2037
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:27,850
You can't treat it like the Ohio state 
university.

2038
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:31,300
It's a tricky one.
The holocaust,

2039
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:36,330
like it's trademarked.
It's a word to describe anything that's 

2040
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:36,330
atrocious.
Anything that's horrible.

2041
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,180
I mean,
that's really what it is.

2042
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,620
It's a,
it's a word to describe.

2043
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,690
Usually.
I've never looked it up.

2044
01:24:40,691 --> 01:24:45,691
I don't know what.
let's look up the official term of 

2045
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:45,691
holocaust.
Brian,

2046
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:49,070
tell us what it is.
I look up a and then look up the law.

2047
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:49,620
I mean,
look,

2048
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:54,630
it was clear,
it's not that he's making light of this 

2049
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:55,600
horrible situation that has happened.
it was a play on words,

2050
01:24:55,810 --> 01:25:00,810
but then he did make light.
Then he fucked up and said they should 

2051
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:00,810
get over it.
It was his fucking 60 years ago.

2052
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:02,860
Fucking get over it.
I thought what the accent,

2053
01:25:02,861 --> 01:25:05,950
he'd get away with it because it sounded
cheeky.

2054
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:08,950
Australia is the shit.
Have you ever done comedy over there?

2055
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,120
Uh,
yeah,

2056
01:25:10,121 --> 01:25:15,121
I did,
but it was a typical thing where it was 

2057
01:25:15,121 --> 01:25:17,311
like,
they was a three day thing where they 

2058
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:20,011
flew over for one day.
They gave you a day to get fucking used 

2059
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:20,011
to it.

2060
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:20,050
Uh,
and then,

2061
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:22,450
then you did the gig and then they flew 
you back.

2062
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:26,410
I stuck around for a couple days ago.
that's kind of how I was in sydney.

2063
01:25:26,411 --> 01:25:28,030
I was only in sydney for a couple of 
days,

2064
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:31,600
but I did a gig up there.
I wanted to see all those fucking snakes

2065
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:33,430
over there.
We saw kangaroos,

2066
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:38,690
kangaroos at kill people all the time.
There's these big giant fucking 

2067
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,600
kangaroos called gray kangaroos and they
tell you if you run into gray kangaroos,

2068
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:43,610
you better leave.
Just get the fuck away from there.

2069
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:48,630
Super aggressive and they're really big.
They're like the fucking 318 and the 

2070
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:50,590
relation and the kick you in the stomach
and fucking glory.

2071
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:53,530
You bugs bunny.
They leaned back in the tail.

2072
01:25:53,531 --> 01:25:58,531
I do that,
but they do glean back in the tail and 

2073
01:25:58,531 --> 01:25:58,531
attack you,
but they have claws,

2074
01:25:58,531 --> 01:25:59,200
man.
They'll rip your fucking stomach apart.

2075
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:01,030
They'll fuck you up when they get 
inside.

2076
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:03,040
I haven't watched enough ufc.
that fucking elbow.

2077
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,610
You've got to claim the most important 
thing.

2078
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,640
Can you get that clinch?
You got no space between you and take 

2079
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:09,640
the kangaroo to the ground.
They're there.

2080
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,590
They've got a great standup.
Then I bounced right back to their feet,

2081
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:13,220
bro.
Don't even try.

2082
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,650
They're fucking fucking arms are too 
small.

2083
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:18,260
The grapple.
If you go to the under hooks ups,

2084
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,200
but you've got to go randy coture star.
We juSt press them up against a tree and

2085
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:22,190
work them over with.
Nice.

2086
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,810
Hey,
just breaking balls.

2087
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:26,150
Work on animals.
Racking balls.

2088
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:28,040
Yeah,
like if you rack a dog's balls,

2089
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:30,860
do they go at all or are we the only 
ones?

2090
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,920
I think it hurts them,
but I think when an animal gets into 

2091
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:36,260
that state where they're attacking,
trying to kill you,

2092
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,120
they don't think about painting the way 
people do.

2093
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:38,870
You know,
I,

2094
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,540
I've seen dogs fight with each other and
they're,

2095
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:46,541
they're wagging their tail like happy.
Meanwhile they're ripping each other's 

2096
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:46,790
faces apart,
especially pitbulls pitbulls.

2097
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,070
They don't,
they don't seem to experience any pain.

2098
01:26:49,071 --> 01:26:54,071
When they fight,
they seem to just just do it and then 

2099
01:26:54,071 --> 01:26:54,071
think about the pain later,
like they block it out somehow because I

2100
01:26:54,071 --> 01:26:56,000
would not count on kicking a dog and the
balls.

2101
01:26:56,150 --> 01:27:01,150
If a dog is attacking you,
your best move is to choke it 

2102
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:03,791
unconscious.
I wonder if there's videos of monkeys 

2103
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:03,791
getting racked.
Know monkeys.

2104
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:04,350
I'm sure it would suck.
They know her.

2105
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:09,390
They know it sucks because when they 
attack people and chimps attack people 

2106
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:09,560
that go for your balls,
that's one of the number one things.

2107
01:27:09,561 --> 01:27:14,561
So do they try to eat your genitalia 
that a rip your balls off and then 

2108
01:27:14,561 --> 01:27:17,330
usually twist your foot off to take your
fingers off the bite.

2109
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:22,330
People's fingers off.
They go for your balls to try to blind 

2110
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:24,641
you.
They try to take away everything that 

2111
01:27:24,641 --> 01:27:24,641
makes you human.
All your valuable assets,

2112
01:27:24,641 --> 01:27:26,660
your ability to control things,
your ability to use your dick.

2113
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,270
I fucked up.
I hate monkeys.

2114
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,190
Really?
I just some a bottom.

2115
01:27:31,191 --> 01:27:33,560
I don't like chimps or scariest.
I don't mind chimps.

2116
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:38,561
I don't mind gorillas,
but those little fucking throwing shit 

2117
01:27:38,561 --> 01:27:38,660
at you.
Spider monkeys.

2118
01:27:38,661 --> 01:27:43,661
I jusT don't fucking lie.
I think it's from Indiana jones because 

2119
01:27:43,661 --> 01:27:46,121
that monkey was a dick and ever since 
some aggregated small month dixon organ 

2120
01:27:46,121 --> 01:27:48,530
grinder guy from back when I was a kid 
down in faneuil hall,

2121
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:53,740
they would always.
Granted they've had to wear that stupid 

2122
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:53,740
bellboy outfit so they probably weren't 
in a good mood,

2123
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,250
but they will always creepy.
Yeah.

2124
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,790
I grew up with a monkey now,
not my monkey monkey by my grandmother's

2125
01:27:58,791 --> 01:27:59,120
monkey.

2126
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,560
You're criminal.
Had a monkey,

2127
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:03,380
a grandmother and a monkey named chichi.
Chichi lived in the attic.

2128
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:05,530
And you couldn't ever have chichi around
people because she,

2129
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,070
she would bite you,
cheat,

2130
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:12,100
you would chew gum,
she would give her gum and he would 

2131
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:12,950
unwrap the gum it in his mouth,
but he only liked my grandmother,

2132
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:15,130
didn't trust anybody else.
And if anybody got near him,

2133
01:28:15,131 --> 01:28:18,680
cheat you would attack you.
But when I was in Costa Rica,

2134
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,560
I had a monkey.
It was fucking crazy.

2135
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:26,770
Monkey jumped on my back.
It was like the monkey that they had in 

2136
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:26,890
the area.
Okay.

2137
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,060
And the compound where I was staying,
jumped on my back,

2138
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,570
hooked it's tail around my neck.
And so now it's hanging.

2139
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,070
It's inverted,
hanging upside down.

2140
01:28:34,071 --> 01:28:39,071
It went right in my pocket,
took my hotel keys and then went up the 

2141
01:28:39,071 --> 01:28:39,071
tree in like two seconds.

2142
01:28:39,071 --> 01:28:41,040
And I'm only standing there like,
did that just fucking happen?

2143
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:43,250
He's serious.
This is now sitting there.

2144
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,140
And I got some fucking,
I don't know,

2145
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:50,141
some sort of costa rican kiwi trying to 
get this fucking monkey come down.

2146
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:51,610
I forget it.
I remember I,

2147
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:56,770
I fucking,
my human brain out did is a monkey 

2148
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:59,801
brain.
And I got it back and I did a quick 

2149
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:02,700
switcheroo and I ran because it was on a
chain and I was able to just get away.

2150
01:29:02,701 --> 01:29:05,100
And the thing thing was so pissed that I
was running where to go.

2151
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,610
It just fucking screamed at me.
Pissed.

2152
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:08,540
I was mad,
man.

2153
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:09,060
I was like,
yeah,

2154
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:10,080
there you go.
You fucker.

2155
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:15,110
Well that's what happens in India.
They steal things from people and then 

2156
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:17,991
they want you to give them food back.
You give them food and they give you 

2157
01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:17,991
whatever,
you know,

2158
01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:17,991
whenever they took from you.

2159
01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:21,120
And then do they kill la?
Kill animals.

2160
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,320
Killed people.
Oh,

2161
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:25,260
they're in their house.
The mayor of one of the towns in India.

2162
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:28,380
He got killed by monkeys recently.
Like within the last couple of years.

2163
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:30,870
They fucking swarmed his ass.
Just jack them.

2164
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,390
What's the monkeYs with big,
puffy?

2165
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,550
It's like the pit on India.
The bumpy problems.

2166
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:40,220
Like the ones that have is it rang tang 
has the weird crazy things.

2167
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,120
Crazy.
How about baboons?

2168
01:29:42,121 --> 01:29:44,340
It was like a half a dog.
Half of a monkey.

2169
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,480
Yeah.
That's a weird animal.

2170
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,830
Baboons eat babies too,
man.

2171
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,870
So to chimps,
chimps eat babies.

2172
01:29:48,871 --> 01:29:53,871
If you,
if you leave babies around and chimps 

2173
01:29:53,871 --> 01:29:53,871
eat them,
eat them.

2174
01:29:53,871 --> 01:29:53,871
Yeah.
They're still not worse than bankers.

2175
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,780
Have you ever seen the video,
the chimp eating the monkey?

2176
01:29:58,670 --> 01:29:59,540
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2177
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,430
Then finally realizing that they do that
and they also,

2178
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:04,410
they sewed all talk shit after they do 
it,

2179
01:30:04,411 --> 01:30:05,960
they feel like stopped beating their 
chest.

2180
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,640
They're very already a ruthless 
motherfuckers.

2181
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:11,040
I thought for the longest time it was a 
rang of tang.

2182
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,310
Like the orange drink.
No,

2183
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:17,470
it's.
Well that's not really neanderthals 

2184
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,100
neanderthal,
you know,

2185
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,150
it's named after a part and part of 
France.

2186
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,070
That's where they found the first 
skeletons.

2187
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:26,070
did they been selling sand recently?
That people are.

2188
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:30,120
Most people or a good percentage of 
people have neanderthal genetics in them

2189
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,470
and that we,
uh,

2190
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:34,440
somehow or another absorb them.
I do look at my forehead.

2191
01:30:34,441 --> 01:30:36,330
I got to hook a frankenstein forehead.
Dude.

2192
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,790
My eyebrows like,
look at that.

2193
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:40,470
That ultimate doom.
I tell me I don't have the same brown.

2194
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:43,620
That's true.
Is that fucking thing is not that I want

2195
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:45,750
to show you my dentist.
My dentist is so freaky.

2196
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,450
I will drive you over to his office just
to say hi,

2197
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,190
just so you could see his head really is
fucking for his dentist,

2198
01:30:52,191 --> 01:30:53,050
man.
It's,

2199
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:56,160
it sticks out like this far,
like no bullshit.

2200
01:30:56,161 --> 01:31:01,161
It doesn't even look real.
It looks like he's wearing a chin up 

2201
01:31:01,161 --> 01:31:04,551
bar.
Like you put a clean on plate from star 

2202
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:07,851
wars.
The next generation will put it on his 

2203
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:07,851
head.
I mean,

2204
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:07,851
it really looks like that.
He's just got this,

2205
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:08,820
these deeps his eyes.
No bullshit or like that.

2206
01:31:08,821 --> 01:31:12,090
Deep into his head.
My dentist is kind of crazy.

2207
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:13,710
My dentist is like that.
What's that movie?

2208
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:15,750
Uh,
people under the stairs or whatever.

2209
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:20,751
Where danny,
what's I should say this in case my 

2210
01:31:20,751 --> 01:31:20,751
dentist is listening.
He's a great guy.

2211
01:31:20,751 --> 01:31:22,290
Look,
I'm not fucking perfect either.

2212
01:31:22,291 --> 01:31:27,291
I look like a champ.
I don't know what the best looking guy 

2213
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:29,901
in the world who liked.
Those guys are all depressed and he's a 

2214
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:29,901
very nice guy.
we already hung up.

2215
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:30,150
Very nice guy,
but he's got a big crazy for him.

2216
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:33,690
That's just a fact.
I didn't name any day.

2217
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:39,580
You know what's funny about that shit 
with that big forehead and went up that 

2218
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:39,780
affects that light that they have on 
their head.

2219
01:31:39,781 --> 01:31:42,420
If it's too far and it just shines on 
the back of your head.

2220
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:49,670
He's getting adjusted to far and he's 
got a pointed straight down.

2221
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:55,470
Some people even use that or am I 
thinking of minors?

2222
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:57,540
I think dennis probably use that shit 
to.

2223
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,920
And the digging deep in mouth.
It should,

2224
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:00,250
right?

2225
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,060
yeah,
that sounds oppressive.

2226
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:04,570
Rough job.
My dentist hypnotizes me.

2227
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,400
There's a part where they checked for 
cancer.

2228
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,650
I don't know if you're a dentist.
Do that where they go.

2229
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:13,860
Okay,
so this is where you're so and so gland 

2230
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,890
dentists.
Dentists stick his fingers in your 

2231
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:16,890
mouth.
No,

2232
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:19,270
no,
but then you wake up and you're like,

2233
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:20,980
what happened?
Did you ever see that guy?

2234
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:23,670
oh,
that would feel girls put them under and

2235
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,850
they busted him.
He,

2236
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,130
they busted us.
And what I loved about that guys,

2237
01:32:27,131 --> 01:32:31,390
you could tell he never got arrested for
anything in his life and he just,

2238
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:33,010
he just like,
he just,

2239
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,810
you saw it and his whole body,
he was just like,

2240
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,270
okay,
like the girl was under,

2241
01:32:36,271 --> 01:32:37,200
right?
And she,

2242
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:41,380
she kept waking up feeling like her bra 
wasn't right the way it should've been.

2243
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:46,650
So they basically get her to go in there
again to go under and they drilled in 

2244
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:47,110
from like the cvs next door or some 
shit.

2245
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,960
and they got this camera.
So he starts fucking second.

2246
01:32:49,961 --> 01:32:51,400
He starts being certainly seem.
You seem like,

2247
01:32:51,401 --> 01:32:51,960
yeah,
I'm going,

2248
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:53,590
I have a testing,
has all this type of shit.

2249
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:55,680
And then immediately all these swat guys
coming in,

2250
01:32:55,750 --> 01:33:00,750
it goes literally from that to.
And my life's over and he just fucking 

2251
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:04,381
shoulders slumped dragged out.
Can you imagine what happened to that 

2252
01:33:04,721 --> 01:33:09,721
guy in prison?
You're going in as a fucking sex 

2253
01:33:09,721 --> 01:33:11,140
offender.
Dentist who probably hasn't had a height

2254
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:13,810
since the third grade.
No gang affiliation.

2255
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,810
Who would have to join one who would 
take him?

2256
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:21,900
You gotta.
You gotta be somebody bits the first 

2257
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:21,900
night you got to stock some cock right 
away.

2258
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,800
You gotta put on a dress.
Whooo.

2259
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:26,920
You think of some guys in prison like,
what the fuck is gonna happen?

2260
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:31,921
Like bernie madoff.
What's what's going on with that guy in 

2261
01:33:31,921 --> 01:33:31,921
prison?

2262
01:33:31,921 --> 01:33:34,740
they must be beating the fuck on it on 
it's white collar that probably guys 

2263
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:34,840
guys will get.
Now he's probably holding courT.

2264
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:36,490
Is he in a white collar prison?
He said,

2265
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,890
absolutely.
he probably can get fresca spite.

2266
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:43,950
The fact that his felonies were so 
egregious that because they're not 

2267
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:49,020
violent,
they don't give a shit so and so and he 

2268
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:53,130
nonviolent offenses.
They put them with other nonviolent 

2269
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:53,130
people.
I don't know how it works,

2270
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:53,710
dude.
I just know if you're rich,

2271
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:56,950
you don't go to real jail.
But he actually fucked.

2272
01:33:57,190 --> 01:34:02,190
The problem was was not how much money 
he took was I think who we took it from 

2273
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:04,660
and they had as much influence if not 
more as he did.

2274
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:08,650
So he actually got life in prison.
That unusual.

2275
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:11,700
I just pulled that on my ass.
I have no idea what fucking.

2276
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:13,600
I think it's unusual that he got life in
prison.

2277
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,350
I mean,
what he did was fucking $50,

2278
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,260
million dollars.
That's,

2279
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:22,490
you got to put them In jail for life.
There's no way he's going to pay that 

2280
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:22,490
back.
I mean,

2281
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,170
what would be.
Did you see that thing in,

2282
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:24,970
in uh,
in rolling stone that this month,

2283
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,550
matt [inaudible] article that it was the
one about,

2284
01:34:27,551 --> 01:34:32,551
uh,
those kids that have the biggest 

2285
01:34:32,551 --> 01:34:34,600
internet cyberspace crime ever?
Yeah.

2286
01:34:34,601 --> 01:34:35,650
I haven't read that yet.
oh,

2287
01:34:35,651 --> 01:34:40,651
he got to read.
That shit will make you super paranoid 

2288
01:34:40,651 --> 01:34:41,350
about where you use your credit card.
These guys would sit outside the mall.

2289
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,820
This was,
this was their,

2290
01:34:42,821 --> 01:34:43,860
uh,
their,

2291
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:45,040
their,
their hacky way.

2292
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:50,041
They first did it would sit there in a 
car with like a fucking eight foot to 

2293
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:53,100
antenna and they somehow tap in to 
whatever that shit in the fucking air is

2294
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:58,490
that computer shit.
The satellite thing went back to that.

2295
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:03,730
And as you use the credit cards,
they somehow they would break into the 

2296
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:03,730
system or something.
I don't want to,

2297
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:05,660
I can't even explain it to fucking dumb,
but it's even,

2298
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:07,250
even for a guy like me,
it was fascinating.

2299
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:09,920
So there was some sort of a wireless 
transmission of your car,

2300
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,660
your credit card,

2301
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:12,360
you in there,
right?

2302
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:13,930
Buying a thermal.
okay.

2303
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:19,090
Alright.
And you swipe your card and as they're 

2304
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:22,561
putting it into the system or as you 
swipe it somehow that tapped into this 

2305
01:35:22,561 --> 01:35:24,010
shit through the fucking air.
It's literally like magic,

2306
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:29,250
like all those years of people pulling 
out rabbits out of hats and it was all 

2307
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:29,250
bullshit.
These guys,

2308
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:30,100
I don't know how the fuck they were 
doing it.

2309
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:31,780
So they would do that and then they were
like,

2310
01:35:31,781 --> 01:35:32,670
oh,
this is bullshit.

2311
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,120
It's too,
it's too risky.

2312
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:39,690
Um,
they somehow then they took it to the 

2313
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:41,710
next level and they got into the main 
database database.

2314
01:35:41,711 --> 01:35:42,760
Thank you.
I needed a word.

2315
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:47,910
I'll go with that.
The main database of all the macy's or 

2316
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:47,910
whatever,
and people's critical.

2317
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:48,770
yeah,
they,

2318
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,290
yeah.
They got like,

2319
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,100
like,
I don't know,

2320
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,090
I'm going to,
what number am I?

2321
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:53,710
Seven say 50 million credit cards.

2322
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:57,330
Banks are totally corrupt.
You think that the banks would hack into

2323
01:35:57,331 --> 01:36:02,331
people's shit on purpose,
like hired people to hack into people's 

2324
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:02,331
shit?

2325
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:02,331
Well,
this is what I think about.

2326
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:03,440
Don't.
I don't think I,

2327
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,340
I,
this is what I don't like is it's not my

2328
01:36:06,341 --> 01:36:11,341
money.
It's their money and they give it to me 

2329
01:36:11,341 --> 01:36:14,341
in my job is to get in debt with it and 
if I don't then they just fucking take 

2330
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:15,460
it for me.
That's basically what happens.

2331
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,810
Right?
But I mean the hackers,

2332
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:19,610
I mean tanked.
Do you think that,

2333
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:23,120
you know how like the cia's always been 
accused of selling drugs and the,

2334
01:36:23,121 --> 01:36:28,121
the,
the argument for it is the bad guys are 

2335
01:36:28,121 --> 01:36:28,121
going to sell drugs no matter what you 
do.

2336
01:36:28,121 --> 01:36:31,070
The cia takes that money and use it for 
covert operation to protect americans,

2337
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:31,310
blah,
blah,

2338
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:31,550
blah,
blah,

2339
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:36,551
blah.
The cia's always sold drugs and that's 

2340
01:36:36,551 --> 01:36:38,801
just the way it is.
Do you think that the bankers would get 

2341
01:36:38,801 --> 01:36:38,801
involved in hacker activity just because
they figured,

2342
01:36:38,801 --> 01:36:39,320
look,
someone's going to do this,

2343
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,340
we're going to do this

2344
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:42,160
at this point.
It might be in another.

2345
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:44,080
They just look at everything as revenue 
streams.

2346
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,940
Yeah,
I don't think that they look at shit,

2347
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:47,940
well not we worked because they will be 
self,

2348
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,750
they will be sabotaging themselves,
but I,

2349
01:36:50,751 --> 01:36:51,850
I,
this is my questions like,

2350
01:36:51,851 --> 01:36:53,020
um,
I'm always looking at these,

2351
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:58,050
but I don't think bank,
I really don't think bankers are above 

2352
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:58,050
stealing.
Now,

2353
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:58,050
of course

2354
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,120
these hacker situations and I go,
okay,

2355
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:03,310
you hear about this fucking russian 
teenager made $50,000,000

2356
01:37:03,311 --> 01:37:04,170
in a year,
you know,

2357
01:37:04,171 --> 01:37:06,600
in his basement and then he started an 
empire,

2358
01:37:06,601 --> 01:37:07,080
blah,
blah blah.

2359
01:37:07,081 --> 01:37:08,370
And he was just a hacker.
Well,

2360
01:37:08,371 --> 01:37:13,371
if I'm reading about this,
there's got to be some people that are 

2361
01:37:13,371 --> 01:37:15,711
rich and powerful and recognize that $50
million some real money and if this 

2362
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:17,550
goofball kid in his basement is making 
that kind of money,

2363
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,210
is there a way they can do that?
And what I mean,

2364
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:25,510
is there any of this shit they have to 
hack into their own system.

2365
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:27,080
I Think that they do it.
They,

2366
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:30,980
they steal from the uh,
um,

2367
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:33,140
the people who put money on us,
the customers,

2368
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:36,140
they still through like fees,
right?

2369
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,370
Well,
they definitely do that too.

2370
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,860
I didn't get the gun a risk what they 
have for doing hacker shit.

2371
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:41,360
You know what I mean?
like if this guy is super rich,

2372
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:42,700
he's not going to risk everything as

2373
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:44,550
America,
but I've been a button.

2374
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,210
Some other countries are pulling some 
shit off.

2375
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,120
There's something about that shit 
though,

2376
01:37:48,121 --> 01:37:53,121
where I find that that type of shit is 
so fascinating where you know,

2377
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:58,250
you learn how to pick a lock.
The bullshit that I'm doing is no big 

2378
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:58,250
deal,
but those guys who can actually,

2379
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,370
you know,
hack their way.

2380
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:04,820
I'll tell you what's even more 
interesting is that you'd be going to 

2381
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,341
youtube.
There's ways to show you how to get 

2382
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:09,711
those like things that you put on atm at
the gas pump and there's videos showing 

2383
01:38:09,711 --> 01:38:11,310
how to do it,
like how and where to buy them,

2384
01:38:11,311 --> 01:38:16,311
where it's like this thing that fits 
over the credit card slot at your gas 

2385
01:38:16,311 --> 01:38:17,220
pump and there's like a little camera 
that you tape into the corner.

2386
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:22,310
So wheN you're using outside right now,
that's why you never use your fucking 

2387
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,730
atm because that's your money.
They get their shit,

2388
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:28,731
they get your money,
they get to be a fucking credit card 

2389
01:38:28,731 --> 01:38:29,940
that's citibank's money,
so then they'll call you up and be like,

2390
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:34,950
you know,
did you buy a tank top and Kansas city 

2391
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:34,950
now?

2392
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:35,130
I did not ever get that.
You have to be on the road so much.

2393
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:40,150
I used to be on the road,
like they would constantly be shutting 

2394
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:40,800
my credit card off and not realizing 
that I was a comedian.

2395
01:38:40,801 --> 01:38:42,780
They'd be lIke,
did you get a lap dance and toronto?

2396
01:38:42,781 --> 01:38:46,860
Yes.
I did get chicken wings days later in st

2397
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:47,560
louis.
Yes.

2398
01:38:47,561 --> 01:38:48,780
I know.
They finally like,

2399
01:38:48,781 --> 01:38:50,580
what are you do?
I'm a comedian.

2400
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,170
I'm on a college tour.
yeah,

2401
01:38:52,171 --> 01:38:54,000
you should always usually never do debit
either.

2402
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:55,910
You should always do credit card.
You know where they are always trying to

2403
01:38:55,911 --> 01:38:57,180
triCk you into like,
that's what I'm saying.

2404
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,530
Put in your pin and you're like,
no,

2405
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:00,300
I'm not putting my pants on as a credit 
card.

2406
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:05,420
Don't ever do that.
Because then it also protects her ship 

2407
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:05,420
for 30 days to,
yeah,

2408
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:06,840
fuck that,
fuck all that.

2409
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:07,740
Do it.
And they're trying to make it.

2410
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:12,950
They're gonna make a cashless,
cashless the shit cash isn't going to go

2411
01:39:12,951 --> 01:39:13,390
Back to work.

2412
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,600
One piece of gold,
one donkey.

2413
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:19,410
That's what we got to go fight a piece 
of it off to get some potatoes.

2414
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:22,200
Something you got to get something for 
something.

2415
01:39:22,201 --> 01:39:27,201
Your money has to represent something.
The problem is our monday doesn't 

2416
01:39:27,201 --> 01:39:27,570
actually represent anything.
It's just an idea.

2417
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:32,780
It's just confidence.
We have confidence at $100 is worth 

2418
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:32,780
$100,
but it doesn't represent $100.

2419
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:35,190
Gold.
It's just keep that confidence.

2420
01:39:35,191 --> 01:39:35,880
I'm alright with it

2421
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:41,750
dude.
I like your hall of fame of fucking keys

2422
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:44,180
you have in there.
That's hilarious.

2423
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:46,280
I'm looking into joseph's walk in closet
right now.

2424
01:39:46,281 --> 01:39:49,880
Most people have like fucking jerseys 
from sports.

2425
01:39:49,881 --> 01:39:52,280
They never played.
That says dexter trophies.

2426
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:57,370
Yeah.
He still has like dried blood from some 

2427
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:59,591
kid.
He fucking hammer fisted back in is 

2428
01:39:59,591 --> 01:39:59,591
revered days.

2429
01:39:59,591 --> 01:40:01,540
My taekwondo middles on the door knob.
That's all shit from the eighties.

2430
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:04,930
So that was one of my favorite from my 
other life.

2431
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:10,540
Yeah,
that's one of my favorite fucking 

2432
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:10,540
responses.
I was.

2433
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:10,540
I was on his.

2434
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:14,180
Hey,
your website way back in the day and 

2435
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:14,180
some kid was given him shit,
so joe,

2436
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,580
you know,
just blast some whatever.

2437
01:40:15,581 --> 01:40:18,280
You're just a fucking loser.
And then he Writes,

2438
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:19,480
oh,
what do you mean I'm a fucking loser?

2439
01:40:19,481 --> 01:40:21,070
He goes,
I'm only 20 years old,

2440
01:40:21,071 --> 01:40:21,730
but blah,
blah blah.

2441
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:24,300
What were you doing at 20?
And shows like a,

2442
01:40:24,301 --> 01:40:29,301
I was a national champion taekwondo.
Fucking loser per like one of the few 

2443
01:40:30,401 --> 01:40:33,760
guys who was actually a success before 
they got into this shit.

2444
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:34,690
Well,
I was,

2445
01:40:34,691 --> 01:40:36,370
but I definitely wasn't a financial 
success.

2446
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:39,250
That's why you weren't doing a taekwondo
toi was teaching.

2447
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,310
I was teaching at boston university.
I was teaching at bu when I was 19.

2448
01:40:42,730 --> 01:40:44,740
I taught at boston university.
That's horrible.

2449
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:46,480
That's way bubble.
Most people.

2450
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:51,540
Well,
I was a bang and half the kids in your 

2451
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,360
class if I fucked a few of them.
Wonderful.

2452
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:54,090
She was so

2453
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,840
hot and uh,
she was just,

2454
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:58,500
I don't want to say her name,
but she was just really hot latina.

2455
01:40:58,501 --> 01:40:59,330
Check kelly.
Chris.

2456
01:40:59,331 --> 01:41:04,331
Then I saw her again like three years 
ago and she wasn't the type of girl to 

2457
01:41:04,331 --> 01:41:05,520
work out,
so it was just type of girl that,

2458
01:41:05,521 --> 01:41:06,540
you know,
when she was young,

2459
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:09,420
she was 19 when I was 19.
She just getting by on her looks,

2460
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:14,550
but now she's like 41 and she doesn't 
exercise and it was so sad.

2461
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:18,030
She's probably sad to see me too.
I was a fucking handsome looking fellow,

2462
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:22,540
but it's broken down man.
Joe coming in at 19 to teach the class.

2463
01:41:22,541 --> 01:41:24,460
He probably did that.
John claude van damme.

2464
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:27,860
Fucking split between two desks and that
was,

2465
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,500
that ran through the whole class from 
that year,

2466
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:33,600
from the,
from 15 till I was 21.

2467
01:41:33,601 --> 01:41:36,720
I was literally.
All I did was fight.

2468
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,330
All I did was train and fight.
That's all I did.

2469
01:41:39,331 --> 01:41:42,090
I didn't have any social life.
I had a girlfriend here and there.

2470
01:41:42,091 --> 01:41:44,610
They would always get sick of me and 
break up with me and whatever,

2471
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:47,880
but all I did was train and fight.
I didn't party.

2472
01:41:47,881 --> 01:41:52,881
I didn't drink.
Very rarely did I drink and I smoke pot 

2473
01:41:52,881 --> 01:41:54,600
twice from like 15 to 21.
That's all I did was fine.

2474
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:59,070
He was completely out of my head and I 
went from that to two from from going to

2475
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,870
talk window straight into going to 
comedy,

2476
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:06,560
kickboxing.
I had a few three kickboxing fights and 

2477
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:06,560
then I went right into comedy because I 
knew I was going nowhere.

2478
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:09,510
So there's no money in it.
What's your opening like standup?

2479
01:42:09,511 --> 01:42:10,910
Was it about.
No,

2480
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:11,630
no,
no.

2481
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:13,390
I never talked to that really intense.
Was like,

2482
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:14,930
hello,
this is my comedy.

2483
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,100
I tried to do it.
You got to talk about your life now.

2484
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:20,650
Never talked about that.
There's no,

2485
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:24,490
no one wants to take some fucking guys a
martial arts champion.

2486
01:42:24,491 --> 01:42:24,590
Right.

2487
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:29,650
That's the thing,
because he was actually good at it like 

2488
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:29,650
this,
that you've got to be,

2489
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:29,650
have like low self esteem.

2490
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,420
You could say,
you know,

2491
01:42:30,421 --> 01:42:31,410
if you can say,
ah,

2492
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:35,220
I find a taekwondo tournament once and I
fought on friday and when I finally woke

2493
01:42:35,221 --> 01:42:36,500
up on tuesday,
you know,

2494
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:37,500
after some.

2495
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,740
So not doing comedy.
I like,

2496
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:40,270
you can't

2497
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,200
say that.
Oh,

2498
01:42:41,201 --> 01:42:44,200
so I fucking kicked this dude in the 
head and knocked him into a coma.

2499
01:42:44,201 --> 01:42:44,890
That's not funny.

2500
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:46,000
No,
but when I,

2501
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,770
when I started out though,
there was like,

2502
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:48,790
you know,
because all those,

2503
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:51,610
all those headliners didn't leave.
We will like kind of fucked.

2504
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:56,611
He ended up headlining.
We were looking at the only guys who 

2505
01:42:56,611 --> 01:42:58,921
kind of busted through was you and 
Anthony Clark with the two guys at the 

2506
01:43:00,311 --> 01:43:04,690
time who would actually somehow gotten 
past the old boy network.

2507
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:06,240
Yeah.
Well they left,

2508
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:07,800
you know,
anthony was one of the uh,

2509
01:43:07,801 --> 01:43:09,900
nick depaulo left too.
They just left,

2510
01:43:09,901 --> 01:43:10,860
you know,
you had to leave.

2511
01:43:10,861 --> 01:43:15,861
You can't stay in boston.
It was so intoxicating because you can 

2512
01:43:15,861 --> 01:43:18,801
make a living.
You could be in boston in the unit if 

2513
01:43:18,801 --> 01:43:18,801
you were a nobody,
you know,

2514
01:43:18,801 --> 01:43:19,980
you're still,
you could grind out 500 bucks a week.

2515
01:43:19,981 --> 01:43:20,970
You know,
you do here.

2516
01:43:20,971 --> 01:43:25,971
Do here.
As long as you're willing to drive and 

2517
01:43:25,971 --> 01:43:25,971
travel.
If you had $500 cash a week,

2518
01:43:25,971 --> 01:43:25,980
you could pay for your bills.
You could eat.

2519
01:43:26,190 --> 01:43:27,720
But if you want to try to go on the 
road,

2520
01:43:27,721 --> 01:43:29,250
man,
good fucking luck.

2521
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:31,110
No tv credits.
No nothing.

2522
01:43:31,111 --> 01:43:33,180
Just some guy from boston.
How much are they going to pay you?

2523
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:38,390
But you're fucking gas.
Your air is going to eat up all your 

2524
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,390
profits.
It's fucking hard.

2525
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,710
What are you,
uh,

2526
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:41,020
what do you think now?
because I just went back to boston.

2527
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:42,300
Have you been back there lately?
Yeah.

2528
01:43:42,301 --> 01:43:42,530
Yeah?
Yeah.

2529
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,450
It's sad.
It's nothing going on there now.

2530
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,440
What is the fucking,
the comedy connection?

2531
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:47,710
A theater now,
you know,

2532
01:43:47,711 --> 01:43:52,711
it's that big.
Wilbur theater comedy can actually just 

2533
01:43:52,711 --> 01:43:54,080
be 150 seats that bad as little room.
And now it's,

2534
01:43:54,081 --> 01:43:54,300
you know.

2535
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:54,830
No.
But they,

2536
01:43:54,850 --> 01:43:58,520
they reopened that right up the street.
The old charles street playhouse.

2537
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,260
What's it now?
What's another comedy club called?

2538
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:06,290
I can't remember this one.
Small one in faneuil hall called 

2539
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:06,290
motley's.
I did that.

2540
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:07,950
That tim mackenzie's place.
I can't remember what I did.

2541
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,650
I ran through all of them.
There was 80,

2542
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,670
there was like eight.
And I was like an 85 seater.

2543
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:14,460
I did dick dority's comedy fault.
What I put together,

2544
01:44:14,461 --> 01:44:18,540
my basically polished up my first five 
minutes of material ever,

2545
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:20,680
so I always go down there.
The vault,

2546
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:26,600
dude,
I fucking love that place and this the 

2547
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,960
thing hasn't changed at all.
Like I remember when that place started.

2548
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:32,140
This I'll fucking old.
I am now and now it's just celebrated to

2549
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:34,290
mackenzie.
I'm sorry if he's listening to american.

2550
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:37,120
I think it started in [inaudible] 93.
Yeah,

2551
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,390
that was a.
Yeah,

2552
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,950
it was a year and a son.
No,

2553
01:44:40,951 --> 01:44:41,310
no,
no.

2554
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:42,620
The fault.
Tardies.

2555
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:43,830
Comedy vault.
So something.

2556
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:45,960
That shit was around in the eighties,
right?

2557
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:50,970
Because in 88 when I was around the deq 
dirty comedy vault was around victoria 

2558
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:51,370
is remington's?
Yeah.

2559
01:44:51,371 --> 01:44:53,140
That fucking bank.
It's like a bank.

2560
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:54,430
Wow.
It's a fault.

2561
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:59,510
I thought.
I thought spike tobin was the first guy 

2562
01:44:59,510 --> 01:44:59,510
who opened that shit up.
Might have reopened it.

2563
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:00,820
Might've reopened it.
Okay.

2564
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,520
So it might've went under and they 
brought it back.

2565
01:45:02,521 --> 01:45:05,670
But dick daugherty's comedy vault was a 
stapled back when I was living there and

2566
01:45:05,671 --> 01:45:07,570
I moved out of boston like 92.

2567
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:12,980
Yeah.
You were gone before I wrote when I 

2568
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:12,980
started.
You were already gone?

2569
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:13,950
Um,
yeah.

2570
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:16,470
Where the fuck was I working at?
I think I was.

2571
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:18,330
First time I saw I saw you with the cow 
loon.

2572
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:19,820
Oh,
that place.

2573
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:21,440
That was a good place.
Yeah.

2574
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:27,820
And comedy still chinese food and is a 
weird combination of exist in boston.

2575
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:33,041
Like the biggest,
the most famous historical comedy club 

2576
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:36,131
in boston was the ding ho,
so chinese restaurant that they had 

2577
01:45:36,131 --> 01:45:39,161
comedy out of and now the only place 
that exists that place had a rick 

2578
01:45:39,161 --> 01:45:39,650
jenkins runs.
He runs a place in cambridge.

2579
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:41,160
Yeah.
And that's the uh,

2580
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:42,510
that's another,

2581
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:47,750
the chinese restaurants restaurant.
His restaurant and upstate you comedy 

2582
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:47,750
labs and what they call it?
Yeah.

2583
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:48,120
Remember the,
uh,

2584
01:45:48,121 --> 01:45:49,190
the,
the cooler.

2585
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:49,980
Cool.
Cool.

2586
01:45:49,981 --> 01:45:51,720
Cool.
And then the other places might.

2587
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,950
Clark's plays giggles and saugus.
Yeah.

2588
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:59,010
You know,
but there's more work in boston or the 

2589
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:02,070
least.
There was like just little road gigs to 

2590
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,070
an hour drive here.
Our drive there.

2591
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:04,980
More of those in that area than anywhere
else in the country.

2592
01:46:04,981 --> 01:46:09,981
No.
When I would talk to guys from like 

2593
01:46:09,981 --> 01:46:09,981
other places and then I'm like,
where's your road gigs?

2594
01:46:09,981 --> 01:46:10,330
Or where do you go for road gigs?
Oh,

2595
01:46:10,331 --> 01:46:12,070
you know,
sometimes I do Ohio sometimes.

2596
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:12,870
Like what do you get?
No,

2597
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:17,900
don't you have gigs around here?
Like no one could make a living around 

2598
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:17,900
there.

2599
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:18,080
Yeah.
But there's no nobody,

2600
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:23,230
nobody would start like,
I don't know what it is that people 

2601
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:23,360
would just start running,
don't have bob marley out of Maine.

2602
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:28,720
He came down like a fully formed fucking
headline or just because he had like 25 

2603
01:46:28,791 --> 01:46:33,791
rooms going up in Maine.
Like he started basically it was like 

2604
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:33,791
mcdonald's.
You have,

2605
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:37,780
you started with like comedies,
isa telling me when he was living up 

2606
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:41,231
there and it was getting so big.
He actually ended up leaving because he 

2607
01:46:41,231 --> 01:46:45,370
almost became,
I think like a kind of almost like a 

2608
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:45,370
club owner at that point.
He could have done it.

2609
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:49,031
But um,
he basically started the comedy scene up

2610
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:51,510
there because before that all they had 
was like the connection.

2611
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:53,280
But like portland.
Yeah.

2612
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:58,340
Yeah.
And he started like he had at any given 

2613
01:46:58,340 --> 01:46:58,340
time,

2614
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:01,350
I used to do gigs in bangor and bob 
would do like guest bots and shit when 

2615
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:01,900
he Was first starting out.
Bobby,

2616
01:47:01,901 --> 01:47:03,750
I don't know if you know how famous he 
is in Maine,

2617
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:04,130
do you?
No,

2618
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:04,720
no,
no.

2619
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:05,140
I,
yeah,

2620
01:47:05,141 --> 01:47:07,120
he's like,
if you don't know who bob marley is.

2621
01:47:07,121 --> 01:47:08,530
Very funny guy,
very nice guy.

2622
01:47:08,531 --> 01:47:11,740
I've known Him for 20 plus years,
always been just a great guy.

2623
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:14,170
But when he first started out,
you know,

2624
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:19,200
there was like,
this is like probably he probably 

2625
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,961
started on 89 or 90.
There's no one known from being from 

2626
01:47:21,961 --> 01:47:25,081
Maine.
There's no like one main comic that 

2627
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:26,791
stands up.
But bob marley in anywhere else in the 

2628
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:26,791
country is like,
people might have heard of them.

2629
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:31,021
You might have heard them on xm radio,
you might have seen him on comedy 

2630
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:31,630
central or something in Maine.
That mother fucker is huge.

2631
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:33,970
Oh yeah.
There's probably no comparison.

2632
01:47:33,971 --> 01:47:38,971
It's like laziness or gabriel iglesias 
and in la is giant.

2633
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:41,800
Gabriel iglesias does shows in la.
Well,

2634
01:47:41,801 --> 01:47:44,170
he'll do like five shows on a monday 
night,

2635
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:49,200
like something fucking nutty and sell 
out everyone like days and days in 

2636
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:49,990
advance.
That's how he is.

2637
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:50,740
Nobody else was like.

2638
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:51,360
Yeah,
no.

2639
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:56,380
He used to go.
I remember he was telling me he would 

2640
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:58,181
basically be an la auditioning and then 
every year right as the holidays came 

2641
01:47:58,181 --> 01:48:02,711
around,
he would make like 10 times what I made 

2642
01:48:02,711 --> 01:48:02,950
on the road in that month.
Yeah.

2643
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,400
Just to,
should be talking about is money.

2644
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:06,500
But yeah,
he would just go up there and do parties

2645
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,580
and then he do the new year's thing and 
this one we be like,

2646
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:12,620
he would do like a,
like a $1,500,

2647
01:48:12,621 --> 01:48:15,350
2000 seater and to be doing like adding 
shows and

2648
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,710
yeah,
doing all this main material,

2649
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,000
you know,
so much main.

2650
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:24,030
Like I was listening to them on the 
radio the other day was on xm radio is 

2651
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:24,240
doing all these main jokes and it was 
doing them in Maine.

2652
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:25,390
They were going crazy.
They were

2653
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,910
no.
And the he also,

2654
01:48:26,911 --> 01:48:31,911
dude,
he has like a box set that so many 

2655
01:48:31,911 --> 01:48:33,720
albums this dude is put out.
He's put out like 16 albums,

2656
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:37,410
14 elvis fucking unbelievable.
Incredible.

2657
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:41,850
The amount hours,
14 hours of fucking material.

2658
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,300
Have you ever heard of anybody say done 
that?

2659
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:45,450
Have you ever heard of anybody else?

2660
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:48,360
You just nailed it in one area like 
that?

2661
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:49,490
No,
there's.

2662
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:52,110
There's a couple of Who's like that 
though?

2663
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:53,750
Not like that,
but it wasn't there a.

2664
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,640
They would always hear those guys when 
you be down south.

2665
01:48:56,670 --> 01:49:01,670
Killer bees.
Remember her killer bees guys and then 

2666
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:04,070
there was a.
There was one or two other guys who 

2667
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,610
south of the mason dixon line would 
just.

2668
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,910
Absolutely.
If you just put their name up,

2669
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:10,350
there was a few of those thousand 
tickets,

2670
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:15,470
a few of those guys,
but I don't think there's any one guy 

2671
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:16,830
that's got the state nailed like bob 
marley does and he created it.

2672
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:19,890
Yeah,
but it's a state that's proud to be that

2673
01:49:19,891 --> 01:49:21,810
state too.
That's a part of the whole key to it.

2674
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:25,960
He's actually from Maine and the people 
in Maine are proud to be from Maine.

2675
01:49:25,961 --> 01:49:26,040
Yeah.

2676
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:31,070
It's like somebody is getting an idea.
So there's a comedian right now in like 

2677
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:31,070
South Dakota trying to put it to.
You're like,

2678
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:32,330
dude,
I could run this fucking town,

2679
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,670
state,
whatever the hell I'm trying to say.

2680
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,340
Does anybody give a fuck about being 
from South Dakota though?

2681
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:42,390
THe thing about being right there,
that's who gave a fuck about being from 

2682
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:42,560
maIne.
A lot of main people.

2683
01:49:42,561 --> 01:49:45,470
You ever talk shit about me.
People in South Dakota,

2684
01:49:45,471 --> 01:49:47,860
they give a fuck about being there.
Not as much as Maine.

2685
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:52,290
I was in North Dakota and they will.
All right with fargo came.

2686
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:53,620
I was like,
we don't talk like that.

2687
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:55,210
That's fucking bullshit.
And whoa.

2688
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:56,110
It's like,
oh,

2689
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,780
you think we talked like cliff clavin on
cheers.

2690
01:49:58,781 --> 01:50:01,250
We don't.
A lot of us do kind of boston now.

2691
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,280
He fucked that accident.
He would go away.

2692
01:50:03,281 --> 01:50:05,170
Their ego a,
their nami.

2693
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,650
It's norm.
Yeah.

2694
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:09,700
Everything was packed.
The car.

2695
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:12,250
So they put an a.
All you do is take the r out and instead

2696
01:50:12,251 --> 01:50:14,290
of normally it wasn't a good boston 
accent,

2697
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,400
my really picking them apart.
Years after the door.

2698
01:50:18,401 --> 01:50:19,570
Norm.
Did you hear?

2699
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:24,430
He went on opie and anthony show and 
apparently they fucking kicked them off,

2700
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:29,431
like really?
She's got some beer book he's putting 

2701
01:50:29,431 --> 01:50:29,431
out now.
George went right,

2702
01:50:29,431 --> 01:50:29,780
right?
No,

2703
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:30,580
no,
no.

2704
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,660
The other.
George.

2705
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:34,870
Yeah.
George wendt was mailman and the mailman

2706
01:50:34,871 --> 01:50:37,730
was clearly above the beer guy out.
If someone's going to put out a book,

2707
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:39,160
it would have been normed.
It would have been.

2708
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:40,090
George went,
yeah.

2709
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:41,660
Well,
george wendt was on the opiod.

2710
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:42,910
Anthony show and I don't know what 
happened,

2711
01:50:42,911 --> 01:50:47,911
but just very unenthusiastic and they 
want to kicking them out because he was 

2712
01:50:47,911 --> 01:50:48,220
unenthusiastic.
Oh,

2713
01:50:48,221 --> 01:50:53,221
what happened?
I'm as informed as you are about the 

2714
01:50:53,221 --> 01:50:53,221
economy.

2715
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:57,070
Those fucking guys like that.
I always get excited.

2716
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,270
Oh,
they had so and so on.

2717
01:50:58,271 --> 01:50:59,510
How did it go on?
Rats.

2718
01:50:59,950 --> 01:51:02,590
Fucking jimmy went in the other room,
started prank calling them,

2719
01:51:02,591 --> 01:51:06,480
and I had a job with jesse ventura.
That's my faith.

2720
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:10,420
That's why he fucking destroyed them.
Each crushed them.

2721
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:13,900
Thank you for your service to our 
country and he was saluting them.

2722
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:19,280
Dude.
I thought for once I was actually going 

2723
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,731
to see jesse and a real fight for all 
those years of watching them take 

2724
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:21,580
flight.
I was in Vietnam.

2725
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:23,250
Where were you?
Yeah,

2726
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:29,040
it's got to be one of those weird 
fucking stupid bullying things with 

2727
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:32,490
norton.
Hates it when when someone tries to 

2728
01:51:32,490 --> 01:51:32,490
bully him,
you know,

2729
01:51:32,490 --> 01:51:33,290
when someone just demands respect 
without fucking proven your point.

2730
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,200
[inaudible] point and the.
It's crazy.

2731
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:37,390
Just chewed him up.
I thought it was awesome.

2732
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:38,350
Oh,
it was hilarious.

2733
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:39,270
It was.
It was.

2734
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:44,300
It was the combiNation of awesome.
And then also he was beating him so bad.

2735
01:51:44,771 --> 01:51:46,680
I felt bad for jessie.
I was like,

2736
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:47,650
jesse,
tap out.

2737
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:50,190
Well,
jesse's got the.

2738
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:50,860
Yeah,
he did.

2739
01:51:50,861 --> 01:51:52,030
He left.
It was so stupid.

2740
01:51:52,031 --> 01:51:54,660
He's got this weird.
Jimmy was going to see it.

2741
01:51:54,661 --> 01:51:57,220
See a fucking leave.
So you're going to fucking leave.

2742
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,650
And he's leaving.
God.

2743
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:03,140
Jesse looked ugly at the end.
The look.

2744
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:08,150
He was thinking about doing something 
like throwing something at them or 

2745
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:10,321
yelling at them or just so hoping that 
kenny was right there and I always 

2746
01:52:10,321 --> 01:52:10,321
wanted to see kenny and actually,
you know,

2747
01:52:10,321 --> 01:52:12,700
he would just go old school,
dirty cop probably.

2748
01:52:12,701 --> 01:52:13,120
Well,
you know,

2749
01:52:13,121 --> 01:52:14,880
jeSsie's got bad hips.
Jesse's,

2750
01:52:14,881 --> 01:52:19,881
uh,
another one of those wrestlers that had 

2751
01:52:19,881 --> 01:52:19,881
hip replacement surgery.
a lot of them have their hips replaced.

2752
01:52:19,881 --> 01:52:24,420
Do you know how [inaudible] like three 
inches shorter from all those years of 

2753
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:28,150
jumping up all operations?
Because when I saw him,

2754
01:52:28,151 --> 01:52:29,500
I was like,
this guy's not that tall,

2755
01:52:29,501 --> 01:52:31,840
but he's fucking arms.
Get down below his knees.

2756
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:34,600
I got like a fucking gorilla and then,
and then I've written,

2757
01:52:34,601 --> 01:52:35,210
this is,
well,

2758
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:40,590
I don't want to fuck.
I saw it said he used to be six foot 

2759
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:40,590
seven and now he's six foot four.

2760
01:52:40,770 --> 01:52:42,490
There's a huge difference.
Six floors,

2761
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:43,110
like,
you know,

2762
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:48,050
we used to play college ball.
Six seven is off of his spine.

2763
01:52:48,051 --> 01:52:51,110
I wonder how many he's got fused.
A lot of guys get their shit fused.

2764
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:52,970
Man,
that's a big thing in mma right now.

2765
01:52:52,971 --> 01:52:57,020
Tito ortiz just had his neck vertebrae 
fused and uh,

2766
01:52:57,021 --> 01:52:58,910
there's a bunch of guys who had their 
back fused,

2767
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:01,610
kenny kenny fight anymore after that.
I don't know.

2768
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:03,650
I mean,
it really depends on how he recovers,

2769
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:05,120
you know,
but it's some serious,

2770
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:06,290
serious shit.
You sure.

2771
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:08,930
It wasn't just hairspray and heels that,
you know,

2772
01:53:08,931 --> 01:53:13,931
or something like that with hall cogans 
serious back surgery more than one who's

2773
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:16,250
the guy that hangs out at the comedy 
store all the time.

2774
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:19,190
Or he was for awhile that roddy roddy,
piper piper.

2775
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:24,720
He's doing standup.
It's so weird if someones going on the 

2776
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:24,720
road with them.

2777
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,040
Yeah.
You know,

2778
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:25,670
steve,
someones,

2779
01:53:25,671 --> 01:53:25,970
uh,
you know,

2780
01:53:25,971 --> 01:53:30,971
steve mom,
see if someone's a comic out of the 

2781
01:53:30,971 --> 01:53:31,760
comedy store has a huge fucking 
wrestling fans.

2782
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:34,640
Really good guy.
Really good guy.

2783
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:38,860
And he goes on the road with a rowdy 
roddy piper and it does a little standup

2784
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:41,270
and rowdy roddy tells the stories.
Apparently it's a hit.

2785
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:42,640
Oh yeah,
dude,

2786
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:43,140
I,
this,

2787
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:43,570
this,
this,

2788
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:44,870
this,
this will really let you listen.

2789
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:46,520
There's no way.
I don't know shit about banking.

2790
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:51,550
I actually ordered it on amazon.
The hard copy version of a ric flair is 

2791
01:53:52,051 --> 01:53:57,051
autobiography to beat the man.
You got to be the man to be the man.

2792
01:53:57,141 --> 01:53:58,490
You got to beat the man.
Dude.

2793
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:03,520
It's one of those.
It's Just a fucking awesome book to ric 

2794
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:03,840
flair.
Have you ever watched his Clips?

2795
01:54:03,841 --> 01:54:04,180
Yeah.
Yeah,

2796
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:06,200
I've seen one of the funniest fucking 
dude.

2797
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:09,110
He's just like a comedian where they 
say,

2798
01:54:09,111 --> 01:54:10,190
do you have writers?

2799
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,430
You know,
people write this and he goes to writer.

2800
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:14,090
So he gets to do what I used to come up 
with hat.

2801
01:54:14,091 --> 01:54:16,230
That shit on the cab ride over from the 
air force.

2802
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:18,650
Like a comedian.
He's just sitting there.

2803
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:20,840
Exactly.
It just gets luby's something.

2804
01:54:20,841 --> 01:54:22,490
He just says,
fuck this dude.

2805
01:54:22,491 --> 01:54:27,491
He's got a couple of way.
He's so into it like you think he's 

2806
01:54:27,491 --> 01:54:28,040
going to pass out and he's,
when he's yelling at people in the veins

2807
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:29,450
of the way,
his eyes bulge out.

2808
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:30,620
he's got one week.
Keeps going.

2809
01:54:30,621 --> 01:54:32,930
I inherited his voice,
keeps cracking.

2810
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:36,800
He's screaming.
So I hadn't heard it about that,

2811
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:39,530
that uh,
born with a golden spoon in his mouth.

2812
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:42,350
Do it.
I'll be on the road depressed like,

2813
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:43,970
oh my god,
I hate this and I'll just start watching

2814
01:54:43,971 --> 01:54:46,460
rick flair videos.
I just start laughing my fucking ass off

2815
01:54:46,461 --> 01:54:46,750
on that.

2816
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,460
This is what it's about.
This is why you do it.

2817
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,080
That guy is.
He's the shit.

2818
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:56,280
Ric flair is fucking awesome.
My favorite wrestling videos that john 

2819
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:57,430
stossel video with john stossel is 
talking to.

2820
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:59,600
I don't remember what the wrestler was 
telling them about.

2821
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:04,601
You know that what you do is fake and a 
fucking slaps him in the head like full 

2822
01:55:04,601 --> 01:55:08,681
blast.
Slaps him in his ear and drop some of 

2823
01:55:08,681 --> 01:55:08,681
those because that fake because I feel 
fake.

2824
01:55:08,681 --> 01:55:09,920
You're telling me what's fake and it 
gets up.

2825
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:11,690
Bam.
He slaps him in the other year and drops

2826
01:55:11,691 --> 01:55:13,670
them again.
Then it gets up and runs out of there.

2827
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:17,240
What was the one that was like?
Was it mr t or something like that where

2828
01:55:17,241 --> 01:55:22,241
he goes crazy.
It was like a live show and he starts 

2829
01:55:22,241 --> 01:55:23,180
smacking or getting angry and I'm 
freaking out.

2830
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:24,950
Wrestler was that.
It was think mr.

2831
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:28,700
T was on talking about hulk hogan 
hawkish and belzer.

2832
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:30,950
Richard belzer asleep.
Yeah,

2833
01:55:30,951 --> 01:55:32,930
that's what rIchard belzer fell and 
bumped his head.

2834
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:35,970
I got to see that video.
Oh,

2835
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I'm sure.
I'm sure it's online in this day and 

2836
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:41,780
age.
It would be convenient.

2837
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:44,010
What you'd do is,
yeah,

2838
01:55:44,011 --> 01:55:45,360
you gotta be nice.
Those guys,

2839
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:49,020
you can't disrespect them.
Plus they're on gallons of juice,

2840
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:49,920
you know?
Oh,

2841
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,890
they get the sicknesses.
They get that big.

2842
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:57,920
You know that crispin wog on that one of
killing his whole family juice to the 

2843
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:58,370
gills.
Yeah.

2844
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:00,120
But that's also another thing too,
is me,

2845
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:03,070
unlike pain meds,
because those guys did like doesn't work

2846
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,660
in like seven nights a fucking week.
It's the thing about a bass who fight in

2847
01:56:06,661 --> 01:56:11,661
the ufc.
Like brock says that pro wrestling is 

2848
01:56:11,661 --> 01:56:12,210
way harder than being the ufc 
heavyweight champion.

2849
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,910
How about that?
Is that the video?

2850
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:16,800
I'm sorry,
I'm going to watch a young.

2851
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:21,180
Back in the day,
they just google it.

2852
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:23,130
You could fit in.
Work this out.

2853
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:28,150
Did they know this isn't like a bit.
I don't think so.

2854
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:29,620
Oh yeah,

2855
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,980
and hulk hogan.
Oh,

2856
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,590
you got them in a keith,
you put them asleep.

2857
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:44,360
Oh,
you went out looking at it

2858
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:52,050
right?

2859
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:54,760
That's pretty fucked up.
I mean,

2860
01:56:54,761 --> 01:56:56,410
he really was out.

2861
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:00,290
That's no bullshit.
He just let them fall to the ground.

2862
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:06,050
I put a to sleep on a radio show once.
No,

2863
01:57:06,051 --> 01:57:06,430
no,
no.

2864
01:57:06,431 --> 01:57:07,940
He was just fucking around with.
No,

2865
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:08,840
no,
no,

2866
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:11,350
he wasn't.
You see the way fell,

2867
01:57:11,351 --> 01:57:16,351
dude.
He fell in and slammed his head off the 

2868
01:57:16,351 --> 01:57:16,351
ground.
He was trying to.

2869
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:18,190
Yeah,
he's trying to cover for it.

2870
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:20,320
Anyway,
that's a,

2871
01:57:20,321 --> 01:57:21,160
that's a famous one

2872
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:23,380
in the,
in the lead up to that.

2873
01:57:23,381 --> 01:57:28,381
It was like a hulk.
Hogan was getting really pissed off at 

2874
01:57:28,381 --> 01:57:28,381
him.
Like,

2875
01:57:28,381 --> 01:57:31,520
like the whole time,
like there was like seven minutes up to 

2876
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:35,521
that or six minutes up to he being a 
smart ass and just pissing the hulk off 

2877
01:57:35,521 --> 01:57:36,820
like in for real.
why would you do that?

2878
01:57:36,821 --> 01:57:39,300
Even if even if what they did was really
fake,

2879
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:44,930
you know?
I mean obviously you know that 

2880
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:46,370
predetermined the victor of stuff and 
when somebody fucking slams you down to 

2881
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:46,370
back,
it hurts.

2882
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:50,570
YeaH.
You gotta be conscious of who you're 

2883
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:50,570
talking to.
Those guys are savages.

2884
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:51,900
You know,
even though even though they're not,

2885
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:54,480
they might not be actually fighting for 
a living.

2886
01:57:54,481 --> 01:57:59,481
They will fuck you.
They beat the shit out of you if they 

2887
01:57:59,481 --> 01:57:59,481
want to like,
you better be nice.

2888
01:57:59,481 --> 01:58:03,290
They live in a wild world to a lot wild 
world of sweaty men that you hoist 

2889
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:04,080
through the air and slammed on their 
back.

2890
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:09,240
You know,
their idea of like what's acceptable 

2891
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,440
danger and punishment that you take with
your body is not what most people's is.

2892
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,580
You know,
for them it's like,

2893
01:58:11,581 --> 01:58:12,440
oh,
he just fell asleep.

2894
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:14,190
Belzer was covering.
That was pretty good.

2895
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:15,240
No,
he wasn't covering.

2896
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:16,710
He went,
going to say he was a.

2897
01:58:17,210 --> 01:58:20,970
I think he was the lead up was trust me.
The guy went out.

2898
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,980
That's 100 percent unconscious.
That's what we're saying.

2899
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,410
We're saying it was covering up that.
oh yeah,

2900
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:25,770
yeah,
yeah.

2901
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:27,600
Belzer was covering as a pro at the end.
Yeah.

2902
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:28,590
Yeah,
definitely.

2903
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:29,850
Yeah.
Well he went to sleep,

2904
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:35,030
no doubt about it.
The way guy that guy squeezed is 100 

2905
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:35,670
percent the way his arms go limp.
How long does it take?

2906
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,940
Two seconds.
When a guy puts a gun to choke,

2907
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,980
there was a guy I choked out on a radio 
show.

2908
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,070
There was this radio show,

2909
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:42,620
uh,
uh,

2910
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:43,870
he was like a,
um,

2911
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:49,440
you know,
a pa and they had them do little stunts 

2912
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:49,440
and stuff and if he couldn't do it then 
they would punish them.

2913
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:50,580
You know,
There's like this gag.

2914
01:58:50,581 --> 01:58:51,970
They used to do it.
It was in boston.

2915
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:57,270
So they had this dude dress up as a cow 
and he had a fucking try to jump over a 

2916
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:59,170
chair on rollerblades and he couldn't 
make it over.

2917
01:58:59,171 --> 01:59:02,740
The cherrY falls and crashes and they 
get them upstairs and I go,

2918
01:59:02,741 --> 01:59:04,090
okay,
now now you know,

2919
01:59:04,091 --> 01:59:06,820
your punishment is going to be joe rogan
has to choke me unconscious.

2920
01:59:06,821 --> 01:59:07,630
I go,
wHat?

2921
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:08,710
And he goes,
okay,

2922
01:59:08,711 --> 01:59:09,990
I'll do it.
I'll go to you,

2923
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:10,980
really,
you sure about this?

2924
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:11,410
and he goes,
yeah,

2925
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:12,460
I go,
you sure?

2926
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:13,270
And he goes,
yeah.

2927
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:13,990
I go,
all right.

2928
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:15,790
So I go,
if you just,

2929
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,800
when you can't take it,
just tap out.

2930
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:19,810
And I locked the choke on them,
squeeze on,

2931
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:24,840
and he goes to tap and he's already 
unconscious and I let them go thinking 

2932
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:27,430
that he tapped and he falls and fucking 
face plants on the carpet boxes.

2933
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:28,590
Head of the carpet.
It was only,

2934
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:32,110
he only fell a couple of inches,
but he was unconscious immediately.

2935
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:33,700
If you just let someone squeeze your 
neck,

2936
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,020
he'd go out pretty quick.

2937
01:59:35,090 --> 01:59:37,890
Do you know that became the thing to do 
for like,

2938
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:40,760
like maybe like a week and a half.
When I was in seventh grade,

2939
01:59:40,850 --> 01:59:45,850
we didn't understand what we were doing 
with somebody came up with it choking 

2940
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:48,960
now we you do is you would just 
basically grabbed two handfuls of 

2941
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,990
somebody's neck on each side grabbing 
that juggler.

2942
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:53,230
But the thIng about it was,
was like this.

2943
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,010
Yeah.
We Didn't know what we were doing.

2944
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:57,890
We didn't know what we're doing.
So some people were just grabbing like,

2945
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:59,990
you know what,
neck muscle they will,

2946
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:03,350
they will back here.
But occasionally people would grab them.

2947
02:00:03,351 --> 02:00:06,670
Right.
False shit.

2948
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:07,690
Yeah.
The file.

2949
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:12,710
What happened with someone did it 
correctly and the dude did the same 

2950
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:13,970
thing.
He fell straight forward and uh,

2951
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:19,030
and then there was announcements,
announcements at the end of the day and 

2952
02:00:19,030 --> 02:00:22,480
there's been a fad around the school to 
be grabbing your classmates next.

2953
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:26,060
His whole fucking thing.
It's very dangerous.

2954
02:00:26,061 --> 02:00:29,420
You're depriving oxygen to the temporal 
lobe and all this fucking bullshit.

2955
02:00:29,421 --> 02:00:31,600
And it just basically.
Could you please stop choking?

2956
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:35,090
I wonder how many kids today approximate
mma moves on their friends at school?

2957
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:40,270
You know,
you watch the ultimate fighter or 

2958
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:40,270
something like that.
She wouldn't get him.

2959
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:40,270
He gotta make memorial let me show you.

2960
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:42,620
Yeah.
The first time I ever thrown my back was

2961
02:00:42,621 --> 02:00:45,020
in fourth grade.
I let this kid put me in the figure four

2962
02:00:45,021 --> 02:00:50,021
leg lock.
I swear to god because that was because 

2963
02:00:50,021 --> 02:00:50,021
I was also an unbelievable.
It's not real.

2964
02:00:50,021 --> 02:00:51,920
It doesn't hurt.
And it was killing me.

2965
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:53,080
So I was,
I was,

2966
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,880
I was leaning up to try to take his leg 
off.

2967
02:00:55,881 --> 02:00:57,680
It's the first time I felt lower back 
pain.

2968
02:00:57,710 --> 02:00:59,600
Fourth grade,
you're jacked.

2969
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:01,910
You're back in the fourth grade.
It's fucking with you ever since.

2970
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:03,410
Figure four leg lock.
Well,

2971
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:08,440
uh,
it didn't fuck with me until football a 

2972
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:08,440
few years later,
unorganized,

2973
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:08,440
of course,
because I never had the grades.

2974
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,260
But uh,
that's,

2975
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:13,520
that's when it really got bad.
But the first first back pain ever had.

2976
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:19,970
What do you thinking about those people 
that say that back pain is all 

2977
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:19,970
psychological?

2978
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:19,970
No,
that's bull shit.

2979
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:20,810
Are you serious?
There's people that actually say that

2980
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:23,960
john sarno guy on it.
There's fucking,

2981
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:26,690
there are a lot of people that have 
psychological back pain.

2982
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:31,970
Absolutely.
The injuries it exists but doesn't mean 

2983
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:32,470
it.
It's all this

2984
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:33,460
guy like he,
he,

2985
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:36,370
I don't know if he says all of them,
but I think he attributes a lot of them.

2986
02:01:36,371 --> 02:01:38,260
He's talking about people,
even if they have injuries,

2987
02:01:38,261 --> 02:01:40,070
the injuries don't really hurt nearly as
much as I think they

2988
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:41,510
do.
It's all psychosomatic.

2989
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:44,570
I agree that he's basically saying we're
a bunch of pussies pussies.

2990
02:01:44,571 --> 02:01:45,590
Yeah.
Bunch of pussies.

2991
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:49,460
And the idea is that the injuries a 
distract you from other stress,

2992
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:50,460
you know,
and take it.

2993
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:55,740
Well,
I'm a firm believer of just stretching 

2994
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:56,030
yoga and that type of shit because,
uh,

2995
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:57,790
I don't know what happens when you get 
older,

2996
02:01:57,791 --> 02:02:00,810
but even just sleeping the amount more 
that your,

2997
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,250
your attendance or whatever shrivel up 
like that.

2998
02:02:03,251 --> 02:02:06,100
If you have a sodomy hobbled to the 
bathroom in the morning,

2999
02:02:06,101 --> 02:02:11,101
you would think that I played like five 
years of professional ball or I don't 

3000
02:02:11,101 --> 02:02:14,191
know what's going on with me.
So I put if I stretched before I go to 

3001
02:02:14,191 --> 02:02:16,120
bed or something like that,
I'm way better really.

3002
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:19,150
My forte,
my foot is fucking jacked.

3003
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:22,960
It's an old injury I had from playing 
drums and uh,

3004
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:25,770
it's a real hard to drum injury.
Yeah,

3005
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:27,230
you'd be surprised.

3006
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:29,500
Some other drummers went up,
planters,

3007
02:02:29,501 --> 02:02:31,030
fish a lot on what the fuck they call 
it,

3008
02:02:31,031 --> 02:02:34,870
but it was from I was,
I had poor technique and I was trying to

3009
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:39,930
do this bass drum lick a,
this thing that john bonham did and the 

3010
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:39,930
song good times,
bad times.

3011
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,190
These really quick,
a 16th note,

3012
02:02:42,191 --> 02:02:43,180
triplets,
triplets.

3013
02:02:43,181 --> 02:02:44,290
I'm sure you heard that.
The fight game.

3014
02:02:44,650 --> 02:02:45,730
And uh,
I was trying,

3015
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:47,710
I had bad technique.
What I was doing and I,

3016
02:02:47,711 --> 02:02:52,711
I fucked up the arch of it and it 
literally felt like as I was walking 

3017
02:02:52,711 --> 02:02:52,711
down the street,
someone was like,

3018
02:02:52,711 --> 02:02:54,730
I was stepping on nails and I didn't 
know what to do.

3019
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:56,710
Typical irish guy,
I just thought,

3020
02:02:56,711 --> 02:02:59,500
well just fucking stick it in the air 
for a minute and it'll be fine.

3021
02:02:59,501 --> 02:03:01,850
And I tuft and I finally had to go.
This is literally,

3022
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:06,190
you got to like take a bottled water,
freeze it in the fridge,

3023
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:11,230
right and step on it.
And then just sit there rolling on the 

3024
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:11,230
bottom.
You foot antiinflammatories.

3025
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:11,860
Then you've gotta.
Then you got arrested up.

3026
02:03:12,130 --> 02:03:14,370
So what is the actual injuries 
attendant?

3027
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:17,510
I don't fucking know.
Carpal tunnel for drummers.

3028
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:22,250
I always stop and tHink about if I lived
like just 100 years ago or even less,

3029
02:03:22,251 --> 02:03:27,251
I would be useless.
My body's been screwed back together so 

3030
02:03:27,251 --> 02:03:27,251
many different times.
Somebody different things.

3031
02:03:27,251 --> 02:03:31,841
I've had three pretty significant knee 
surgeries to reconstructions both knees 

3032
02:03:31,841 --> 02:03:33,350
over the acl.
Replaced this one.

3033
02:03:33,351 --> 02:03:35,870
I had my meniscus done,
I had my nose fixed,

3034
02:03:35,871 --> 02:03:38,930
my nose was broken.
Who knows how many fucking times.

3035
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:42,890
So they had a scoop out all the shit out
of my nose and a deviated septum repair.

3036
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:48,370
I stop and think about it like if,
if modern science wasn't around modern 

3037
02:03:48,370 --> 02:03:48,410
medicine,
I'd be fuck you be an ogre.

3038
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:51,230
I'll be living under a bridge a bit 
crippled.

3039
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:56,260
I wouldn't be able to do anything for 
without fear of my legs given out and 

3040
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:56,660
popping out and fall onto the ground and
in agony.

3041
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:58,920
That's just what people did back then.

3042
02:03:59,010 --> 02:03:59,820
Well,
I would've been dead.

3043
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:02,430
My appendix ruptured in the sixth grade.
That would've been.

3044
02:04:02,431 --> 02:04:03,840
It would've been a wrap.
Wow.

3045
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:06,930
One of those cakes ruptures.
What happens?

3046
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:10,920
Your parents tell you to go take a nap 
and they don't believe it.

3047
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:15,570
And then finally they'd take it down 
there and you,

3048
02:04:15,571 --> 02:04:16,620
uh,
you almost die.

3049
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:22,530
Wow.
I always present yourselves for that 

3050
02:04:22,530 --> 02:04:22,530
one.
They just didn't believe,

3051
02:04:22,530 --> 02:04:23,010
you know,
I don't know.

3052
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,680
My brothers convinced I was playing 
baseball and that's what happened.

3053
02:04:25,681 --> 02:04:30,681
I don't even remember.
I just kept having like side pain and 

3054
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:31,470
then then the next day I would feel 
fine.

3055
02:04:31,471 --> 02:04:33,390
Then I have a fever and then I would 
feel fine.

3056
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:36,300
And then one day,
I guess it just burst.

3057
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:37,980
Isn't it crazy that what

3058
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,370
your appendix is an organ that you don't
use anymore because it's used to meet.

3059
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:45,690
Yeah.
So evolve past bone,

3060
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:49,080
breaking doWn bone is your is your urine
or in Oregon?

3061
02:04:49,081 --> 02:04:51,270
I thought your organs like the liver,
pancreas,

3062
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:52,440
google,
intestines.

3063
02:04:52,441 --> 02:04:57,441
Find out what the fuck it is.
I'm pretty sure that would intestine is 

3064
02:04:57,441 --> 02:05:01,040
not a test in the appendix rather would 
appendix is is an organ that we used to 

3065
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:04,380
use when we processed meat,
we processed much more raw meat.

3066
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:07,170
You know,
I thought it was when we ate leaves,

3067
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,900
that was bone phrase.
Jesus,

3068
02:05:09,901 --> 02:05:14,901
look at it between the three of us,
we don't have a fucking clue if it's 

3069
02:05:14,901 --> 02:05:19,671
something that we're evolving.
We're evolving so we don't use it 

3070
02:05:19,671 --> 02:05:24,381
anymore.
WHich is pretty fascinating when you 

3071
02:05:24,381 --> 02:05:24,381
think about it.
It's actually mean.

3072
02:05:24,381 --> 02:05:28,460
It couldn't have been that long ago.
It's like clear evidence that the human 

3073
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:30,780
body is adapting to its environment and 
then we literally don't use this fucking

3074
02:05:30,781 --> 02:05:33,000
Oregon anymore.
And sometimes it blows up in your body,

3075
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,940
you know?
I mean that's what it does right?

3076
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:39,200
It just fucking suicide bombs.

3077
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,480
I would've been,
I would've died too,

3078
02:05:40,481 --> 02:05:45,481
that there's a couple of things I would 
have died if I broke my arm when I was 

3079
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:45,481
six.
I got hit by a car.

3080
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:47,460
If I,
if it was the 18 hundreds,

3081
02:05:47,461 --> 02:05:48,700
I would have died,
but I get hit by it,

3082
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:52,170
like getting hit by that car.
18 hundreds was hit by a car.

3083
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:57,260
I didn't look.
I was racing my brother home and he had 

3084
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:57,260
stronger legs than I did.
So,

3085
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:58,140
uh,
I figured if I cross,

3086
02:05:58,141 --> 02:06:02,190
I was sure I looked and I just do right 
out in front of a jeep.

3087
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,920
I wish I had video because I stIll don't
know how I didn't get run over.

3088
02:06:04,921 --> 02:06:09,921
All I remember was being upside down and
feeling the heat of the engine and 

3089
02:06:09,921 --> 02:06:11,160
seeing the bumper.
Oh my.

3090
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:15,770
And then the next thing I remember,
I was lying perpendicular to the,

3091
02:06:15,771 --> 02:06:17,100
uh,
the double lines.

3092
02:06:17,850 --> 02:06:20,670
I was only out for a second,
just like belzer when he got choked out.

3093
02:06:20,671 --> 02:06:23,670
it was only off for a second because 
when I came to,

3094
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,900
uh,
the biggest dude,

3095
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:31,140
sonia life gets out of this jeep,
he probably had nightmares because of 

3096
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:34,700
the way I just wrote out in front of me 
already crying.

3097
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:36,680
Oh.

3098
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:40,490
and I all I could think was my dad's 
going to fucking kill me.

3099
02:06:40,491 --> 02:06:43,700
and I got up and I ran a only thing that
fucking happened.

3100
02:06:43,701 --> 02:06:48,701
Well,
anything that other than I got knocked 

3101
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:48,701
out was,
uh,

3102
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:49,630
you know,
that thing here,

3103
02:06:49,631 --> 02:06:54,631
if you bite down on your back teeth,
that thing that goes in and out on the 

3104
02:06:54,631 --> 02:06:54,631
side of your head.
THat's right where I got hurt.

3105
02:06:54,631 --> 02:06:57,470
So I had to eat with a little spoon for 
a couple of days.

3106
02:06:57,471 --> 02:07:02,471
I remember it happened on a wednesday 
because the doctor says you don't have 

3107
02:07:02,471 --> 02:07:02,471
to go to school for the rest of the 
week.

3108
02:07:02,471 --> 02:07:03,710
And I was psyched.
I finally didn't have to fake school and

3109
02:07:03,711 --> 02:07:05,510
I had fucking thursday,
friday,

3110
02:07:05,511 --> 02:07:06,710
saturday,
and sunday off.

3111
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:07,750
It was totally worth it.
I think

3112
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:12,940
it was one of the reasons why I stopped 
fighting is because when I was 

3113
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:12,940
kickboxing,
oh,

3114
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:13,130
there was many nights where couldn't 
chew my food.

3115
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:18,790
I'd come home and I literally couldn't 
chew all because too much side of the 

3116
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:22,301
head and I would get headaches.
I'd lay in bed at night and get fUcking 

3117
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:22,301
viciouS headaches.
That was not fun.

3118
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:25,400
Scary shit.
Food opportune food gunner,

3119
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:29,810
you know,
you get kicked in the fucking jaw.

3120
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:31,430
That's not fun.
You know,

3121
02:07:31,431 --> 02:07:36,431
he kicked or punched in the head,
like really blasted your jaw just gets 

3122
02:07:36,431 --> 02:07:36,431
funded.
I fought

3123
02:07:36,431 --> 02:07:38,840
right up right up until fifth grade and 
then all the.

3124
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:42,310
I went from being one of the bigger kids
to one of the smaller kids and then also

3125
02:07:42,311 --> 02:07:47,311
kids started getting to be like a buck 
20 and kind of knowing how to throw a 

3126
02:07:47,311 --> 02:07:50,230
punch and it like I saw,
I saw scary dude.

3127
02:07:50,231 --> 02:07:52,790
I totally became a coward.
I became funny all of a sudden,

3128
02:07:52,950 --> 02:07:56,580
bunch of dudes who had brain damage.
I knew a bunch of dudes from boxing gyms

3129
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:59,250
that had brain damage wasn't too 
significant,

3130
02:07:59,251 --> 02:08:02,330
but it was enough that you could see it.
And I had seen guys from uh,

3131
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:07,340
you know,
when I started when I was 15 and I'd 

3132
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:07,830
seen how he evolved into how they 
develop brain damage up until,

3133
02:08:07,831 --> 02:08:08,910
you know,
when I was 21,

3134
02:08:08,911 --> 02:08:12,480
when I stopped finding 21 or 22,
I got to see the deterioration.

3135
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:13,740
That's some scary shit.

3136
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:14,960
What's his face?
He knows,

3137
02:08:14,961 --> 02:08:16,140
saved me.
I went,

3138
02:08:16,141 --> 02:08:21,141
I went to go get,
I wanted to get in shape when I was 

3139
02:08:21,141 --> 02:08:21,141
living in New York.
So our started going to gleason's gym,

3140
02:08:21,141 --> 02:08:22,630
but I just did it like total,
like actor.

3141
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:25,610
I just want to get shredded.
They will call me like billary swank and

3142
02:08:25,611 --> 02:08:27,770
shit.
I say about this yet given me shit.

3143
02:08:27,771 --> 02:08:32,390
So charlie murphy fucking gave me great 
advice because I told him I was starting

3144
02:08:32,391 --> 02:08:35,350
to go over there because he's only good 
at martial arts shit.

3145
02:08:35,351 --> 02:08:36,530
And he goes and he just called me and 
said,

3146
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:37,280
hey,
your bill,

3147
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:39,890
let me tell you something.
And he totally fucking broke it down.

3148
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:45,160
He's like,
you're going to be over there for like 

3149
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:47,320
eat literally broke that because you're 
going to be over there for like fucking 

3150
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:47,540
maybe a month,
month and a half,

3151
02:08:47,541 --> 02:08:52,541
and somebody's gonna come up to you and 
tell you that you look like you're 

3152
02:08:52,701 --> 02:08:57,701
decent and they're basically gonna try 
to talk you into getting into the ring 

3153
02:08:57,701 --> 02:08:58,400
because they need fresh meat and he 
goes,

3154
02:08:58,401 --> 02:09:01,400
do not go in there under any 
circumstance.

3155
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,970
I'm like,
whatever.

3156
02:09:01,971 --> 02:09:04,070
Charlie always preaching this 
apocalyptic shit.

3157
02:09:04,071 --> 02:09:06,770
They would literally clockwork six weeks
over there,

3158
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:09,500
fucking black dude shredded comes up to 
me.

3159
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:11,150
Hey,
you're a comedian man.

3160
02:09:11,151 --> 02:09:12,110
You know,
looked like a comedian.

3161
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:13,850
Like how you've got a nice jab or 
whatever,

3162
02:09:13,851 --> 02:09:15,350
you know,
we want to spar a few rounds.

3163
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:20,600
I almost started laughing.
It was so exactly what the fuck he said.

3164
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:23,560
I was like,
get the fuck some six weeks,

3165
02:09:23,561 --> 02:09:28,561
six weeks in a comedian.
this fucking guy has been fighting for 

3166
02:09:28,561 --> 02:09:31,691
like 10 years as a beat you up.
He wanTed to try this shit that he 

3167
02:09:31,691 --> 02:09:32,690
didn't have the balls to try against a 
professional.

3168
02:09:32,691 --> 02:09:35,060
he was going to try some new,
I don't know,

3169
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:36,680
superman hook.
Is that a punch?

3170
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:38,840
I don't know what the fuck it was.
He wanted to try it on my moods.

3171
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:42,830
Do look for guys a spar with it.
Looked to beat guys up

3172
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:44,660
to improve their confidence and you 
know,

3173
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:47,010
try the techniques on.
Nobody wants to spar with the guy that's

3174
02:09:47,011 --> 02:09:52,011
going to beat the fuck out of here.
You want to spar with a guy who's going 

3175
02:09:52,011 --> 02:09:52,100
to just kind of barely put up a fight 
and you gonna be able to tee off on them

3176
02:09:52,101 --> 02:09:52,730
and it's like

3177
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:56,030
glorified.
That's basically what charlie told me.

3178
02:09:56,110 --> 02:10:01,110
It's true.
And probably murphy gave you some good 

3179
02:10:01,110 --> 02:10:01,110
advice.
Great advice.

3180
02:10:01,110 --> 02:10:03,050
I tell him he laughed his ass off when I
told him that because he just started.

3181
02:10:03,051 --> 02:10:08,051
He just started thinking about my big 
stupid charlie had getting battered 

3182
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:08,990
around the ring.
Boxing gyms are notorious for that shit.

3183
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,780
See when that happens in jujitsu,
it's really no big deal.

3184
02:10:11,781 --> 02:10:13,350
I remember when I first started doing 
jujitsu,

3185
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:18,400
I started rolling with guys who are 
really good and like just getting 

3186
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:18,470
humiliated,
getting strangled.

3187
02:10:18,471 --> 02:10:21,060
There was this one purple belt kid.
I was a white belt.

3188
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:26,080
I was.
I was on news radio and I was just 

3189
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,611
starting out and this is purple belt kid
is brazilian kid who was bad ass and he 

3190
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:29,140
used to fucking raped me.
Everyday I would.

3191
02:10:29,190 --> 02:10:32,240
I would be terrified to have to fucking 
roll with this kid because he was really

3192
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:33,020
good.
I was,

3193
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:34,220
and every

3194
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:39,220
time I'd run with them,
this motherfucker would mount me and 

3195
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:39,220
choked me and armbar me.
He would tap me three,

3196
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:41,360
four times and I was exhausted just over
and over and over again.

3197
02:10:41,361 --> 02:10:43,400
He would tap me now,
but it didn't hurt me.

3198
02:10:43,401 --> 02:10:43,960
You know what I'm saying?

3199
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,000
What was the level of frustration coming
from being a national champion and 

3200
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:49,270
ongoing

3201
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:51,310
was it was eyeopening?
Well,

3202
02:10:51,311 --> 02:10:56,311
there was one of the reasons why I 
stopped doing taekwondo is because 

3203
02:10:56,311 --> 02:10:58,471
taekwondo,
you don't punch to the head and the 

3204
02:10:58,471 --> 02:10:58,471
tournament's and I started kickboxing.
I started working with.

3205
02:10:58,471 --> 02:11:02,490
There was a guy named joe lake was a 
boxing coach in boston and he was 

3206
02:11:02,490 --> 02:11:05,791
training at the same gym that I was at 
and he was offering me to teach me 

3207
02:11:05,791 --> 02:11:09,721
boxing if I would teach him how to kick,
and so we sort of made this little deal 

3208
02:11:09,721 --> 02:11:13,151
and we'll work back and forth with each 
other and I started boxing and as I 

3209
02:11:13,151 --> 02:11:15,751
started boxing I realized how bad my 
hands were from taekwondo and then I'm 

3210
02:11:15,751 --> 02:11:19,171
like,
I've wasted all my time doing this 

3211
02:11:19,171 --> 02:11:20,700
taekwondo shit,
but then when I go box with guys and 

3212
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:20,700
kickbox,
I'm fucking terrible with my hands.

3213
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,360
So I started getting really good at my 
hands and working on it.

3214
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:27,510
So I'd already been enligHtened to the 
fact that my original path was not the 

3215
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:28,360
best path in the world and one of the 
reasons why I stopped fighting.

3216
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:33,510
I stopped fighting and taekwondo 
tournament because I realized how silly 

3217
02:11:33,510 --> 02:11:36,091
it was,
how easy it was for people to punch me 

3218
02:11:36,091 --> 02:11:36,091
in the face and how many techniques 
didn't work.

3219
02:11:36,091 --> 02:11:39,960
Once you added punching.
Then when the ultimate fighting 

3220
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:40,030
championship came along,
I realized like,

3221
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:41,740
oh,
well look what this fucking guy does.

3222
02:11:41,741 --> 02:11:42,440
He just,
you know,

3223
02:11:42,490 --> 02:11:44,920
hoists gracie just takes guys down and 
strangles them.

3224
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:46,750
What the fuck would I do if that guy got
me,

3225
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:47,890
I don't know,
shit.

3226
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:50,680
So I started doing jujitsu and I was 
just a rank beginner.

3227
02:11:50,681 --> 02:11:53,110
I was,
I wrestled one year in high school,

3228
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:55,750
so I knew how to throw bodies around a 
little bit,

3229
02:11:55,960 --> 02:12:00,960
but I didn't know how to defend myself 
against anybody who's any good and this 

3230
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:01,330
kid just mangled me over and,
but he never really hurt me,

3231
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:06,480
you know,
if this was kickboxing and he did that 

3232
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:06,480
to me,
he would've given me brain damage,

3233
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:07,450
but my face knocked me out.

3234
02:12:07,690 --> 02:12:09,700
But this guy just choked me and I just 
tapped and yarn,

3235
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:10,540
pardon me?
And I tapped.

3236
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:13,390
But he's not really hurting you.
Every time he's doing this to you,

3237
02:12:13,391 --> 02:12:16,360
just tap,
just emotionally devastating.

3238
02:12:17,710 --> 02:12:20,200
You don't realize until you roll with a 
guy who's good,

3239
02:12:20,230 --> 02:12:22,140
how a guy who's like that a,
you know,

3240
02:12:22,150 --> 02:12:27,150
high level purple builds,
a strong guy can just do whatever the 

3241
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:27,150
fuck he wants to you.
Like literally,

3242
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:29,680
you have no defense.
There's almost nothing you can do if you

3243
02:12:29,681 --> 02:12:34,681
don't punch him and knock him 
unconscious as he's grabbing a hold of 

3244
02:12:34,681 --> 02:12:34,681
you.
Once it grabs You,

3245
02:12:34,681 --> 02:12:35,590
you're a victim.
You're a victim.

3246
02:12:36,170 --> 02:12:41,170
You know,
it's almost like if you get grabbed by 

3247
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:41,170
like a bear,
like a wild animal,

3248
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:41,930
it's a second.
They grab your button down,

3249
02:12:41,950 --> 02:12:44,320
your worse for the bear finished.

3250
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:47,480
You imagine what it must feel like.
There's a photo that a guy took.

3251
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:48,140
He,
uh,

3252
02:12:48,220 --> 02:12:50,030
he died.
He was killed by this bear,

3253
02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:55,210
but he got one last photograph of the 
female charging him because he was a 

3254
02:12:55,210 --> 02:12:59,081
wildlife photographer.
It's a very famous photo aNd he was in 

3255
02:12:59,081 --> 02:12:59,081
the woods and as he's walking through 
the woods,

3256
02:12:59,081 --> 02:13:02,480
he stumbled upon bear cubs as you 
stumble upon It was just too late.

3257
02:13:02,630 --> 02:13:07,630
The female just runs out.
I'm a grizzly and he got a photo of her 

3258
02:13:07,630 --> 02:13:10,720
fucking lips curled teeth bared,
roaring and looking at him with dead 

3259
02:13:10,881 --> 02:13:13,070
eyes and that was his last photo that I 
ever took.

3260
02:13:13,071 --> 02:13:15,950
It's a fucking intense photo of you find
it online.

3261
02:13:15,951 --> 02:13:18,920
Anybody finds online twitter?
That shit to me because I lost it.

3262
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:24,160
I had it online.
I was showing it to somebody and then I 

3263
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:24,160
cannot find it anymore.
I don't know if it was pulled or what.

3264
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:25,850
Jesus,
you know when I was in Colorado,

3265
02:13:25,851 --> 02:13:27,710
my dog got eaten by mountain lion.
Oh yeah.

3266
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:32,010
I've been keeping up on you just

3267
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,880
see.
Just so you know,

3268
02:13:32,881 --> 02:13:35,020
we're at the two hour and 20 mInutes.
I know where we are.

3269
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:37,160
We should probably on this because 
nobody wants it.

3270
02:13:37,190 --> 02:13:40,530
Let's do a two hour and 20 minute 
podcast about podcasts.

3271
02:13:40,670 --> 02:13:44,670
We should talk to you monday.
He does not have fucking twitter,

3272
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:46,800
so we got him a god damn twitter 
account.

3273
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:48,720
Bill.
You got that shit.

3274
02:13:49,090 --> 02:13:54,090
It helps you.
It's the best thing for a comic to use 

3275
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:54,090
right now.
It shows.

3276
02:13:54,190 --> 02:13:59,190
I would not.
I would have known that you had a 

3277
02:13:59,190 --> 02:13:59,190
podcast.
if I,

3278
02:13:59,190 --> 02:13:59,190
if I,
if I heard something on twitter,

3279
02:13:59,190 --> 02:14:01,420
you know that that's by design my 
pockets.

3280
02:14:01,650 --> 02:14:03,690
We don't hype it.
I don't know.

3281
02:14:03,691 --> 02:14:04,770
Hype,
my podcast.

3282
02:14:04,771 --> 02:14:08,160
I totally,
I do it for fun and it's,

3283
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:09,210
it's,
I go,

3284
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:11,510
I'm waiting,
right?

3285
02:14:11,570 --> 02:14:12,390
Yeah.
But people don't know.

3286
02:14:12,391 --> 02:14:14,280
But you got,
you fucking know me.

3287
02:14:14,281 --> 02:14:15,000
You know me.

3288
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,190
You didn't even know I had one.
I know you had one.

3289
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:21,840
I didn't know you had one.
I think that you knew that I had one but

3290
02:14:21,841 --> 02:14:26,841
you didn't.
I remember you should do it with a 

3291
02:14:26,841 --> 02:14:26,841
phone.
The phone.

3292
02:14:26,841 --> 02:14:26,841
I do,
yeah,

3293
02:14:26,841 --> 02:14:28,560
but I just don't.
I don't give a fuck.

3294
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:33,561
How do you do it now?
You sit down with a microphone now and 

3295
02:14:33,561 --> 02:14:33,561
just ran the same thing.
Yeah.

3296
02:14:33,561 --> 02:14:36,480
People send me questions and then I,
I just go off on shit.

3297
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:39,150
So now you don't do it on a phone,
you don't do that anymore?

3298
02:14:39,190 --> 02:14:44,190
No,
I haven't done it on a phone now for 

3299
02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:44,370
about a voice mail thing.
Year and a half.

3300
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:45,950
Oh yeah.
When I used to call up ge cath.

3301
02:14:45,951 --> 02:14:50,951
But that was,
that was a lot of fun though because I 

3302
02:14:50,951 --> 02:14:53,660
could be an airport's making fun of 
fucking the creeps at cinnabon and all 

3303
02:14:53,660 --> 02:14:54,060
that and people really liked that.

3304
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:56,550
So I don't hAve a fucking twitter 
account.

3305
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:59,010
I dude,
I just got on facebook,

3306
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:02,310
but facebook's good.
But twitter is great for promoting gigs.

3307
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,170
Like I got a gig.
The punchline is duncan.

3308
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:06,640
Okay,
sounds rolling.

3309
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:09,540
I got a kick it,
the punchline in atlanta this sunday.

3310
02:15:09,541 --> 02:15:14,541
I just booked it because I knoW I'm 
going to be in atlanta on monday and I 

3311
02:15:14,541 --> 02:15:14,541
had to fly In sunday afternoon.
So I said,

3312
02:15:14,541 --> 02:15:16,410
well I'll just do a fucking show there.
So I,

3313
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:21,420
I just started promoting it.
I started promoting it on fucking 

3314
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:21,420
twitter.
I just threw it up on twitter.

3315
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:23,350
I'm in to let people know.
So then people started retweet,

3316
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:25,350
knit and letting people know it's almost
fucking sold out.

3317
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:29,520
That's all you have to do,
joe rogan television.

3318
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:32,750
But people know who you are.
It helps build you're a celebrity.

3319
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:35,100
When I told people that you were coming 
on the podcast,

3320
02:15:35,101 --> 02:15:37,170
people got all fucking excited and fired
up on twitter.

3321
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:40,090
A bunch of them on twitter,
I'll show you know,

3322
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:45,120
something filling seats.
They'll burn against this fuzzy math 

3323
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:46,560
look.
I'll show you.

3324
02:15:46,650 --> 02:15:48,950
There's a lot of people in here that 
we're talking about bill burr.

3325
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,580
There's a lot of people look at 
scrolling,

3326
02:15:51,581 --> 02:15:54,060
scrolling five bill burr on twitter 
right there.

3327
02:15:54,061 --> 02:15:55,710
Bam.
Is bill burr on twitter?

3328
02:15:55,711 --> 02:16:00,711
People trying and that's what you do.
You leave them wanting more.

3329
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:04,860
Joe,
you know how much fucking it's a pain in

3330
02:16:04,861 --> 02:16:06,960
the ass to do all that.
It's so easy.

3331
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:08,130
If you have an iphone,
what?

3332
02:16:08,150 --> 02:16:13,150
You have a blackberry.
I fucking twitter every week on my 

3333
02:16:13,150 --> 02:16:15,980
podcast.
I for an hour and you could listen to 

3334
02:16:15,980 --> 02:16:15,980
what twitter.
It's on to the same thing.

3335
02:16:15,980 --> 02:16:18,360
Twitter is like a text message that you 
send to all your fans.

3336
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:22,710
So like I've got 130 something thousand 
people on my quit showing off.

3337
02:16:22,711 --> 02:16:26,730
We already know one slash 31 slash 75.

3338
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:31,760
So that is 131,000
people that I can get in contact with 

3339
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:35,640
pretty much instantly.
I mean if they pay attention to their 

3340
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:35,640
twitter,
you know,

3341
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:35,640
all you have to do is your twitter,
hey,

3342
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:36,010
I'm going to be in fucking newport 
beach,

3343
02:16:36,011 --> 02:16:41,011
bam.
And then you can get people to come to 

3344
02:16:41,011 --> 02:16:41,011
your shows.
It's so much easier.

3345
02:16:41,011 --> 02:16:43,921
It's so much easier than going on a 
radio show and getting up in the 

3346
02:16:43,921 --> 02:16:43,921
morning.
You could fucking get things.

3347
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:49,260
I'm always like,
I always liked the old school way of 

3348
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:49,260
doing shit.
I always think it's better.

3349
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:50,890
I don't know why I'm an old school sort 
of a guy.

3350
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:53,290
I'm a romantic.
You are romantic.

3351
02:16:53,630 --> 02:16:55,630
And by the way,
joe,

3352
02:16:55,631 --> 02:16:58,540
that bear photo is fake.
I'll get on twitter is fake.

3353
02:16:58,770 --> 02:17:01,330
Yeah.
Which one is the one with the dead body?

3354
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:03,430
I dunno.
You talking about?

3355
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:03,930
Oh no,
no,

3356
02:17:03,931 --> 02:17:04,200
no,
that's,

3357
02:17:04,201 --> 02:17:05,190
that's a different one.
Yeah,

3358
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:05,940
I will.
I will.

3359
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:10,990
I will.
The other one is start tweeting black 

3360
02:17:10,990 --> 02:17:10,990
and white.
That's what it was.

3361
02:17:10,990 --> 02:17:12,070
That tweeting.
That just sounded clay tweeting.
