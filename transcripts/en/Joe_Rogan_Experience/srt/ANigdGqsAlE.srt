1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Live,
what's up?

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,840
What's up boys?
So nice to have you guys on man.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,350
It's a nice first of all to a nice to
have you guys in studio,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,730
but it's nice to have more tie,
which I've been a giant fan of for so

5
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,160
long.
I feel like it's starting to get more

6
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:20,400
ground in America and we've done our
best to try to promote it as much as

7
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,810
possible and here and it's been
frustrating for the longest time for me

8
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:29,220
watching what I think is like one of the
most exciting combat sports in the world

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,280
and it's sort of kind of slip under the
radar man when golf is taken off golf,

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,540
so everywhere they had a scrabble on
espn one time and that was just gut

11
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,800
wrenching.
That scrabble.

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,830
Well it is a sport so a lot of training
involved.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,510
Hey man,
it's brutal.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,810
But to see that and then to see us just
with nothing,

15
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:51,450
no coverage whatsoever for so long and
you know,

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,170
finally on tv but still relatively under
the radar.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,000
It's tough to watch but you knowing that
it's going to be there eventually,

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,630
it's just a matter of time.
You know,

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,120
so it's nice every,
every time we take another step,

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,230
like when it got on access tv,
it was such a giant leap compared to

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,460
where it was prior to that.
So what,

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,190
what's coming next?
What's coming next?

23
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:14,100
It's just a matter of time and the right
people coming along and doing the right

24
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:17,970
things.
One can only hope it's when we talked

25
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,020
about this today,
but uh,

26
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,840
the Dana white had a point that I think
he's probably right about,

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,360
is that in a lot of people's eyes in
America,

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,720
kickboxing got poisoned with that old
pka karate stuff that was on and like

29
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,030
the eighties and the nineties put a bad
taste in people's mouth.

30
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:37,350
So it's hard to break free from that
mentality of you think kickboxing,

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,660
Muay Thai,
you think pants fighting?

32
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,440
Yeah,
I remember the shoes and everything.

33
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,540
Everybody thinks,
oh,

34
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,250
you do that thing with the pants and the
shoes.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,720
I took a buddy of mine who was a,
uh,

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,390
he's a producer.
He was a producer of fear factor.

37
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,510
Actually my friend David,
I took him to some Moy Thai fights in

38
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,280
Burbank.
This is a local show that was at some

39
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,091
hotel,
you know,

40
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:02,091
they just had a ballroom and uh,
this was back when I'm God,

41
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:05,370
who the fuck was fighting on that card
and I'll,

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,810
I'll remember,
I'll remember,

43
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:07,980
but some,
some good names,

44
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,350
some really good fighters.
This is like back in 2000,

45
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,340
one,
2002.

46
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,730
And uh,
he had never seen like Moitai before.

47
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:18,060
He really had no idea what to expect.
And he was like,

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,350
Oh,
when they kicked the legs,

49
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,210
it makes a big difference.
I was like,

50
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,830
yeah,
it makes a fucking huge difference.

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,410
Well,
every time you have to,

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,240
somebody asks you.
So it was more tight every I feel.

53
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:30,270
So I,
I really dislike when I have to say it's

54
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,420
like kickboxing with elbows and knees,
like I died a little bit inside every

55
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,790
time I have.
It's a matter of how long you want to

56
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,710
sit there and talk to this person
because you can be like,

57
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,850
no,
it's actually this,

58
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:39,331
this,
that.

59
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,610
And so sometimes it's like,
is it like fixed kickboxing?

60
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:42,150
Like,
yeah,

61
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,310
see you later with Ella was a nice.
You're late like well kick as hard to

62
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,870
explain it.
It looks the same when you're looking at

63
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,700
it.
Like if you're watching glory it looks

64
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,080
the same.
You know?

65
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,540
And then when people talk about like
I've,

66
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,170
I've had people over watching the fights
that go,

67
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:58,350
wait a minute,
this isn't Moitai well it's similar.

68
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,420
It's like on the door,
it's like the difference between

69
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,280
American football and rugby.

70
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,840
Like they're similar,
they're running,

71
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,660
there's a ball,
but they're not the same whatsoever.

72
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,280
The two,
they're two different sports that

73
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:13,720
dissimilar because it is really
completely because it's a completely

74
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,420
different pace.
It's a completely different mentality.

75
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,210
Yeah.
You're,

76
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,320
you're limited on a just a few weapons
which seems very minor,

77
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,300
but in an icu fight it,
unless you do it,

78
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,500
it's,
it's night and day.

79
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,940
It's night day.
Well,

80
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,130
I would imagine that it would make,
there was,

81
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,770
there'd be a big adjustment for people
that are listening that don't know what

82
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:31,180
we're talking about.
Kickboxing,

83
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,990
if you watch like glory or now Bella
tours having kickboxing as well,

84
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,310
and of course k one was really the first
one to start it on a global scale and

85
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,650
make these big gigantic events over in
Japan.

86
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,820
Kickboxing does not allow the use of
elbows or knees and the very limited

87
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:46,650
amount of clinching.

88
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,140
Yeah.
Whereas in Moitai,

89
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,130
especially in Thailand,
you see a tremendous amount of clinching

90
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,280
and it's very technical.
There's a lot going on in that clenching

91
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,970
and I've always maintained.
I've been a big fan of lion fight

92
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,320
because what lion fight is doing is
giving you the actual pure Moitai you

93
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,460
know,
other than the dancing and the music and

94
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,620
all this stuff that happens before,
you know,

95
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,930
in a traditional Moitai fight.
Yeah.

96
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,250
They're,
they're doing a really good job.

97
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,390
And,
and as you said,

98
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,960
they've had to a limit a few of the
things in order to get it out there to

99
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:20,320
the general public,
which it's unfortunate that you can't

100
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,820
just,
you can't just like throw it out there

101
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:25,240
and people's faces with all the culture
and the tradition is particularly here

102
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:25,961
in America,
you know,

103
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,000
people,
people turn away from it so fast.

104
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,210
So I think at some point we'll be able
to build up to that,

105
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,130
you know,
if you start slowly,

106
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,810
I'm educating people on what that is and
the history and everything and hopefully

107
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,840
eventually we won't get so far away from
that,

108
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:42,370
that,
that does become kickboxing because

109
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,290
we've taken so much from it,
you know.

110
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,880
And for people who don't know what we're
talking about,

111
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,714
again,
the,

112
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,490
the,
the dance that you do,

113
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:52,380
the warmup dance before a Moitai match
called why crew.

114
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,700
Right.
And how long does it usually take it?

115
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,710
It depends really.
Um,

116
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,690
you know,
different gyms,

117
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,170
a different people do,
do,

118
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,930
do longer and shorter ones.
You know,

119
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,790
I,
I do a very limited,

120
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,600
a shorter one,
a when I fight.

121
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,990
Well,
I haven't done it in forever but,

122
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,600
but because of that,
you know,

123
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,400
and knowing that people aren't,
don't want to really want to see it,

124
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:15,340
you know,
you kind of Americanize it and shorten

125
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:16,930
it where some of them.
I've seen some,

126
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,570
I've seen some longer.
Why Cruz and then fights in the past.

127
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,690
Yeah.
Well what's a long one?

128
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Five minutes
kind of has like one of the longest ones

129
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,870
I've seen.
Like he takes his sweet time,

130
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,580
you know,
it goes down those everything like

131
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,210
perfectly.

132
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,740
It's like a,
it's like a whole routine.

133
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,000
But then in those situations like people
are very educated and they want to see

134
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:43,000
that they want to see the beauty of it
almost becomes part of the entertainment

135
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,250
part of the fight,
but besides the fight itself.

136
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,310
But when you go see a professional
Moitai match,

137
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:52,060
I would estimate that like 50 percent of
the crowd trains.

138
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,600
They're very educated in what it is.
You know,

139
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,280
it's like,
it's like baseball here in America where

140
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,520
you don't have to play baseball in order
to appreciate and love it because it's

141
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,950
our pastime and that's what it is in
Thailand.

142
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,140
Not,
not everyone there is actively training

143
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,530
or fighting or has fought,
but it's so embedded in their culture

144
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,090
that,
that they just love it and they

145
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,040
appreciate it.
Everything about it.

146
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,520
So to go to a live Muay Thai fight in
Thailand is just,

147
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,650
you can't even describe it.

148
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,350
I could only imagine it's on my bucket
list for sure,

149
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,540
but in America,
if you go to see a live event in

150
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,420
America,
half of the audience at least is either

151
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,810
people from the gym or people that know
people from the gym and it's sort of

152
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,970
almost an incestuous kind of an
environment.

153
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,760
Yeah.
Especially like when I was coming up,

154
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,230
the only people that were there trained
were family or friends of the people

155
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,090
fighting,
you know,

156
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,000
so that you weren't hitting this,
this wider audience,

157
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,170
you know,
where we are now.

158
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,870
It is getting on TV and there are people
seeing it who,

159
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,530
who don't know anything about it and
it's slowly building momentum and

160
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,330
getting out there and getting a little
more popular.

161
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,170
But it's just one of those sports where
you know,

162
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,260
it's,
it's not for everybody.

163
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,640
And,
and you gotta find the way to,

164
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
to bring it to everyone.

165
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,730
You know,
it's not,

166
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,310
it doesn't have this mass appeal.
The fight in itself does,

167
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,270
but,
but all,

168
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,220
everything that goes with it is very,
uh,

169
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,250
it's different.
It's very traditional.

170
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,000
The Thai style.
And then the music is very traditional

171
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,470
and it's,
it's for a lot of people,

172
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,750
for whatever reason,
they just don't have an open mind.

173
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,780
They don't want to accept that.
Yeah,

174
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,520
yeah,
yeah.

175
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,170
It's strange.
And like we were saying,

176
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:23,770
you know,
watching it live compared to watching it

177
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,370
on tv,
it's like two different things.

178
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,750
So yeah.
So yeah,

179
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,760
there's nothing like it.
Even for me,

180
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,880
I'll watch it on TV and then I'll be
there in person.

181
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm like,
Geez man,

182
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,950
like why do people do this?
Oh yeah,

183
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:35,780
yeah,
I do this.

184
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,700
Yeah.
It's sad,

185
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,640
but it's without any combat sport.
If you,

186
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,340
when you're there live,
you could feel it.

187
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:44,150
You feel the energy in the air,
you feel the impact as opposed to

188
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,010
watching it on TV,
which is still great,

189
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,020
but nothing compares to being there in
person,

190
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,010
particularly moved tie.

191
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,470
It's just brutal.
Yeah,

192
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,060
I agree in that it's,
there's something about it when you're

193
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:56,810
not hearing any commentary,
you just literally feeling the slap of

194
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,740
the shins bone to bone.
It just makes me cringe.

195
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,330
I was in la a couple of years back when
they had that big pro Moitai event.

196
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,570
They had a lot of big name fighters
fight and book how fought and he,

197
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,150
uh,
had some beef with some dude that he

198
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:11,984
was,
uh,

199
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,150
gonna fight and there was a lot of shit
talk back and forth.

200
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,820
So we had this long.
Why crew where he was shooting arrows at

201
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,990
them.
Remember that?

202
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,400
Yeah.
That was the NPL,

203
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,630
right?
Yes.

204
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,070
Yeah,
yeah.

205
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,680
What happened to that organization?
Same thing that happens to a lot of

206
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:25,640
organizations.
They,

207
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,920
they,
they try to go too hard out the gate.

208
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,860
They pay all this money for all these
super high level fighters,

209
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,760
which you know,
your,

210
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,500
your mood tie fans going to know who
they are,

211
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,570
but your,
your general public has no idea.

212
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:42,050
And that's who we're trying to reach is,
is the people that don't know anything

213
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:45,050
about it.
So those people aren't going to come out

214
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:46,770
just because there's a high level
multitech I,

215
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,830
they don't know who this is,
they don't anything about them.

216
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,950
They'd be more likely to come out to a,
uh,

217
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,670
a local person because at least I'm
like,

218
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:54,320
hey,
that guy flights out of California or

219
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:55,220
whatever.
And,

220
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,100
and that's

221
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,100
been the biggest thing that's a slow,
slow mo tie down is these promotions

222
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,320
tried to go too hard out the gate and as
opposed to building it up,

223
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,750
which you know,
you got to lose a lot of money and build

224
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:10,710
these people with anything.
You got to start slow and build people

225
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,750
gradually build a promotion,
build the fighter's,

226
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,450
build your audience,
and eventually you can get to that level

227
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,430
where,
where everyone in the card is like top

228
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,650
10 people.
But you can't do that from the beginning

229
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
when you were just trying to grow and
build.

230
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,960
Yeah.
I remember I went to the event and uh,

231
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,060
Larry Merchant was there,
remember the boxing guy,

232
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,290
Larry merchant was there.
A lot of people were there and

233
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,270
[inaudible] was doing commentary.
It was.

234
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,363
And I was like,
wow,

235
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,770
maybe this is going to work.
You know,

236
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,480
it seems like these guys have got it

237
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,850
too big,
too fast,

238
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,560
you know,
too many big names right away,

239
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:39,394
you know,
the rent,

240
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,950
I'm pretty sure they ran out of money
like by the second or third show,

241
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,980
it just didn't work out.
And that's where a lion fight has been

242
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:48,370
doing a really good job.
But like growing their talent and trying

243
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:49,840
to get better.
And like every shoe they,

244
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,230
they're putting really good fights and
really good match ups with guys from

245
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:54,064
around here.

246
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

247
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,700
Well the,
the match ups and the talent level is

248
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:01,300
very high.
It's way higher than the credit it's

249
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,020
getting.
Yeah.

250
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,310
It's like a watch.
I have a Dvr and my gym,

251
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,660
I've got,
I mean,

252
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:08,890
what,
what number they up to now,

253
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:13,891
like 30 something 30 to 32.
I've got way back to like 21 or

254
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,590
something just saved up and I can watch
them all while I train.

255
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,110
And it's um,
there's such high level.

256
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:21,390
There's so much good fights are.
So,

257
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,810
you know,
there's so many good guys.

258
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,680
It's so exciting.
And it's,

259
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,400
it's such a dynamic technical sport and
that's one of the things that I think is

260
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:32,500
probably,
it's probably,

261
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:36,350
it probably slips by some people when
the casual observers watching it.

262
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,340
Just some of the stuff that we were
doing today when you were showing me

263
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:44,341
just a little little shifts and
variations and stances and little things

264
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,780
like that.
And that's,

265
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,440
you know,
I think that's when you train in it or

266
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,600
you try it,
it makes the experience of watching

267
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,990
people compete in it richer because you,
you kind of understand,

268
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:56,381
you're like,
wow,

269
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:58,930
this is very complex.
There's a lot going on here.

270
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,310
It's not just guys going around and just
trying to fucking kick each other.

271
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,220
Yeah.
And there's so much.

272
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,510
There's so many levels to this and in
your casual fan isn't going to know that

273
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:07,940
in,
in,

274
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,550
in a big problem a lot of promotions
make is they try to cut corners and put

275
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:15,940
guys out there who aren't very good.
But both those guys are at the same

276
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,200
level.
So for your average person,

277
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:17,561
they're like,
well,

278
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:19,150
they're kicking and punching each other
so.

279
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,790
But they might be very,
very low level,

280
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,910
but they just wanted to get some cheap
people they could put on the air,

281
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:26,080
you know,
so they'll,

282
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,160
they'll take all the cut,
all these corners just just to save some

283
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:31,690
money.
But at the end it hurts everybody

284
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,280
because you're putting crappy flights
out there,

285
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,170
you know what I mean?
Not good matchups,

286
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,190
not very talented guys because you want
to save some money or there they'll

287
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:41,550
spend so much money on like the main
event,

288
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,220
the main event that they have to cut
those corners with everybody else.

289
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:49,510
And so you're putting these crappy
fights out there in your brain trying to

290
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,670
bring this new audience in.
So people come and like this is

291
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:52,510
terrible.
Like why?

292
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,110
Why would I to come to this,
you know,

293
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,640
because because they're bad matchups.
And,

294
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:58,570
and as we were talking about line fight,
what they did from the beginning was

295
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,870
they had quality matchups throughout the
entire card.

296
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,810
Whether it was the main event,
whether it was undercard,

297
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,710
whether it was the amateurs,
they're good,

298
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,930
exciting matchups regardless of the
level.

299
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,430
And that's what really helped build them
up.

300
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,920
Now,
how long have you been fighting Moitai

301
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,400
now?
I started when I was 10 back in Lima,

302
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,730
Peru.
And how long have,

303
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:17,331
you know?
20.

304
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:18,164
Twenty four.
Yeah.

305
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,800
Um,
I think is really interesting.

306
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:22,260
You were telling me today we were
talking about your training partner,

307
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,120
a Missouri.
What's his first name was Gabriel.

308
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,560
Gabriel,
who's,

309
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,630
who just fought this past weekend and
lion fight.

310
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,360
You watch them fucking sensational.
Holy Shit.

311
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:31,440
Is that kid dynamic?

312
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,140
And his brother is like bigger,
older and like more even like more

313
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,780
aggressive.
That's incredible.

314
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,680
He's,
he's a lot there.

315
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:40,690
Yeah,
he was.

316
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,450
What was going on in Peru?
Like man,

317
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,180
my,
my,

318
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,280
my first coach Rodrigo,
you know,

319
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,230
he,
he had a vision of the sport,

320
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:49,064
you know,
when,

321
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,390
when he first started he came here to
train with how he's gone from like San

322
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,840
Francisco and it was very small but he
went back and I remember I started

323
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,480
training with them and it was,
everything was so small back then,

324
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,610
like the amount of talent there is now.
Like,

325
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,770
I mean Kevin and Kerry inside when we
went to,

326
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:05,960
uh,
to Peru last November and hide in the

327
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:08,000
corner over there.
He's here but he's not here.

328
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,260
I mean there will be on cameras out on,
there was 150 fighters in the national

329
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:15,710
tournament last November when me and
Kevin were fighting and yeah,

330
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,050
it's crazy.
Like the amount of talent and how much

331
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:20,540
is growing.
I mean pro is definitely going to be a

332
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,620
powerhouse in the future.

333
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,580
Is it because of one coach?
Is it just as the country embraced it?

334
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:27,770
Is it taken off in popularity?

335
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,340
It's getting a little more popular.
But like I said,

336
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,670
Rodrigo really help help.
He,

337
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,650
he got to go with the government,
you know,

338
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,720
so they,
they can start helping mountain and

339
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:40,880
bring it guys out too if my and
everything.

340
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,140
And it's just crazy.
Like all these kits are really like 16,

341
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:45,980
17,
18,

342
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,040
19 years old,
really a kids.

343
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,830
So

344
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,910
it's just fascinating that that one part
of the world is starting to produce a

345
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:54,950
lot of,
like really high level talent and then

346
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,360
talking to you about it,
you know,

347
00:13:56,361 --> 00:14:00,330
you were saying that it's like soccer
and then Moitai is like really like

348
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,540
coming up in popularity behind soccer,
which sounds crazy,

349
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:02,660
right?

350
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,281
Yeah.
Yeah.

351
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:05,390
I mean,
and then our soccer team suck so

352
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,340
everybody's trying to turn to Moitai.
So it's really cool to see.

353
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:11,250
It's really cool to watch.
Watch

354
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,340
that is really fascinating.
You know,

355
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,850
more tie is the predominant striking art
in MMA,

356
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,230
you know,
it's the most,

357
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,360
uh,
I would say probably the most successful

358
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,360
striking art,
mma because it has all the elements of

359
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:25,950
boxing and uh,
you know,

360
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:28,650
a lot of the elements of a lot of the
other traditional martial arts.

361
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:33,150
But there's something about the
combination of kicks and elbows and

362
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:38,151
knees and the technical style of Moitai
that really lends itself to mma.

363
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,200
And I think when Maury Smith came along,
like Maury Smith was probably the first

364
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:47,290
guy who was like a really high level
technical striker who gave him a mayor

365
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,860
try and was showing everybody the
effectiveness of Thai

366
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,480
in mma,
but for whatever reason it never

367
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,810
translated to Moitai getting more
popular in mma,

368
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,650
but it didn't necessarily translate to
Moitai getting that much more popular.

369
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

370
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:09,611
It's one of those things that with the
mma it kind of helps and it hurts,

371
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,810
like it helps in the sense that it gets
it out there,

372
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,010
but it can hurt as well when,
when you're getting a bad representation

373
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,390
of the sport you do.
So.

374
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,620
So for a good stand up striker in MMA,
they might not be that great when it

375
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:25,010
comes to the tie,
you know,

376
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,881
so,
so you're saying,

377
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,380
hey,
this guy's got really great stand up

378
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,630
will.
He has really great standup for MMA.

379
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,810
So people assume that that's what good
standup looks like in a more tire,

380
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,310
traditional,
traditional stand up art,

381
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,200
you know.
So it's,

382
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,950
it's the,
the pros and cons of,

383
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:41,060
of it getting out there.

384
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,100
Um,
so it's stuff,

385
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,230
you know,
everything kind of helps as well as

386
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:48,950
takes away from the sport to,
well I think all martial arts make an

387
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,170
adjustment.
They have to make a technical adjustment

388
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,800
when they're being applied to mma
because you have to deal with the take

389
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:56,480
downs,
you have to deal with all the and even

390
00:15:56,481 --> 00:16:00,740
wrestling and judo had to make
adjustments for more time because as

391
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,990
soon as you involve leg kicks and then
knees,

392
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,420
you know,
a lot of guys were shooting for take

393
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,270
downs and is going to need it.
They're getting into the face like that

394
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,420
Cyborg.
Um,

395
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:10,910
my mom,
uh,

396
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,920
Michael Page fight crazy knockout where
his whole head got crushed from that

397
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,140
knee surgery and everything.
Yeah,

398
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,900
I mean he's got literally had to have a
sculpture back together again.

399
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,090
It was the most brutal injuries I've
ever.

400
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,200
Have you ever seen one of those before?

401
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,030
Have you ever seen a skull get crushed?
No.

402
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,250
I actually had my skull fractured but
not like that.

403
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,180
That was the one of the worst things
I've ever seen.

404
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,940
How did your school?
I got kicked in the back of the head and

405
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,070
the guy had a steel plate in his Shin
Guard in China.

406
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,850
What?
Any shinguard yeah.

407
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,500
So we had a shin guard on,
with a steel plate in it.

408
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,380
Yeah.
I didn't really think anything of it at

409
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,190
the time,
you know,

410
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,440
this was like 10 years ago,
you know,

411
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,870
we would just fight all everywhere,
anywhere,

412
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,681
whatever,
you know,

413
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,540
and,
and not really think twice about it.

414
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,400
And I,
uh,

415
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,800
so I fought,
he kicked me in the back of the head.

416
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:58,700
I got dropped,
got up,

417
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,270
I ended up knocking him out,
fought again the very next day.

418
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,070
I'm Wyatt.
Yeah.

419
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,540
Not Knock this guy out to.

420
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,950
And then uh,
when we got back to the states I was

421
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,230
having headaches all the time and I just
thought I had a bad concussion,

422
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,380
you know,
but like up to like almost like a month

423
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,330
later I kept seeing these flashes of
light every,

424
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,330
anytime someone would ever touch me,
you know,

425
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,150
I'd be working with little kids or girls
and smaller people and just them

426
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:25,660
touching me.
I'd get this jolt and you know,

427
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:29,360
it was kind of freaking me out and I uh,
I was getting ready for another fight

428
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,560
and uh,
I had to get my Mri or a cat scan.

429
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,150
I don't remember what it was.
And he was like,

430
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,850
yeah,
you kind of inch and a half crack in the

431
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,770
back of your skull.
And they're like,

432
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,780
I don't know why you're not a vegetable
right now.

433
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,780
You should be there.
Like if you even hit that again,

434
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,190
you,
you'd probably kill you.

435
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,890
Doctors always say that though.
Yeah,

436
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,260
of course.
Was the last you were fucking

437
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,960
knocked out one more time.
I'm dead.

438
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,440
It was one inch closer to my spine.
I'd be dead.

439
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,390
It was,
it was,

440
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,770
it was,
it was pretty a rough thing to happen

441
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,380
into.
I couldn't do anything other than hit

442
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,340
the bag by myself for,
I don't remember how long it was to like

443
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,530
let it heal.
But,

444
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,630
but it was a toy just essentially how to
close on its own.

445
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,090
You don't get hit,
you don't get it.

446
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,610
And I was getting ready for a fight and
I actually still tried to fight anyway.

447
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,210
But uh,
that,

448
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,180
that doctor,
who doctor who diagnosed it was the

449
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,920
doctor for the fights.
Oh,

450
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:23,880
that's hilarious.
Like,

451
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:24,691
dude,
he can't fight.

452
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:27,720
Get out of here.
How long after that was the fight?

453
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,270
After the diagnosis?
Like a week.

454
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,190
I said cat fight with fucking die.
That's,

455
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,450
that's just kind of the mentality I had
coming up,

456
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,870
you know.

457
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,440
And how old were you at the time?
Twenty five.

458
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,600
So he just felt invulnerable?
No,

459
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,860
not really.
I mean my,

460
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,100
my mentality from the beginning has
always been I'm going to fight as long

461
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:53,130
as I'm breathing and you know,
I've gotten into fights with some of the

462
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,990
worst injuries ever.
Broken hands,

463
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,490
broken,
broken skulls,

464
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:59,340
broken faces,
and that's just the way I came up,

465
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:00,750
you know,
like you're going to fight no matter

466
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,760
what,
you're going to fight anyone anywhere,

467
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,290
anytime,
any weight class.

468
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,150
And that's how I was able to get as much
experience as I did back there.

469
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,040
So,
you know,

470
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,520
good.
It's just,

471
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,680
it was the mentality we had coming up,
you know,

472
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,060
this was that time when,
you know,

473
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,770
youtube wasn't even out yet.
Like,

474
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,170
nobody knew what was.
It was like you gotta be ready to fight

475
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:24,550
all the time or else you're never going
to get any fights.

476
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,381
You know,
we're now,

477
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:29,140
it's like everyone's kind of like
looking for the big show or oh,

478
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,670
pick in there like a month,
like a month is short notice for people

479
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,090
were.
It was like an hour.

480
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:34,800
It was like,
yeah,

481
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,520
we're ready.
We're,

482
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,750
we're here to fight.
Let's go.

483
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,860
You know,
and it's just the time I came up was a

484
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:43,230
different mindset than it is today.
And that's kind of the pros and cons of

485
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,870
that.
Getting bigger is the bigger things get.

486
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,660
You got to take the kind of fake or
people with it.

487
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,553
Where,
where,

488
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,900
when,
when I started and I was at fights,

489
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:56,210
it's like you knew every person that was
at that fight was a die hard and we tie

490
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,290
fan.
There was no other reason to do this

491
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,150
other than the fact that you loved it.
You're losing money.

492
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,350
There was no,
there was no show to get on.

493
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,370
There was no television.
There was no reason to do this sport

494
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,610
except for the fact that you loved that
there wasn't,

495
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,100
wasn't a question like there's no reason
to do this except for you.

496
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,130
Love it with everything that's in you.
So everyone,

497
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:18,870
you met,
everyone you talked to,

498
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,730
every gym you went to,
every fight you went to,

499
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:25,260
you were surrounded by people that had
the same heart and mentality is you.

500
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,290
Whereas now you know,
people are doing it for different

501
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,300
reasons.
You know,

502
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,590
that they,
maybe they want to get famous or they

503
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:33,400
want to get instagram followers or you
know,

504
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,870
they want to look cool doing pad work
and that's kind of the good and the bad

505
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,230
of things getting bigger.
So you think that by the sport getting

506
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:42,480
more popular by more people paying
attention to it,

507
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:44,430
it opens up the door to more people
doing it,

508
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:48,220
but they just don't have the pure

509
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,580
intention of course.
And that kind of waters down the sport

510
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,040
at the end.
So it's interesting because there's got

511
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,940
to be,
there's a,

512
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:59,110
there's a line right between like where
it's intelligent to fight injured.

513
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,140
Like with your broken head.
I would never,

514
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,600
that would never tell anyone to do
today.

515
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,480
Would you think you would be in the same
situation today or would you go,

516
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,220
well,
what wisdom?

517
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,610
I'm not going to fight with me
personally,

518
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,640
but fortunately I have good people
around me who,

519
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,630
who would be like,
and that's not smart,

520
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,450
right?
I'm like,

521
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:17,881
yeah,
yeah,

522
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:19,660
you're right.
And again,

523
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,720
it wasn't a time where if I don't take
this fight,

524
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,550
who knows?
One another fight is going to come along

525
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,550
and you know,
they're there.

526
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,520
You got to take what you can get when
you can get it.

527
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:30,820
And that's when I'm like fighting people
who outweighed me by 30 pounds and you

528
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,860
know,
just just taking a fight on a couple

529
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,170
hours notice because you got,
there was,

530
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,020
there wasn't opportunities so you've got
to do what you had to do to get in there

531
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,870
and he had to get experience and that
was the only way you were going to get

532
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:41,690
fights.

533
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,140
You know?
Was it difficult to motivate yourself

534
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,570
during those times?
Because for a lot of people,

535
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,630
motivation requires some sort of an end
goal or at least so much about.

536
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,400
It was more about getting fights and it
was about,

537
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,420
what am I getting out of this fight?
So it wasn't about making money,

538
00:21:58,421 --> 00:21:59,800
it wasn't about getting on tv,
but,

539
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:03,580
but there was a long period of time when
I just couldn't get a fight to save my

540
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:07,000
life and that's when I was highly
considering switching over to mma

541
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,940
because everyone I trained was fighting.
They're fighting in the UFC there

542
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:12,760
getting fights all the time,
the fight and every month and I'm

543
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:16,450
sitting there busting my ass and I can
only get a fight or two a year.

544
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,110
You know,
I,

545
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,250
there was a time I had over 30 fights
fall through that I was training for and

546
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,210
preparing myself for it.

547
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,120
And then they'd fall through and they'd
fall through in the late fall through.

548
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,350
And that's why I started just taking a
boxing fight.

549
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:29,290
Even though I'd never trained boxing in
my life or taking a San shall fight that

550
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,740
that one in China was a sand shall fight
because I just had to do what I had to

551
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:36,040
do to stay busy or taking a flight on a
day's notice or fighting with a cracked

552
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,760
skull because I knew I had to stay in
there and stay active and stay busy or

553
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:42,190
else I'm never going to get better.
Especially if I want to compete with

554
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:45,370
guys who have like 400 fights and been
fighting since they were eight years

555
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:45,911
old.
You know?

556
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,800
How are you going to fight against the
guy like that?

557
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,620
If you don't get the experience,
you have so much to make up for it

558
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,250
anyway.

559
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,800
I didn't start till I was 23.
You know what I mean?

560
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,240
I'm so late to the game.
My mentality was always I'm always going

561
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:00,250
to be playing catch up no matter how
good I get,

562
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:03,790
I'm playing catch up and so I got to do
everything I can every way I can.

563
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:07,450
Maybe it wasn't the smartest thing,
but I wouldn't be where I am today if I

564
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:10,000
didn't take those risks and maybe take
those.

565
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,530
Not so smart fights,
but yeah,

566
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:15,880
there is a fine line between putting
yourself out there and being dangerous,

567
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,280
but I don't know where that line is.
Yeah,

568
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,280
I don't think anybody does.
Right.

569
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,560
So that for me it was all for everybody,
so I was always on that.

570
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,390
I'm like,
I'm just going to do it no matter what

571
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,450
because where do you draw the line?
You stub your toe and you're limping a

572
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,910
little bit or you're not fight.
I Dunno,

573
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,470
maybe,
but I'm going to do it.

574
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,700
Yeah.
Do you.

575
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,030
When you say you started at 23,
was that when you started competing as

576
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,830
the first time I stepped foot in the
gym.

577
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,140
You were 23.
No training at all in martial arts

578
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,570
before that.
What motivated you to get in there?

579
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,483
Well,
I.

580
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,760
The first time I ever saw him when we
tie it was like 94,

581
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,500
90,
94 and 96.

582
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,110
I went back when espn used to play them
late at night,

583
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,640
like the old school fights in hours.
I'd always thought about boxing and

584
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,970
doing some kind of fighting in.
But I always love martial arts,

585
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,910
you know,
and when I saw them I was like that's it

586
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,490
man,
cause cause every other kind of thing

587
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:08,370
with like kicking and knees was like
taekwondo or point point fighting and

588
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,350
not that real boxing style of,
of hardcore fighting,

589
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,840
you know.
So when I saw them once I was like,

590
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,180
if I'm going to do anything that's going
to be it,

591
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,840
um,
but unfortunately at that time I was too

592
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:25,841
busy living in Vegas and drinking myself
to death every day and party and you

593
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:29,180
know,
and it was never one of those serious

594
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:30,470
things.
And so I never,

595
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,570
I never told anybody about it.
I was never,

596
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,850
because I didn't even know how serious I
was because obviously I couldn't do what

597
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,000
it lived the way I was living in
compete.

598
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,520
So I knew that if I was ever going to do
this,

599
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,530
I would have to completely stop
drinking,

600
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,660
partying,
living the lifestyle I was living.

601
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,090
And I wasn't ready to give that up,
you know,

602
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:49,160
I wasn't ready to give up my friends and
lose all these people.

603
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:52,490
Not to say that I would,
but I knew that was a possibility.

604
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,340
Um,
and I only ever told one of my friends

605
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:57,360
about it.
His name was moe and um,

606
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,420
you know,
I always figured people would laugh at

607
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:01,520
me if I told them I want to be a fighter
one day.

608
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:04,290
If you knew me back then you probably
would have left him when he talking

609
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,500
about like,
you drink every single day,

610
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:11,180
all you do is party.
And I told him and to my surprise,

611
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:12,100
he didn't laugh at me at all.
He's like,

612
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,250
well,
why don't you,

613
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,150
why don't you go after it?

614
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,200
And I was like,
well,

615
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:18,140
I'm like,
I was only like 18 at the time.

616
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,660
And at that point I thought it was way
too old to start.

617
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,310
I'm like,
I can't start now.

618
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:24,770
I can't start now and make it anywhere.
You know what I mean?

619
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,450
These people are starving in there like
10.

620
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,190
It's too late for him.
And he's like,

621
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,040
you should do it anyway.
You know,

622
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,820
like if you want to do something you can
do it.

623
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,511
And He,
uh,

624
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:35,030
he was born with a bad heart and he
ended up passing away.

625
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,960
Um,
and I promised myself when he died that

626
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:39,860
I would do it.
I was like,

627
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,650
I'm going to go after this dream,
um,

628
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,610
if not for myself.
Then for him because he was never able

629
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,480
to,
to live,

630
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,630
you know,
and unfortunately his death sent me just

631
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:52,940
in a really bad downward spiral.

632
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,030
Even more so than I was already in
drinking and partying and all that

633
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:59,240
stuff.
And this continued on for years and

634
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,440
years and in through a month long series
of really horrible things happening,

635
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,750
like friends dying or almost killing
people,

636
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,210
drunk driving and myself getting pulled
over,

637
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:11,510
doing like 120 on the two slash 15 in
Vegas.

638
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,900
And for whatever reason the cop let me
go.

639
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,100
And,
and that was just the,

640
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,590
all these things happen.
And it was this huge wake up call for

641
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:21,020
me.
And I realized that if my friend was

642
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:23,780
still alive,
he would beat the shit out of me.

643
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,471
You know,
he's like,

644
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:25,880
well,
you're wasting your life.

645
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:29,420
You're wasting this dream you have
because you're too scared to do it.

646
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,310
His dream,
you mean you would never even stepped

647
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:35,720
foot in the door.
So this is like a dream of you one day

648
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,910
attempting to learn something,
right?

649
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,580
Yeah.
That's a very crazy thing because it was

650
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,670
always hanging over your head then.
Yeah.

651
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,010
And was again,
it

652
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,540
was that thing where I'm not going to be
able to get anywhere in this,

653
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:52,950
but I finally realized that where I get
to isn't what matters.

654
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:57,900
Like how good I can get doesn't matter
me giving myself all of myself to this

655
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:02,550
sport and dedicated myself to this is
what really matters.

656
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:03,810
How,
where I make it to,

657
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:06,480
I don't know where I could make it so I
can be the best in the world or the

658
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,700
worst in the world,
but as long as I'm putting myself out

659
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,170
there,
why is that more important?

660
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,870
Why is it,
why is the most thing important to put

661
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,290
everything you have into it?
I've just always believed that if you're

662
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,270
going to do something,
it's all or nothing,

663
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
you know?
Um,

664
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,020
I,
I never wanted to see half asset and

665
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:25,620
that's why I knew if I was going to do
this I'd have to give up partying and

666
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:30,270
drinking and hanging out with my friends
and going out all the time and I wasn't

667
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,104
ready to do that.

668
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,861
You know,
I,

669
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:35,610
I've always been in that mentality of if
you're going to do something,

670
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:38,380
do you do it all the way?
You don't do it at all because.

671
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,830
Because you're sabotaging yourself and
then you can just say,

672
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,810
oh I didn't make it because of this,
that and the other.

673
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,890
Right.
But why was it so what,

674
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,710
what were you getting out of it when
you,

675
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:51,540
when you realized that it wasn't really
about how good you get or how far you

676
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,520
go.
It was about giving it everything you

677
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,390
have it.
A lot of it had to do with seeing my

678
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:59,880
friend pass away it at 18,
you know,

679
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm like,
there's no reason to ever halfway do

680
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:06,130
something because there's people who
don't get the opportunity to,

681
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,170
to even attempt to go after these things
because because of whatever reason they

682
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,490
might die,
they might have a disease,

683
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:12,690
they might,
you know,

684
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,540
not have all their legs,
you know,

685
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,020
and you,
you can do this.

686
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,270
Maybe you can't be the great,
but you can do this.

687
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:22,350
You can at least attempt this and you
owe it to yourself and you owe it to

688
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:25,020
them to give it everything that you
have.

689
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:29,940
I always felt like I owed him everything
to go after my life with everything.

690
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,880
I have all my dreams.
I need to go after 100 percent because

691
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:36,120
there's people that don't get to.
I'm asking this because I think this is

692
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:40,640
a common theme with people is that when
they're pursuing a dream or when they're

693
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,190
attempting to do something,
they realized somewhere along the line

694
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:49,290
that you're doing something more than
just like trying to get really good at

695
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,640
Moitai or,
or whatever.

696
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,320
You know,
fill in the blank with whatever sport it

697
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:54,050
is,
your eye.

698
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,080
I was the expression that was used as a
martial arts are a vehicle for

699
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:01,920
developing your human potential and I
think that until you have a really

700
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:05,170
difficult task in front of you,
like becoming a professional Moitai

701
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,030
fighter,
which is one of the most difficult tasks

702
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:10,470
and all combat sports,
until you have that task in front of

703
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:13,290
you,
until you go down that road and realize

704
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,920
how much is actually required of Hugo,
you don't know how much you can give to

705
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,420
something.

706
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,210
Right?
And once you do realize how much your

707
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,290
capable of giving you something and then
you can give a little more and then you

708
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,890
can give a little more than you realize.
Why did I give my all I did,

709
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,600
I did.
I watch what I ate.

710
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,250
Did I sleep enough?
Did I do,

711
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:32,940
did I think about things the right way?
Did I get anxious when I shouldn't have?

712
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,690
Did I that I keep my mind clean?
You know what?

713
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,560
What was I doing wrong?
What was I doing right?

714
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:40,860
How can I improve?
And then it sort of trickles over into

715
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:41,890
your life.
Yeah.

716
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,641
Yeah.
Well,

717
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,140
in the beginning,
as I said,

718
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,480
for me it's always been all or nothing.
You know,

719
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,250
I didn't realize that at the time,
but,

720
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,550
but looking back,
I can kind of understand the mentality

721
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:56,170
behind it is there's so many things that
are going to come up that will deter you

722
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,004
from going after.

723
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,760
Maybe you get injured or maybe you're
not getting the opportunities and if

724
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,870
you're not in it 100 percent,
those things are going to steer you

725
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,700
away.
Those things are going to make you quit.

726
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:10,180
It's that people kind of look at.
People have made it as if they just had

727
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:12,660
this easy path and all of a sudden
they're there.

728
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,700
They're in the spotlight and they're a
world champion and doing these things.

729
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:18,430
But it's like any person who's made it
to a high level,

730
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:20,780
whether it's an athlete or a
businessperson,

731
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,230
if you go back in their life and see the
things they've had to do and overcome

732
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,430
the obstacles in their way,
you have.

733
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,650
You have no idea.
And that's why everyone's like,

734
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:31,090
well,
they didn't have to deal with this or

735
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,010
they didn't have to deal with this.
You don't know what they had to deal

736
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:33,460
with.

737
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,120
You don't see the obstacles.
Isn't that always a problem when you do

738
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,260
something kind of condensed to one
performance?

739
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,060
You know,
like if you watch like Gabriel go out

740
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:41,050
the other night,
you look at him,

741
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:43,180
he's 19 years old.
He destroys that guy,

742
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,170
was the guy's name Josh a shepherd,
a shepherd who was a really talented

743
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,660
fighter herself,
goes out and destroys this guy in the

744
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,320
first round.
Like,

745
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,310
well,
how hard could he have worked?

746
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,020
He's fucking 19.
She was a young kid.

747
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:55,420
I was training.
I mean Karen and I were training that

748
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:59,740
kid and I was like running him to the
ground every single day.

749
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:00,640
I mean,
he's really good.

750
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,350
He's a really talented already.
But I was like,

751
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,480
you're,
you're in this position right now.

752
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:07,330
This is where you're going to do and
we're going to work really hard,

753
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,081
you know?
And I,

754
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:11,080
I dedicated myself to him throughout his
camp too.

755
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,220
I mean,
we're training together.

756
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:17,221
When I was fighting for my world title
fight and then he just kept training and

757
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,870
going and he's trained like three months
for that fight and that's why he looked

758
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:22,810
so good.
He dedicated everything to that.

759
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,430
Also super talented.
Also there's something about being 19,

760
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,840
right?
Right.

761
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,160
Isn't there something about being like
really what is it?

762
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:33,580
Is it a physical thing or is it a mental
thing?

763
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,740
Is it that you don't have as much
responsibility?

764
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,720
It's a combination of a lot of those
things.

765
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,490
Yeah,
without a doubt.

766
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,000
But it's,
it's super rare that a guy is like 35

767
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,120
and then how long is Gabriel been
training for?

768
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,360
He,
he wasn't even like,

769
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,080
he wasn't even that good at before.
Like he was okay.

770
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,120
He was good but like his,
he didn't get back until he went to

771
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,190
Thailand and he started taking like
really tough fights.

772
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,810
Even training for him since he was like
13.

773
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,400
I think.
So think of that.

774
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,580
That's only six years.
Yeah.

775
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,660
So it's very rare that a guy will be
like 34 and then at when he's 39,

776
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:10,130
he's this motherfucker have
motherfuckers like he is,

777
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,830
you know what I mean?
Like what is it?

778
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:14,160
Is it.
I've always wondered like is it that

779
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:19,161
life just you burden yourself down with
responsibility and information and just

780
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,540
life itself.
Relationships,

781
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,950
bills,
bullshit.

782
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,860
Just dress existential angst.
The,

783
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,260
the fucking,
the grave calling know there's,

784
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,140
there's so many variables that you can't
really like pinpointed on one specific

785
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:36,040
thing.
You know,

786
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,920
everybody in everybody's variables are
going to be different.

787
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,621
You know,
we're all,

788
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:41,600
we all have different things to overcome
and deal with.

789
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,570
Just because I've used yours is maybe
they're not that difficult.

790
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,860
Like you don't know.
I don't know.

791
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:46,910
Everything he's dealing with.

792
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,460
He doesn't know everything I'm dealing
with or have had to overcome.

793
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
But,
but if I sat there and listened to his

794
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:52,011
story,
I'm like,

795
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,450
Jeez.
Like I wouldn't want to do that.

796
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm sure it's a crazy story.
But like when you go back and watch Mike

797
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,390
Tyson when he was 19,
you go see Mike Tyson,

798
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:01,490
like hitting the bag with teddy atlas
when he's 19.

799
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,330
Just go Jesus fucking Christ.
How does anybody get that good.

800
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,900
Like what,
what happens from 13 to 19?

801
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,770
Like what,
how is it possible that someone can just

802
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,720
reach that insane level and it seems
that it happens primarily when someone's

803
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,340
really young.

804
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,880
Yeah,
I mean I started when I was 10 and when

805
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:23,920
I was 16.
And you can ask Karen like I felt

806
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:24,790
invincible,
man.

807
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,920
Like I will,
I will take much.

808
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,311
Uh,
Kevin,

809
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:29,740
I will take any fight,
any it didn't matter,

810
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,680
you know?
Um,

811
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,100
I was 16.
I couldn't fight as an adult yet because

812
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:36,490
I wasn't 18,
but we lied and said that I was 18.

813
00:33:36,491 --> 00:33:38,710
And so because I ran out of people to
fight,

814
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,570
I ran,
I ran out of juniors to fight.

815
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,990
So from 16 to 18 I was technically an
adult and I was just taking this many

816
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,890
fights at anywhere from 132 pounds to
147.

817
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,150
Any fight that I could possibly take us,
I needed to get the experience and

818
00:33:55,151 --> 00:33:57,880
that's what I wanted to do.
I wanted to dedicate my life to it.

819
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,300
Do you think that that's possible for an
older person?

820
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:03,270
Like so like Kevin,
you are.

821
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,330
You obviously you were still young.
You're 23 mean you're saying you were

822
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,050
older,
but a lot of people listening to God 23,

823
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,060
you're still like a baby.
You can still learn a lot.

824
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:18,010
I mean relatively though for the sport.
Kevin was old and I'll have people come

825
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:18,721
up to me like,
oh,

826
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:19,481
I'm too old.
I'm like,

827
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:20,970
how old are you?
Like 19.

828
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,843
I'm like,
dude,

829
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,640
like I didn't even start till I was 23.
What are you talking about?

830
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,830
Because people just.
I think people just like to view things

831
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,970
as an excuse,
like,

832
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:29,530
oh,
I can't do it because x,

833
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,050
but we all have something that we can
point to and be like,

834
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:34,210
well I can't make it because of this.
Of course,

835
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,400
but.
But there's people who have had that and

836
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:39,700
worse and have made it so what excuse
could you possibly have?

837
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,760
You are a very technical fighter,
you're very technical guy.

838
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,790
Do you think that maybe there is some
benefit in having started a little bit

839
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:50,200
later,
be 100 percent that,

840
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,950
that I think that's a huge thing,
um,

841
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,830
that just because you start,
you know,

842
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,080
when you start,
when you're a kid,

843
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,570
there's so much of it,
like you're just doing it and for

844
00:34:58,571 --> 00:34:59,950
whatever,
but put once you,

845
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,813
you've,
you've

846
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,490
matured in a certain way.
Like,

847
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,710
like I started to for only one reason.
I want to be the best I can be on,

848
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:09,570
you know,
I'm,

849
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm developed enough physically and
mentally to apply these things to,

850
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:15,034
to,
to,

851
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,590
to what I'm trying to apply them to be
the best fighter I can.

852
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:19,210
Whereas yeah,
when you're younger you're still,

853
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,180
you're still growing and learning and
developing physically as well as

854
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,390
mentally.
Yeah,

855
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,410
like when I,
when I,

856
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,330
my first fight I was 11,
10,

857
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,550
like I didn't know why,
what I was doing there,

858
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:31,100
I just knew like I,
I kinda liked it but I like,

859
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,240
I didn't have like a purpose to it.
Like I just really enjoyed training at

860
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:36,260
the time.
It was exciting.

861
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,020
It was exciting.
You

862
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,850
want to try them out?
Yeah,

863
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,130
I did,
but I wasn't like,

864
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:42,590
Oh,
I'm going to be the best in the world

865
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,030
right now.
Like they didn't come to like 14,

866
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,590
15 when I was like,
I really,

867
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,890
I really want to dedicate my life to
know where you were living in America at

868
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:50,760
the time.
No,

869
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I was in Peru.
When did you come to America?

870
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,340
When I was 13.
When you were 13 years,

871
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,310
did you go straight to CSA?
Was it the first year?

872
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,070
I started a for text and then when I was
16.

873
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,030
Oh,
2008.

874
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:04,380
I met Karen and ever since we've been
inseparable would you guys have a very

875
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:09,381
unique gem and it's one of the most
important things for a young fighter is

876
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,760
to find the right environment to
develop.

877
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,260
And we were talking about that earlier
today.

878
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:18,261
Like you can get unlucky and find a bad
coach in a bad gym and you get all

879
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:21,870
tangled up with that person
psychologically and they become family

880
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,020
and then you know,
you're,

881
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:27,030
you're kind of fucked and it's a very
difficult break for a lot of fighters to

882
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:27,480
make.

883
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,990
Yeah,
man.

884
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,610
I mean,
like I honestly,

885
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,250
I,
I've been truly blessed since I started

886
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,910
all the way to now because I started
with Rodrigo then I was with son of

887
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,920
somebody who Kevin still trains with
this day to this day a little bit.

888
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,140
But you know,
I've,

889
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,730
I've always had really good coaching
since I started.

890
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,470
Yeah.
I think another,

891
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:50,280
another unfortunate thing is just
because somebody is a great coach

892
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:52,320
doesn't mean they're great for you.
You know,

893
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:54,060
so.
So sometimes you'll see these people

894
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:57,750
like leave their camps and go to this
really high level coach who's had a lot

895
00:36:57,751 --> 00:37:00,300
of success with certain individuals,
but that doesn't mean they're going to

896
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,490
be great for you.
So I try to always tell people,

897
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,860
you have to find what works best for
you.

898
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,080
Whether it's a coach,
whether it's your diet,

899
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:11,430
whether it's your training scheduled.
What works for me won't always work for

900
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:11,790
you.

901
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,510
You got to find what's best for you and
that doesn't always necessarily mean I

902
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,300
need this great coach because you guys
might just clash.

903
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,880
You know what I'm saying?
Like like coaches and fighting.

904
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:23,910
It's very much about.
It's like having a relationship with

905
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:24,800
somebody.
Oh,

906
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,260
with another person.
Like you just might clash together,

907
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,980
not work and it's also how will you just
said is super important about finding

908
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:34,410
that winning formula,
whether it's training,

909
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:36,480
whether it's Diet,
whether it's coaching,

910
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,440
and then Jim partners like,
I know you guys are fantastic partners.

911
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,310
You guys work together really well.
I've watched a lot of videos that you

912
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:44,760
guys trained together.
I mean,

913
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:48,930
how critical is that to have someone
who's an elite fighter that trains with

914
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:52,110
you on a daily basis and it's on the
most most important things.

915
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,270
They're there.
There's so many factors that go into

916
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,350
building a fighter.

917
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,200
It's not just one thing.
You know what I mean?

918
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,690
And,
and that one thing needs to constantly

919
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:05,490
be adjusted because the way I trained
today isn't how I trained even a year

920
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,970
ago.
You continually need to be hopping back

921
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,390
and forth on this line of too much in
too little of one point.

922
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,860
The difference between how you train
today versus how you turn a year ago.

923
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,770
Uh,
I'd say I'd say the older I get,

924
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:21,090
the more it's a mental approach kind of
thing.

925
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:21,750
You know,
like,

926
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,750
like my technique in the [inaudible]
isn't going to be altered that much at

927
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:28,860
this stage.
But the way that I apply them,

928
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,260
the way I go about them,
the way I think about them,

929
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,530
it very much is gonna Change.
You know,

930
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:35,980
at a certain stage you,
it's like you

931
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,830
have all these weapons to use.
It's just a matter of which ones you use

932
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:40,420
at which time,
at which speed,

933
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,500
in the way that you apply them,
where in the beginning you're just

934
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:48,070
trying to do things well and you're
trying to almost put all these tools in

935
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:49,180
the toolbox,
you know,

936
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,360
as your career develops,
but better at a certain stage.

937
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:55,450
Not to say I'm not adding more is that I
have all these tools.

938
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:57,940
I need to figure out how,
which ones work best for me and which

939
00:38:57,941 --> 00:39:00,760
ones work worked for me at which time
against which opponent,

940
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,140
which,
which venue,

941
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,820
which sport.
You know what I mean?

942
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,740
There's,
there's so many things that you can play

943
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:08,040
with and adjust and good and bad.
I,

944
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,350
that was a huge thing I struggled with
after my knee surgery was like almost

945
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:15,100
forgot how to fight as myself,
you know what I mean?

946
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:15,940
Because it was like,
okay,

947
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:17,910
here's all your weapons.
Pick up which ones you want to use.

948
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,790
I'm like,
I don't know.

949
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,990
I don't remember which ones I used in,
how I put them together and it took me a

950
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,010
series of fights to find myself again as
a fighter in the ring.

951
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,050
How much time did you take off because
you need surgery?

952
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,210
Nine weeks.
Nine months.

953
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,300
In one week.
That was between fights.

954
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,750
That was between the day I blew my knee
out and the day I got back in the ring.

955
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,450
Um.
You had acl reconstruction?

956
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,910
Yeah.
Throw me an ACO.

957
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,930
Which way did they do it?
A cadaver?

958
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,280
Yeah,
I had that way.

959
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,350
I just talked to a friend of mine,
she had it done.

960
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,200
They took a,
she was an Austrian,

961
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:52,900
a skiing accident and they took some
meat out of her calf I've never even

962
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:54,800
heard of before and reconstructed it,

963
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,960
you know,
there was those options,

964
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,110
but I was like,
I don't want to take anything else out

965
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:02,150
of myself into it might weaken that
thing.

966
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:04,640
Like I got enough to deal with now I
can't weekend something else.

967
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:08,060
So for me it was an in and talking to
other athletes that have had it,

968
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:11,180
it just,
it seemed like the better approach for

969
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:11,700
me and,
and,

970
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,370
and it has worked best for me.

971
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,230
It worked best for me too.
I had both knees reconstructed.

972
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:18,570
I had my left one done with the Patella
tendon graft with.

973
00:40:18,571 --> 00:40:21,870
They take a big chunk on your patella
tendon with a piece of bone from your

974
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:24,690
Shin and a piece of bone from your knee
and it's fine.

975
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:27,960
But that was like a year before it felt
good again.

976
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,740
But the right knee,
like I have zero problems with it.

977
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:35,100
And I was training.
I was doing Jujitsu again in six months.

978
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,310
So it was,
it,

979
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,810
it,
it,

980
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,780
and it was with no pain,
like it never really,

981
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:41,670
like,
there was no consequences for the

982
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:44,460
injury.
Whereas the left one still like where

983
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:48,000
they cut the bone out.
Like if I kneel down on a hardwood

984
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,170
floor,
I could still feel it.

985
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,960
It's um,
there's a lot of people that are scared

986
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:53,790
of cadavers though.
They're scared her

987
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,060
weird.
Like for me,

988
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:58,940
it was more of a mentally a strange
thing,

989
00:40:58,941 --> 00:40:59,774
you know,
to,

990
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,170
to have something of someone else's who
passed away and you know,

991
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,050
that was a,
just a weird,

992
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,960
very weird thing mentally to,
to kind of deal with.

993
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:09,890
And you know how it works,
right?

994
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,390
It's just a scaffolding.
No,

995
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,191
no,
not really.

996
00:41:13,191 --> 00:41:13,820
No.

997
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,561
Um,
what it is,

998
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,000
is they take,
usually they use,

999
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,830
um,
an achilles tendon because it's much

1000
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:20,080
stronger.
It's actually 150 percent,

1001
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,630
I believe,
stronger than the original acl.

1002
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,240
They take that Achilles tendon,
they put it in place,

1003
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:30,241
and then your body re proliferates that
tendon with its own tissue.

1004
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,680
Right?
So that tendon is not

1005
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,010
there anymore.
Your body fills it up with cells because

1006
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:42,011
they reattached the blood supply and as
your body starts it starts using that to

1007
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:45,620
regenerate tissue so it puts your own
cells,

1008
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,160
but in the form of a much larger tendon,
it's really kind of interesting.

1009
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,780
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1010
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,550
Yeah.
My my right leg,

1011
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,130
which is the one that blew off,
feels so much better than my left one

1012
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:59,750
does like stronger and looks thick and
they use a thick ass fucking tent.

1013
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:04,370
I mean we have a shitty design.
The human body that acl in particular,

1014
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,020
I'm just going to get everything
replaced.

1015
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,270
Well,
as soon as you figure out heal hooks,

1016
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,400
as soon as people figured out he looks,
he just realized like,

1017
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,620
oh my God,
my knee is like so stupid.

1018
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,200
Who figured that?
Who designed this?

1019
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,210
Because all you have to do is get that
heel here and like,

1020
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,680
pop just pops off.

1021
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,030
It's terrible.
You know?

1022
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,760
I mean,
it happens all the time and Jujitsu guys

1023
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:25,100
get their knees blown apart.
That gives me nightmares,

1024
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:25,940
man.
Just watching that.

1025
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,380
Yeah.
Well it's.

1026
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,920
I mean some guys get nightmares.
They watch you guys kick each other.

1027
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,280
I know I've blown up a couple acl is
kicking people.

1028
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,020
Yeah,
I'm sure didn't feel good,

1029
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,150
man.
God,

1030
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,640
was it a planted leg?
Is that what it is?

1031
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,710
Most of the Times.
A couple of tough guys.

1032
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:44,820
I tried to come in the gym,
go on and on.

1033
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,010
I'm like,
alright man,

1034
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,430
let's go.
Oh,

1035
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,030
that's why.
That's why a lot of people like learning

1036
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:55,031
how to absorb and take up a punch or a
kick is just as if not more important

1037
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,500
than than throwing it because you're
going to get hit.

1038
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,820
Sure.
No matter how good you are,

1039
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:01,190
you're going to get hit and if you don't
know how to take that and absorb it and

1040
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:04,040
minimize the damage,
you're going to have a lot of really

1041
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,150
serious injuries and,
and,

1042
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:09,680
and unfortunately so much of what we do
is applied to the offensive side of it.

1043
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,300
Hitting people,
you know,

1044
00:43:11,301 --> 00:43:14,060
and those kinds of things.
But if you don't have to take a punch

1045
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:15,860
and it wasn't,
obviously you don't want to just be

1046
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:16,251
like,
all right,

1047
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:17,690
I want to learn how to take punches
really good.

1048
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,210
But.
But that's,

1049
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,560
that's a skill that you need to have.
Yeah.

1050
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:24,320
There's a subtlety to it that I think is
lost on a lot of people.

1051
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:27,740
The ability to just move with something
and the way I was trying to tell people

1052
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:30,080
like,
have someone hold their hand up and you

1053
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:31,910
punch it.
Then have them move the hand just a

1054
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:32,744
little bit.
Yeah.

1055
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,060
And you still try to punch you,
but it doesn't feel good.

1056
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:35,590
Yeah.
You know,

1057
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,370
like it feels good when they meet you.
That's like,

1058
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,500
people hold pads and they slap you with
the,

1059
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,510
you know,
it feels good,

1060
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:42,710
you hit it.
But if,

1061
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,840
if,
if someone just kind of pulls away a

1062
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:48,020
little bit,
so much of the punch is diminished.

1063
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,610
Yeah.
No,

1064
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:52,070
it really just drain the life out of you
because you feel like you're giving

1065
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:53,140
someone all you have in,
in,

1066
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,620
in your mind,
you're hitting them.

1067
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,950
But nothing is happening.
And we have the winning a big shield,

1068
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:02,930
you know,
and can we use it sometimes to train us

1069
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,700
like towards the end of camp and it's
awful because you're giving everything,

1070
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:10,400
you got to this thing and it's just so
fat.

1071
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

1072
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,420
There's nothing coming back at you.
So there's no,

1073
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:18,140
there's no reverb off your head.
It's like you're punching into a cloud

1074
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:19,340
and like,
oh gosh,

1075
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,170
well I've seen some gyms that have that
crazy 300 pound bag that just sits on

1076
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:25,820
the ground.
It doesn't even swing,

1077
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,830
it just sits there and you wind up
kicking that thing.

1078
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,910
And I'm always like,
man,

1079
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,950
I don't know like that.
Is that good?

1080
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,240
Is it good to,
doesn't.

1081
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,110
It's another one of those things where
it's just a piece of the puzzle,

1082
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:38,990
like it's good to,
to uh,

1083
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,710
develop your power and stuff.
But yeah,

1084
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,500
if that's all you're doing,
when something's moving around on you,

1085
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:46,890
it's giving you very different looks.
It's kind of like a,

1086
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,920
um,
like we do a lot of technical sparring,

1087
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,240
you know,
with no gear on and stuff.

1088
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:54,750
If you have these all these pads on and
you have this false sense of security

1089
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:58,260
and then you get in there with someone
who's got nothing on and it's just like

1090
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,770
feels,
feels almost your elbows and you're

1091
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:06,120
messing your feet up because you haven't
learned how to place things correctly

1092
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,600
and where they need to go and where you,
where you maximize their damage and

1093
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:12,240
minimize yours.
Is there a point of diminishing returns

1094
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:15,450
though with a heavy bag were like a 300
pound bag and you're kicking it.

1095
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,990
It's probably not developing your power
as much as even maybe a hundred 50 pound

1096
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:20,370
bag.
Would that make sense?

1097
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:24,210
I guess it just depends on what it is
you're trying to do and work on it and

1098
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:25,830
improve.
You know what I mean?

1099
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,630
When you're hitting one of those
immobile bags,

1100
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,940
what?
What would you concentrate on?

1101
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:33,290
Primarily?
Power power is just dig in.

1102
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:36,240
Just digging in as hard as you can
because I know that's going to be right

1103
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:39,420
there.
I can close my eyes and hit this as hard

1104
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:40,580
as I want to.
I don't know.

1105
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,070
I don't have to worry so much about like
my balance and my speed,

1106
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,560
I can just blindly do this kind of
thing.

1107
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,560
So just dig in and work on just the
explosion.

1108
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,460
Yeah,
but is there,

1109
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:53,960
isn't there some benefit in the bag
having some sort of a give so the year

1110
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,220
without pushing,
without a doubt.

1111
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,900
Like I mean a lot of times when I'm
working on a speed and movement and

1112
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,180
stuff,
I don't really just try to like crack

1113
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:04,500
the back.
I'm just like touching his soul,

1114
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:08,430
work on a much lighter bag and I'm just
trying to work on my ankles and in the

1115
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:11,010
bag moving and targeting and those kinds
of things.

1116
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,440
But again,
it's very specific in what I'm trying to

1117
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:16,180
do and there's not just one way to do
this and.

1118
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,350
And then I think that's another thing
that not a lot of people think about or

1119
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:20,970
or applies.
She was like,

1120
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,950
Oh,
I'm just gonna hit pads on.

1121
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,700
I'm just going to hit the bag,
but why you're doing it?

1122
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,070
What it is it that you're working on?
What are you trying to develop?

1123
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,620
Because there's so many aspects to this,
you know what I mean?

1124
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,230
And it's something,
but it's another thing that you just

1125
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:32,310
figure out over time.

1126
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,830
Do you remember when the water bags
were?

1127
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,700
Big Deal?
Yeah.

1128
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,840
It's like a big thing with those.
Like there was a thick foam outer layer.

1129
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:41,930
Then there was water in it that didn't
really catch on.

1130
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,630
We have an aqua bag.
It's a little different.

1131
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,640
It's a little thicker.
Like rubber.

1132
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,660
It's good for power punching.
I like it.

1133
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,660
I like it.
I like it.

1134
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,080
Throw elbows because he gives in on you
a little bit.

1135
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,000
I mean,
not that it's very,

1136
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:59,030
it's very well put together so it
doesn't like given as much as you think

1137
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,070
it what?
Yeah.

1138
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,670
What,
what are the misconceptions that you

1139
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:06,390
think maybe even traditional martial
artists might have when they're looking

1140
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:07,860
at Moitai?
Like what?

1141
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,670
Maybe that it's really one dimensional.
You know,

1142
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:14,530
I think,
I think we have this kind of like,

1143
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,010
we think about it like,
like almost like the uh,

1144
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,510
uh,
who was in a street fighter a real right

1145
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,280
now the uh,
saget old school,

1146
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,870
the old school,
a boxer.

1147
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,220
When you think

1148
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,250
about Muay Thai fighters,
just being this mindless,

1149
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,300
like we're just gonna throw power at
each other and just stand there and we

1150
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:40,270
have no thought process behind anything
and yeah,

1151
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:42,070
there's definitely fighters who do that
and,

1152
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:44,470
and,
and maybe to an outside observer that

1153
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,490
they might not see all the small details
and the complexity of the things they're

1154
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,400
doing.
Just because I'm standing in front of

1155
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,110
you,
not moving doesn't mean there's no

1156
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:54,820
thought behind it.
You know what I mean?

1157
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:59,680
It's like I've learned how to use those
head movement and footwork things on a

1158
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:02,500
very,
very small scale,

1159
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,120
you know.
So to me I am.

1160
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:06,130
I am doing a lot of movement and
footwork but,

1161
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:09,490
but to an outside person and I'm just
standing there mindlessly just winging

1162
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:10,810
shots at each other,
you know,

1163
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:12,250
so you don't see,
you don't see the,

1164
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:15,430
all the complexity that goes into it
where I can watch it and view those

1165
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:17,790
things very well.
Is it one of those things where you're,

1166
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,640
you're watching like say,
um,

1167
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,080
if you're watching an mma fight for
example,

1168
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:24,870
where a lot of times when you're
watching mma you're watching someone

1169
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:28,680
who's pretty good at a bunch of
different things but not maybe

1170
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,610
technically proficient at any of those
things and you,

1171
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:33,510
you,
you're seeing a lot of that where guys

1172
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:37,110
are just kind of standing in front of
each other and almost playing Moitai

1173
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:37,861
right?
Yeah,

1174
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:38,480
yeah,
yeah,

1175
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,370
definitely.
And as a high level fighter,

1176
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,390
do you guys watch mma and go fucking,

1177
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,120
oh my God.
I mean honestly,

1178
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,520
especially the,
it hits me really hard sometimes.

1179
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:54,180
Like when we're like Friday night lion
fights where they're alive and then

1180
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,830
you're like watching whatever you have c
or whatever,

1181
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,370
whatever the car there is on and you're
like on TV.

1182
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:00,420
And he's like,
oh my God,

1183
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,873
you know,
so.

1184
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,530
But there is,
there is some good strikers in mma.

1185
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:06,360
Sure.
There's guys like Barboza,

1186
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:09,130
there's some pretty high level guys,
but Joanna,

1187
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,800
sure,
sure.

1188
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,930
Valentina Shevchenko.
Yeah.

1189
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:16,970
But there's also a lot of different
elements they have to think about take

1190
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,520
downs and it's definitely,
like we were talking about earlier,

1191
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,230
you got to implement,
you know,

1192
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:26,240
what works for you and mma.
So what,

1193
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,650
what works for you might not work for
somebody else either.

1194
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:30,660
So it's,
it's really,

1195
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:32,430
it's really tough.
It's different now.

1196
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:34,440
You at 24 years old,

1197
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,930
you've already have a very successful
Moitai career.

1198
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,460
Have you thought about doing her name?
Man?

1199
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,210
So actually I just signed a deal with
belt or oh,

1200
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,290
I'm sure I'm making the transition.
Uh,

1201
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,710
not only with mma I wanted to do Moitai
keep doing more tie with lion fight,

1202
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:51,320
but that has,
that,

1203
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,710
that hasn't worked out so good.
So I'm going to be doing kickboxing and

1204
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,570
MMA.
So that worked out.

1205
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,460
Uh,
I,

1206
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,210
they're,
they're going the different route so

1207
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,650
it's not gonna work to promote and then
they fight or you know,

1208
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,590
through what lion fight.
So Scott Coker is gonna,

1209
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,050
you know,
has signed me in that.

1210
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,000
He's going to be able to work both
angles with me.

1211
00:50:12,001 --> 00:50:13,500
So that's gonna.
That's gonna be really good.

1212
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,220
Now you're a guy who clenches a lot and
uh,

1213
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:20,090
that'd be great thing for mma,
but what about for kickboxing?

1214
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,300
Are you going to do bell to our
kickboxing as well because I know that

1215
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,190
bell towards doing a really interesting
thing right now.

1216
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:28,940
They're kind of combining kickboxing and
mma on the same card.

1217
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,870
Has Anybody talked to them about
abandoning the kickboxing aspect and

1218
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:34,070
just doing moy,
Tai,

1219
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,850
I don't know.
I'm,

1220
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:41,290
I've said some things to Scott about it
and I think they're just trying to

1221
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:45,280
establish that a,
that kickboxing side of their,

1222
00:50:45,281 --> 00:50:47,050
uh,
of their cards and uh,

1223
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,570
hopefully one day he might bring in some
fights,

1224
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:51,404
maybe,
maybe,

1225
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,740
maybe once,
once the belt or kickboxing can be more

1226
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:57,800
of a standalone promotion.
I think,

1227
00:50:57,801 --> 00:51:00,920
uh,
it might be able to venture out into

1228
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,910
mixing the cars and maybe have some
fights on the owner corridor in between

1229
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,410
fights as well.
So,

1230
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:08,420
but,
but for now I think they're just trying

1231
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:09,280
to,
to,

1232
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:11,410
to start out and do things right and
build up that,

1233
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:14,420
that portion of it and having those
mixed cards where it's the uh,

1234
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,280
built or in my me and the bill or
kickboxing,

1235
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,040
which has worked out very well and I
think people really enjoy it because

1236
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:19,874
we're,
we're,

1237
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,790
we're having both,
both fights on the card,

1238
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:24,320
but eventually I'd be nice if,
uh,

1239
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,710
the kickboxing can stand alone and then
kind of developed from there.

1240
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,100
Yeah.
Just seems to me that it doesn't make

1241
00:51:30,101 --> 00:51:32,500
any sense to eliminate elbows and knees
just,

1242
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:34,520
it seemed kind of crazy.
But again,

1243
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,800
it's,
it's a different sport,

1244
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,870
you know what I mean?
It is,

1245
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,010
but it's striking,
you know what I mean?

1246
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:41,170
I mean if you're,
if you're kicking like,

1247
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,770
why aren't you elbowing?
Like why don't you need.

1248
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,730
I can say I agree with you.
It's a beautiful.

1249
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,540
I mean I think the more complex striking
gets,

1250
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,790
the more beautiful it is.
I mean,

1251
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:56,200
the more variables that exist.
Like when I watch a guy like Sanchez,

1252
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,770
perfect example,
because he's such a wild guy to watch,

1253
00:51:59,771 --> 00:52:04,771
he's so he fights his own very
particular style and he's very light on

1254
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:07,570
his feet as a lot of switching of the
feet.

1255
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:09,230
A lot of kicks that you,
you,

1256
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,090
you don't know where they're going to
think they're going low and they kind of

1257
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,700
come straight up and go,
hi Kevin Fault.

1258
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,590
Sanjay,
did you,

1259
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,433
when you play,

1260
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,200
when was that standard?
11,

1261
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,420
2012.
Eleven or 12?

1262
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,010
I forget.
August 2012.

1263
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,500
It was right before you moved to CSA?
Yeah,

1264
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,800
no,
I thought Saginaw before

1265
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,790
the CSA.
How was that?

1266
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,150
How was fighting?
I like,

1267
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,160
I'll watch it,
man.

1268
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,460
It was,
it was amazing.

1269
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,740
So it was a great fight.
It's hard to describe what it was like,

1270
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:40,540
man,
it was.

1271
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,960
I was so dialed in physically and
mentally that,

1272
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,690
that I've looked back on it.
I'm like,

1273
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:50,410
Jeez Dude.
Like I can't believe I.

1274
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,590
That was me.
And they're doing that.

1275
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:54,410
Oh,
it was just so like I was in another

1276
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,600
mental plane,
you know what I mean?

1277
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:58,350
Like just everything was just firing

1278
00:52:59,050 --> 00:52:59,801
right here.
Okay.

1279
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,540
We'll watch a little bit of this while
we're talking.

1280
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,170
We have it in the.
I want you to see.

1281
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:09,100
I want you to see looks after the fight.
So Cecil people's as a referee.

1282
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,640
Yeah.
He kinda did it.

1283
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,220
Oh yeah.
Who saw that comment?

1284
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,040
Did he do that thing where he lifts his
knee up and does the karate thing at the

1285
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,120
beginning?
I got to watch that.

1286
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,970
That shit's hilarious.
How did he become the person to see

1287
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,730
people's is a very nice guy.
I will say that.

1288
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,440
I want to be a nice.
I want to see this high.

1289
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,460
Ah,
there it goes.

1290
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,160
The take that he does

1291
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,990
that weird,
neat thing that he does,

1292
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,371
but yeah,
Sanchez,

1293
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:33,300
one of those guys like you.
He doesn't fight like a traditional Thai

1294
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,520
fighter.
He's the best fighter of all time.

1295
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,480
Arguably.
You know,

1296
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,270
he's certainly one of them.
He's,

1297
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,280
he uses so many things from different,
different arts and taekwondo and Moy

1298
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:48,860
Thai and kickboxing and yeah,
he's got really sneaky left leg to man

1299
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:52,770
that left leg.
It literally comes straight up and it's

1300
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,750
one that you have no idea where it's
going.

1301
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:56,670
It might be a front kick,
leg kick,

1302
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:57,630
body kick,
head kick.

1303
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,330
Like I knew he was going to kick me.
I just didn't aware of the hell it was

1304
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:02,670
going well.
He's really good.

1305
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,150
If you ever seen Lawrence tensions
breakdowns of Muay Thai fights,

1306
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,680
um,
what is,

1307
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,850
what is the name of them on Youtube?
I don't know what to see if you can

1308
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,180
find.

1309
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,280
I've seen one guys deal with a lot of
breakdowns in there.

1310
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:15,500
Really.
Well I don't know if it's the same.

1311
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,640
I think Lawrence just does them under
his name,

1312
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,650
but he's a,
he's really,

1313
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:22,920
really smart guy and really,
really aware of,

1314
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,230
uh,
of more Thai and really aware of the

1315
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:27,870
complexities.
And he did a breakdown on San shy and

1316
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:32,190
one of the things Sanchez setting up
high kicks and the way he,

1317
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,330
he'll sort of test you with some other
kicks and then he's got that really

1318
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:41,070
unusual way of throwing his kicks to
where they literally come straight up.

1319
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:41,904
Yeah,
there it is.

1320
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,190
But let's go back to that fight.
I want to go back to that fight.

1321
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:47,490
I don't want you to change some of that
guys and that's Kinda what we were

1322
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:51,750
speaking of earlier in the gym is it's
just that one thing he's kicked butt,

1323
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:55,590
but he has so many ways and variables to
set that up as far as speed.

1324
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,320
And so he uses all these things to test
you and once he figures that out,

1325
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:01,430
you're done.
And that's how he's able to destroy

1326
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,480
basically everyone at every level of the
sport because he has so many answers to

1327
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,310
that one question.
You beat him,

1328
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:09,960
didn't you know,
it was a split decision,

1329
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:11,610
split decision.
Why did I feel it?

1330
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,430
Well,
Kieran saying you want some people think

1331
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,200
that if I didn't get dropped but not
really dropped one.

1332
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,680
Oh,
Cecil commercials got you with a bad

1333
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,750
count.
Well,

1334
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,840
it was a split,
right?

1335
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:25,810
Yeah,
it was.

1336
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,080
Or uh,
uh,

1337
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,240
it's,
it's kind of ironic having cecil peoples

1338
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:33,270
be the referee in a fight.
It's a Moitai fight because he's a

1339
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:36,330
people's is one of those guys that says
that you can't stop people with leg

1340
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:39,000
kicks.
That was like one of his quotes.

1341
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,850
It was one of the bad decisions that
went down where he's like,

1342
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,930
leg kicks,
don't stop.

1343
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,490
Fights went,
oh my God,

1344
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,870
were you allowed?
The thing about fighting is you have

1345
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:53,070
people regulating these arts who have no
idea about them whatsoever.

1346
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,470
Well,
that's a giant issue with the UFC.

1347
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,920
That's a giant issue with judging and I
would imagine with tie it's even more

1348
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:02,010
difficult to find competent judges and
you can't,

1349
00:56:02,011 --> 00:56:04,230
you're getting,
you're getting boxing judges doing,

1350
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:10,350
you're getting karate guys doing a
Moitai and these are the people who are

1351
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:14,130
basically controlling the outcomes of
these fights if there's no stoppage.

1352
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,420
Right?
And it,

1353
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:16,254
it,
it's,

1354
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,600
it's crazy.
It's crazy in Thailand.

1355
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:19,590
Wow.
That fucking sneaky.

1356
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:22,020
Left leg.
He's got man in Thailand.

1357
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,003
Um,
what,

1358
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,620
how do they approach the clench because
you've seen in this fight like cecil is

1359
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:29,380
breaking guys up almost immediately.
As soon as you tie up.

1360
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,273
It's,
it's,

1361
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:32,650
it's such a complex thing to,
you know,

1362
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,060
it's not just the fact.

1363
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,980
Are these guys working well?
What are they doing?

1364
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:40,150
If you don't have a deep understanding
of it,

1365
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,190
you're not going to be able to to a
judge it or ref it accurately.

1366
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,900
You know what I mean?
So it's not just a matter of time is

1367
00:56:47,901 --> 00:56:50,260
it's not a matter of people moving
around.

1368
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,690
It's what are they doing?
Are they affecting each other?

1369
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:56,260
Are they hurting each other or they just
mindlessly like lifting your legs up to

1370
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:58,900
appear to stay busy.
Where if somebody doesn't know that me

1371
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,270
just lifting my leg up and be like,
oh well he's staying busy,

1372
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,590
he's active,
why are they breaking them up?

1373
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:06,670
But I wasn't really doing anything.
I was just screwing like a lot of times

1374
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:07,160
they're like,
oh,

1375
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,010
I'm going to let you guys work in the
clench,

1376
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,140
but they just let like you're not doing
anything and they just let it go and not

1377
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,140
not knowing when people are stalling out
or trying to buy time or just just

1378
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:20,140
moving their legs for the sake of
looking like they're actually needing

1379
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:24,190
each other and the and these judges in
these reps don't have an understanding

1380
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:24,610
of that.

1381
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,170
That's an issue with ground fighting as
well.

1382
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,800
It's an issue of course the UFC,
when certain fights go to the ground,

1383
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,800
whether it's judging or whether it's
even refereeing like some guys are

1384
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:35,620
setting up certain positions and then
the referee will come up and stand them

1385
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,450
up like that is crazy.
Like this guys,

1386
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,920
they're working,
they're fighting,

1387
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:42,200
but I think that in a clinch as well,
there's a lot of times they separate

1388
00:57:42,201 --> 00:57:46,870
guides from the clench when two guys,
if they're clenching up and they're both

1389
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,940
working to try to establish dominant
positions,

1390
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,440
one is eventually maybe going to win
that dominant position battle and that's

1391
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:56,140
part of the grind.
Part of the grind is a guy in posing

1392
00:57:56,141 --> 00:58:00,310
your skillset as well as conditioning
all the above on his opponent and if you

1393
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,740
just get in and separate that because
you want to watch a knockout.

1394
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,380
Yeah,
you're kind of diluting the sport and

1395
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,030
it's like,
I don't care how much,

1396
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:09,760
how many fights you've watched or how
many courses you've taken.

1397
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:12,670
If you haven't done this before,
if you've never fought before,

1398
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,940
you don't know what's going on in there
and that's.

1399
00:58:14,941 --> 00:58:16,240
That's the problem.
You have people,

1400
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,910
even if they've been in the sport for a
very long time,

1401
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,890
it may have been around it for a very
long time.

1402
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:23,200
If you've never fought,
at least at some level,

1403
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:27,370
you don't know what's going on and yeah,
you're seeing it,

1404
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,820
you're seeing it,
but you really don't know what you're

1405
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:32,800
saying right there.
You don't know how much of it is

1406
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:36,850
actually effective and how much of it
the guys that actually just absorbing

1407
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:38,580
things and blocking things.
It's very.

1408
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,200
It's,
it's so complex and I think that's one

1409
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:44,080
of the things that gets lost about
fighting arts in general,

1410
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:48,400
but more tie in particular is all of the
complexity that goes on.

1411
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,460
Like what you were saying that a lot of
people that misconception is that they

1412
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,700
look at it.
Two guys that are just bruisers yeah,

1413
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,040
but what I'm watching here,
I'm watching all this complex

1414
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:01,630
interactions of footwork kicks and
elbows and knees and clenching and and

1415
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:06,050
knowing when to time things and dealing
with a really high level opponent is

1416
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:10,570
very crafty and he's.
He's sort of calculating all this stuff

1417
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:11,810
in his head as well.
Yeah.

1418
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:13,810
Well that's,
that's kind of the problem with,

1419
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,660
there's only so much you can learn from
a book.

1420
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:21,100
There's only so much you can learn from
watching videos until you apply those

1421
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,040
things.
It's like

1422
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,460
street smart and book smart.
If you don't have that street knowledge,

1423
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:26,870
your,
your,

1424
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,690
your,
your knowledge is very limited,

1425
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:30,933
you know,
and,

1426
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:34,040
and so I don't care how much you think,
you know,

1427
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:38,300
if you've never applied it even or even
giving them just like sparring.

1428
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:40,070
I don't care how much you spar,
you know,

1429
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,950
until you get in there,
you don't know what it's like

1430
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:44,913
management.
Yeah.

1431
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,970
You know,
I think that's the case with a lot of

1432
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:49,640
things.
I mean I even joke about golf because I

1433
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:54,080
think golf is stupid,
but I get the people that do it a lot to

1434
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:57,140
them it must be complex,
like they must understand all the

1435
00:59:57,141 --> 01:00:00,980
different aspects of it.
And I say that about playing pool to

1436
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:02,000
that.
It's an art form.

1437
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,800
It's only interesting for people to do
it and I think that's one of the things

1438
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:09,050
that's cool about going to like what I'm
seeing here,

1439
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:13,280
this is a small arena or small crowd who
you mean it looks like there's only like

1440
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:17,780
four or 500 people and that whole place
and so that kind of shit.

1441
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,560
I mean you look here,
here's you world championship caliber

1442
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:23,900
fighter fighting another world
championship caliber fighter.

1443
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:27,470
Both guys in their prime and you
fighting in front of 50 people,

1444
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,790
you know,
and,

1445
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,450
but it's been a couple of books and it's
super complex.

1446
01:00:32,451 --> 01:00:34,220
I mean what's going on is,
you know,

1447
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:38,030
this exchange,
the interactions and I think one of the

1448
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:41,930
things about having guys like Lawrence
Kenshin putting out these videos and a

1449
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,990
lot of other people that have done these
tremendous breakdown videos with Moitai

1450
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,220
is that people that are fans mean even
if they don't train themselves,

1451
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:52,790
even if they just watch it,
they can see things now that it may be

1452
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:56,210
perhaps they wouldn't have seen before.
And then appreciate what these athletes

1453
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:58,150
are doing.
Like there's a lot of people that watch

1454
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,200
football.
They can't fucking play football at all,

1455
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,970
but they can enjoy it and I think that
you're seeing that in this,

1456
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,120
you know,
and watching the flow.

1457
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,380
There's a.
is that where he called a knockdown?

1458
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,080
Yeah.
So he got right back up.

1459
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,750
I mean why was that a knock down?
Because he got kicked in the head,

1460
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,250
shoulder carrying.
If you want to talk,

1461
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:20,690
you've got to talk on the mic.
Okay.

1462
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:21,350
Look,
motherfucker,

1463
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,720
I told you you were going to be on the
show.

1464
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,800
Why don't you.
Why don't you get a Goddamn chair?

1465
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,840
Because Jamie was still on the
microphone.

1466
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,733
No,
this is the one thing.

1467
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,880
This one thing that's lost that hasn't
been discussed is because Kevin doesn't

1468
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:34,520
talk about it,
is to this day and how long ago was this

1469
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:36,590
fight for years.
Four years ago.

1470
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:39,230
To this day,
this is the only time that the WBC has

1471
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:42,530
ever sanctioned at diamond belt fight
for a Moitai fight.

1472
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,660
Was that mean?
What it means is that in boxing,

1473
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:47,330
when you have two great fighters from
two different weight classes that meet

1474
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,790
at a catch weight,
they make it a diamond belt fight and

1475
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:53,600
they put a real diamonds on the belt and
it's the epitome of the WBC title.

1476
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,550
Okay?
That's the only time in the history of

1477
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:59,080
the sport.
The WBC made a diamond belt for a Moitai

1478
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,580
fight.
That's what a watershed moment this

1479
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:05,330
fight was for Moitai in America.
Okay.

1480
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,223
Go sit down.

1481
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,260
I get it.
No frill.

1482
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:18,890
And also just important because it's
rare that you see guys of this caliber

1483
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,070
going

1484
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,890
at it like this.
I mean,

1485
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,350
it's super exciting.
Fight.

1486
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,100
Great fight.
I'm worse than shy fighting.

1487
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:29,060
Now he's starting to do mma isn't,
you know,

1488
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:34,030
he was calling out conor mcgregor for a
second just to get a little like they're

1489
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,240
talking about stuff and doing stuff,
but,

1490
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,670
but will,
it actually helped me when they talked

1491
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:42,240
about Macau do on mma for a long time
because he was trained in a little bit,

1492
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:44,040
but.
But is he going to actually do it?

1493
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,300
I don't.
I don't know.

1494
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,500
Yeah.
Well,

1495
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:49,260
what's interesting about Thai fighters
is that they're really good in the

1496
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:51,160
clinch and taking people down,
you know,

1497
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,100
and really good at avoiding being taken.
Yeah.

1498
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:57,000
Well a lot of people don't understand
how much similarities there are when it

1499
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:59,870
comes to the clench and wrestling and
judo and you know,

1500
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,960
I went and trained with the black veil
judo team in San Jose before I had a

1501
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:07,500
shoot boxing fight and they just could
not believe that I could hang with their

1502
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:08,640
high level black belts.

1503
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,360
And I'm like,
well,

1504
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,270
it's all this kind of similar stuff.
Like yeah,

1505
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:13,770
your setups might be a little bit
different,

1506
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:17,460
but all the fundamentals that go into
more Thai clinch are very similar to a,

1507
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,640
to judo.
It's just a difference of things you can

1508
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:21,590
and cannot do.
But,

1509
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:24,360
but the base in the fundamentals of it
go across the board.

1510
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,100
Yeah.
You see that a lot with,

1511
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,590
uh,
with sweeps and trips and like you see

1512
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:33,180
some really interesting trips and sweeps
in Moitai that are really very,

1513
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:37,460
very technical about manipulating guys.
Setting them up in one direction and

1514
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:39,600
changing direction on them and throwing
them to the ground.

1515
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,860
It's really cool stuff to see.
A lot of the stuff in the tight clench

1516
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:46,920
is very similar to a greco wrestling,
you know,

1517
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:50,230
a all upper body a throws and stuff
because we can't shoot in,

1518
01:03:50,231 --> 01:03:54,090
but everything we can do is above the
waist and in those kind of manipulations

1519
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:54,900
and off balancing.

1520
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,470
And that's why like,
like if I just do Greco wrestling,

1521
01:03:58,471 --> 01:03:59,910
I,
I do pretty well,

1522
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:03,120
you know,
and people are often surprised by how

1523
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:06,810
well my wrestling or Jujitsu is if I'm
just messing around and doing it because

1524
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,540
there's so many similarities.
Right.

1525
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,570
You know what I mean?
That makes sense.

1526
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,060
Now when you're watching fights in
Thailand,

1527
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:17,090
they judge the clench is a very
important part of the fight.

1528
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,360
Whereas a lot of times,
and in America when you're looking at

1529
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,040
the clench,
we think of it the same way.

1530
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:26,160
We look at a clench in boxing.
You guys are just stalling.

1531
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,700
Yeah.
It's,

1532
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,980
it's a way to dominate and,
and show your strength and ability over

1533
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:33,480
over your opponent.
You know,

1534
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:38,220
and if you can control someone and
damage them and then in laying these

1535
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:41,430
clean knees on someone,
it's showing your superiority over them,

1536
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,810
you know?

1537
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,220
But again,
like you said here,

1538
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,580
we don't have a good understanding of
it.

1539
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:48,660
So yeah,
we just viewed as,

1540
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:49,200
oh,
they're just,

1541
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,850
they're just,
they're just resting or they're just,

1542
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,580
they're not doing anything in there.
You know what I'm saying?

1543
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,210
No.
When guys take guys down and Moy,

1544
01:04:55,211 --> 01:04:56,640
Tai,
like how much does that count?

1545
01:04:56,641 --> 01:04:59,700
Like how are they scoring fights
obviously knockdowns or critical,

1546
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,300
but if you dump a guy a bunch of times,
meaning you sweep them and trip,

1547
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:06,360
I'm going to slam on his back.
How much of a factor is that an in a

1548
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,730
fight?
It should be a huge factor if they're

1549
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:11,550
scoring these correctly because again,
showing your,

1550
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,380
your balance,
your dominancy are in your control is,

1551
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:16,350
is one of the most important thing.
So,

1552
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:18,920
so being able to throw someone in the
ground and,

1553
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:20,010
and,
and you're,

1554
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,750
you're still just standing there is,
is huge.

1555
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:26,500
A huge scoring thing is how you're doing
it important because like what if you

1556
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:29,200
just get double under hooks and just
crush them towards you and just send

1557
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:31,360
them over and um,
you know,

1558
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:35,380
it's,
there's so many factors that go into it.

1559
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:37,080
And again,
if you have a,

1560
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:42,340
a judge or a ref that basically has a
very elementary understanding of this

1561
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:47,170
sport,
they can't give you an accurate,

1562
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,250
a judge of this or,
or an accurate reading of this because

1563
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:51,730
they,
they,

1564
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:54,760
they're not.
So their knowledge isn't so deep.

1565
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,140
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,

1566
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:57,670
it's like,
like me watching a,

1567
01:05:57,671 --> 01:06:00,640
a Jujitsu match and trying to score it.
Like I can kind kindness,

1568
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:03,010
score it,
but I wouldn't be able to if I spent my

1569
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:05,050
life in the sport,
you know what I'm saying,

1570
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:08,780
what I'm kind of getting out.
It was style points by five points,

1571
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,400
you know what I'm saying?

1572
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,160
And cool something dope,
you know,

1573
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,810
beautiful.
Sweep them on his bad side,

1574
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,930
somebody and seamlessly do it and make
it look like nothing as opposed to I'm

1575
01:06:17,931 --> 01:06:20,170
like falling on top of them and we both
lose their balance.

1576
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:20,910
Of course,
yeah,

1577
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:21,581
yeah,
yeah.

1578
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:23,890
Without a doubt.
That's a weird thing to like objectively

1579
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:24,820
call though,
isn't it?

1580
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

1581
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,170
Judging is such a strange thing.
It's tough man.

1582
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,690
And I'll be the first one to admit that.
It's a very complicated thing.

1583
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:32,640
You know,
I've just fighting my,

1584
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:33,800
I don't know,
like,

1585
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:36,310
yeah,
you know it and then I'm thinking,

1586
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,220
trying to think of it from the mentality
of someone that's never done this before

1587
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,800
or only taken like a course.
I'm like,

1588
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:42,880
how can,
how can you do that?

1589
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:47,290
I have a hard time doing it and I've.
I've spent 15 years doing this sport and

1590
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,110
you had a controversial loss in lion
fight.

1591
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,350
I fought,
I fought crump.

1592
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:56,110
Ed Tie with over a couple of hundred
fights.

1593
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:59,170
And that was your first loss.
That was my first loss that I didn't

1594
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:02,320
think you lost that fight.
They overturn it.

1595
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,160
They did?
Yeah.

1596
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,840
For Ya.
18 never happened.

1597
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:07,990
So 18 judges from all around the world
or something like that.

1598
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,060
I can do that.
I,

1599
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,560
I guess I honestly,
I didn't care.

1600
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:14,830
I still don't because I had a great
fight and I put everything on the line.

1601
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:15,850
I,
I did.

1602
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,900
I thought I did the best that I could.
You know,

1603
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:19,720
there's,
I mean there's some things that I think

1604
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:21,670
I could've done better.
Like it was a great fight,

1605
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,290
no doubt about it.
It was a close fight,

1606
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,910
no doubt about it.
But I thought you won.

1607
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,690
And I watched and I was like,
hmm.

1608
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:27,610
And then,
uh,

1609
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,700
I remember Pat Miletich and Michael
Chevelle,

1610
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,660
we're both saying they thought it was a
bad decision.

1611
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,690
Yeah.
And so then I'll watch it again and I

1612
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:33,911
said,
well,

1613
01:07:33,911 --> 01:07:35,680
I'm going to watch it one more time.
And I was like,

1614
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:37,420
man,
I think that was a bad decision.

1615
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,370
And I remember now that you're saying
that,

1616
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:40,900
I remember hearing that it was
overturned.

1617
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:44,290
I think maybe they brought it up on a
broadcast afterwards,

1618
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,820
during your next wide.
Is that what happened?

1619
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,460
Is that when they brought it up again,
maybe I'm making this up.

1620
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,320
It was the next event.
It wasn't fighting on it,

1621
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:53,170
but they broke up and I was on the
broadcast.

1622
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,360
Is that rare that they overturn a fight?
Yeah,

1623
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:56,194
I mean,
yeah,

1624
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,860
I'm pretty sure it's rare.
Yeah.

1625
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,310
I never,
I never seen it.

1626
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,550
I mean it's such a tough thing,
especially especially in a fight that

1627
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:06,010
wasn't like so lopsided,
you know,

1628
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,800
relatively close.
It's just a matter of how,

1629
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,480
how you're viewing it,
what you're,

1630
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,910
what you're giving more or less credit
too.

1631
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:15,860
And it seems like a simple thing to do
on the outside.

1632
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,070
Well

1633
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,110
he hit him more or while he rocked him
more,

1634
01:08:18,111 --> 01:08:20,030
but,
but there's so many levels to.

1635
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:21,770
This is Kinda like we were talking about
earlier,

1636
01:08:21,771 --> 01:08:23,450
it's not,
it's not an on or off thing,

1637
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:24,930
it's a dial,
you know what I mean?

1638
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:30,080
In and unless you're in there,
you can't even tell how much impact this

1639
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:32,440
is doing it,
how much it's really hurting you,

1640
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,830
you know,
from the outset.

1641
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:36,560
And that's why it's very important.
It is especially like for the ties to

1642
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:40,670
have that stone cold face where
nothing's affecting them because you

1643
01:08:40,671 --> 01:08:43,070
don't really know this person.
Could you just get crushed with a,

1644
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:45,570
with a right hand and they didn't even
move or,

1645
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:48,380
or show anything.
It makes it very difficult for for a

1646
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:50,150
judge to say,
well,

1647
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:53,570
this punch should get this,
this amount of credit or this much

1648
01:08:53,571 --> 01:08:56,910
credit as opposed to just that pit or
pet stuff so you know it.

1649
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,550
It's very difficult thing to do and to
do correctly and accurately because

1650
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:04,460
there's so many variables and so many
things you're seeing or not seeing.

1651
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:06,950
Depending on where you're sitting,
how you're viewing it.

1652
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:08,090
If you're in there,
if you're out there,

1653
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:09,980
if you're on the left side of learning
the right side of the ring,

1654
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,250
there's there's.
It's too complex a thing to.

1655
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,890
That's why I could never say anything
about a decision.

1656
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:16,724
It's like,
well,

1657
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:21,130
it's such a difficult thing to do.
Unless it was so one sided.

1658
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,390
You're like,
how in any way could you view this?

1659
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:25,400
But if,
if any fight is relatively close,

1660
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:29,660
I don't see how you can complain really
about the decision because no matter

1661
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:31,550
what,
sometimes you're going to be on one side

1662
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,830
of it and sometimes you're going to be
on the other side of it where maybe you

1663
01:09:33,831 --> 01:09:36,080
didn't win and they gave it to you.
You know?

1664
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:39,150
One of the things I love about talking
to fighters and especially about putting

1665
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:44,151
on a podcast is I think it gives people
the impression of fighters that like a

1666
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:49,350
similar impression to what I have.
I think a lot of people have the wrong

1667
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,240
impression.
They have this impression that fighters

1668
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:52,110
are all,
hey,

1669
01:09:52,111 --> 01:09:55,050
I'm a bad motherfucker.
I'm out there to fuck the world and kick

1670
01:09:55,051 --> 01:09:58,200
ass and.
But really the very best fighters are

1671
01:09:58,201 --> 01:10:02,100
almost all very intelligent and very
complex people.

1672
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:05,880
And what,
what you do when you fight,

1673
01:10:05,881 --> 01:10:10,320
when you compete is a,
is like a representative of your focus.

1674
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:14,760
It's like all the stuff that you had to
do to get to that moment,

1675
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:18,240
especially after you've done it a few
times and you're aware of all the

1676
01:10:18,241 --> 01:10:22,530
demands and you've really risen to the
occasion on more than one time and you

1677
01:10:22,531 --> 01:10:24,600
realize like all the variables that are
involved in it,

1678
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,920
you know,
it's cool talking to you guys and,

1679
01:10:27,921 --> 01:10:29,880
and,
and going over that stuff.

1680
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:31,740
And it's sort of.
I think there's a lot of people that are

1681
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:34,330
listening right now and like,
these fucking guys are sharp like this.

1682
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,690
There's a lot going on to this that I
didn't think.

1683
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,320
It's a thing that you don't.
You don't see the whole thing.

1684
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,420
Yeah,
ever,

1685
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,660
ever.
It's like when it comes to fighting,

1686
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:49,661
you're viewing 15 minutes of something
someone put their entire life into.

1687
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:56,110
You judge them on this very small
fraction of a moment in their life in

1688
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,000
that.
That's why fighting is one of the,

1689
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:04,001
I think more stressful sporting things
you can do because we put so much into

1690
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:09,080
such a little thing that is viewed in
this is the only thing we're judged on

1691
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:12,260
were not judged by how hard we train or
how much do we kill ourselves or the

1692
01:11:12,261 --> 01:11:14,160
things we've had overcome and the gym.
It's like

1693
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:19,230
what you did on that day in that moment
and how how you came across it means

1694
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,150
everything.
You know what I mean?

1695
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,000
Whereas other things,
there's other other ways around it and

1696
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:24,451
you're like,
yeah,

1697
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:25,860
you could have a bad day,
but tomorrow you're going to have a

1698
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:26,520
better day.
It's like,

1699
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,130
this is the day.
This is the only day and not the only

1700
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:31,490
day.
Fifteen minutes or half an hour,

1701
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,440
whatever it might be,
football that where there is a season

1702
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,880
and okay,
we'll make it up the next game.

1703
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:38,280
You know,
people don't really truly understand how

1704
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:42,060
much goes into this and how much we put
and that's all I can say.

1705
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,810
Every bad judges and bad reps.
it's like it's life and death.

1706
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:49,410
Like you are literally have my life in
your hands and you are incompetent.

1707
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,600
I mean even the UFC you lose three
times.

1708
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:53,460
You get cut,
so sometimes twice.

1709
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:54,270
Yeah,
exactly.

1710
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:55,950
So yeah,
I mean depending upon,

1711
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,380
there's a lot of variables that are
involved in that,

1712
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:03,210
but what fighting is to me the way I
always like to describe it as high level

1713
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:05,790
problem solving with dire physical
consequences.

1714
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:09,600
And so when you watch someone who's
absolutely sensational at it,

1715
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:11,430
you know,
like when you watch an Anderson Silva in

1716
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:14,820
his prime,
you see some guy who's just figured out

1717
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:17,730
a way through this puzzle and it's
really extraordinary way.

1718
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,580
And there's,
there's a beauty to that that I,

1719
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:23,910
I,
I think the people that really love and

1720
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:27,330
appreciate fighting can,
can understand it and can feel it and

1721
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:32,331
see it and I always want to try to find
a way to express that to other people.

1722
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:33,870
Like,
do you see what I'm seeing?

1723
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,970
No,
because if you saw what I'm seeing,

1724
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:37,740
you'd be fucking freaking out just like
I am.

1725
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,730
Yeah,
it's tough man.

1726
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:40,080
Uh,
especially like he said,

1727
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:44,440
if you don't have experience in that
sport or I've trained or fought in

1728
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,720
yourself like you,
you can't appreciate it as much as

1729
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:51,840
someone who hasn't.
It's just viewing it from the outside,

1730
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:52,681
you know,
like,

1731
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,240
you know,
what goes into this,

1732
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:55,350
you know,
how hard it is,

1733
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:57,150
you know,
what it feels like to get hit and you

1734
01:12:57,151 --> 01:12:58,380
know,
what it feels like to,

1735
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:02,220
to have to come these obstacles and
training and preparing yourself for a

1736
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:04,370
fight.
It's not just this surface thing like

1737
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:06,360
two guys in the ring in there fighting
and silver and it's done.

1738
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,950
When you saw there was some recent event
that uh,

1739
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:11,010
what,
what was it,

1740
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:15,570
NBC or whoever was putting it into,
they spent hundreds of millions of

1741
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:18,480
dollars on boxing.
They had a few events,

1742
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:21,990
they'd lost a shitload of money and then
it's done.

1743
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,990
It's out and it falls apart.
I've watched something like that.

1744
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,000
I'm like,
God damn,

1745
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:31,680
they put so much effort into this.
If they just put together a fucking

1746
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:36,681
stacked Moitai card just to stacked one
and just let people know.

1747
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,840
I put it on prime time tv just like they
do with Fox,

1748
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,840
with the UFC.
I feel like you can't miss.

1749
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,070
I really do.
I just,

1750
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:46,620
I feel like it's one of those things
where the product is there,

1751
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,090
the talent is there,
the,

1752
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:51,480
the fighters were established.
There's so much high level talent.

1753
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,070
I mean when anybody watches Moitai even
in on tv live,

1754
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:58,800
especially if they're like,
they just fall in love with it as,

1755
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,810
oh my God.
Like we're where has,

1756
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,490
where's the spin?
Yeah.

1757
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,650
Where's this bed's here.
Yeah.

1758
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:07,220
If you're a fan of exciting shit,
you should be a fan of time.

1759
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,093
Definitely.
It's,

1760
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:10,230
it's.
As we said earlier,

1761
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,070
there's so many variables that go into

1762
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,390
it and it's just a matter of the Dole,
those right pieces coming together at

1763
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:19,210
the right time.
It's just like when the UFC really

1764
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:22,960
started blowing up with Stephan Bonner
and forrest griffin fight,

1765
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:26,230
like how long had it been around,
how many amazing fights had been going

1766
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:29,110
on and it was just that the right time,
the right people,

1767
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:32,170
the right thing blew it up.

1768
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,570
Yeah,
it was 12 years old.

1769
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,300
A lot of people forget he was 12 years
old when that happened.

1770
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,460
How long did they struggle?
How much money they lose,

1771
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:42,440
like how many promotions came and went.
And it's the same thing with Moitai.

1772
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:46,740
It's just you don't know what the right
combination and the right time is and

1773
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,460
hopefully one day those all those pieces
will come together.

1774
01:14:50,461 --> 01:14:51,360
Uh,
if,

1775
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,700
if not,
we're just doing the best we can with

1776
01:14:53,701 --> 01:14:54,534
what we have.

1777
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,350
Now,
you as a fighter and you're 34 now,

1778
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:59,270
36,
36.

1779
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,710
This is,
you know,

1780
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:02,840
when you're an athlete,
this is the,

1781
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:03,650
you know,
there's a,

1782
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:07,700
there's a window Sanchez 36 to where
there's a window,

1783
01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:11,840
there's like what your body is going to
function at the level that it's at right

1784
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,720
now for a certain amount of time and not
much more.

1785
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,950
Yeah.
Does that,

1786
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,690
does that fuck with you,
does that,

1787
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,680
um,
when you think about them,

1788
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:20,880
you know?
Um,

1789
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,530
after,
uh,

1790
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,010
after I had two really bad losses,
I lost my,

1791
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:28,010
lost my world title,
um,

1792
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,740
by stoppage and then I got knocked out
the next fight I was really struggling

1793
01:15:31,741 --> 01:15:34,290
mentally with,
with a lot of things like,

1794
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:35,760
I don't know,
can I still do this?

1795
01:15:35,761 --> 01:15:37,260
You know,
I'm too old to do this.

1796
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,570
And,
and I had all these questions in my head

1797
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,210
and what I realized,
what Karen helped me realize right

1798
01:15:42,211 --> 01:15:45,900
before I won that a wmc title in Peru
was,

1799
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,730
I've had all these questions from day
one.

1800
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:50,130
I'm too old to do this.
I don't know if I'm good enough,

1801
01:15:50,131 --> 01:15:52,860
you know,
but my answer has always been the same.

1802
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,240
Do I love to do this?
Yes.

1803
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:56,070
Can I physically still do this?
Yes.

1804
01:15:56,071 --> 01:15:58,830
Well then I'm going to do the best that
I can and give this everything that I

1805
01:15:58,831 --> 01:16:01,200
have and that's not going to change.
I don't know if that's going to be over

1806
01:16:01,201 --> 01:16:02,280
today,
tomorrow,

1807
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:04,200
10 years from now.
You know what I mean?

1808
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:08,970
So as long as I'm physically able to do
this and as long as I still have a love

1809
01:16:08,971 --> 01:16:10,590
and a passion for this,
I'm going to keep doing it.

1810
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,820
I've been.
People have been asking me how long I'm

1811
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:14,910
going to keep doing this for over 10
years.

1812
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,550
The old expression that a fighter lives
and dies in their own mind,

1813
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,890
you know,
and when you're at your best,

1814
01:16:20,891 --> 01:16:22,540
like you were telling me when you were
16,

1815
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,870
you felt invincible.
You know,

1816
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:25,130
when you're,
when you're,

1817
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:28,450
you're confident,
you can pull the trigger faster,

1818
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:33,220
you have more belief in yourself.
When you're saying I'm just gonna do my

1819
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,820
best.
Like when you,

1820
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,390
when is there a thing in your head that
says,

1821
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:40,030
man,
I wish I was in that state where I felt

1822
01:16:40,031 --> 01:16:42,310
invincible or does that not matter?

1823
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:45,830
Yes and no.
It definitely does.

1824
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:49,460
Um,
there there's a point where thinking

1825
01:16:49,461 --> 01:16:51,410
you're invincible,
it can backfire.

1826
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:52,030
Sure.
You know,

1827
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:53,760
like,
think about like Tyson course,

1828
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:54,590
he was invincible,

1829
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:57,530
but as soon as he lost that he,
it was,

1830
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:01,250
he couldn't overcome it.
Have you ever heard Tyson talk about

1831
01:17:01,251 --> 01:17:04,340
what was going through his mind when he
was walking to the ring?

1832
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:06,470
Have you ever heard them do that thing?
Have you heard him do it?

1833
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:09,900
I fucking love that.
I've,

1834
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,830
I've played that like 30.
You got it to that shit up because

1835
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:18,330
there's something about that where it's
so raw and it's honest.

1836
01:17:18,331 --> 01:17:20,350
It's after he had been retired and you
know,

1837
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:24,980
and he had just kind of reflecting about
all the nerves that would go through his

1838
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:29,981
mind and all the Geckos.
Most guys are pretty much intimidated.

1839
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,490
They lost the fight before flooding got
hit.

1840
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:37,670
Most Guy I knew I needed.
I'm just going to doug.

1841
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:40,280
I mean these guys know how to beat these
guys psychologically.

1842
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,020
He finally got in the ring with them.

1843
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,560
As soon as I come into come into the
ring,

1844
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,980
I'm globe.
No stop.

1845
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:51,270
That's not true.
While I'm in the dressing room five

1846
01:17:51,271 --> 01:17:53,910
minutes before I come out,
my gloves are laced up,

1847
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,360
breaking my gloves down,
and I'm pushing the lever on the back of

1848
01:17:57,361 --> 01:17:59,370
my break in the middle of the glove for
my knuckle,

1849
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:01,290
compares to the lack of feel,
my knuckle,

1850
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:05,360
Pearson against the tight leather gloves
on the everlast boxing gloves.

1851
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,740
I come around,
I have supreme confidence and I'm scared

1852
01:18:07,741 --> 01:18:09,950
to death.
I'm totally afraid.

1853
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:11,880
I'm afraid of Evec name,
afraid of losing.

1854
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:14,870
I'm afraid of being humiliated,
but I'm totally confident.

1855
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:15,800
Close.
I get to ring.

1856
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:18,950
The more confidence I get closer,
more confidence.

1857
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,490
I get closer,
more confidence.

1858
01:18:20,491 --> 01:18:23,580
I get all during my training.
I've been afraid of this man.

1859
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:25,530
I thought this man may be capable of
beating me.

1860
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,360
I've dreamed up from beaten me but that
well,

1861
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,290
but I always stayed afraid of him,
but it was close.

1862
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,720
I get to her and I'm more confident.
Once I'm in the ring,

1863
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,580
I'm a God.
No one can beat me.

1864
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,900
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1865
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:50,210
I fucking love that.
I love that because that what you were

1866
01:18:50,211 --> 01:18:54,320
saying about all that work for that one
moment,

1867
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,020
there's so much mind fucking going on.
Yeah.

1868
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:58,160
Yeah.
So mental,

1869
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:02,180
you know the thing like people don't
understand how mental fighting is and

1870
01:19:02,181 --> 01:19:06,200
they can't really appreciate it.
So the hardest part is after you have

1871
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:10,670
been broken to still get that back and
that's a very tough thing to do.

1872
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:12,800
So if you've gone undefeated for so
long,

1873
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:15,950
you finally lose a lot.
A lot of people come back from that or

1874
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,420
not.
A lot of people get back to the level

1875
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:19,320
they were like,
I was very fortunate I've lost,

1876
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:23,900
but I got crushed my first fight and I
was able to overcome that and to build

1877
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:27,920
myself up and it helped motivate me.
And then I went onto win like 18 fights

1878
01:19:27,921 --> 01:19:31,790
in a row after that.
But I saw a lot of people go undefeated

1879
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:34,580
for 10,
15 fights and they just had this amazing

1880
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:36,140
confidence in.
You're just crushing everybody.

1881
01:19:36,141 --> 01:19:40,520
But they were also not learning a lot of
very important lessons that they needed

1882
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:43,040
to learn.
And so once they finally lost it almost

1883
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:46,980
destroyed them and it's very tough to
get so far in a game in,

1884
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:51,230
in miss all these lessons you need to
learn until you're forced to learn them,

1885
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,460
you know what I mean?
So if you can find a way to learn them

1886
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:58,040
as well,
but nothing teaches as good as losing.

1887
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:01,090
There's also losing,
I mean you see it in mma,

1888
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,040
like fighters from different
disciplines,

1889
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:06,670
maybe grapplers or something like that
that loose by Kao for the first time.

1890
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,040
It's a different animal.

1891
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,910
And that's what happened with me when I
was saying well my two losses,

1892
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:15,510
like I'd never been.
I'd never been stopped while I've been

1893
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:18,360
stopped but not,
I'm not really hurt or really knocked

1894
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:21,450
out before.
And that happened twice in a row and it

1895
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:23,700
was,
it was really devastating for me

1896
01:20:23,701 --> 01:20:28,700
mentally to have that happen and to try
to get back to where I was prior to that

1897
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:30,060
and not just skill,
skill,

1898
01:20:30,061 --> 01:20:30,781
skill,
skill,

1899
01:20:30,781 --> 01:20:32,910
but that there's so many other factors
that go into this.

1900
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,110
You know,
the way,

1901
01:20:34,111 --> 01:20:37,890
the way that you think about things.
It's like being confident but not over

1902
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:38,910
confident,
being confident,

1903
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:39,810
but in,
in,

1904
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:43,460
in understanding the danger in that and
the things that'll keep you sharp with

1905
01:20:43,461 --> 01:20:44,520
that,
without affecting you.

1906
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:47,430
It's like,
it's like finding that balance between

1907
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:50,430
being too nervous and too calm.
Like I've always been more way,

1908
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:52,530
way to calm,
like for my own good.

1909
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:56,070
And I always kind of a calm dude most of
the time you're very mellow,

1910
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:56,561
you know,
in,

1911
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:57,960
in,
in the beginning I thought everybody was

1912
01:20:57,961 --> 01:21:00,750
like that and then I would see people
getting ready for fights in there

1913
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:03,090
freaking out and like they can't walk
into like I can't do this,

1914
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,020
I can't do this,
I can't do this.

1915
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:05,940
And these like high level people who
have been watching.

1916
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:06,731
I'm like,
Jeez man.

1917
01:21:06,731 --> 01:21:07,441
I'm like,
what's wrong with you?

1918
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:10,080
Like I don't understand,
like what are you so nervous about your

1919
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:11,640
amazing,
you know what I mean?

1920
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:12,141
But,
but I,

1921
01:21:12,141 --> 01:21:15,630
I one day I realized like being to calm
isn't so great either because I went

1922
01:21:15,631 --> 01:21:17,910
into a fight once and like I had no
adrenaline going.

1923
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,300
I'm like half asleep like alright man.
And you know about the fight and this

1924
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:23,340
guy is coming across the room from him.

1925
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,150
I'm like,
alright,

1926
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:26,100
alright,
this guy's going to try to kill you.

1927
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:30,000
You'd better get going.
And it took me a whole round to get back

1928
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:34,140
into that mental zone.
You've seen that cowboys for one video

1929
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:37,170
of his breakdown walking a walk into the
cage?

1930
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,130
No,
it's similar.

1931
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:43,810
It's just like that where it's about his
mental approach process and everything.

1932
01:21:44,221 --> 01:21:45,750
It's really good.
It's really good.

1933
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:50,850
He's changed a lot of stuff in his game
and he's a God that has survived some

1934
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:53,250
pretty devastating losses and come back
even better.

1935
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,473
And that's,
that's.

1936
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,020
That is really the key because no matter
eventually if you do this long enough,

1937
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:02,550
those things are gonna happen.
And how if and how you overcome them is

1938
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:06,150
really what shows you what it would a
great fighter is because anybody that

1939
01:22:06,151 --> 01:22:09,030
goes around winning and just crushing
people's as great and all.

1940
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:12,750
But if you haven't ever come back from
total destruction,

1941
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,360
you're not a complete fighter.
I don't feel.

1942
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,510
Yeah.
Cowboy since the dos Anjos fight is the

1943
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:22,590
best version of cowboy ever.
And before that it was the pettis fight,

1944
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:24,350
the pettis fight,
he got stopped and Pettis fight came

1945
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,193
back.
And better than that,

1946
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:28,380
he's a guy that is like the adversity
builds him.

1947
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,740
It makes him stronger.
Have you ever worked with a

1948
01:22:31,741 --> 01:22:33,990
psychological coach or a.
yeah,

1949
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:34,920
a little bit,
uh,

1950
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,750
back when I was in Vegas,
um,

1951
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:37,521
you know,
I,

1952
01:22:37,521 --> 01:22:41,340
I originally started doing it because I
broke my hand three times in a year and

1953
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:44,370
I was always so hesitant to throw it and
I'm like,

1954
01:22:44,371 --> 01:22:46,590
I don't.
It's always painful and stuff.

1955
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:49,290
I know it was just like mentally
couldn't get over it.

1956
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:51,450
And I started a,
um,

1957
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,670
that was how it originally started
working with a mental coach with like a

1958
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,600
sort of hypnosis but,
but more just the getting,

1959
01:22:57,601 --> 01:22:59,780
uh,
getting to that right mind frame,

1960
01:22:59,781 --> 01:23:03,260
like going into the ring.
And then I started going from there as

1961
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,010
like very specific things wanted to work
on

1962
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:11,020
because it's all about having that right
mentality when you get in there or when

1963
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:14,200
you're getting into training as opposed
to just going through the motions and

1964
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:16,150
you can get very.
Especially when he'd been doing this for

1965
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:18,430
so long,
you can get very comfortable in too

1966
01:23:18,431 --> 01:23:20,980
comfortable and that's one of the
problems I've had,

1967
01:23:20,981 --> 01:23:25,680
especially being so calm as I am,
it's very easy for me to just be like

1968
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:26,740
whatever,
you know,

1969
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,190
like we're just seeking out.
So you're,

1970
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,210
I'm sorry I could do it.
So like it's your mental coach would

1971
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,360
help you with your mindset for training
to prepare,

1972
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:36,010
training,
training as well as fighting,

1973
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:36,780
um,
you know,

1974
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,570
what kind of stuff did you work on?
Like,

1975
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,670
well,
like for training,

1976
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,800
just having that,
that,

1977
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:43,990
that,
that I'm like,

1978
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,790
I'm here for a purpose.
I'm here to,

1979
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:49,360
to very specifically build myself up,
get ready for this fight.

1980
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,010
I'm not just here,
I'm not here to work out.

1981
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:55,840
It's the difference between working out
and training and that's something like

1982
01:23:55,841 --> 01:23:59,420
you're very focused on the task at hand
and what,

1983
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:02,050
why are you doing this?
You're doing this to be the best in

1984
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:03,850
that.
And they're like,

1985
01:24:03,851 --> 01:24:06,610
you're getting ready for this date.
You need to give it all you have at this

1986
01:24:06,611 --> 01:24:09,910
very specific moment.
And instead of just casually getting

1987
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:10,810
through the training,
you know,

1988
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,190
you're doing everything you're supposed
to do,

1989
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:15,100
but if you're not mentally doing that as
well,

1990
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:17,230
when you get into the ring,
you're going to fight in that kind of

1991
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:20,950
laid back casual way as opposed to this
being this very,

1992
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,020
um,
you know,

1993
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,960
dangerous thing you're doing.
So you're training your,

1994
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,850
your specifically gearing up to an
event.

1995
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:30,760
Yeah.
Just dialing everything in,

1996
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:31,870
you know what I mean?
And,

1997
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,100
and,
you know,

1998
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,320
some people have more of that automatic
thing and they're like,

1999
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,910
when I'm in the gym,
I'm very focused,

2000
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:37,744
very determined.

2001
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,840
I'm doing this for this specific goal.
Um,

2002
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:43,660
but,
but after you've been doing this for so

2003
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:45,580
long,
it just becomes like that.

2004
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:48,700
I'll just get through it and do it.
And if you kind of almost get lazy,

2005
01:24:48,701 --> 01:24:51,610
mentally not,
I've never been lazy physically.

2006
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,860
Um,
you know,

2007
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,790
I've always pushed myself almost too
much.

2008
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:56,380
But uh,
mentally,

2009
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,870
uh,
there's been times when I've had those,

2010
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,450
those bad fights is one I've allowed
myself to slip.

2011
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,580
Whether that's because,
you know,

2012
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:06,100
I just,
the person I was fighting didn't,

2013
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,490
didn't give me enough a threat in my
mind or,

2014
01:25:09,491 --> 01:25:11,830
or are there was some things going on
outside the gym,

2015
01:25:11,831 --> 01:25:15,330
will have family and you know,
pets dying and things like that,

2016
01:25:15,331 --> 01:25:16,910
that,
that kind of baroque certain things to

2017
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,340
me down where I was still doing the
work,

2018
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:22,090
but mentally I was just broken.
Relationships are a big one with

2019
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:22,810
fighters,
right?

2020
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:23,740
Yeah.
You know,

2021
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:27,250
when you see fighters,
they get broken up relationship or they

2022
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:29,860
have a crazy girlfriend or something.
Like there's a lot of fighters,

2023
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:33,340
like there's a body mind used to work
with fighters and it would seem like

2024
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:37,150
every time his fighter was getting to
get ready to compete,

2025
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:41,790
his girlfriend would have some fucking
major drama and waking him up in the

2026
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:44,350
middle of the night screaming at him and
she just wanted to fight.

2027
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:48,010
Like as he was gearing up to a fight
because he was pulling away from her and

2028
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:50,920
concentrating more on what this event
was going to be.

2029
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,130
So she didn't like the fact that he was
spending less time paying attention to

2030
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:56,430
her.
So she started getting super needy and

2031
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,080
it would fuck them up every time.
It's tough man and that's why you'll see

2032
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:01,660
a lot of fighters leave and go away to
camps,

2033
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:03,170
you know,
things like boxers and stuff.

2034
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:04,004
They'll totally

2035
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:09,310
leave town and set up shop somewhere
else because you have to be so focused

2036
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:12,680
on this one thing.
I mean your life is on the line,

2037
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,770
even just in the gym or the life is on
the line.

2038
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,430
We don't really don't really think about
it or,

2039
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:17,320
or,
you know,

2040
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,080
put that much emphasis on it.
But every day we get in there we,

2041
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:24,260
we risk a injury and death,
which is obviously a severe case,

2042
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:26,400
but.
But it happens definitely in.

2043
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:30,830
If you're not taking the necessary
precautions and going into it with,

2044
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:33,860
with that right mentality,
then you can get hurt really bad.

2045
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,230
What were you going to survive?
I'm really lucky.

2046
01:26:36,231 --> 01:26:36,800
You know,
I,

2047
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,780
I,
I've been with Karen since I was 16,

2048
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:41,390
so he's not only been my coach but he's
also been my mic,

2049
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:43,400
my mind coach.
He knows me so well,

2050
01:26:43,401 --> 01:26:45,200
you know,
he knows as soon as we're going to hit

2051
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:46,640
pads,
if something's going on,

2052
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:48,950
you know,
or I'm in my head or anything he knows

2053
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,260
by just my,
my body movement.

2054
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,520
Uh,
he's like,

2055
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:53,563
Hey,
what's up?

2056
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:55,010
What's going on?
Let's get,

2057
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:56,210
let's get out of your head.
Come on.

2058
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:57,950
Are we going to,
we're going to work with what's the

2059
01:26:57,951 --> 01:26:58,431
deal?
You know,

2060
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:02,930
he,
he knows me so well that he knows he,

2061
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:07,280
he can see it a mile away even just by
my texting or whatever.

2062
01:27:07,281 --> 01:27:09,380
And you know,
I'm really lucky and that's why it's so

2063
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:13,340
important to have.
And it's not just a great coach or a

2064
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:15,470
great team,
it's having people around you who know

2065
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:19,490
you and they can see these elements that
maybe someone who you haven't been

2066
01:27:19,491 --> 01:27:22,790
around long enough wouldn't see before.
They might not pick up on just that very

2067
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:24,290
subtle vibe you have.
I'm like,

2068
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:25,970
dude,
like what the hell is going on with you?

2069
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,860
Even though you're doing everything
correctly,

2070
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:31,160
you're training really hard.
But like you can see that that thing

2071
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:33,030
that's off in their head and like,
that's what,

2072
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:35,720
what's great though,
to have people who you're friends with

2073
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:36,980
and had been around for a long time.

2074
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,360
It was like,
I can see that in him.

2075
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:40,310
He can see that in me and be like,
dude,

2076
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:41,144
like,
you know,

2077
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,580
like we're going to talk about something
like,

2078
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,050
what's going on with you.
Like maybe you could just ease back a

2079
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:46,850
little bit and you need to fix that
thing,

2080
01:27:46,851 --> 01:27:48,530
whatever.
And there's so many things that could

2081
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:49,820
be,
you know what I mean,

2082
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:52,700
whether it's you overthinking the fight
or whether there's something going on

2083
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,650
with someone outside the gym or you're
just,

2084
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:58,430
you've just got a bad vibe or it's in.
It's knowing when sometimes you got to

2085
01:27:58,431 --> 01:28:00,730
take a little step back and maybe not
push yourself so hard,

2086
01:28:00,731 --> 01:28:01,311
but be like,
hey man,

2087
01:28:01,311 --> 01:28:02,660
just ease back a little bit.
You know?

2088
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:06,490
It's all about finding that winning
combination,

2089
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:07,660
whether it's,
you know,

2090
01:28:07,661 --> 01:28:10,600
and obviously your mindset,
what you need to think about.

2091
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:11,860
It's probably going to be different than
gas.

2092
01:28:11,861 --> 01:28:12,694
Tom.
Totally different.

2093
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,730
Probably going to be different than,
you know,

2094
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,000
fill in the blank joe shillings mindset.
Everybody's got their own little weird

2095
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:22,990
tweaky shit that you have.
So I can't just tell him,

2096
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:23,890
oh,
just do this.

2097
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,830
Right?
So like people will ask me,

2098
01:28:26,831 --> 01:28:28,780
well,
what should I do mentally to prepare

2099
01:28:28,781 --> 01:28:29,380
myself?
I'm like,

2100
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,620
I have no idea.
I don't even know for myself what that

2101
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:36,850
is because it's a constant learning and
adjusting things can change every camp.

2102
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:38,020
You know,
people don't like that.

2103
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,970
People like to be able to show up at
work at 9:00.

2104
01:28:39,971 --> 01:28:41,800
There's a coffee break at 10:30,
you know,

2105
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:44,530
at noon they'd go to lunch at 5:00 PM,
they go home,

2106
01:28:44,531 --> 01:28:46,150
you know,
it was that easy.

2107
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,810
Don't you hate it?
You hate it.

2108
01:28:49,811 --> 01:28:50,611
I would hate it.
I would have.

2109
01:28:50,611 --> 01:28:51,191
I'm like,
why?

2110
01:28:51,191 --> 01:28:52,540
This is stupid.
Everybody can do this.

2111
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:55,600
Well,
when you've experienced life at 10,

2112
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:58,660
like you guys are living,
you know you're living this extremely

2113
01:28:58,720 --> 01:28:59,980
dangerous,
difficult,

2114
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,340
incredibly complex

2115
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,650
life.
I mean,

2116
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:08,580
the task of being a professional combat
sports athlete is one of the most

2117
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:12,300
difficult jobs that is available to a
person really is.

2118
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:14,430
It's incredibly difficult.
It's incredibly difficult.

2119
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:16,320
Psychologically.
It's not just difficult.

2120
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,350
It's difficult across the board.
There's not a single fucking thing

2121
01:29:19,351 --> 01:29:24,351
that's easy about it and to find the
right formula to make that thing work

2122
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:26,990
for you.
It's.

2123
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,220
It's so it's,
it's.

2124
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:30,330
There's so much involved.

2125
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:33,680
Yeah,
and you really have to pay attention to

2126
01:29:33,681 --> 01:29:38,540
it because the longer you let things
slide and don't realize like,

2127
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:40,370
hey,
you're letting this slip over here,

2128
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:42,620
the harder it is to make those
adjustments.

2129
01:29:42,621 --> 01:29:46,880
That's why I was saying like every day
it's you're on both sides of of too much

2130
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,040
or too little of of one thing or
another.

2131
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:51,170
Whether it's training,
whether it's your mental approach,

2132
01:29:51,171 --> 01:29:53,810
whether it's your diet,
whether it's how much or how little

2133
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:56,420
you're running there.
There's so many variables that go into

2134
01:29:56,421 --> 01:29:57,070
everything.

2135
01:29:57,070 --> 01:30:00,050
What about strength and conditioning?
You guys do follow a strength

2136
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,240
conditioning routines,
tons

2137
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,660
tons up.
What kind of stuff do you do?

2138
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:08,040
I can't even begin to describe this
stuff.

2139
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,460
You know,
a lot of sprints.

2140
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,170
It just really depends on.
It switches every day and again,

2141
01:30:14,171 --> 01:30:18,940
it's that thing where you have to find
what works best for you on that day,

2142
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,530
in that moment,
in that,

2143
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:23,210
in that certain fight,
it's like how,

2144
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:26,950
how much is too much or how little is
too little and your dial in.

2145
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,440
I didn't constantly and some because
sometimes you go to a bail,

2146
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:30,820
okay,
this is what I'm going to do tomorrow,

2147
01:30:30,821 --> 01:30:33,490
but then you wake up and you're like,
this is not going to work for me today,

2148
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:37,240
man.
Four or sometimes just doing it for the

2149
01:30:37,241 --> 01:30:38,200
sake of like,
yeah,

2150
01:30:38,201 --> 01:30:40,660
I'm going to do it because I don't feel
like I'm doing what I need to push

2151
01:30:40,661 --> 01:30:42,940
myself.
Sometimes that's not the wisest thing.

2152
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:46,570
Just pushing yourself for the sake of
pushing yourself isn't always the right

2153
01:30:46,571 --> 01:30:48,100
answer.
You know what I mean?

2154
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,860
And and trying to find that is very
difficult.

2155
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,090
It's like I was saying before about like
what injury is too bad to where you

2156
01:30:55,091 --> 01:30:56,890
should take this fight off and once an
hour.

2157
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,330
What's that?
What's that?

2158
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,530
What's that Ninja?
Oh,

2159
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,840
I stubbed my toe,
like going into my world title fight.

2160
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,990
I busted my rib like a nine days prior
to.

2161
01:31:07,991 --> 01:31:10,180
I couldn't even breathe.
I couldn't even move for two days.

2162
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:10,661
Like,
Hey,

2163
01:31:10,661 --> 01:31:13,210
maybe you should not fight in.
Yeah,

2164
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:16,240
that went through my head of course,
because I couldn't do anything.

2165
01:31:16,241 --> 01:31:19,040
I couldn't even touch it,
but I'm,

2166
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,000
I'm always somebody,
like I said I'm going to do it no matter

2167
01:31:22,001 --> 01:31:26,130
how that was broken.
Was it a intercostal tear?

2168
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,080
The tear of the tissue in between the
ribs?

2169
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:30,160
Yeah,
that's very painful.

2170
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,630
So it was,
when it happened,

2171
01:31:31,631 --> 01:31:35,200
my rib was sticking out like that,
pop it back into place and like duct

2172
01:31:35,201 --> 01:31:39,980
tape it down and I literally couldn't
take a breath and I was like,

2173
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,670
how am I going to fuck?
I can't even train.

2174
01:31:42,671 --> 01:31:45,270
I still got like over a week to go,
you know,

2175
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,650
I gotta make weight,
I got to do all these things and it's

2176
01:31:47,651 --> 01:31:49,290
all.
I'm laying in bed for two days just

2177
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,220
taking these short breasts.
I couldn't lay down,

2178
01:31:51,221 --> 01:31:56,170
I couldn't sit up and I'm just like,
I've been working so long to get to this

2179
01:31:56,171 --> 01:31:58,990
point and this happens to me right
before,

2180
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,340
like,
it was brutal.

2181
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,100
So what'd you end up doing?
I have fought and crushed him.

2182
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,160
Find out.
Did you,

2183
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:08,410
uh,
did you get a cortisone shot or anything

2184
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:09,460
in it?
And uh,

2185
01:32:09,461 --> 01:32:10,271
no,
no,

2186
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:12,740
I got,
I got a lot of body work done.

2187
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:15,520
Um,
I worked with my,

2188
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,970
a mind coach a lot like,
cause I was just like,

2189
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,830
literally if somebody touches me there,
I'm,

2190
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:22,170
I'm done.
Like I'm,

2191
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,660
my body's going to fall.
Like even if I'm mentally strong,

2192
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,550
that's what I was so worried about.
I was like,

2193
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:29,020
I'm gonna go out there and guys just
touched me.

2194
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:30,040
I'm gonna fall in like,
oh,

2195
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:31,630
knock me out.
You know what I mean?

2196
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:35,080
I was really worried about that,
but I was like,

2197
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:35,914
well,
you know what?

2198
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,890
He still has to do it.
He might go the whole fight not even

2199
01:32:38,891 --> 01:32:40,000
touched me.
You know what I mean?

2200
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:45,001
I can't be so concerned about this one
thing that I'm not going to allow this

2201
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:46,600
to break me.
You know?

2202
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:50,050
It's like,
at what point do you do allow things to

2203
01:32:50,051 --> 01:32:50,831
break you?
And I'm like,

2204
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:51,970
there's nothing that's going to break
me.

2205
01:32:51,971 --> 01:32:54,460
There's nothing going to stop me if I
can physically get in there,

2206
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:55,294
I'm going to do it.

2207
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:00,960
There's a fine line that people make
when they're training and they're

2208
01:33:01,901 --> 01:33:04,420
putting together a schedule.
There's a big debate,

2209
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:09,070
especially in mma over how much strength
and conditioning you should do versus

2210
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:12,310
how much fight specific skill training
you should do.

2211
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,450
Where do you guys fit in on that and how
do you make the distinction?

2212
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:19,310
I feel like there should be a balance
between both.

2213
01:33:19,311 --> 01:33:19,971
You know,
you gotTa,

2214
01:33:19,971 --> 01:33:22,840
you gotTa know what you're.
So you think you have to do strength

2215
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:23,840
conditioning.
Definitely.

2216
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,681
Definitely,
definitely.

2217
01:33:24,681 --> 01:33:25,940
Absolutely.
And then you should run.

2218
01:33:25,941 --> 01:33:29,050
There's a lot of fighters,
other MMA fighters that don't run around

2219
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,290
running,
sprinting,

2220
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:31,370
strengthening,
conditioning.

2221
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,440
But again,
it's different for every person.

2222
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,600
Now when you say running,
do you run distances?

2223
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:39,440
Do you run hills miles at a time?
We do a lot.

2224
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,870
We have the shortest run that I do is
four miles a night.

2225
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:45,980
Most of the Times I do that twice a day.
So you're running eight miles in a day.

2226
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:47,180
I mean,
it just really depends.

2227
01:33:47,181 --> 01:33:48,410
You know,
how I'm feeling that day that,

2228
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:50,680
so I go either for,
you know,

2229
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,390
whatever.
But I,

2230
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:54,070
I,
everyday I have to get my running.

2231
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:55,910
Otherwise I feel like I'm not training.
Really.

2232
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:56,300
Yeah.

2233
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,490
So you do the run in the morning and
then you train at night,

2234
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,300
is that.

2235
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,450
So I run,
I usually,

2236
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,050
so Monday,
Monday is kinda like a,

2237
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:06,080
it's not as long as,
as long of a day for me.

2238
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:08,480
Like I have like a long training session
in the afternoon,

2239
01:34:08,481 --> 01:34:11,190
but then Tuesday I run,
then we do strength and conditioning.

2240
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:14,060
Then they come back in the afternoon
when they hit pat's a,

2241
01:34:14,061 --> 01:34:16,090
then we all parked together,
you know,

2242
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:18,230
so that's Kinda like a longer day for
me.

2243
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:22,130
So you have a couple days where it's
just a big brutal,

2244
01:34:22,131 --> 01:34:24,080
crazy day.
So that's like four workouts you're

2245
01:34:24,081 --> 01:34:26,270
doing,
you're running,

2246
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:27,510
running,
conditioning,

2247
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:29,780
running again,
pat work,

2248
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:31,220
sparring,
sparring,

2249
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:34,900
you know,
then pull up neck exercises to crossfit

2250
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:36,740
in there.
And I really try.

2251
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:40,250
I try to put everything that I can into
my training.

2252
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:43,100
So fight day comes.
I'm like,

2253
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:46,100
there's nothing else I could have done.
This is it.

2254
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:51,160
But you also have to find that balance
between those things too.

2255
01:34:51,201 --> 01:34:55,790
So it's not like I can't 100 percent
crush every single thing I'm doing.

2256
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,860
I can't sprint for miles,

2257
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,970
crush the pads as hard as I can,
as hard as I can kill the bag as hard as

2258
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:02,890
I can,
you know what I mean?

2259
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,690
It's what is it that you're working on
in that moment,

2260
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,960
you know?
And am I just working on my technique

2261
01:35:08,961 --> 01:35:12,950
and my things in my footwork and my
movement and as well as that.

2262
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:16,340
So it's not like every time we do
strength and conditioning it's just full

2263
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:17,720
on kill yourself.
Sprint,

2264
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:19,100
you know,
or it might be.

2265
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,960
And then,
but later on maybe we're doing a little

2266
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:24,260
more technical stuff so we'd definitely
switch it up at the gym.

2267
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:27,870
Yeah.
How do you man,

2268
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,060
I mean that,
that balance,

2269
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:33,110
which is what's interesting about it is
like how do you know the right way to go

2270
01:35:33,111 --> 01:35:35,060
about it?
Like don't fade or towards the end of

2271
01:35:35,061 --> 01:35:36,800
his career.
I mean he's obviously back now,

2272
01:35:36,801 --> 01:35:39,350
but towards the end of his mma career,
he abandoned all strength and

2273
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:41,420
conditioning and he's just doing fight
training,

2274
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:44,900
which is again,
it's what works for the individual,

2275
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:45,980
you know what I mean?

2276
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:48,470
Like,
like what would I do?

2277
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,280
I was not going to tell everyone you
need to do this because then you're

2278
01:35:51,281 --> 01:35:53,990
going to be like me.
Like we don't have the same schedule.

2279
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:56,540
We were very different in the thing we
do.

2280
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:58,940
We do a lot of stuff together,
but there's a lot of stuff we don't do

2281
01:35:58,941 --> 01:36:01,190
the same at all.
What's the differences between you two

2282
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:02,120
terms?
Training?

2283
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:05,150
I probably don't.
I don't run as much as he does anymore.

2284
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,270
I used to.
Yeah.

2285
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:08,150
But like the older I get,
the less I'm running.

2286
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:10,890
Like I paid it man.
Hey,

2287
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:11,720
I'm like,
I've done,

2288
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,940
I've done the running.
But is there a benefit to you?

2289
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:16,280
Do I mean,
is there anything wrong with you not

2290
01:36:16,281 --> 01:36:17,990
doing it?
I don't feel so.

2291
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:20,090
No,
but you have to find a way to make up

2292
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:20,860
for that.
You know,

2293
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:23,060
like I know people who hardly run at
all,

2294
01:36:23,061 --> 01:36:26,330
but they also find a way to stumble a
supplement that,

2295
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,320
you know what I mean?

2296
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:30,880
They might do a lot harder.
Bag backgrounds are a lot more rounds,

2297
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:33,350
you know,
when it comes to that where you know

2298
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:35,990
there's not just one thing you have to
do this,

2299
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:39,410
this many rounds is this many miles.
You have to do,

2300
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,320
you have to eat exactly like this.
You have to do it exactly like this.

2301
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:45,110
It changes and it changes for me daily,
weekly,

2302
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,600
a fight.
Every fight is different.

2303
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:48,650
You know,
I might do more,

2304
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:49,430
do less,
you know,

2305
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:52,760
I've had fights where I couldn't run
because I snapped all the tendons in my

2306
01:36:52,761 --> 01:36:55,460
ankle and I had to swim instead,
you know,

2307
01:36:55,461 --> 01:36:57,000
and I still feel great now.
Fight.

2308
01:36:57,001 --> 01:37:00,650
And I have felt like I had just as much
cardio and I had to.

2309
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,570
I had to make up for it somehow.
In other aspects of what I was doing.

2310
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:05,240
You're making up for this.
Your,

2311
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:08,060
the one who's got this schedule in your
head.

2312
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:12,320
So there's that mind fuck of am I
slacking off or am I pushing myself hard

2313
01:37:12,321 --> 01:37:14,390
enough?
And how do you know that Kinda that

2314
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,220
kinda comes from the way I came up.
You know,

2315
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:20,060
I came up with high trainers who didn't
speak English,

2316
01:37:20,061 --> 01:37:23,210
you know,
I had to learn everything very much.

2317
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:25,790
So by doing it myself and figuring it
out myself,

2318
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:28,400
you know,
I never had had people telling me what

2319
01:37:28,401 --> 01:37:30,680
to do or what I should eat,
what I shouldn't eat,

2320
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,190
everything I've done and learned.
Most of what I've done and learned has

2321
01:37:34,191 --> 01:37:38,450
been by application.
I find it hilarious and fun to watch

2322
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:42,710
when you see Thai guys training with
American people and American people

2323
01:37:42,711 --> 01:37:46,850
don't speak Thai and the Thai guy
doesn't speak English and they're trying

2324
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:50,870
to teach them a technique and you know,
they're just kinda like doing it with

2325
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:53,600
your hip and you know,
it's this weird thing where you're

2326
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,980
looking at each other and they're trying
to figure what the other guy's saying.

2327
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,360
Well,
it's interesting because I didn't,

2328
01:37:57,390 --> 01:38:01,920
I didn't really start thinking of how
complex what I was doing was until I

2329
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:05,100
started teaching people.
Because I'd been doing this for almost

2330
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:09,450
10 years before I actually started
trying to train people and I remember

2331
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:11,970
the first time I taught somebody,
or maybe it was a seminar,

2332
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:12,511
something.
I'm like,

2333
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:13,344
well,
just kick,

2334
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:14,670
you know,
just just do it,

2335
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,990
do it.
And then I'm like,

2336
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:16,920
oh,
well you gotta do this,

2337
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:17,671
you gotta do this.
And I'm like,

2338
01:38:17,671 --> 01:38:20,280
Geez,
there's like 15 steps involved in just

2339
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:22,530
the kick.
Well that's funny you said that because

2340
01:38:22,531 --> 01:38:25,470
we worked out today and you're very
complex.

2341
01:38:25,471 --> 01:38:27,630
I mean you got.
I mean we were talking just about the

2342
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:32,160
switch kick and I think you went on this
10 minute rant of just all the different

2343
01:38:32,161 --> 01:38:35,100
variables that are involved in it.
It was very illuminating.

2344
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:38,160
It was awesome.
I did it again.

2345
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:39,090
It was,
it was.

2346
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,630
I learned it by doing it,
but it wasn't till teaching it that I

2347
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:47,631
had to figure out what all those steps
were and which has helped me in what I

2348
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:52,761
do and help me improve a lot of the
techniques I have and realizing all the,

2349
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:56,610
the complexity of every technique of
every movement in it.

2350
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,370
And when I explain it to people and then
I train people,

2351
01:38:59,371 --> 01:39:02,880
a lot of it is just me telling them how
you do it,

2352
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,950
you know,
were were,

2353
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:07,350
were how I learned was just just do it
like go run,

2354
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,730
go kick the bag.
Like hey,

2355
01:39:08,731 --> 01:39:12,090
you gotta fix this.
And like by watching and studying.

2356
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:15,900
And that's how it really how I learned
what's interesting.

2357
01:39:15,901 --> 01:39:19,380
And maybe unfortunately there's a,
you could train with a lot of people and

2358
01:39:19,381 --> 01:39:22,200
they would never point out some of the
stuff that you guys pointed out today.

2359
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:27,480
It's finding someone who's technically
proficient and understands how to,

2360
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:31,680
how to relay that information.
It's one of the harder parts of being a

2361
01:39:31,681 --> 01:39:35,000
martial artist unless you're a self
starter and you just do a lot of.

2362
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:37,890
Well now today obviously when you're a
day you can do youtube,

2363
01:39:37,891 --> 01:39:40,890
but now you can just get online.
You can watch a million.

2364
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,900
Yeah.
But you might find some shitty ones too.

2365
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:45,450
I've found some shitty ones on all sorts
of things where they don't know what the

2366
01:39:45,451 --> 01:39:48,900
fuck they're talking about on all sorts
of different martial arts techniques.

2367
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:51,390
Well,
it's the thing that Kinda like the

2368
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:55,590
unfortunate part,
a lot of times high level people didn't

2369
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:57,870
really have to learn things because it
came so naturally.

2370
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:02,070
They didn't have to learn all the
fundamental aspects that go into this

2371
01:40:02,071 --> 01:40:04,470
technique,
whereas somebody that might not be as

2372
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:07,140
good,
they've studied it a lot more and that's

2373
01:40:07,141 --> 01:40:12,000
why a lot of times you'll see not the
highest level of fighters be the better

2374
01:40:12,001 --> 01:40:15,690
coaches because they had to study it so
much more and they've had to really look

2375
01:40:15,691 --> 01:40:20,460
into it and dissect it that much more
because they weren't able to or or for

2376
01:40:20,461 --> 01:40:22,920
whatever reason do it so naturally.

2377
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,360
Like Freddie Roach.
Yeah,

2378
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:25,110
without a doubt.
He.

2379
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:27,570
I mean he was amazing fighter,
but he's a good fighter,

2380
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:29,460
really good fire fighter,
but he,

2381
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:30,294
you know,
he wasn't,

2382
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,550
he wasn't mayweather.
Right.

2383
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:33,390
You know what I mean?
Where you know,

2384
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:35,370
maybe others,
probably not the best coach in the

2385
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:36,610
world,
I don't know,

2386
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,550
but a guy like Freddy Roach has really
had to develop that and figure those

2387
01:40:41,551 --> 01:40:43,290
things out and he can tell somebody
else,

2388
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,000
how do you do that?
This is how you do it because I've had

2389
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:46,630
to figure it out,
you know what I mean?

2390
01:40:46,631 --> 01:40:50,040
And that's something like I've gone a
gone out of my way to do,

2391
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:52,350
like it was much more natural for me to
do,

2392
01:40:52,351 --> 01:40:54,280
but,
but throughout the years I've,

2393
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:56,710
I've realized that,
you know,

2394
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,750
and how do I tell someone how to do
this?

2395
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:01,060
I've had to figure out what those things
are and how do I,

2396
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,000
how do I tell someone how to do this
work because I can just do it just by

2397
01:41:04,001 --> 01:41:04,250
doing.

2398
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,830
I can watch somebody do something and
I'm like,

2399
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,250
I'm going to do it,
but,

2400
01:41:07,251 --> 01:41:10,080
but how do I explain this to somebody
and I've had to dissect my,

2401
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:15,110
my own self and realize all these things
and all these aspects of the technique

2402
01:41:15,341 --> 01:41:20,341
and it allows me to translate that to
somebody else as well as fine tune it in

2403
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:21,970
myself.
Now,

2404
01:41:21,971 --> 01:41:26,971
when you guys watch mma and you see
someone like Stephen Thompson that has a

2405
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:33,180
few elements of Moitai he uses,
but he uses a lot of sport karate,

2406
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,960
which is a completely different stance
and completely different style.

2407
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,730
What's your take on that when you wash
that will,

2408
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,800
what his style or when they say,
well,

2409
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:49,801
they definitely don't really mean well
with leg kicks in some techniques,

2410
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:52,120
but essentially he's doing a sport
karate style.

2411
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:53,620
Well,
it was kind of the same thing with

2412
01:41:53,621 --> 01:41:55,270
Anderson Silva.
It's like just because someone's

2413
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,790
throwing an elbow,
just because somebody has a clenched

2414
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,830
doesn't necessarily make it more tie.

2415
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:01,900
There's a lot of arts that have those
things.

2416
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:04,450
You know what I mean,
and I'm not going to view him as a

2417
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:06,490
Moitai Meta.
I think of Anderson is a more Thai

2418
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:07,324
fighter.
Not at all.

2419
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,450
He thought of himself as a Moy Thai
fighter.

2420
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:11,020
That's okay,
but.

2421
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:13,930
But I wouldn't view them as a fighter at
all.

2422
01:42:13,931 --> 01:42:16,980
I know is an MMA fighting.
Anything he did was very moist.

2423
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:20,590
Even his clench was.
I mean that's such a fundamental basic

2424
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:21,860
clench,
you know what I mean?

2425
01:42:21,861 --> 01:42:23,830
And that's just because everyone else
was so terrible at it.

2426
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:26,890
It's like grab the neck,
like you don't see that in high level

2427
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:29,050
Muay Thai guys going up and grabbing
each other by the neck.

2428
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:32,260
It's in transition and one of the hurt
people when they get tired very,

2429
01:42:32,261 --> 01:42:34,110
it's very much a,
um,

2430
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,990
us of struggling for dominance over
under those kinds of things,

2431
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:40,240
but a big sloppy,
ridiculous arm bar.

2432
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:41,103
Yeah,
Dude.

2433
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:44,500
It's like,
that's like day one more time.

2434
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,380
So when you saw the,
like the rich Franklin fight with the

2435
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,490
fuck,
like how did he not learn this this

2436
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:55,500
first day in training and what was even
worse was I had a friend that I trained

2437
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:59,380
with that went out to help him for the
second one and he just didn't want to

2438
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:01,390
hear it.
Like they did not want to hear that.

2439
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:02,141
Like,
dude,

2440
01:43:02,141 --> 01:43:05,440
you don't know what you're doing at all
because as we talked about earlier,

2441
01:43:05,441 --> 01:43:09,200
these guys get to a high level and think
that their,

2442
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:11,440
your technique is good.
And I'm like,

2443
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:12,850
dude,
you are like a kindergarten,

2444
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:15,430
like you don't know what you're doing at
all whatsoever.

2445
01:43:15,431 --> 01:43:17,100
He didn't want to listen.
So.

2446
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:19,150
Wow,
that's crazy.

2447
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:23,480
So who was it that went out with him?
Uh,

2448
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:24,870
Anthony Brown.
Oh,

2449
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:28,780
hold a training partner of mine.
And he was specifically brought there

2450
01:43:28,781 --> 01:43:30,250
because of his more time.
Yeah,

2451
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:31,240
without a doubt.
I'm like,

2452
01:43:31,241 --> 01:43:34,120
why would you,
why would you bring me in if you're not

2453
01:43:34,121 --> 01:43:34,800
going to use me?
I mean,

2454
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,380
I've been brought in for people to and
like,

2455
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:40,360
why wouldn't you use what you've brought
me in here to do?

2456
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,520
You know what I mean?
Like you brought me in for my,

2457
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:45,430
for my knowledge and the singing.
You just want to keep doing what you're

2458
01:43:45,431 --> 01:43:46,300
good at.
Like,

2459
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:47,500
why am I here?
This is stupid.

2460
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:50,770
That's unfortunate.
He's such a nice guy and such a smart

2461
01:43:50,771 --> 01:43:53,120
guy.
He was a math teacher without a doubt.

2462
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:56,990
How do you not see the math of that?
It's when people aren't.

2463
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:01,220
People have a false sense of where
they're at in the sport and what they

2464
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:04,100
can do and like you literally know
nothing,

2465
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:08,540
but you have this mentality that you're,
you're decent at standup,

2466
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:09,160
you're decent at.

2467
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:13,160
When we tie in your terrible compared to
someone that really does know what

2468
01:44:13,161 --> 01:44:14,510
they're doing.
You know what I mean?

2469
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:18,920
Most people's understanding is very
elementary.

2470
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:20,540
If that,
you know,

2471
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:22,500
you take another person in.
I'm on,

2472
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,830
I can beat you without even touching
you.

2473
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,470
You know what I mean,
and just let you mess yourself up

2474
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:28,910
because you don't really know what
you're doing.

2475
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,240
That's a.
it's crazy to think that someone could

2476
01:44:32,241 --> 01:44:36,200
reach the world championship level in
something that involves more Thai,

2477
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:37,870
but there's so many variables that come
into.

2478
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:39,330
There's wrestling,
there's Jujitsu,

2479
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,960
there's always things.
There's you can get away with a lot

2480
01:44:41,961 --> 01:44:44,840
more.
Like the striking in mma you can get

2481
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:47,660
away with because of those variables,
because of the smaller gloves,

2482
01:44:47,661 --> 01:44:49,320
because of the takedowns,
you know,

2483
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:54,020
you put that person in the ring with
even a moderately good.

2484
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:56,660
When we tie person a moderately good
boxer,

2485
01:44:56,661 --> 01:44:59,090
if they're going to get murdered,
you know what I mean?

2486
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:01,460
Right.
Just like it can bring like a really

2487
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:03,470
good fit for him,
but they don't have any wrestling

2488
01:45:03,471 --> 01:45:05,840
defense defense or no Jujitsu.
I'm not going to do it.

2489
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:06,700
Be able to do.
Exactly.

2490
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:07,940
Exactly.
Look like an idiot.

2491
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:09,861
It's.
Well,

2492
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:12,370
that's one of the appeals of MMA.
Yeah.

2493
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:17,470
Is that the guy who wins is most likely
the best fighter because if it was just

2494
01:45:17,721 --> 01:45:21,050
more tie or if it was just wrestling or
if it was just Jujitsu,

2495
01:45:21,051 --> 01:45:23,060
you would see someone who's the best at
that,

2496
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:26,900
but when you throw everything in,
like it's the kitchen sink get in there

2497
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:31,460
and that's when you know,
you get to see like who's been.

2498
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:33,170
I mean,
it's even more complex puzzle.

2499
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:38,150
That's why I've never really understood
the argument of like pitting this person

2500
01:45:38,151 --> 01:45:41,690
against that person or who's got the
best Moitai never made well nobody

2501
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,390
because they're not doing more tie.

2502
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,781
Right.
So,

2503
01:45:44,781 --> 01:45:46,310
so that,
that argument,

2504
01:45:46,311 --> 01:45:48,740
that conversation is completely invalid.
Like,

2505
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:50,900
Oh,
if you put this boxer and against this

2506
01:45:50,901 --> 01:45:52,160
Moy Thai fighter,
who's going to win,

2507
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,630
I don't know what rules are they
fighting under their fighting under more

2508
01:45:54,631 --> 01:45:57,110
type roles are going to get crushed.
You know what I mean?

2509
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,350
Well,
it's interesting that a wonderboy

2510
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,130
Thompson is going to fight tyron
Woodley,

2511
01:46:01,131 --> 01:46:04,970
who's the UFC welterweight champion and
who's just a super powerful wrestler,

2512
01:46:04,971 --> 01:46:08,750
but he's also training with Duke Roufus
who's obviously very talented,

2513
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:11,240
knows a lot about.
Great coach,

2514
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:15,680
when you see a guy like that,
the reason why I keep bringing up

2515
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:18,290
wonderboy styles because it's so unique,
you know,

2516
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:22,100
we brought up Raymond Daniels in glory
who's one of the only guys that has that

2517
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:26,120
similar background and then Michael Page
of course in mma fights were belt or has

2518
01:46:26,121 --> 01:46:29,090
a very similar style to that sport
karate style.

2519
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:31,520
What are the holes in that style?
Like what's.

2520
01:46:31,521 --> 01:46:34,740
What's the pros and cons that you see as
a fighter?

2521
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:36,680
What we were speaking of earlier,
it's,

2522
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:40,670
it's if you've never applied that in a
fight,

2523
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,050
a real fight,
not,

2524
01:46:42,051 --> 01:46:43,610
not,
not point sparring,

2525
01:46:43,611 --> 01:46:44,111
not,
not,

2526
01:46:44,111 --> 01:46:44,830
not,
not that,

2527
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:47,870
that kind of thing.
There's certain techniques and things

2528
01:46:47,871 --> 01:46:52,871
that are completely worthless and
unfortunately in a lot of those sports

2529
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:56,580
you are not.
You don't get exposed by that until it's

2530
01:46:56,581 --> 01:46:58,650
way too late.
So you're trying these techniques that

2531
01:46:59,190 --> 01:46:59,651
you know,
a,

2532
01:46:59,651 --> 01:47:03,570
a decent person just going to walk right
through because they look good and

2533
01:47:03,571 --> 01:47:06,480
they're flashy and they're great on the
pads and and all that,

2534
01:47:06,481 --> 01:47:08,850
but,
but when you have to damage someone,

2535
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:11,400
right?
Obviously Thomson knows how to do that

2536
01:47:11,401 --> 01:47:14,670
though,
obviously it's using those techniques

2537
01:47:14,671 --> 01:47:19,671
and applying them in a more fight,
a centric way and it's completely

2538
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:22,620
different thing,
but when you see what I was trying to

2539
01:47:22,621 --> 01:47:24,770
get at,
is that such a weird style where you

2540
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:28,620
stand sideways and he leaps in and out
and he moves back and forth from the

2541
01:47:28,621 --> 01:47:29,670
waist,
like a snake.

2542
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:33,600
I mean he's got a lot of.
There's a lot of weirdness to the way he

2543
01:47:33,601 --> 01:47:38,601
moves and it's very difficult to find
anybody that has that level skill with a

2544
01:47:39,331 --> 01:47:43,440
sport karate kickboxing,
but also has a really good wrestling

2545
01:47:43,441 --> 01:47:44,274
base to.
Yeah.

2546
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,020
Yeah,
and I think that's one of the biggest

2547
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:50,190
things in and why he's able to apply
those things because because he can deal

2548
01:47:50,191 --> 01:47:52,410
with the wrestling and everything else
that goes in so,

2549
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:56,100
so that's why you'll see him throw those
techniques because he's not as worried

2550
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:58,800
about it as someone who might be just as
good as him with those things.

2551
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:02,840
It has zero ground wrestling or they're
not gonna throw it because they're going

2552
01:48:02,841 --> 01:48:03,810
to get taken down.
Crushed.

2553
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:05,430
Yeah.
It's like we were talking about your

2554
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:10,230
experience in a taekwondo school that
you went there the first day you started

2555
01:48:10,231 --> 01:48:12,210
doing sparring,
you through a low kick and then like get

2556
01:48:12,211 --> 01:48:13,044
outta here.

2557
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:16,320
Time to go do it.
Something to do effective.

2558
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:19,020
Yeah.
So being able to apply things in a real

2559
01:48:19,021 --> 01:48:21,870
fight and being able to apply them in
the air.

2560
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,430
It is very different.
Right.

2561
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:26,340
Obviously we've seen Thompson can apply
them in a real fight.

2562
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:29,400
What is he doing that you see that's
different?

2563
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:32,040
Like obviously it's not a Moy Thai
fighter,

2564
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:35,520
he's a kickboxer,
but like when you see that stance,

2565
01:48:35,521 --> 01:48:37,500
that weird stance,
that sideways stance,

2566
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:40,230
when you think about that?
Well,

2567
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:42,330
I don't think much about it because I
don't watch a lot of MMA,

2568
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:43,910
you know?
I mean I do,

2569
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:46,260
I don't,
I wouldn't say I follow it,

2570
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,080
you know what I mean?
I watched it when it's on and,

2571
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:49,770
but I'm not a,
you know,

2572
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:52,920
like paying attention to the fighters or
tracking them throughout the years,

2573
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:56,400
you know that much.
I'm just so curious because you're so

2574
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,890
Moitai,
you know your style so tiny.

2575
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,830
You're obviously an expert at it.
I'm always curious as to like how a

2576
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:06,831
person like you observes an expert
striker in sort of another realm.

2577
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:09,830
La,
I think he's an expert and he's becoming

2578
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,010
an expert striker in mma.
So he's,

2579
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:16,170
he's applying all the techniques that he
knows that he knows and ha have worked

2580
01:49:16,171 --> 01:49:19,410
for him in MMA.
So it's different than if he would get

2581
01:49:19,411 --> 01:49:23,370
in the ring and do Moitai yeah.
How many fighters like him have done

2582
01:49:23,371 --> 01:49:25,290
Moitai?
Obviously Raymond Daniels has done

2583
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:27,350
kickboxing and some you know,
and it,

2584
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:31,710
but it's another one of those things
where being able to apply the things

2585
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:37,400
from your other sport into that.
So like we were talking about with a

2586
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:40,410
Raymond Daniels and Nikki hold skin,
like he just walked him down and he's

2587
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:41,520
like Bop,
Bop,

2588
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:46,521
crushing the Valtellina to.
So at a certain level it kind you,

2589
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:48,280
you lose

2590
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,900
that.
Like where you're spinning,

2591
01:49:49,901 --> 01:49:51,970
flashy techniques are going to work
against,

2592
01:49:51,971 --> 01:49:52,480
you know,
those,

2593
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,050
those mid level guys,
but you put them in there with the best

2594
01:49:56,051 --> 01:49:59,000
in the world,
in a lot of that stuff gets exposed in,

2595
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:02,920
is not working out so well,
and you think that essentially

2596
01:50:02,921 --> 01:50:06,340
demonstrates the effectiveness of Moitai
at the highest levels you think is the

2597
01:50:06,341 --> 01:50:07,640
best.
Demonstrates the,

2598
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:10,570
the holes and some of the stances in
techniques.

2599
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:12,850
Um,
if I'm not flinching on the things you

2600
01:50:12,851 --> 01:50:16,660
do and don't really care so much about
you hopping around and spin around,

2601
01:50:16,661 --> 01:50:21,661
I'm just walking down and crushing you.
You know that that's where that kind of

2602
01:50:21,971 --> 01:50:24,310
gets exposed.
So it's like,

2603
01:50:24,311 --> 01:50:27,970
it's like putting a boxer into a fight
I'm going to do is kick your legs and

2604
01:50:27,971 --> 01:50:29,560
you can't punch me.
You know what I mean?

2605
01:50:29,561 --> 01:50:33,730
But you take a box there and teach them
how to defend those kicks and standing a

2606
01:50:33,731 --> 01:50:36,300
little bit more of a squared up way.

2607
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:39,610
And where I can't use you use your
weakness against you as much.

2608
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:42,190
You're going to have much better success
even if you never throw a kick.

2609
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:45,720
Now you just can take those kicks better
and just kill me with your,

2610
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:48,140
your high level hands.
Will you,

2611
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:52,450
you said that you had taken some boxing
matches I had for boxing floats in and

2612
01:50:52,451 --> 01:50:54,280
you just did it to stay active?
Yeah,

2613
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:56,110
I mean there were all on like a week's
notice.

2614
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:57,970
I,
one of them was like,

2615
01:50:57,971 --> 01:50:59,350
the day I got there,
like,

2616
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:03,430
well this was when I was saying I was
out on all those fights fall through and

2617
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:05,380
uh,
I went to this fight was supposed to be

2618
01:51:05,381 --> 01:51:08,470
a fight and I told the promoter way
ahead of time,

2619
01:51:08,471 --> 01:51:08,951
like,
look,

2620
01:51:08,951 --> 01:51:11,470
I've had all these fights fall through.
I'm not coming out there unless you have

2621
01:51:11,471 --> 01:51:12,040
a fight for me.

2622
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:13,990
I'm like,
not only do you need to have a fight for

2623
01:51:13,991 --> 01:51:15,520
me,
I need you to have a backup guy for me

2624
01:51:15,521 --> 01:51:16,040
as well.
He's like,

2625
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,900
don't worry,
don't worry.

2626
01:51:16,901 --> 01:51:18,280
We got it.
We got am like,

2627
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:19,620
I'll call them before I went out there
and be like,

2628
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:21,010
so the guys still gonna find me,
right?

2629
01:51:21,011 --> 01:51:21,820
Yeah,
yeah.

2630
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:23,260
You got the backup guy too,
right?

2631
01:51:23,261 --> 01:51:23,711
Yeah.
Yeah.

2632
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:24,940
All right,
get out there.

2633
01:51:25,570 --> 01:51:26,960
Well,
uh,

2634
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,060
yeah,
they both backed out.

2635
01:51:28,061 --> 01:51:29,220
So,
um,

2636
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:30,700
I don't know what we're going to do.
I'm like,

2637
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:31,390
look,
man,

2638
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:34,780
day of have much of an issue.
Oh yeah.

2639
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,430
And I was like,
look,

2640
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:40,060
if you don't get me a fighter you need
to drag your ass into the ring and we're

2641
01:51:40,061 --> 01:51:42,470
going to fight because I have killed
myself and you promised me we had a

2642
01:51:42,471 --> 01:51:43,171
fighting saying,
Oh man,

2643
01:51:43,171 --> 01:51:44,370
I'm going to get you someone get you
somebody.

2644
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:45,213
I'm like,
alright.

2645
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,200
So I weighed in,
left,

2646
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:48,550
came back.
He's like,

2647
01:51:48,551 --> 01:51:52,930
well we got somebody but uh,
he's a boxer.

2648
01:51:52,931 --> 01:51:56,290
It's a do you want to do a boxing fight?
And I used to carry my boxing shoes with

2649
01:51:56,291 --> 01:52:00,070
me just in case and I'll bring my
mouthpiece in my cup to fights even if I

2650
01:52:00,071 --> 01:52:01,510
wasn't fighting just in case,
you know,

2651
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:02,990
because,
because it's ridiculous.

2652
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,320
That's just how we came up,
you know what I mean?

2653
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:07,270
And he's like,
well you can box.

2654
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,190
I was like,
alright,

2655
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,970
alright let's do it.
And this guy is standing right there.

2656
01:52:09,971 --> 01:52:12,940
He was freaking out because one,
he was like 20 pounds bigger than me.

2657
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:16,450
I've never boxed the day in my life
before and he's like,

2658
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,920
what is wrong with this guy?
And I was like,

2659
01:52:17,921 --> 01:52:18,710
yeah,
let's go man.

2660
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:19,061
He's like,
well,

2661
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:20,140
he's 20 pounds everything.
I'm like,

2662
01:52:20,141 --> 01:52:20,974
I don't care.

2663
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:21,821
I'm like,
let's go.

2664
01:52:21,821 --> 01:52:22,840
I got some shoes,
like,

2665
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:23,830
well,
I got some gloves,

2666
01:52:23,831 --> 01:52:26,290
let's fight.
And I went out there and knocked him out

2667
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:27,370
and uh,
you know,

2668
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:29,160
that was,
that was my first time boxing everybody.

2669
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:31,840
It was always like that.
I like a last minute thing where I'm

2670
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:33,670
like,
I can punch man,

2671
01:52:33,671 --> 01:52:37,970
like I'm going to do whatever I can do.
Now you're preparing for mma?

2672
01:52:37,971 --> 01:52:38,701
Yeah.
So,

2673
01:52:38,701 --> 01:52:40,240
uh,
how much different is your training?

2674
01:52:40,330 --> 01:52:42,310
Are you still taking more Thai fights as
well?

2675
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:43,360
Well,
right.

2676
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,000
Right now we're in the transition.
I just signed with belts are in

2677
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,200
them.
I don't know what's coming next.

2678
01:52:48,201 --> 01:52:51,380
If it's going to be kickboxer I may,
but I'm definitely preparing for both.

2679
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:54,560
And they haven't told you.
I don't know yet because we don't know

2680
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:55,260
what Carla,
me,

2681
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:56,990
I'm going beyond,
but I mean my,

2682
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,540
my mma training,
even when we hit the paths,

2683
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:01,890
as I stand differently,
I'm diff.

2684
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:04,220
I'm moved differently when they're
training for MMA.

2685
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,050
You know,
I'm doing a lot of MMA rounds actually

2686
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:06,884
with the,
with the,

2687
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:09,230
with the guy.
So from a team pseudo.

2688
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:12,560
Well,
the good thing about mma is it'll still

2689
01:53:12,561 --> 01:53:14,290
allow you to do spinning elbows.
Yeah.

2690
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:17,280
The bad thing about kickboxing is you
can't do spinning elbows.

2691
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:18,360
Yeah.
People don't know.

2692
01:53:18,361 --> 01:53:20,250
That's one of your signature techniques
properly.

2693
01:53:20,251 --> 01:53:21,730
Your signature technique.
Mimo.

2694
01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:24,860
I mean,
you had some spectacular knockouts in

2695
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:26,910
lion fight was spinning elbows.
Thank you.

2696
01:53:26,911 --> 01:53:29,720
And Yeah.
How the fuck could they take that away?

2697
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:31,520
Well,
that's ridiculous.

2698
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:32,720
Yeah.
Well,

2699
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:33,201
you know,
I'm,

2700
01:53:33,201 --> 01:53:34,820
I'm,
I'm really looking forward to doing both

2701
01:53:34,821 --> 01:53:36,910
to be honest.
I'm looking forward to uh,

2702
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:39,230
you know,
improving on my boxing and really having

2703
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:42,710
to exercise that,
that style of fighting and I'm really

2704
01:53:42,711 --> 01:53:44,180
looking forward to doing them in May as
well,

2705
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:47,180
you know.
And you were fighting 1:45 in lion

2706
01:53:47,181 --> 01:53:49,810
fight,
low 40 mma.

2707
01:53:49,811 --> 01:53:50,810
I don't,
I don't know yet.

2708
01:53:50,811 --> 01:53:53,470
I'll probably start at 1:45 then going
down to 35.

2709
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:56,260
You think you could make 1:35 big guy?
I can.

2710
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:59,480
I've made 1:39 last time.
How much do you weigh right now?

2711
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,280
Probably like one 60,
1:58.

2712
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,970
God,
everybody's just killing themselves.

2713
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:09,550
That to me is one of the most
unfortunate aspects of fighting is the

2714
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:13,670
drastic weight cuts and I just think
that juice is not worth the squeeze.

2715
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:18,050
I just feel like fighting itself is so
God damn difficult.

2716
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:22,490
Like why complicated even further by
dehydrating your brain 24 hours before

2717
01:54:22,491 --> 01:54:23,160
the fight.
Yeah.

2718
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:26,870
And that's why I cut down so much and
I've been working with my job for my

2719
01:54:26,871 --> 01:54:30,560
last three camps and has been great.
What is dolce got you doing differently?

2720
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:34,800
Just like the fact that he sent.
He sends me all my Diet's like,

2721
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,110
you know,
before I,

2722
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,740
we,
we,

2723
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:38,990
I have like an off season diet as well,
you know,

2724
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:42,890
so I'm just ready getting ready all year
round.

2725
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:46,370
So do you have like a pre prepped meals?
Are there in the little containers and

2726
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:51,050
you open them up and out of the cave is
a meal prep company that we have out

2727
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:53,600
there in Dublin and Kevin sponsored by
them too,

2728
01:54:53,601 --> 01:54:55,850
so it's really easy.
So I just,

2729
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:57,770
I get my diet from dolce.
I give him my,

2730
01:54:57,830 --> 01:55:00,290
I give out of the cave,
my diet and I just get my meal prep

2731
01:55:00,291 --> 01:55:00,860
every week.

2732
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,693
Oh,
that's nice.

2733
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:02,630
Yeah,
that's jargon.

2734
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:06,260
It definitely makes it a lot easier to
not have to worry about cooking and not

2735
01:55:06,261 --> 01:55:08,840
have to worry about any of that.
And just training,

2736
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:11,910
you know,
eating and good desk.

2737
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,490
That is gigantic.
Now.

2738
01:55:13,491 --> 01:55:17,390
What is a primarily what kind of foods
are you eating and do very that.

2739
01:55:17,391 --> 01:55:19,730
And do you have different results with
different diets?

2740
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,370
I,
my last diet was pretty good.

2741
01:55:22,371 --> 01:55:26,540
I will have like oats in the morning.
I'm oats in the morning with a chia

2742
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:28,460
seeds and hemp seeds and that kind of
stuff.

2743
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:33,350
Then I'll have my first workout,
my second meal will be eggs and then at

2744
01:55:33,351 --> 01:55:36,830
night I will have like fish or chicken
or anything like that with asparagus or

2745
01:55:36,831 --> 01:55:40,370
Broccoli.
I found that to be really successful,

2746
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:42,230
you know,
so um,

2747
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:44,250
if you do vary it,
like what

2748
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:48,270
do you various far as like the fat
content versus the carbohydrate content

2749
01:55:48,271 --> 01:55:49,920
versus the protein content?
I mean,

2750
01:55:49,921 --> 01:55:50,460
do you,
uh,

2751
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,200
do you mess around with that at all?
I use,

2752
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:57,201
I used to do mostly a Paleo Diet.
It was 90 percent Paleo except for a

2753
01:55:57,841 --> 01:56:01,020
little bit of milk in my coffee,
but now I actually,

2754
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:05,010
I had all these grains like oats and
brown rice at night and I feel great.

2755
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,020
I feel better with that.
I feel better with that.

2756
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,450
What was,
what is the difference between adding

2757
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:10,800
the grains,
the extra car?

2758
01:56:10,810 --> 01:56:14,820
I have way more energy and interesting.
I have a lot more energy and my weight

2759
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:17,850
is even lower than it was when I was
just trying to do,

2760
01:56:17,851 --> 01:56:19,770
you know,
all fruits and meats.

2761
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:21,990
Yeah.
There's a certain amount of

2762
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:26,190
carbohydrates that a lot of people that
are involved in like very strenuous

2763
01:56:26,191 --> 01:56:28,830
shit,
like whether it's a triathletes or

2764
01:56:28,831 --> 01:56:31,710
somewhere along those lines,
there's a lot of people that try,

2765
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:34,050
um,
maybe the goal with a ketogenic diet.

2766
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:37,710
I tried that a little bit and I just had
no energy.

2767
01:56:37,711 --> 01:56:40,530
It did not work for me.
I've heard that like I was just like,

2768
01:56:40,531 --> 01:56:42,690
I felt like I was brain dead.
How long did you do it for?

2769
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:46,530
It was like about a couple of weeks.
And see that's the problem.

2770
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,650
You're supposed to wait.
You're supposed to not even do anything

2771
01:56:49,651 --> 01:56:52,980
strenuous for the first three or four
weeks to your body transitions.

2772
01:56:52,981 --> 01:56:54,660
So in my case I was,
you know,

2773
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:56,280
I'm always trying to get ready for
fights.

2774
01:56:56,670 --> 01:56:57,630
I was just like,
dude,

2775
01:56:57,631 --> 01:57:00,030
I have no energy.
Like I don't know what they call the

2776
01:57:00,031 --> 01:57:02,100
Keto flu.
Yeah,

2777
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:04,500
it's A.
I know some guys have made the

2778
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:06,960
transition successfully and then they
um,

2779
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,630
they compete and they do a lot of things
burning off fat.

2780
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:13,680
But I'm always curious about extreme
people,

2781
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:15,870
like people that are doing ultra
marathons,

2782
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:20,820
people that are doing things that are
extreme energy requirements,

2783
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:21,570
you know?

2784
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:23,070
Yeah.
Well I was living with the Karen at the

2785
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:25,380
time and he was like,
I felt like a little bit is I did,

2786
01:57:25,381 --> 01:57:28,620
what the fuck are you doing?
Shit for you.

2787
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:30,480
You need carbs.
You need,

2788
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:32,550
you need,
you need that stuff.

2789
01:57:32,551 --> 01:57:33,970
I was.
You're not going to have any juice,

2790
01:57:33,971 --> 01:57:34,804
man.
Well,

2791
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:39,300
if you talk to mark Sisson,
who he calls his diet the primal

2792
01:57:39,301 --> 01:57:41,730
blueprint,
let the whole problem with the term

2793
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:44,010
Paleo.
Is that the Paleolithic era?

2794
01:57:44,011 --> 01:57:47,670
They ate a lot of grains.
I mean that's just not historically

2795
01:57:47,671 --> 01:57:49,320
accurate.
It's not a good word for it,

2796
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:53,550
but the people that are successful with
it,

2797
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:55,800
apparently it required.
There's a.

2798
01:57:55,801 --> 01:58:00,570
there's a curve where you go through
that Keto flu stage for a few weeks and

2799
01:58:00,571 --> 01:58:03,180
then you get better than you,
but I've talked to people that never get

2800
01:58:03,181 --> 01:58:05,040
better.
I mean I know some friends,

2801
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:09,690
Jujitsu friends that went through the
whole process and didn't train hard for

2802
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:13,290
three or four weeks and got themselves
to a state of Ketosis but just did not

2803
01:58:13,291 --> 01:58:13,830
feel right.

2804
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:15,630
Yeah,
I mean I know it works for like power

2805
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:17,490
lifters and stuff like that and people
like that,

2806
01:58:17,491 --> 01:58:21,630
but me as a fighter personally
experienced it for a little bit.

2807
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:25,170
I just would not do it again.
Your description shows me that you

2808
01:58:25,171 --> 01:58:29,050
didn't really get through it,
the that you can't do it for two weeks.

2809
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:31,680
He told me like mark system when I did
it,

2810
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:34,230
he told me,
don't do anything hard for three weeks

2811
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:37,380
to do anything.
Even if you like on the treadmill for 45

2812
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:39,390
minutes just at a slow pace.
That's probably too much.

2813
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:41,980
I think that was my mistake and I
training just

2814
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,960
as hard as I always do,
but trying to eat like that.

2815
01:58:43,961 --> 01:58:44,860
I was like,
yeah,

2816
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:48,250
it takes your body,
takes your body awhile apparently to

2817
01:58:48,251 --> 01:58:50,650
make that adaptation,
but it is controversial.

2818
01:58:50,651 --> 01:58:52,570
I mean it works for me and it works for
some people,

2819
01:58:52,571 --> 01:58:55,990
but obviously my lifestyle doesn't have
the same energy requirements that your

2820
01:58:55,991 --> 01:58:57,120
lifestyle.
Does it mean training for

2821
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:59,190
fights?
I mean like all the things you've got to

2822
01:58:59,191 --> 01:59:01,020
find what works best for you.
That's why I like,

2823
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:02,880
you know,
I'll make the adjustments.

2824
01:59:02,881 --> 01:59:05,340
I feel like I need.
If I need some more cars,

2825
01:59:05,370 --> 01:59:09,570
some more grains on a certain day or
going into a certain workout,

2826
01:59:09,571 --> 01:59:11,700
I'm going to have them.
That's why I wouldn't say I have a

2827
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:13,390
specific diet,
I,

2828
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:14,670
because it varies,
you know,

2829
01:59:14,671 --> 01:59:16,170
there's how I'm feeling,
what's working,

2830
01:59:16,171 --> 01:59:17,350
what's not working,
you know,

2831
01:59:17,390 --> 01:59:20,220
which guys get blood work done.
Do you get your blood work checked out,

2832
01:59:21,470 --> 01:59:24,450
have a uh,
I got a buddy in vegas who does that and

2833
01:59:24,451 --> 01:59:26,400
a years back,
um,

2834
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:27,081
you know,
I,

2835
01:59:27,081 --> 01:59:29,130
I had my blood looked at it,
it was messed up man.

2836
01:59:29,131 --> 01:59:33,680
I had a lot of plaque in my blood and
stuff and I was really surprised.

2837
01:59:33,681 --> 01:59:36,100
It looked like it was really unhealthy
and I never would have known that if I

2838
01:59:36,101 --> 01:59:37,140
never had gotten it done.

2839
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:39,720
What were you eating at the time?
The same stuff I'm meeting.

2840
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:42,240
I think it was more of a hereditary
thing then,

2841
01:59:42,241 --> 01:59:43,710
uh,
then as far as my diet,

2842
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:44,821
um,
yeah,

2843
01:59:44,821 --> 01:59:46,370
and what got me on a lot of,
uh,

2844
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:47,850
like the red algae and,
and,

2845
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:50,390
and uh,
I don't remember everything but we've

2846
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:53,190
got to completely clear.
It was just crazy to see it.

2847
01:59:53,191 --> 01:59:55,590
Like I could see the blood and like
showed me like,

2848
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:58,020
you know,
how it gets moving around.

2849
01:59:58,021 --> 01:59:58,471
So be like,
yeah,

2850
01:59:58,471 --> 02:00:00,890
there's a big chunk of a crystals right
there.

2851
02:00:00,891 --> 02:00:01,711
It's like,
that's not good,

2852
02:00:01,711 --> 02:00:02,550
man,
if there's.

2853
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:05,280
Because it's only worse.
He was really surprised by how bad it

2854
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:07,200
was.
This guy a doctor or is he like a

2855
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:08,580
healer?
No,

2856
02:00:08,581 --> 02:00:09,130
no,
he was.

2857
02:00:09,130 --> 02:00:10,290
He was a phd.
Is legit.

2858
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,193
Yeah.
Yeah,

2859
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:14,960
fucking people.
You'd be amazed like world class

2860
02:00:14,961 --> 02:00:18,920
athletes that go to quacks and you know,
they'll come back and tell you

2861
02:00:18,921 --> 02:00:19,491
something.
Well,

2862
02:00:19,491 --> 02:00:23,270
I'm balancing out my alkaline and my
energy and my truck was what?

2863
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,840
Huh?
What's going on?

2864
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:26,670
Like I was,
it was,

2865
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:28,890
it was nice to visibly be able to see
it.

2866
02:00:28,891 --> 02:00:30,120
Like him take a blood,
put it on,

2867
02:00:30,121 --> 02:00:31,910
things like that.
So you can see it in newspapers.

2868
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:33,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2869
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:35,610
Wow.
So you're like a projection up on the

2870
02:00:35,611 --> 02:00:39,570
wall.
And I got cleared it up within like a

2871
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:42,390
month or two.
What about like vitamin supplementation

2872
02:00:42,391 --> 02:00:45,660
or things along those lines?
Well now I'm hooked up with on it and

2873
02:00:45,661 --> 02:00:49,720
all their amazing stuff.
So I've been hooked up taking all their

2874
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:53,400
multivitamins and things like that,
which all the other stuff's really

2875
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:54,810
amazing.
Yeah,

2876
02:00:54,811 --> 02:00:56,410
we try,
we try to get the best shit,

2877
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:59,190
but then there's stuff is awesome.
I mean like I have days,

2878
02:00:59,191 --> 02:01:00,570
you know,
towards the end of the camp that I'm

2879
02:01:00,571 --> 02:01:03,810
like dude,
like I cannot like even with my dad and

2880
02:01:03,811 --> 02:01:05,160
everything,
like you're so sore you,

2881
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:07,470
you busted your ass for so long,
you know,

2882
02:01:07,471 --> 02:01:10,440
you're like,
I just scan and I've taken that Alpha

2883
02:01:10,441 --> 02:01:13,350
brain stuff and like that stuff puts you
on for sure.

2884
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:13,850
Like

2885
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:17,060
it's a great thing to take before
workouts and a lot of people don't think

2886
02:01:17,061 --> 02:01:19,490
of it as that because it's,
you think of it as something for,

2887
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:22,250
for mental energy or for your memory or
for.

2888
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:25,760
Yeah,
like I take it during sparring and I

2889
02:01:25,761 --> 02:01:28,600
feel like I'm,
I'm on like 100 percent.

2890
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:29,900
I feel like,
um,

2891
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:32,990
mental fatigue is a huge factor in
physical fatigue,

2892
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:36,800
which is one of the next questions I
wanted to talk to you guys about.

2893
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,530
Sources of inspiration.
Do you,

2894
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,130
do you

2895
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,290
actively seek out inspiration?

2896
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,450
You know,
personally when I was,

2897
02:01:46,570 --> 02:01:51,190
when was the one that got knocked out?
18 17 when I got knocked out,

2898
02:01:51,191 --> 02:01:53,470
you know,
I had a really bad time after that,

2899
02:01:53,471 --> 02:01:55,570
you know,
like I said I was invincible and then I

2900
02:01:55,571 --> 02:01:59,580
had a really bad way cut that happened
and then I'm carrying,

2901
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:02,860
brought out Kevin to help me out.
So Kevin's been Maya's per my

2902
02:02:02,861 --> 02:02:04,360
inspiration for the last,
you know,

2903
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:08,770
since he moved out and every everyday
just seeing this guy,

2904
02:02:08,771 --> 02:02:10,840
you know,
how hard he works and how everything he

2905
02:02:10,841 --> 02:02:12,970
puts on the line everyday.
Like that's been.

2906
02:02:12,971 --> 02:02:15,400
Mine's my inspiration since then,
you know,

2907
02:02:15,401 --> 02:02:15,820
I mean,
I,

2908
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:17,770
I knew Kevin before that,
uh,

2909
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:19,600
the first,
the first time I ever saw Kevin,

2910
02:02:19,601 --> 02:02:21,950
I thought I saw Kevin fight.
I thought he was going to lose weight

2911
02:02:21,951 --> 02:02:23,050
here.
He fought coke.

2912
02:02:23,051 --> 02:02:25,720
I was supposed to be in that car.
The fight fell through and then I

2913
02:02:25,721 --> 02:02:27,460
watched them and then I'm talking to
Karen on the side.

2914
02:02:27,461 --> 02:02:28,930
He's like,
he was betting against me,

2915
02:02:28,931 --> 02:02:29,980
man.
I was like,

2916
02:02:29,981 --> 02:02:31,630
dude,
why coke?

2917
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:32,553
I was like,
dude,

2918
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,770
what's his full name?
A channel.

2919
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:35,633
What?
Yeah.

2920
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:38,620
And he was,
that was when I was like,

2921
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:39,700
Damn,
who is that?

2922
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:41,080
Because I,
at first I was like,

2923
02:02:41,081 --> 02:02:41,840
do white boys.
Yeah,

2924
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:46,820
but to get smashed
you don't know Kevin Ross,

2925
02:02:46,821 --> 02:02:47,660
dude,
I know

2926
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:50,640
smash this guy.
And I was like,

2927
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:51,991
I was like,
after,

2928
02:02:51,991 --> 02:02:52,824
if I was like,
dude,

2929
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:53,713
that was my new favorite.

2930
02:02:54,730 --> 02:02:56,290
That's funny.
And then you get to train with them.

2931
02:02:56,550 --> 02:02:58,600
Yeah.
What I meant was do you seek

2932
02:02:58,601 --> 02:03:02,530
inspiration?
Like do you read books about inspiration

2933
02:03:02,531 --> 02:03:06,190
or do you,
do you read anything about mindset or

2934
02:03:06,370 --> 02:03:08,170
psychology or anything along those
lines?

2935
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:08,900
Um,
I read,

2936
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:09,930
I read a lot,
um,

2937
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:13,240
I'd say more and more along lines of
biographies and stuff,

2938
02:03:13,241 --> 02:03:16,780
like a Red Meat Micky Ward's book,
which is amazing.

2939
02:03:16,781 --> 02:03:18,740
And uh,
um,

2940
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:22,660
that unbroken book,
which is unbelievable.

2941
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:24,730
What's unbroken.
It's,

2942
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:27,250
they made an Angelina Jolie made that
movie about it,

2943
02:03:27,251 --> 02:03:31,840
but it's about a fricking guy's name.
So the runner guy?

2944
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:34,410
Yeah,
he was a runner and then it was a World

2945
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:35,243
War II.
It was a great movie.

2946
02:03:35,490 --> 02:03:37,930
I thought it was really good and like,
oh,

2947
02:03:37,931 --> 02:03:40,300
that was the Japanese people torture.
Nomany went bad dude.

2948
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:43,720
But like,
read that book man,

2949
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:44,950
like,
like the movies,

2950
02:03:44,951 --> 02:03:49,951
like such a small fraction of what this
dude went through and like seeing how

2951
02:03:51,431 --> 02:03:53,710
much stuff he overcome,
not once,

2952
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:56,140
not twice,
like every time you think there's no way

2953
02:03:56,141 --> 02:03:58,000
this guy can overcome this dated again.

2954
02:03:58,030 --> 02:03:58,930
Did it again?
Did it again?

2955
02:03:58,990 --> 02:04:01,450
Did it again,
like on unbelievable stuff,

2956
02:04:01,451 --> 02:04:03,610
man.
It's one of my more favorite books.

2957
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:05,160
Um,
but like,

2958
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:07,840
people like that,
I would say I seek that out and like

2959
02:04:08,170 --> 02:04:10,540
look through,
look for stories of inspiration,

2960
02:04:10,541 --> 02:04:12,040
you know,
not just fighters but uh,

2961
02:04:12,041 --> 02:04:15,280
in any,
in any order aspect of life in general.

2962
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:18,470
I'm seeing the things that people
overcome.

2963
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:19,570
It was,
as I said earlier,

2964
02:04:19,571 --> 02:04:20,404
you,
you,

2965
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:23,260
if you go and look at anyone's story,
who's ever made it,

2966
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:26,230
like you can take inspiration for them.
Like seeing the struggles they went

2967
02:04:26,231 --> 02:04:27,500
through a,
it's,

2968
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:28,990
it's,
it's unbelievable.

2969
02:04:28,991 --> 02:04:29,930
And,
and you know,

2970
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:33,390
when we don't know these things,
we think of ourselves as the only ones

2971
02:04:33,391 --> 02:04:36,700
that have to overcome stuff or are
dealing with things that might have

2972
02:04:36,701 --> 02:04:37,860
slowed down.
But you're like,

2973
02:04:37,861 --> 02:04:39,900
well,
that guy had way worse than I ever did.

2974
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:41,730
You know what I mean?
And that's why I've always treated,

2975
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,630
tried to be very vocal about the things
I've struggled with and overcome.

2976
02:04:45,631 --> 02:04:48,150
And like the first highlight video I
ever had done for me,

2977
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:52,080
it was very important for me to show
myself getting knocked out and dropped

2978
02:04:52,081 --> 02:04:53,010
in all of these things.
I'm like,

2979
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:56,250
everyone just shows these highlights of
their life and it gives you a very

2980
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:59,720
skewed perception of what it is we have
to deal with and go through,

2981
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:02,350
especially to reach a certain level.
Like it's,

2982
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:03,480
it's terrible,
man,

2983
02:05:03,481 --> 02:05:07,440
that we go through a lot and people
don't know because you just see the end

2984
02:05:07,441 --> 02:05:11,300
result of all this hard work and you see
the glamour and the lights and the

2985
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:12,680
highlights and stuff.
But,

2986
02:05:12,681 --> 02:05:15,600
but you don't know what people have felt
overhead come with and dealt with things

2987
02:05:15,601 --> 02:05:16,770
I would crush.
And most people,

2988
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:19,490
I think what's really important about,
um,

2989
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:24,560
inspirational videos and books and
biographies and things along those lines

2990
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:29,370
is it gives you an insight into
someone's perspective that you,

2991
02:05:30,170 --> 02:05:32,030
you,
you can find parallels,

2992
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:36,560
you find parallels to your own life and
it normalizes some things that might

2993
02:05:36,561 --> 02:05:38,930
just seem incredibly confusing because
maybe to you,

2994
02:05:38,931 --> 02:05:42,140
it's the first time you've had to
overcome something that's so difficult,

2995
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:44,750
but then you find out that other people
have done it as well.

2996
02:05:44,930 --> 02:05:46,460
And it kind of,
yeah,

2997
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:47,120
it,
it,

2998
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:49,670
you can,
you can take a lot of comfort in people

2999
02:05:49,671 --> 02:05:50,570
that have gone before you.

3000
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,670
Yeah.
Like we've all had to overcome

3001
02:05:53,671 --> 02:05:55,350
something.
You know what I mean?

3002
02:05:55,351 --> 02:05:59,310
Like just sitting down and talking to
somebody like hearing their story,

3003
02:05:59,370 --> 02:05:59,931
you know,
it,

3004
02:05:59,931 --> 02:06:00,764
it,
it's,

3005
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:03,420
it's,
it can be very inspirational and really

3006
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:05,850
help you overcome anything you might be
facing.

3007
02:06:05,851 --> 02:06:07,980
And again,
that's why I've always been tried to be

3008
02:06:07,981 --> 02:06:12,981
very vocal about my story and share some
of my fight experiences or training

3009
02:06:13,411 --> 02:06:15,360
experience or life experiences.
Because,

3010
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:16,583
you know,
most people don't.

3011
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:18,200
They don't ever hear that side of,
of,

3012
02:06:18,201 --> 02:06:18,960
of,
of,

3013
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,150
of,
of fame if you want to call it that.

3014
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:24,120
Like they don't see that we don't.
It doesn't get put out there like,

3015
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:25,600
like,
like the successes.

3016
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:27,510
Do you know,
you see everyone's success.

3017
02:06:27,511 --> 02:06:29,270
We don't see their failures.
Well

3018
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,420
that's one of the things that I think is
interesting about you.

3019
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:35,560
You're obviously a very intelligent guy
and you're a guy who's gone through a

3020
02:06:35,561 --> 02:06:38,440
lot of things,
but you're also a guy who wants other

3021
02:06:38,441 --> 02:06:41,380
people to know that you've gone through
all these things.

3022
02:06:41,381 --> 02:06:43,460
You're a guy who wants you,
you,

3023
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:46,090
you,
you're assuming not just this role of a

3024
02:06:46,091 --> 02:06:48,550
fighter,
but you're also assuming role as a

3025
02:06:48,551 --> 02:06:53,410
mentor and have a,
an example to those who are coming up.

3026
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:55,520
Well,
it's something that's been very

3027
02:06:55,521 --> 02:07:00,380
important to me because like as I was
coming up before youtube and everything,

3028
02:07:00,381 --> 02:07:02,330
like I didn't really have anyone to look
at me like,

3029
02:07:02,331 --> 02:07:03,710
well he did it.
I can do it too.

3030
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:07,550
So it was very,
it still is very important to me.

3031
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:10,790
One of the most important things to me
to show people that they can do it,

3032
02:07:11,210 --> 02:07:12,043
you know,
into,

3033
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:15,900
to show people when I say how late I
started in,

3034
02:07:15,901 --> 02:07:17,960
in where I was and the things I've
overcome,

3035
02:07:17,961 --> 02:07:21,050
because when you've,
when you've seen that someone's done it

3036
02:07:21,051 --> 02:07:23,600
before you or similar and overcome these
things,

3037
02:07:23,601 --> 02:07:25,510
it makes it that much easier.
Um,

3038
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:28,520
for the next person.
There's a really amazing book called the

3039
02:07:28,521 --> 02:07:30,480
rise of Superman and uh,
I don't know if you're read it,

3040
02:07:30,890 --> 02:07:32,220
they talk about,
um,

3041
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:33,800
like,
like the,

3042
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:35,900
the leaps we've made an athletic.

3043
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:36,700
So,
um,

3044
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:38,350
you know,
they're more talking about like extreme

3045
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:39,710
sports.
And I'm,

3046
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:41,290
one of the things they were talking
about was the,

3047
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:41,771
uh,
you know,

3048
02:07:41,771 --> 02:07:45,670
the four minute mile and it's like,
that used to be physically thought of as

3049
02:07:45,671 --> 02:07:49,210
impossible.
Whereas now it becomes a requirement for

3050
02:07:49,211 --> 02:07:51,490
people to do.
And like kids in high school are doing

3051
02:07:51,491 --> 02:07:53,470
it where,
where were they used to think of it like

3052
02:07:53,471 --> 02:07:55,270
there's no way you can physically do
this.

3053
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:56,790
Uh,
and they were there.

3054
02:07:56,810 --> 02:07:59,500
They brought up,
I think it was like the $900 on a

3055
02:07:59,501 --> 02:08:01,790
skateboard.
It was impossible to do,

3056
02:08:01,791 --> 02:08:05,350
it's like there's no way you can do this
and then a Tony Hawk or whoever did it

3057
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:08,980
and now like eight year old kids can
pull this off because you,

3058
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:13,000
that thing that's viewed as impossible
becomes the norm and as soon as that

3059
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:14,860
happens,
you can get to the next level and the

3060
02:08:14,861 --> 02:08:15,760
next level,
next level,

3061
02:08:15,761 --> 02:08:19,330
and the only way to do that is for
someone to break through whatever that

3062
02:08:19,331 --> 02:08:22,840
impossible thing is and if,
and if these things aren't put out there

3063
02:08:22,841 --> 02:08:26,080
and people don't know about them,
you're still always viewing that,

3064
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:27,100
that,
that,

3065
02:08:27,101 --> 02:08:30,340
that barrier as,
as this is as high as we can go

3066
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:31,820
in that.
In that sense,

3067
02:08:31,821 --> 02:08:34,400
do you think,
do you think of yourself or view

3068
02:08:34,401 --> 02:08:36,740
yourself as a part of this process?

3069
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:37,970
One hundred percent?
Yeah.

3070
02:08:38,010 --> 02:08:43,010
One hundred percent.
I've always felt like I've always known

3071
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:46,890
were speaking about Moitai where,
where the sport could go.

3072
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:48,090
Um,
you know,

3073
02:08:48,091 --> 02:08:50,610
coming up,
I never thought I'd still be actively

3074
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:54,810
doing it while it got out there and got
the exposure it's been getting recently.

3075
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:57,780
Um,
but I always knew I would be a person

3076
02:08:57,781 --> 02:09:01,470
that helped it go along and that was a
huge thing that kept me from ever

3077
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:05,970
venturing fulltime into mma or into
boxing because I was like,

3078
02:09:05,971 --> 02:09:09,960
there's only a handful of us doing this,
me and Joe Schilling and Tiffany and

3079
02:09:09,961 --> 02:09:10,700
Chi,
you know,

3080
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:12,600
in a lot of other people.
I was like,

3081
02:09:12,601 --> 02:09:14,760
if I,
if there's only a handful of us doing

3082
02:09:14,761 --> 02:09:18,570
this at this level and going out there
and taking these almost impossible

3083
02:09:18,571 --> 02:09:21,050
fights and I leave who,
who,

3084
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:22,590
who is there to do this,
who's gonna do this?

3085
02:09:22,591 --> 02:09:25,140
I'll be somebodies.
Got To go through the gate and get

3086
02:09:25,141 --> 02:09:26,070
bloodied up,
you know,

3087
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:28,240
that first person that has to do it.
And uh,

3088
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:30,600
I can't like pass this off on somebody
else.

3089
02:09:30,601 --> 02:09:32,700
I can't give up.
Like that's going to make it that much

3090
02:09:32,701 --> 02:09:34,080
harder for them.
So yeah,

3091
02:09:34,081 --> 02:09:38,220
I've always felt like I needed to be the
inspiration I wanted to see in the

3092
02:09:38,221 --> 02:09:38,940
world.

3093
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:41,850
Do you find a great benefit and being
able to train with him?

3094
02:09:41,851 --> 02:09:42,684
Because

3095
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:47,120
when we first started training together,
I will do it.

3096
02:09:47,121 --> 02:09:49,730
I'll get this adrenaline dumps when I
was sparring with them,

3097
02:09:49,731 --> 02:09:51,800
I was like,
I was like,

3098
02:09:51,801 --> 02:09:53,870
oh my God,
like this is I'm sparring with Kevin

3099
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:56,360
Ross.
And then slowly it will get better.

3100
02:09:56,361 --> 02:09:59,660
And like now we've become great training
partners and he's been a huge part of my

3101
02:09:59,661 --> 02:10:02,000
career obviously.
I mean,

3102
02:10:02,810 --> 02:10:03,600
yeah,

3103
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:04,590
definitely.
Well,

3104
02:10:04,591 --> 02:10:06,420
you're the up and comer,
you know,

3105
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:10,290
I mean,
and then of course you've got guys that

3106
02:10:10,291 --> 02:10:15,291
are coming up that are in the same place
that you were a few years ago and you

3107
02:10:15,691 --> 02:10:20,691
get to see it now that it is this sort
of long crazy chain of events in this

3108
02:10:21,361 --> 02:10:24,120
process that really,
essentially,

3109
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:27,330
you only get a couple of decades out of
it if you're lucky,

3110
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,300
if you're super,
super lucky and it's um,

3111
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:35,360
it's such an unbelievably endeavor to do
what you guys are doing.

3112
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:41,210
And I'm a fucking huge fan.
So to me this podcast was awesome.

3113
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:43,910
I'm like a kid in the candy store.
I hope people got a lot out of it.

3114
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:45,110
I really feel the same way,
man.

3115
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:46,890
We were really happy to be here and you
know,

3116
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,410
I've been wanting to do this for a
really long time,

3117
02:10:48,411 --> 02:10:49,070
so this is awesome.

3118
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:50,510
Let's do it again sometime,
man.

3119
02:10:50,970 --> 02:10:53,360
Maybe when you guys are fighting,
we'll do a fight companion,

3120
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:56,420
how some fights on and coming in and
then we'll talk some shit.

3121
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:57,590
That'd be fine.
Uh,

3122

3123
