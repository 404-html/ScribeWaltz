1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,120
The joe rogan experience or jail?

2
00:00:02,121 --> 00:00:02,370
Man,

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,890
I was in the New York during the,

4
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:04,141
uh,

5
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:04,480
you know,

6
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,920
the hurricane sandy and we were talking
to us a little bit before the show,

7
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,350
but like you got a doomsday prep.

8
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,580
I mean like unfortunately I prepped for
the wrong doomsday but a which one did

9
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,414
you prep for?

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,050
I Dunno,

11
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,370
a invasion of clowns.

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,770
I prefer a good one.

13
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,031
Good one.

14
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:21,661
But annoying.

15
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:24,720
Like clowns will be everywhere and we
have to fight them off with like water

16
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:26,150
guns and stuff like that and wrappers.

17
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,440
Yeah,

18
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,230
exactly.

19
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,770
But in this was like just fucking,

20
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,970
it was like apocalyptic.

21
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,810
It really was.

22
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,710
That's hilarious.

23
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,573
I mean,

24
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,210
did you expect it to be like that?

25
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,800
It was a way crazier than you expect it.

26
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,251
You know,

27
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,410
the thing about New York
though is since nine 11,

28
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:42,900
like our first responders
are like top notch.

29
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,580
They really like step up.

30
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,331
They know what they do,

31
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,800
they got plants and
all that kind of stuff.

32
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,461
But nobody,

33
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,680
I guess expected like New York City,

34
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,170
a tsunami wave hitting us,

35
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,150
knocking out power for like two weeks.

36
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,510
And then there's like Staten Island
Jersey where they got it even harder.

37
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:58,344
But uh,

38
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,560
you take the power out of New York
City and you got Somalia basically.

39
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,640
It's just a freaky,

40
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,001
weird,

41
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:03,780
scary town,

42
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,350
you know?

43
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:04,591
Yeah.

44
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,390
It's really strange when
you see how easy the,

45
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:07,800
the,

46
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,800
the film that covers civilization
can be removed and peak power savage,

47
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,350
it's just becomes absolutely rival real.

48
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:19,560
So you really have to worry about
survival because the first responders are

49
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,131
excellent.

50
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:20,910
Don't get me wrong,

51
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,390
they're great,

52
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,350
they're overwhelmed,

53
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,670
there's just sheer numbers,

54
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,960
impossible to deal with.

55
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,320
There was parts of the city where like I
was just walking around and it was just

56
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,110
dark and like guys would roll up on you,

57
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:31,861
like you can't see him.

58
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,440
And I'm pretty good.

59
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,000
Like nick,

60
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,840
no one what's happening?

61
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,310
It got to roll up on me and I'm like,

62
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:35,581
Whoa,

63
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,570
this is like a Chuck Norris,

64
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:36,751
you know,

65
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,830
that scene and every chuck Norris movie
we still like in the factory in a box in

66
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:41,590
October.

67
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,510
It was like that kind of thing.

68
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:42,661
Like,

69
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:43,500
just weird,

70
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:48,501
scary faces and just sounds like to walk
around a street at night with no gun,

71
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,083
no gun.

72
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,490
I was like,

73
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:53,940
fuck,

74
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,320
what am I going to find him with sarcasm?

75
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,183
What's going on here?

76
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,970
Who were walking like to where you had
to go to and fro in your neighborhood and

77
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,550
there was no lights on for days.

78
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,270
No lights.

79
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,370
It I where I lived there was lights,

80
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:07,320
but when you like we did
shows at the comedy cellar,

81
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,101
which is in the village.

82
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,140
They had no lights up
until almost the last day.

83
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,910
And we're doing shows to generators,

84
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:15,090
which is kind of cool in a way but
bad cause it went out when I was on,

85
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,170
but uh,

86
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,800
and went out and all of these flashlights
and candles started popping out of the

87
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,011
crowd.

88
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:21,930
It was like that scene
in requiem for a dream,

89
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,530
you know that saying like whether like
asked to ask the flashlights on the check

90
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,364
and all that kinda stuff.

91
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,300
So it was really,

92
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,450
it was really a freaky show,

93
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,284
but it was a good show.

94
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,680
But when you're walking around
the streets you're like,

95
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,161
okay,

96
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,851
this is like,

97
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:33,121
you know,

98
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:33,780
what do I,

99
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,620
what can I fight?

100
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,300
Whoever comes at me with,

101
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:40,500
with a weapon and there's a lot of like
homeless people coming off of their meds

102
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:40,831
too.

103
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:43,410
So there's like they have
like the extra evil in them,

104
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,740
you know?

105
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,800
Oh that's right because they can't
get their meds cause there's no power.

106
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,430
So it was like Zombie Style Zombie.

107
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,480
I was walking dead kind of shit.

108
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,500
That's scary as fuck.

109
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,030
Now whizzer a lot of that.

110
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,020
Like was there a lot
of muggings was there?

111
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,353
It was,

112
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,740
there was some looting,

113
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,411
there was whatever.

114
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,760
But it wasn't like Katrina,

115
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,650
cause I talked to guys who were
in Katrina and they're like,

116
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,190
you know,

117
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,581
everybody's like,

118
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:04,900
this is our Katrina.

119
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,711
It's like fuck no,

120
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:08,260
this is like Katrina was
like the end of the earth.

121
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,490
That was the end of the world there.

122
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,140
That was like weeks and weeks and weeks,

123
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,880
no help,

124
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,370
you know,

125
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,530
and no power and it was
hot and all that stuff.

126
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,720
In New York it was a little
bit better than that.

127
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:17,321
That's for sure.

128
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:17,371
It.

129
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:18,204
So I can't,

130
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,421
but it's still,

131
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:19,901
it was bad.

132
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,220
She lets you know what can go wrong
in the biggest city in the world.

133
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:24,431
Yeah,

134
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,120
exactly.

135
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,931
When that happens,

136
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,960
when the biggest city in the world gets
essentially shut down for two weeks,

137
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,130
that's a real eyeopener.

138
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,401
Oh,

139
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:30,860
absolutely.

140
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,210
Let's,

141
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,451
you know,

142
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,760
like people trying to get into
the city and they had to do,

143
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,001
you know,

144
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,220
like buses and all the trains were like,

145
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,130
exactly like somebody should
a kayak through these tunnels.

146
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,911
Just do it.

147
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:40,990
Like let's say like I did it,

148
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,010
I didn't even think about what it
must be like at night with no power.

149
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,980
I didn't even think about it.

150
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,220
Parents stayed inside.

151
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,760
Yeah.

152
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,510
Not have left.

153
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,343
Well you kind of,

154
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,640
it's kind of like,

155
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,260
how do you see where you're going?

156
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,071
It's scary.

157
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,210
So unless it's a full moon,

158
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,060
how do you see where you go?

159
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,063
Exactly.

160
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,491
You know,

161
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:00,160
the scariest thing I saw was
when I was like driving around,

162
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,080
like I was in a cab and uh,

163
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,690
calves by the way were like
incredibly hard to get at that point.

164
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:05,200
But,

165
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,530
uh,

166
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,830
there was like a candle in a
window of a project and I'm like,

167
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,230
this is what it's gonna look
like after a nuclear winter.

168
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:14,020
Like just like one holdout guy in a,

169
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,370
in a project somewhere like,

170
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:15,970
um,

171
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,190
you know,

172
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,540
like Charlton Heston in the light,

173
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:17,890
you know,

174
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,480
in the Omega man kind of thing.

175
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,321
And you know,

176
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:20,770
uh,

177
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,191
I was like,

178
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:21,761
this is it.

179
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,570
This is what it looks like.

180
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,400
You know,

181
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,910
I was,

182
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,480
I was,

183
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,170
it freak freak a lot of people out.

184
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,540
But then I think the guests
thank freak them out even more.

185
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,330
The fact they couldn't get gas for
their generators in cars and shit.

186
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,890
They're online for like 12,

187
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:33,724
15 hours.

188
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,820
Talked to a friend who said he was online.

189
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,050
It was two 30 in the afternoon.

190
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:40,000
He had been there since
six in the morning.

191
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,680
And you still haven't gotten gas easily.

192
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,101
Easily.

193
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,400
Yeah.

194
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,120
That's crazy.

195
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,661
We never,

196
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:44,141
we never,

197
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,100
I don't think even the,

198
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:45,700
uh,

199
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,241
government,

200
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:46,870
local,

201
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,690
whatever state thought like
there's going to be a gas problem,

202
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,260
you know,

203
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,490
and nobody was ready,

204
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,630
so wow,

205
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,370
you need that gas for the generators too.

206
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,840
So Jesus Christ,

207
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,310
especially in bringing everyone down,

208
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,920
but it was getting the
material from it at all.

209
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,551
Oh yeah,

210
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,000
I've got time.

211
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,600
I mean like a,

212
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,900
you know,

213
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,800
the whole idea of like,

214
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,130
um,

215
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,491
you know,

216
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,324
basically uh,

217
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,290
doing uh,

218
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,120
shows like in New York,

219
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:10,420
like the top of the line like guys
who pull the most prone are like,

220
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:10,601
you know,

221
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,710
the hedge fund guys,

222
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,250
you know,

223
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,510
the club Dj,

224
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:13,811
you know,

225
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,060
the male model who's,

226
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,360
you know by or whatever.

227
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,110
But that week it was all like Renaissance
Fair skills like candle maker,

228
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,973
blacksmith,

229
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,350
you know,

230
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,220
any guy who could hook
a bike up to a light,

231
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,821
you know,

232
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:25,541
he would get like,

233
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,374
you know,

234
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,280
definitely at least the reach
around that Yukon man show.

235
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:31,240
Have you ever seen that show?

236
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,380
Those shows were important.

237
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:36,040
They have a generators
that work on waterflow.

238
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,461
Oh,

239
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,390
they take a generator,

240
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:38,500
they set it up at their camp.

241
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,200
They have a fish camp and
they put this generator,

242
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,310
they set it up and then they attach these
tubes to it and they stick to tubes in

243
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,760
the creek and the water coming down
the creek goes through the tubes.

244
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,570
And by the time it,

245
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:49,871
you know,

246
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,670
it focuses in this one area,

247
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,160
it's spins this thing around
and start to generate.

248
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,880
I want that,

249
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,960
I want to get that crazy.

250
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:57,530
I watch and he pulls the cord and

251
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,150
it's going on.

252
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,080
Got Electricity 100% from the
creek spinning this generator.

253
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,940
So as long as this
generator keeps working,

254
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,710
he had his lights on the whole,

255
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,191
the whole thing.

256
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
It's crazy.

257
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,680
That really is the one thing
that you need is like power.

258
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:11,101
You know,

259
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,230
it really is the one thing
that separates us from animals.

260
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,090
Well we've somehow or another
just accepted that that's
going to be around even

261
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:20,330
though it's only been here for 150
years or whatever the hell it's been.

262
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,160
We were so used to it,

263
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,611
you know,

264
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:26,300
a million years of human
beings and 150 years of power.

265
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,980
We're just like this how we do it.

266
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:28,814
We got power.

267
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,800
I could see myself going
to my ex girlfriend's house
and just hanging out and

268
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,390
cause she would have like all
the candles in the rural vrs

269
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
candles a girl has is directly
proportionate to exactly
how long she will cry.

270
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,574
FDF section.

271
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,770
Yeah.

272
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,360
Girls were prepped a little bit
harder than it dude candles.

273
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,020
Mentos you know there's like 30 candles,

274
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:53,590
that bitch just going to cry
for a bomb is petroleum base,

275
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:53,900
you know,

276
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,070
whatever girl Shit.

277
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,810
But uh,

278
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,060
yeah,

279
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,900
we have a lot of different things to
help you in survival situation and I'll

280
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:00,141
tell you,

281
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,810
you know who really did not
step up for this crisis,

282
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,860
the dogs of New York City because like
every other person in New York has a dog

283
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,700
when it's all of these faggot.

284
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,470
He has a little dogs and I was like,

285
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,304
they've been genetically

286
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,691
belt,

287
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:14,950
all the cool like Wolf Kahn qualities
that would have helped look gone.

288
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:15,610
So they were like,

289
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:15,761
what,

290
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:20,230
are we going to do any food there
when the snow hit afterwards?

291
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,560
No,

292
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,490
I was already out of there but that was
like a one two punch of like sad fuck

293
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:24,740
man.

294
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,570
A blizzard.

295
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,210
And the really scary
things that they're saying.

296
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:28,901
Well,

297
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,250
who's the governor Cuomo?

298
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:30,820
Andrew Cuomo.

299
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,180
Yes.

300
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,391
Yeah.

301
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:32,224
He's a good guy though.

302
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,160
He seems like a good guy.

303
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,390
He said something really interesting.

304
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:34,661
He said,

305
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:36,730
I don't want to use the
term climate change.

306
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,190
I'm getting,

307
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm paraphrasing him because
it's such a loaded topic.

308
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,361
He said,

309
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,260
but you know,

310
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,900
his father had to deal with in 12 years,

311
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,270
he had to deal with
two major storm events.

312
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,020
And he's like,

313
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,840
I've been here for 12 months
and I've had to deal with three.

314
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,460
Wow.

315
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,740
You know,

316
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,820
so he's saying like,

317
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,510
there's,

318
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,440
it's very possible.

319
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,430
Something's going on

320
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,740
the,

321
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,780
I think there's definitely something
going on that's never happened in New York

322
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:58,350
before.

323
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,621
Well,

324
00:07:58,621 --> 00:07:59,040
you know,

325
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,310
uh,

326
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,270
a buddy of mine,

327
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,680
I assume you know him too,

328
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,880
a big Jay Oakerson.

329
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,480
Yes.

330
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,560
He's a great of him.

331
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,221
Do you know of him?

332
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:05,461
Okay.

333
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:05,730
Yeah.

334
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,720
You probably haven't worked with them yet,

335
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,000
but really funny guys toured
with me a couple of times.

336
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,200
His house was wiped out.

337
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,590
He was like in the flood
is flood zones zone A,

338
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,443
whatever,

339
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,610
you know,

340
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,720
it really is weird.

341
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,670
Like when a flood comes at your house.

342
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:18,331
So I'm lucky.

343
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,290
I like lift up,

344
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,070
you know,

345
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,360
up in that is skyscrapers.

346
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:24,390
But the scary part about that is like
if the power goes out then you're like

347
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,970
trying to kind of stuck
up there until like,

348
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,580
you know,

349
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,310
whatever happens.

350
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,570
So you're stuck up there
until the water drains out.

351
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,261
Exactly.

352
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:31,501
You know,

353
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,000
it's like a skeleton,

354
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,270
you know,

355
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,050
basically born.

356
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,050
I believe in the theory that it was a
terrorist attack and I think all the

357
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:40,990
terrorists are now high.

358
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,450
Whether ladies with beards,

359
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,210
a Neptune,

360
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,043
Lawton.

361
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,140
Well your first part made sense.

362
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:49,830
The second part just like your Hitler
cat with a fucking dynamite strapped to

363
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:50,281
his chest.

364
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,114
I don't know what you're trying.

365
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,190
And a lot of people were just basically
milling around a lot like fires,

366
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:56,911
you know on the street.

367
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,950
Like people making fires and
quicken out on the street,

368
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,210
which I think they should
allow them to do that.

369
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,520
Well why not?

370
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,170
You know,

371
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,520
you keep a sense of a social,

372
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,930
the exact connectedness.

373
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,233
But yeah,

374
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,670
it was bad with their food shortages.

375
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,190
A supermarket or a question
like the first night,

376
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,140
like everybody prepped in terms of like,

377
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,030
you better buy milk and bread.

378
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,800
They always say that milk and bread,

379
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,431
all the,

380
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:20,671
uh,

381
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,031
you know,

382
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:21,270
uh,

383
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,070
which we're it French toast that we make.

384
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,340
And then like the next day,

385
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,001
you know that you're like,

386
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:27,271
okay,

387
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:28,104
there'll be more,

388
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,771
nothing.

389
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,580
There was nothing left.

390
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,180
All the people from downtown who didn't
have access to food came uptown like a

391
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,290
horde and like,

392
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,070
no,

393
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,601
no.

394
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,270
A watchman call it,

395
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,660
it was good that they did it because
they had no food and they kind of swept

396
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,340
through all the Bodega's
and stuff like that.

397
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,390
So it was like wiped out,

398
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:42,690
you know?

399
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,523
Wow.

400
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,980
That must have been strange.

401
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,211
Yeah.

402
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:45,600
I mean,

403
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,850
like you always assume in
America there's going to be food.

404
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,420
You know,

405
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,850
the other thing is the cell
phone towers were down,

406
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:51,684
down.

407
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,920
Even if you had a cell phone,

408
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:53,910
you couldn't call anybody.

409
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,100
My friend Tommy said he drove,

410
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,560
he drove six hours to
make a cell phone call.

411
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,140
You got to just drive around
until he could find service.

412
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,940
But it was six hours before.

413
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,170
That's crazy.

414
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:04,890
Yep.

415
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,090
Coco had service though.

416
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:06,871
Did you see the video?

417
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:10,560
She was posting of her like in
the rain with ice teas wife.

418
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,463
Oh dear you.

419
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,210
She has special bling
service snapping Sarah.

420
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,650
She had cell phone service.

421
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:15,810
Yeah,

422
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,360
she had cell phone service
and she has this posting,

423
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,350
these awesome videos of
her in the hurricane,

424
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,150
like rain hitting her
while she's wearing like,

425
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,540
nope,

426
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,373
no clothes.

427
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,920
And she's like,

428
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,131
oh,

429
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,680
it's so rainy outside is great.

430
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,660
That's like a videos.

431
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,050
That's how rap video.

432
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,933
Yeah.

433
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,050
[inaudible]

434
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:38,740
okay.
