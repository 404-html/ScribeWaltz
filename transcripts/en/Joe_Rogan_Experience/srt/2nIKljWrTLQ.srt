1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,603
Her low freak bitches.
See they want fame already have the 

2
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:06,790
money.
Right.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,360
Like wanting fame and needing the money 
is such a different thing.

4
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:13,090
That's why the bad girl's club show is 
the greatest thing on TV.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,740
I haven't seen it.
Oh,

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,900
put it.
Bring up a trailer for it.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,910
If you're listening this is going to be 
good.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,190
They just get,
they get it.

9
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:22,024
Like we talked about this eight pieces 
of garbage and then they just fucking 

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,373
make them drink and stuff.
I'm in a goddamn house for three for 

11
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:29,854
three months and it's,
it still has to go to the hospital from 

12
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:34,644
the fights.
One girl this year showed up in the 

13
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:40,270
first day she was there or the one other
girl just said,

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,063
she goes,
these fat bitches are trying to ruin my 

15
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:46,690
birthday and picked up like a rocks 
glass and bounced it off.

16
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:47,524
The girls,
hey like splitter I opened and the and 

17
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:50,134
the things like they have 15 girls per 
season because eight of them get kicked 

18
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,850
off and they have to bring in 
replacements.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,373
Christ.
Season 14 oh will season 15 see if you 

20
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:02,920
can find the season 15 is this year.
That's the one I just watched.

21
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,070
That's to not just grow and go and run 
this renters,

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,510
they feed them booze from morning till 
night.

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Girls just digging stuff in her ass.
We're back.

24
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:21,730
Bitches.
It says Los Angeles,

25
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:25,540
California four oh seven what happened 
this time?

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,600
There was a limo.
They came earlier.

27
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,060
The three of us got and we're more in.
We lock the girls out.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
That's okay.
I don't want to have with,

29
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,910
then we proceeded to go on about the 
other phone,

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,753
Bro.
Stay in the house and they proceeded to 

31
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:40,020
destroy all of our personal belongings 
in the house.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,080
It looks like a tornado just isn't going
to give you any way

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,470
each other's money,
animals,

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,343
so they just can't let the worst people 
they can find make them fuck with each 

35
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,890
other.
These are all girls that in two seconds,

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,670
if you would just give them a porn 
contract,

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,533
they would do it,
but they figure they want to sell more 

38
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:12,804
porns by being a part of this show.
Then you're the girl from the bad girls 

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,260
club.
Why am,

40
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,900
why am I not hearing about this?
More off this show is,

41
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,980
is fantastic.
They are the worst people.

42
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,620
It's garbage.
Then what they do is then they uh,

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,181
they,
they,

44
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,650
you know,
they filmed the whole season,

45
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,963
they edit it,
then they a ferret now while they're 

46
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:40,434
airing it,
these girls now watch the show and they 

47
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:47,760
see that all the girls they thought was 
their friend shit talk behind their back

48
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:49,260
or said they were using them for 
something.

49
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:52,390
All the confessional shit and they're 
just build up this more like,

50
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,663
as much as they already hate each show,
now they're more irate than they have 

51
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,454
like a three part reunion.
They have to break into three parts 

52
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:04,921
cause people rested during the show.
All real hundred percent real.

53
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:07,130
They got arrested during the reunion 
show.

54
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,293
What kind of a person produces a show 
like this genius that has been reading 

55
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,090
my mind or tiring.

56
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,740
Yeah,
because man,

57
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,360
it's sure fire attainment,
they're gonna fuck up,

58
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,710
right?
They're not going to get along great.

59
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,230
They just,
they cut out the middleman of,

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,620
of all the real world was a show based 
on alcohol.

61
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,813
That show was like where it took off.
Where it got exciting was when it'd be 

62
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,574
fueled like no one cared about.
This one's trying to get a job in 

63
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,470
animation and this girl's an aspiring 
singer.

64
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:47,981
It's like,
no.

65
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,690
It goes,
what happens when you,

66
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,690
when that fucking number,
the guy put his finger in the guy's age,

67
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,550
peanut butter and then that was a whole 
thing.

68
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,590
That's what people want to see.
They've cut out all of that like shit of

69
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:00,424
like watching live their lives and have 
real emotional conversations and just 

70
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,050
get them boozed up and then they're 
like,

71
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,663
ah.
Girls were going go karting today and 

72
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,600
then they go kart drunk and then they're
like,

73
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,240
this bitch thing.

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,390
She's better than me.
She bumped in front of me.

75
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,190
I was supposed to be next in the go kart
and that bruise.

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,510
Then they get dressed for the night and 
they'd go out and they fight and fucking

77
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:20,344
bars and limos.
Then they come home and take off their 

78
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,760
shit and put it on better fighting 
clothes and then continue to,

79
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,770
something gets kicked out.
Every episode has two fights.

80
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,640
You should be a spokesperson.
Why don't you narrate it?

81
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,523
The show we wanted to do was I want to 
do a live show where we get the 

82
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,763
transcript.
I want to be like no charlie to get 

83
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,640
transcripts of bad girls club.
You just have dudes read.

84
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:47,641
Cause if you read what they say with any
kind of rational tone of something is be

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,590
a fucking nightmare is actually a great 
idea for a show I'm in.

86
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,773
Yep.
Dude fights they've had this year 

87
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,024
particularly.

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,373
It goes uh,
I'm over there trying to twerk and this 

89
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,110
bitch is like,
you know,

90
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:03,650
she trying to twerk next to me.
She's writing my workspace.

91
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,590
Like bitch can't talk like me.
You shouldn't even be on the same level.

92
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,380
And then it's like having fights like oh
adults of his face.

93
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:13,070
He goes bitch cause you ain't on my work
level.

94
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,070
That's why I'm up in your face cause you
ain't on my worse ca level.

95
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,590
Oh Man.
And then one girl goes,

96
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,410
they throw a punch and then the 
confessionals were all like,

97
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,750
I buy that bitch knows who could work 
now and there's blood.

98
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,600
They throw toasters.
It's insane.

99
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,990
It's hurt my eye from laughing.
Like I pulled something in my,

100
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:35,300
I was laughing so hard.
All right.

101
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,150
Amen.
But if we can do a transcript for you,

102
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,070
that'd be good.
Belly room show.

103
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah man.
I got a transcript.

104
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,450
If you guys want to practice,
shut the fuck up.

105
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,393
Okay.
Um,

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,780
let's do it.
Is this bad and make it a little larger.

107
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,740
Here we go.
Jenna said,

108
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,290
but this is the one from the deficit of 
the ugly duckling.

109
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,380
It was a season ward in 2010 Tanisha,
Tanisha now hosts all the reunions.

110
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,340
She's a big fat black lady.
Hmm.

111
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,903
It's hard to know if you have to,
if you have to get him in to find the 

112
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,030
arguments yet.
That's the thing.

113
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,520
Yeah,
because I just doing them in general,

114
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:09,170
but there's a whole episode would take 
too long anyway,

115
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,670
but just finding like a fight weight 
when they started getting it.

116
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,760
I get to work level fight.
Oh my God.

117
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,594
Yeah.

118
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,560
And then they tried to happen to like 
emotional moments,

119
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,620
like with like a life coach.
But that show would be so much better if

120
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,030
you were narrating it.
Oh,

121
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:24,680
I love,
since you such a fan,

122
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,150
you should reach out to them and it 
really should area,

123
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,540
do they have a narrator?
Nope.

124
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,493
What do now?
Just like the Internet of Commercial 

125
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,920
Shit,
bad girls club.

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,320
If you hire Jay Oakerson to be your 
narrator,

127
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,440
I will do everything I can to promote 
your show.

128
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,670
I will.
I will help.

129
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,110
I will.
I'll put it on twitter.

130
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,290
I'll make an instagram post and it'll 
never stop out on the podcast.

131
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,440
Let's make it happen.
You got it.

132
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,780
You got a gold mine here and do it.
He could do it in an afternoon.

133
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,770
He'll do the whole season.

134
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,723
Okay.
