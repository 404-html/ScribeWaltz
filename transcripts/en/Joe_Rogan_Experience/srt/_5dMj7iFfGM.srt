1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,970
Must be from New York.
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,710
Well you could definitely tell that
four,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,360
three,
two.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,800
And we're live.
John Joseph,

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,190
how are you?
This is like,

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm excited and I'm excited to for.
I think it could set a nice precedent

7
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:21,501
because there's so much fucking toxic
energy between vegans and non vegans.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,370
Even if we're just joking around,
people get so fucking angry and it's not

9
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:27,204
necessary.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,730
Absolutely.
I mean,

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,160
where's the humor?
Where's the comedy?

12
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:32,240
Yeah.
I mean,

13
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:37,160
the other thing is I don't sit around
like I'm not defined by what the fuck I

14
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:37,994
eat.
Like,

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,370
like this dude said,
how come you don't call yourself a

16
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:41,040
Vegan?
I'm like,

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,040
because I do a lot more shit than just
eat plant based food is part of what I

18
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:46,490
do.

19
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,780
But don't you call yourself a Vegan?
Me.

20
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,680
You are a Vegan,
right?

21
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,100
Uh,
I practiced that a lifestyle for sure.

22
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,090
But I don't call myself a Vegan.
Um,

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,920
that's interesting.
I would say people say,

24
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,090
uh,
you know,

25
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,620
how do you,
I don't like to put any type of material

26
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,850
laid label on myself and if somebody
says to me and push the issue,

27
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,170
I'm like,
I'm more of a higher Krishna Bhakti Yoga

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,620
person than I am a Vegan,
you know,

29
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,870
even though I don't wear animal
products,

30
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:21,290
I don't use animal products.
I eat a plant based diet,

31
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,990
100 percent,
um,

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,520
but uh,
to call myself,

33
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:28,730
that just puts me in some,
you know,

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,380
some shelf,
oh,

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,780
it's just another Vegan or whatever the
fuck,

36
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:33,614
you know,

37
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,870
it seems to me as though people are
always searching for an identity and if

38
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:41,020
they have an identity that I'm a,
I'm a carnivore,

39
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:43,990
I'm on the carnivore diet,
which has all the latest trends and then

40
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:47,500
people get really hopped up on that and
that's all they want to do is talk

41
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:51,760
carnivore diet to the difference between
what's happening right now with this

42
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:55,240
carnivore diet.
And vegans seems very similar to me in

43
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,580
that they're very into the identity of
their food,

44
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,880
not their food choices,
but certainly into the fact that this is

45
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:03,850
how they identify.
They talk about it all the time and I

46
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:06,730
just think this photo,
there's pitfalls in that.

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,180
There's traps that people fall into
where they lock their identity into a

48
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,500
group.
Absolutely.

49
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,910
And this is what happens with vegans,
it happens to hunters.

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,990
It happens with Republicans,
happens with Democrats.

51
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,400
It just becomes a group thing.
And then you automatically oppose

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,750
people,
the other group,

53
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,780
and you have like,
you have a conflict with them,

54
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:26,614
you have hate with them.

55
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,370
Do we need more walls?
You don't need more adults.

56
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,730
And I'll tell you what really got it for
me.

57
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,910
And I started doing this in [inaudible]
81 before anybody.

58
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:39,911
I came out of incarceration.
I came out of abusive foster homes.

59
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:44,330
My father was a professional fighter,
tried to murder my mom,

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,790
peter continuously.
I didn't even find out I,

61
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,030
you know,
that I was conceived that of a rape from

62
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:53,060
him on my mom.
So getting locked up,

63
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:58,061
hitting the streets and then meeting the
bad brains in 1980 and seeing them and

64
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,650
who they were surrounded by.
It was a lot of uh,

65
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,220
you know,
people who were into very metaphysical

66
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,610
stuff.
So I got into the yoga and I know you've

67
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:13,090
been doing yoga now too.
So one of the first tenants of the yoga

68
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,710
practice,
which slams all it ish.

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,660
All this label shit is a Hump Brahmasmi
that I'm actually,

70
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,120
my identity is a spirit soul.

71
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,400
It beyond anything in the material
world,

72
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:29,110
any label you want to put on yourself.
So that's really where I come from with

73
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:33,280
the whole thing.
And I think the toxicity level that is

74
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,000
existing now just because of what people
fucking,

75
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,390
you know,
choose to eat.

76
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:42,270
I mean I have my issues with a certain
things that are being done because of,

77
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,340
because of the condition of the planet
and we're not being good custodians of

78
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:52,330
this planet that were in charge for kids
and future generations.

79
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,530
What's being done now.
There's industries that are destroying

80
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,010
the planet.
Like,

81
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,810
you know,
some of it is irreparable damage being

82
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,600
done,
but I really try to keep it

83
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,040
metaphysical,
uh,

84
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,740
with everything I do and who I help.
I mean,

85
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,930
I'm working on a documentary right now
at here,

86
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:15,160
30 year life with hardcore fucking ex
cons.

87
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,920
I just did 20,
25 years,

88
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:18,550
30 years.

89
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,030
If I go in there trying to preach them
some Vegan shit to them,

90
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,500
um,
I'm coming out.

91
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,730
I'm like a fucking like,
Yo,

92
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,020
dude,
this is where I've been.

93
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:27,250
I,
I've been where you are.

94
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,900
People helped me and I'm,
I'm here to help you.

95
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,330
I,
we didn't start out.

96
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,580
You know,
we don't even say,

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,950
you know,
we said,

98
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:36,850
you know,
we're going to put you on a plant based

99
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,710
Diet.
What are you going to do?

100
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,080
Tell them don't wear leather.
Fucking shoes.

101
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,160
Don't do this.
Don't,

102
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:46,480
do you know the whole thing.
Even when Jay z and beyonce is never

103
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,920
enough.
Okay.

104
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,070
They went and did you know they said
Vegan,

105
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,031
right?
Okay.

106
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,980
We were practicing a Vegan Diet.
We're doing a 30 day Vegan.

107
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,200
So what are the vegans do?
Attack them all,

108
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,210
but he fucking leather and it's,
you have to be able to find the spark.

109
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,900
So if you see some goodness in someone,
you have to be able to fan that spark,

110
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,470
not throw water on it.
And that's the problem that's being done

111
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,490
is people are so judgmental because
they've built this walls,

112
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,640
the walls between them that um,
it's just for finding.

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,410
And I was telling the guys,
I trained them this morning,

114
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:27,460
we're doing this 30 to life.
We kipp in Anniston and we're at the

115
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,680
amity foundation where these guys got
paroled.

116
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,341
And I said,
look,

117
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,500
there's two types of mentality in the
world.

118
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,040
There's the Bema mentality that's
looking for the sweet and the good in

119
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,270
people.
And then there's the flies and they

120
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,630
looking for the shit.
I said,

121
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:45,631
when you see shit on a sidewalk and a
dog takes a shit or in New York,

122
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,100
uh,
you know,

123
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,670
a human takes a shared within a matter
of fucking 20 seconds.

124
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,200
There's flies on that motherfucker.
So I try to roll with the PMA,

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,110
which I learned from bad brains,
positive mental attitude,

126
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,790
which Napoleon Hill,
her copped it from Napoleon Hill,

127
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,490
think and grow rich and all those books
on self out.

128
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,200
And it was like he told me no matter
what circumstances you may be in.

129
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:16,060
And I was in the navy at the time in
Norfork fucking smuggling,

130
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,770
fucking up catching cases came out and
took,

131
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,020
took navy over,
going back to jail.

132
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,060
And I was fucking up.
I didn't know what to do.

133
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,040
Fuck out of my mind hanging out with
Henry rollins and Ian Mci and all those

134
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,660
guys in the DC hardcore scene in New
York punk scene and you know,

135
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,480
hanging with John Belushi on fear that
night.

136
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,510
We were the ones that wreck the set of
Saturday night live and just,

137
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,550
you know,
the just doing crazy shit.

138
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,130
And he was just told me,
you know,

139
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,020
whatever you may be going through in
life,

140
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,770
if you keep a positive mental attitude,
you could get through anything.

141
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,740
So how am I going to criticize people
just because,

142
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,921
uh,
you,

143
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:55,220
you eat meat or do whatever.
It's like,

144
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,830
you know,
and some of these people are hardcore

145
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,840
Christians and it's like you're supposed
to say,

146
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:00,351
hey,
what,

147
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,430
you know,
hate the sin,

148
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:04,880
not the sinner or whatever the fuck that
whole philosophy deals with.

149
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,050
I mean,
my point is I'm trying to knock down the

150
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,650
walls between people and unify people,
so

151
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,010
I think what you do good is you,
you're a very positive role model in

152
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,360
terms of hard work,
in terms of your,

153
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,870
your,
your mental fortitude and how you

154
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,990
approach things and I think people need
that and I think one of the things

155
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:27,500
that's going on right now with social
media and one of the reasons why people

156
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,020
will attack Jay z four and leather
shoes,

157
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:32,330
even though they're,
they're looking to stand out,

158
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,030
they're looking to be virtuous.
They're looking to be the person that's

159
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,400
more virtuous than the person.
We're pointing a finger at,

160
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,300
man,
fuck them.

161
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,050
And there's always a lot of fuck people
who aren't this or fuck people who

162
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:44,330
aren't that.
She'd never say fuck people because

163
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,430
people are.
They're just like you.

164
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,680
They're human beings and everybody's on
a different path.

165
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,230
Tell me why you believe the way you
believe.

166
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,900
Tell me why you think the way you think,
and I'll tell you why.

167
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,290
I think the way I think and I bet we'll
find common ground and that's what human

168
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,440
beings need to do more with each other.
The problem with social media is it

169
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:04,490
gives us this them this unusual platform
to get people to pay attention to their

170
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,670
ideas when maybe their ideas aren't even
that good or maybe their ideas are very

171
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:08,570
obvious.
You know,

172
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,430
like you're gonna appointed someone,
hey man,

173
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,650
you know you shouldn't say this word.
Hey man,

174
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:16,730
you shouldn't do this thing because that
we've decided that that's a bad thing.

175
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,050
We've decided that that's culturally
unacceptable anymore and now everyone's

176
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,140
gonna attack for that very reason.
Instead of describing how they feel,

177
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,300
what makes them feel when they say
something,

178
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,340
what makes them feel when they do
things,

179
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,640
where what's going on in their head so
we can all relate on common ground.

180
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,880
People just want to attack and it's a
big problem with social media is way too

181
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,430
young.
It's a new thing and people are using it

182
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:42,860
and he's really fucked up ways.
They don't exactly know what they're

183
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:45,920
doing while they're doing it.
They're not even aware of the effect of

184
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,630
their printed word.
What's going to have.

185
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,050
That's why you have so many trolls and
so many mean people and so many people

186
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,490
just trying to get a rise out of
someone.

187
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,830
They're not even aware of the process
they're setting in motion.

188
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,830
They just know they could push a button
and watch something happened that just

189
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,664
going,
Ooh,

190
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,700
I mean this is,
this is a lot of what's going on today.

191
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,760
I mean,
and some of this stuff is,

192
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,650
is destroying people's lives.
What they fucking do.

193
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:09,390
And they don't.
They don't realize that,

194
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,610
um,
you know,

195
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,790
it,
it's a shame because,

196
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,510
uh,
like when I was growing up,

197
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,210
we didn't have social media,
there was no motherfucking Internet,

198
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,410
there was no,
none of you know,

199
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,440
I remember I had the first pager.
It was fucking gigantic.

200
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,000
So like,
we didn't even have no internet.

201
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:30,660
Everything was word of mouth.
And if you wanted to catch shows,

202
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,780
if you wanted to do this,
if you had a beef with somebody,

203
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,710
you didn't go on fucking social media
and talk a bunch of bullshit,

204
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,680
you fucking walked up to the person and
you said,

205
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,840
hey,
here I am and what the fuck,

206
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,340
let's let's deal with this.

207
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,930
Let's talk about it,
talk it out.

208
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,420
But now you got people buying followers
and do another.

209
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,290
It's just that it's,
you know,

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,340
it's just the most toxic environment in
a lot of ways.

211
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,440
And it's a shame because it could be
used.

212
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,650
And that's why I never post negative
shit.

213
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,410
I tried to use the platform,
you know,

214
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,850
make light of Shit and not have a stick
up your ass.

215
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:11,790
There's too many people that do even the
plant based Vegan thing and everything

216
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,860
so fucking serious.
I'm like,

217
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,810
you might reach more people if you
lightened up,

218
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,130
you know,
like stripes.

219
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:19,420
Lighten up Francis.
Yeah.

220
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,430
I think if you say you eat meat,
well you did write a book called me this

221
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:28,170
proposal.
I'll tell you how that came about.

222
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,350
And actually I got attacked.
I'm going to tell you something else you

223
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,760
want to talk about destroying people.

224
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,330
I got attacked more by the Vegan
feminists for that book.

225
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,740
Fucking tried to destroy me,
everybody because I wrote push now first

226
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,180
of all.
And then she,

227
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,390
she went on a blog and called me a
misogynistic.

228
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,960
I said,
yeah,

229
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,960
like massages the but you know,
call me and misogynistic scumbag and

230
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,490
then fucking piece of shit and all this.
So I just had,

231
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,650
I just wrote a,
Hey,

232
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,540
any of you ladies that bought this book
for the,

233
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,930
for the fellows and it helped them
please fucking Holler at this fucking

234
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:03,270
woman and tell some.
They shut her fucking blog down.

235
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,790
And then she called me a maniac and I
said,

236
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,730
let's call Germanium.
Send people on her the way she sent,

237
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,460
but dig this.
And then I said,

238
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,750
we have,
we have a saying on the streets in New

239
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,280
York back in the day.
Don't start nothing.

240
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,150
There won't be none.

241
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,440
I say,
you know,

242
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,810
but the thing was,
I'm going to tell you how that book

243
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:23,700
title came about because it was a woman
actually Karen Rinaldi from a Harper

244
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,850
Collins wave.
And what happened was,

245
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,590
uh,
I was training at crunch.

246
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Aaron Dragos Winooski is my trainer and
he's gotten me through all my fucking

247
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,640
Iron Mans,
everything.

248
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,700
I was a fucking broken up person,
injuries all this shit.

249
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,220
So I'm working.
I was working at crunch and training

250
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:43,050
with him.
And then another person,

251
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,840
a friend of mine,
all the five points guys used to be

252
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:46,980
there.
You would see them all.

253
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:50,820
They had a ring on the second floor.
So this guy was doing pad work and I'm

254
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:52,110
telling them,
hey,

255
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,100
you know,
listen man,

256
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,460
you got a fight coming up,
man,

257
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,470
get on the chlorophyll,
get onto wheat grass,

258
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,430
get on,
you know,

259
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:01,270
eat as much recovery foods as you can
that's going to fight inflammation.

260
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,280
So some fucking Momma Luke with fucking
19 eighties tiger striped pants.

261
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,510
Fuck it.
Fuck you.

262
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,570
You know,
you're like,

263
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,220
he,
he,

264
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,330
he just took everything out of context.
And then he's like,

265
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,260
you're fucking people that don't want me
to fucking pussies,

266
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,094
you know,
my uh,

267
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,200
yeah,
you got like 50 pounds on me,

268
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:23,620
but if you want to put some head gear
and get in the ring,

269
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,450
I'll oblige you.
He's like,

270
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:27,340
what?
I said I don't eat meat bro.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,020
And then the funny shit with the whole
book title was it was going to be called

272
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,290
to grow green road to health,
fitness and longevity and business

273
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,480
partner Todd Erland goes,
motherfucker,

274
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,920
who are you?
Dr Oz.

275
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:46,240
Nobody wants to hear that book.
Familiar John Blood Clot Joseph singer

276
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:49,140
from the Cro mags they want.
And then I post it,

277
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,830
they will.
And then I said,

278
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,510
yeah.
I said,

279
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:53,860
yeah,
this motherfucker was like,

280
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,230
you know,
saying fucking people that don't eat me

281
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,630
to push these on my motherfucker.

282
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,610
That dude ain't seen his dick in fucking
10 years.

283
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,480
He was overweight and all this shit.
I said that motherfuckers to pussy.

284
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,810
And he's like,
Yo,

285
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,880
you know what?
Throw it back in her face.

286
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:08,230
And I was like,
I don't know man.

287
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,550
That's,
you know,

288
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,220
that's a pretty bold statement.
He said,

289
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:12,911
do it.
Do it.

290
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:17,911
So we released so right away to fuck and
emails and the texts that way.

291
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,620
Yo,
that's how it started.

292
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:24,550
And then we uh,
our agent Dan,

293
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,470
we got hooked up with this guy,
Dan from ICM.

294
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,260
He's like,
met my business partner in the Hamptons.

295
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,103
She's like,
Yo,

296
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,580
that book is fucking dope man.
I think we could get a deal within a

297
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,900
week.
He had four offers.

298
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,370
So you wrote it first?
Yeah,

299
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:42,370
I wrote it first and we put it out.
So it was the thought process behind

300
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:42,700
writing it.

301
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,100
You just had a lot of shit in your head.
Just wanted to get out.

302
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,680
Yeah.
Well I studied writing under Robert

303
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,460
Mckee,
so I wrote my memoir first.

304
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,381
Interesting.
Yeah.

305
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,050
Story.
I fucking that guys like my guru for

306
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:53,671
writing.
I,

307
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,870
I took,
I took the story seminar twice.

308
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,270
He's fucking amazing.
I mean Brian Cox,

309
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:03,271
his portrayal of him and fucking in a
adaptation fucking brilliant spot on.

310
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,980
So.
And you know,

311
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,120
I,
I actually became friends with Robert

312
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,240
with Mr Mckee.
I would.

313
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,880
He smoked like crazy.
Realized.

314
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,060
Yeah.
He smoked cigarettes.

315
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,760
I A fucking CIM lot of writers do,
man.

316
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,900
Yeah,
but not during the class.

317
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,090
So when he had the breaks he would
fucking do like two,

318
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,080
three cigarettes.
I said,

319
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,210
you know,
my friend has an organic green tea

320
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:27,211
extract company and the Polyphenols in
that is going to counteract all your

321
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:29,590
fucking smoking shit that you're doing.

322
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,670
So I gave him five bottles and then
every time he would call,

323
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,090
he would have his people call Yo,
you know that guy fucking Miguel and get

324
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:39,280
them to bring me some more of that green
tea shit.

325
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,470
Did he quit smoking?
I don't know.

326
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,870
I haven't seen him in.
The problem is it gives them a charge.

327
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,770
Some,
uh,

328
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,650
you know,
a nootropic charge fires up your brain.

329
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,770
Yeah.
It's a smoke a cigarette man.

330
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,750
I smoked like crazy.
I used to Kools in lock up and shit,

331
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,410
like,
you know,

332
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,310
because that's what they gave you in
Spofford.

333
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,970
And uh,
and when I went upstate it was,

334
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,110
cools quit.
I quit because I started boxing in lock

335
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:07,640
up and they would have us run this
fucking hill called suicide hill and I

336
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,590
will be fucking puking.
And I was like,

337
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,560
I gotta quit fucking smoking.
So I quit smoking,

338
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,320
they used to do smoker fights in lockup.

339
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,640
So if you had a beef with somebody you
went into this rec room was explained

340
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:21,120
smokers to people,
they don't know what that means.

341
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,810
Smoker,
fights means you just have a beef with

342
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:26,740
somebody and you could just throw on the
gloves and,

343
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:29,960
and go at it.
And as long as it's like reasonably

344
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,500
within 20 pounds of weight difference,
like,

345
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,770
you know,
although in lockup I saw people much

346
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:40,070
bigger people fighting much smaller
people in,

347
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,130
some of them guys.
I mean I was,

348
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,000
I was not good.
I got,

349
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,080
I would fight the black dudes and they
would just beat the shit out of me,

350
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,480
but I would just keep coming back.
You know,

351
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,140
I'm Irish,
I don't quit man.

352
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:52,910
I was [inaudible] then,
you know,

353
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,390
I learned more of the sweet science and
you know,

354
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:59,910
went into the navy and.
And so you quit smoking just for boxing.

355
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,030
I quit smoking A.
Yeah,

356
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,050
for that,
for that reason.

357
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:07,160
But when I was locked up,
I didn't quit almost to the end because

358
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,410
towards the end of your sentence,
they allow you to go home because they

359
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,230
want to reintegrate you back with your
family or whatever.

360
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,630
And I never grew up with my mom so they
would send us home.

361
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:21,620
So we would take the continent
cigarettes and opening up very

362
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,300
carefully,
open up the cellophane,

363
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:28,301
carefully slide the cellophane down and
put joints inside the cigarette pack,

364
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:31,250
slide it back up,
glue it closed the cart and cigarettes.

365
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,720
And that's how we would get the feedback
from the visits because I wasn't smoking

366
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:37,520
weed coming back out of.
Nobody's asked.

367
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:39,160
That was,
I'm like,

368
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,003
no,
thank you.

369
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,830
So,
uh,

370
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,471
that,
you know,

371
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:45,650
so that was the process and um,
you know,

372
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,180
so that's why,
that's why I quit.

373
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,040
But that's the book came,
uh,

374
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,350
I had a lot of shit,
a lot of demons inside of me from what

375
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:57,300
happened to me,
me and my two brothers was,

376
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,770
you know,
pretty severely abused and all kinds of

377
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,510
ways in his foster home,
physically,

378
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:05,870
mentally,
sexually abused by the older kids in the

379
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:06,290
home.

380
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,440
It was fucked up and I never told
anybody,

381
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,240
but that was always something,
no matter how much I lived as a monk for

382
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,910
two years or Hari Krishna Monk,
nothing,

383
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,570
a cure,
that fucking anger that was inside of me

384
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,970
that I had toward these people for what
they did to me.

385
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:24,590
And the secret of like,
Yo,

386
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,500
it's fucked up to say like,
Yo,

387
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:26,931
Yo,
Yo,

388
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:30,530
just do from the streets.
You had knife fights with Puerto Rican.

389
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,590
I,
I got shot with a 22 and forest parks on

390
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,350
angel dust.
I got stabbed and then to try to say,

391
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:39,080
Yo,
this motherfucker molesting me is wwe.

392
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,890
It took a lot out of me too.
And nobody knew it because I never

393
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:46,880
talked about it.
And I took my keys class and that was

394
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:50,190
the turning point because I went up to
him and I was writing a script at the

395
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,680
time based on what happened to me in the
foster home.

396
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,250
The kids in the screenplay.
We based,

397
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,100
uh,
what,

398
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,980
what happened to me,
uh,

399
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:00,360
in,
in my younger,

400
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,920
a period of my life.
And I never told anybody what happened.

401
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,840
I would just avoid that,
but then when I wrote,

402
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,000
I started writing the book and I was
taking his class and between,

403
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,800
uh,
you know,

404
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,570
parts of his thing,
when you went on a break,

405
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,880
you could walk up to Robert Mckee and
say,

406
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,190
ask him questions.
So I said,

407
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:25,191
Mr Mckee as far as a protagonist who was
abused as a kid and he stopped me right

408
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,360
there and he said,
listen,

409
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,070
stop.
Right Day said McGowan,

410
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,220
everybody uses it.
It's a cliche,

411
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,080
you know,
abusive children,

412
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,440
uh,
to develop empathy for characters we

413
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:41,850
could otherwise not give a fuck about.
It's not what happens to somebody,

414
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,810
it's what they do as a result of it.
And that's the fucking light came on.

415
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,630
And I mean,
for years I would sit there and it took

416
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:52,590
me seven years to write the evolution of
a cro magnon and I would get to that

417
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:57,591
part of the story and I will lose my
shit and break down crying like fucking

418
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,190
uncontrollably because of what happened
to me and my brothers.

419
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,260
So I just skipped over that part and I
would never address it.

420
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,270
But then,
you know,

421
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,360
he gave me the strength and a lot of
ways to be able to say,

422
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,070
hey man,
you got to tee.

423
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,880
He wrote in my book,
so I have his book and he wrote to me,

424
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,690
he goes,
John always write the truth and that's

425
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:26,610
when I knew that that needed to come out
in the book to cleanse myself.

426
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,720
I've been two years on crack,
a 88,

427
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,370
88 to 90 crack pills,
you know,

428
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,200
doing whatever getting shot at with
fucking ear fifteens robin deals.

429
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,500
I had a tos or not.
It was chaos at the time,

430
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:44,520
kill on site.
I was,

431
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,300
I was a fucking maniac because I just
didn't care.

432
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:52,470
I actually kind of wish subconsciously
that somebody would put a fucking bullet

433
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,030
at me.
We're doing crack.

434
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,070
A lot of people get molested.
They almost act out to the point where

435
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,530
they want someone else to do it for them
because they don't want to.

436
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:03,970
Yeah,
I was definitely in a lot of ways that's

437
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,740
what I was doing.
But when I took a his,

438
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,940
when that seminar helped me so much
because it's really like,

439
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:15,420
he's really like a fucking a guru and a
teacher man.

440
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:19,380
The man is amazing.
If you ever get a chance to take the

441
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,610
Robert Mckee story seminar,
two,

442
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:22,440
three day seminar.
I took it twice,

443
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,660
then he does workshops.
But the story seminar,

444
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,290
I just walked out of there after the
third day is 10 hours a day and you're

445
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,880
just like,
you fucking,

446
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,200
you like speeches.

447
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,450
Like what the fuck did I just
experience?

448
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,250
It's incredible.
And,

449
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:40,251
and that gave me the power to go and
tell my story the right way and the

450
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,970
amount of emails of people that I
received that will like,

451
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:46,800
Yo,
that shit was done to me.

452
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,600
Thank you for having the courage to tell
the story.

453
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,760
And um,
you know,

454
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:55,360
I just kept writing after that.
So even the meat is for pussies.

455
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,340
A book was,
you know,

456
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,930
if you read it,
it's tongue and cheek.

457
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:01,510
I'm not calling.
There's a lot of dudes that eat meat

458
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,410
that could kick the shit out of me.
I'm not saying what I'm saying is if you

459
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,400
continue to lead a sanitary lifestyle
and you eat this fucked up food that's

460
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,930
out there that they're putting out
there,

461
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,840
that they are knowingly putting out
there to fucking poison you because

462
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,880
they're tied in with the pharmaceutical
companies.

463
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:17,620
It's a racket.
It's it,

464
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,610
it's not a conspiracy has been proven
that this is what they're doing.

465
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:25,090
You will become a pussy dependent on the
pharmaceutical companies to keep you

466
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:26,260
alive.
If you,

467
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,840
if that's what you want,
then this book is not for you.

468
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:30,020
Put it back.
So you

469
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,610
got into Hari Krishnas and you got into
this whole consciousness trip from the

470
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:36,170
bad brains,
which is crazy.

471
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,780
Like think about that.
Like people would assume like,

472
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,810
you think the hardcore scene you think
at a drugs and violence and tattoos and

473
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,110
namaste and you are getting into that.
So tell me about that.

474
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,480
How'd you get into Hari Krishnas?

475
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,820
I'm going to tell you.
So,

476
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,730
um,
initially my first and my first

477
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:56,880
interaction with Rastafarian's,
it was 1980.

478
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,030
So I went to my ship was going to
Jamaica.

479
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,620
So when you go to any,
when you go take this,

480
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,410
let's say you go to any port and they
take you down on the mess deck and they

481
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,700
show everyone,
you go here,

482
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,630
you go there,
they're like,

483
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:12,570
they show you these films.
So when we were getting ready to go to

484
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:13,404
Jamaica,
they're like,

485
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,560
if you're going to use,
and it's these like military films from

486
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,450
like the sixties,
if you're gonna use,

487
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,010
uh,
you know,

488
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:23,670
have sex with a prostitute and make sure
you use a prophylactic.

489
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:28,671
And then the next photo was a fucking
Rastafari in with smoke coming out of

490
00:22:29,221 --> 00:22:31,980
every fucking or FIS.
And they're like,

491
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,850
and under no circumstances should you
talk to these people,

492
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:38,430
they're just going to try to sell you
drugs.

493
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,450
So who the fuck do you think was the
first people I went when I got off the

494
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:45,930
ship because I didn't hang out with like
any of the dudes on my ship.

495
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,130
I got the fuck away from.
I was the only punk rocker.

496
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:51,480
I was wearing sex pistols,
destroy fucking tee shirts.

497
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:55,560
They're looking at me like I was already
into punk rock since the seventies.

498
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,630
So I get off the ship and I meet this
like 20 something year old fucking

499
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:01,860
dread,
dread dude.

500
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,721
And he's like,
yeah,

501
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:03,511
mom,
what you need?

502
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:04,250
I said,
listen,

503
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:04,710
I,
you know,

504
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,960
I'm fucking smuggling some weed back.
I,

505
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,960
I wanna I want to get,
take [inaudible] this other sale at told

506
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:10,231
me,
Yo,

507
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:15,090
you go in there and you get them to take
you to the carving shops and they carve

508
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:19,740
out the fucking statue and they packed
the lamb's bread in there and then seal

509
00:23:19,741 --> 00:23:20,700
up the statue.

510
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,210
And then I had a hookup with uh,
the officer,

511
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,740
the guy who did the watch and counted.
So say every fifth person you got

512
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,280
searched.
So I was always avoided that because I

513
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:35,100
will hit the dude off with some weed or
whatever the fuck it was.

514
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,640
So when I went to Jamaica,
I asked this kid as soon as I got off

515
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,470
the boat,
like there was no hotels in Montego Bay,

516
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:44,550
nothing.
It was just,

517
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:48,590
you took the ship,
the ship anchored out in the bay and you

518
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:52,730
took a boat in and landed at the dock.
And it was just like some fucking

519
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,390
ancient,
like crazy shit like that you would see

520
00:23:56,391 --> 00:24:01,391
back in $1,800 for sale report and then
there's two was eating his carton a

521
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,680
fucking shit.
I might kill 'em.

522
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,020
I'm like French fries and Burgers at the
time.

523
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,951
And I'm like,
Yo,

524
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:07,950
what the fuck are you eating?

525
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,140
What is that shit?
He's like,

526
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:10,100
yeah,
I'm on this color,

527
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:12,510
Lou and Aki.
And he's like Manya,

528
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,010
he shall live to 150 to Ross.
I was like,

529
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:16,701
really?
I said,

530
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:19,490
let me check that shit out.
Took one fork full.

531
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,460
And I just was like,
that's fucking disgusting.

532
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,140
Shit.
Tastes like dirt dude.

533
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,820
What was it?
It was Carla Lou Lou Lou is a green.

534
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:31,370
It's like one of the most nutritious,
Collard Green.

535
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,350
Yeah,
it's like Collard Green.

536
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:38,351
It's like they have a day of Greens down
there that don't really grow anywhere

537
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:40,340
else.
So I think it's like a combination of

538
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:45,020
Kale and Collard Greens.
And then Aki is like this fruit and it

539
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:48,440
looks like it's yellow.
It looks like an egg almost.

540
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:51,290
But if you eat Aki when it's not ripe,
you'll die.

541
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,450
You get poisoned.
It's this type of thing.

542
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,170
Like when the fruit opens up the.
It's like a red fruit.

543
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,660
If you eat it when it's not open,
you will die.

544
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,500
Really?
Yeah.

545
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,200
Aki Aki will poison you.
And then.

546
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,400
And then he was eating seaweed and beans
and anyway,

547
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:09,920
so I went up into the hills.
He took me.

548
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:12,470
Now I don't know if you like reggae,
but I do.

549
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,770
I fucking love Gregory.
So do you know where Peter Tosh?

550
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,250
I'm wanted shredder alive.
Do you know where that came from?

551
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,180
No.
Okay.

552
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:24,500
I'm going to tell you.
So back in,

553
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:27,380
I think it was 78,
this cop,

554
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,230
they hate the roster foreigns in Jamaica
by the way,

555
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:33,620
because it's a big Christian.
The Christians invaded that place and

556
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:38,621
just fucking turned everybody into
dogmatic fucking thinking people to

557
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,890
judo.
You know the what the white man does

558
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:45,500
everywhere across the planet.
You got to be my religion.

559
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,300
Fuck everybody else.
This is what's up.

560
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:52,301
So they did that dad.
So I'm what they call the Jamaicans.

561
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,820
What the rosters called the Jamaicans
who don't grow knots.

562
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,560
They call them ball heads,
man.

563
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,760
You know,
like Bob Marley,

564
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:01,850
crazy ball head.
So what they did with these guys,

565
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,230
uh,
a,

566
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,280
a cop tried to kill Ross,
the foreign and the roster foreign

567
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,240
killed a cop so they put a bounty on
every single Rastafari and wanted dead

568
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,810
or alive.
You could kill a roster and drag him to

569
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:19,490
the precinct and collect a reward.
So all the rosters fled up into the

570
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,610
hills and it was called the Greenbay
killings.

571
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:25,220
They just started killing all these
rastafarian's it.

572
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,750
And so this guy brought me up into the
hills and I met these rosters and the

573
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,480
Nyabinghi,
the drummers and all that shit.

574
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:35,180
And the guy had the actual,
because it was only like two,

575
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,200
maybe three years prior to me going
there in 1980 and I got to meet like

576
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,990
these cats that survived that shit.

577
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,560
And they had the news and all this shit.
So that was like my first experience

578
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:50,070
with the whole roster thing.
And then I met the bad brains one night

579
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,130
at first Ian Mci and all them cats came
down with teenagers and untouchables.

580
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:58,590
That was Henry's whole crew first.
I know Henry's been on here,

581
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,480
I'm pretty good friends with him and our
next week tell him I said,

582
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,270
well,
started fucking love him man.

583
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,140
He's a fucking great human being.
He's a beast.

584
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,030
And yeah,
he was like,

585
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:12,390
when I split the baby he let me stay at
his house and I was eating his food and

586
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:15,590
then after a week of him going to work
and coming home and his food's gone.

587
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,171
He's like,
all right,

588
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:16,661
John,
you gotta,

589
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:18,810
get the fuck out.
Go somewhere.

590
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,940
Not here.
But uh,

591
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,150
they played and then a week later,
uh,

592
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,940
I used to go during the middle of the
day,

593
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,020
uh,
in my car in the navy and go to happy

594
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,410
hour and I'm walking in and the owner
comes out.

595
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,850
He's like,
you got to shoot this fucking band.

596
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:36,960
You got to see this band.
I'm like,

597
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:37,620
all right,
cool.

598
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm going in.
He's like,

599
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:41,610
no,
you don't understand their fucking black

600
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,070
man and there.
They're incredible.

601
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,420
So I go upstairs and bad brains are
sound checking and I'm just like,

602
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,410
what the fuck is this?
And if you haven't seen the bad brains,

603
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:57,411
I'll tell you the best video to watch.
Nineteen 80 to cbgbs they got the whole

604
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:00,240
set up there.
And if you want to have your shit blown

605
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:02,400
away,
just watch that.

606
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,940
So that's what,
uh,

607
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,830
I actually sold their,
their manager acid.

608
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,650
I was selling acid at the time.
So they manage.

609
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,220
I sold him acid,
but I got to talk with her and he

610
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,760
started telling me about this pma shit.
And,

611
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,120
and I told him,
hey man,

612
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:22,320
I fucking got out of jail and went into
the navy because I caught another case.

613
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:24,630
They offer me military.
Here we go.

614
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,810
Is them right?
They're fucking amazing dude.

615
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,330
Will this get us taken off Youtube,
you think?

616
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,570
Yeah.
Sing.

617
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,300
And he's a fucking maniac.
He does a back flip perfectly on the end

618
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,270
of this one song at the movies and lands
it perfectly.

619
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:44,850
That's CBS in 82.
Wow.

620
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,750
I wasn't there.
I was their roadie.

621
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,150
I was in high school.
Yeah.

622
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:51,990
So I was actually living as a Hari
Krishna monk at the time in Hawaii.

623
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:52,500
When?
When,

624
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,330
so how did the Howard Kristen thing?
Well,

625
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,260
I'm going to tell you.
Okay.

626
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,970
So what happened was,
um,

627
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,930
they had,
so I talked with her,

628
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:01,770
he said,
yeah man,

629
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,290
it was really funny because they were
all from DC,

630
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,360
but they talk with Patois accent.
Yeah.

631
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:09,360
Mine jogging arranged mine.
We're going to run into,

632
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,370
to each other again,
you know.

633
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:13,260
So,
uh,

634
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,460
I beat someone down on my shit pretty
bad and I got caught for a drug case in

635
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,680
Norfolk,
so I knew that they was trying to

636
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:23,240
persecute me and uh,
you know,

637
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:28,550
sent me to fucking prison and I was like
really not going to have that.

638
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:34,010
So my ship pulled out and we will go
into like shell back to South America.

639
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,540
And um,
I had,

640
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,490
this day I was on the,
you know,

641
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,530
basically under arrest because the
fight,

642
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,980
it was civilian case for the drugs.
I sold to an undercover cop outside of a

643
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:49,060
club called King's head in Norfork on
Hampton Boulevard was dead,

644
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:52,270
did punk shows.
So I sold him a,

645
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,520
you know,
Lsd,

646
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,630
and he was an undercover cop so I got
arrested for that and then that was

647
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,490
pending.
Meanwhile,

648
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:03,130
I go on my shit,
we go out to see this one redneck kept

649
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:06,120
fucking with me and he was like,
Fuck Eve,

650
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,850
New York faggot.
And like,

651
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,920
just,
I'm like,

652
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,240
dude,
chill,

653
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,140
like you don't know me,
like I'm not fucking with you.

654
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:16,720
Just let it go man.
And he just wouldn't let it go.

655
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:17,970
So,
uh,

656
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,510
I trapped them in the paint lock up.

657
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,590
I was supposed to meet and I beat him
with a fucking paint can in the soft

658
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:30,130
tissues till he shit his pants.
Then they arrested me.

659
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,740
So they had,
uh,

660
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,270
they had me on the fucking ships arrest
and all this shit and I'm,

661
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,790
I got this bad infection.
They had to medevac me off the ship,

662
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,370
back to Roosevelt roads,
Puerto Rico.

663
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,550
And they forgot to say that,
you know,

664
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,840
I'm supposed to be handcuffed to the
fucking bed.

665
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,740
And then,
uh,

666
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,810
they cut.
They didn't send those orders because

667
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,360
this was pre computer.
So the paperwork I fucked up,

668
00:30:55,361 --> 00:31:00,361
they gave me my id and then they sent me
back to Norfolk and then,

669
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,770
uh,
I was just doing all my shit.

670
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,870
And so they just didn't know that you're
supposed to be incarcerated.

671
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,650
They didn't know that I'm supposed to be
awaiting court,

672
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:09,780
poppy,
court marshal,

673
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,600
whatever the fuck.

674
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,660
And then the civilian case too.
So then,

675
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,410
uh,
I was inimitable,

676
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,360
which is Tpu,
transient personnel union waiting for my

677
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:22,750
ship to come back and they were going to
deal with it then.

678
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,850
So I was there for like,
I dunno,

679
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,260
like a month and a half.
And,

680
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,760
and they were like,
Yo,

681
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,550
your ship.
The dude I was cool with,

682
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,401
he warned me.
He goes,

683
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:33,940
Yo,
your ship is fucking talking today.

684
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:35,230
And I was like,
fuck.

685
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,150
I was like,
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

686
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:42,151
So I just packed up a couple of things
and I got on the bus that used to go

687
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:44,740
through the base and then roll out
Hampton Boulevard.

688
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,120
And as I'm fucking day I had already
pulled in.

689
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,930
And as I'm pulling out the gate in the
seat,

690
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,610
the fucking master at arms of my ship,
the police are right there walking

691
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:59,190
across the street to fucking them.

692
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,710
It's all to get me.
And I just shrunk,

693
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,680
shrunk down in the seat.
But if they would've looked up,

694
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,470
that was it,
I wouldn't be here telling you this

695
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:12,520
story because my life would have taken a
much different trajectory.

696
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,250
So what happened was I went up and I
hitchhiked with his band,

697
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:18,910
the undead from New York.
This punk band,

698
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,440
bobby
bobby still was an original misfits.

699
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,080
So they,
they played the 9:30 and they gave me a

700
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:31,081
ride back to New York and I get out the
van and right there on avenue a one 71

701
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,340
was motherfucking h on the doorway with
a recorded and lived.

702
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,560
He's like Ross stuff far.
I'm like fuck.

703
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,780
And what happened was they were playing
a show a couple of days later and

704
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,110
there's a big Puerto Rican gang that was
right there that didn't want them

705
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:50,510
hanging out.
So they went in there one night and

706
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,300
they,
I mean they,

707
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,190
they killed people.

708
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,990
I'm not going to say the name of the,
of the fucking gang because for

709
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:57,980
whatever,
you know,

710
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,260
I'm not trying to out him like that.
But they were,

711
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:02,990
had the largest heroin cocaine spot in
America.

712
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:06,300
The feds busted,
busted them knock down there building

713
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:08,420
the whole shit.
Alphabet city was out of fucking

714
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,560
control.
So nobody.

715
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:12,950
The beastie boys were there that night.
Nobody would fight these dudes back.

716
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,250
And I was on a fucking qualia,
which is gorilla biscuits.

717
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:21,200
You think you got crazy strength and uh,
I said to j Dot Lee,

718
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,630
who was the engineer that shit.
I was like,

719
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:26,540
Yo,
let's get these motherfuckers man.

720
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,260
And he's like,
dude,

721
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,820
they kill people.
Don't fuck with them.

722
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:31,280
They will kill you.
And I was like,

723
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:31,881
Yo,
come on,

724
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:34,790
you fucking do your punk rock is
supposed to be fucking tough.

725
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:38,180
Let's fucking get these guys.
So they calmed me down.

726
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,670
But when I got outside,
the dude tried to stab me.

727
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,120
So I blocked the knife and I hit him
with an elbow and pop out.

728
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:46,520
Bob knocked him down,
smashed his head off the curb.

729
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:49,640
Next thing I know,
four of his homies come charging at me.

730
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,370
Yo,
you white motherfucker trying to stab

731
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,470
me.
And I used to wear a chain belt and you

732
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:57,050
can ask Henry.
We all used to wear these chain belts

733
00:33:57,051 --> 00:34:00,950
with a quick release,
a bike chain to fight people because in

734
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:05,420
dc it would be the marines would fucking
or the rednecks would beat up the punk

735
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:07,970
rockers.
So I got in a fight with these

736
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,980
motherfuckers and I ended up,
so I go to run back into one 71 because

737
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:16,280
I lost the chain and one of the beastie
boys slams,

738
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,770
tries to slam the door.
I mean it keeps me out on the street.

739
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,350
These motherfuckers want to kill me.
I pushed my way in.

740
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:25,280
I got stabbed in the shoulder and then
they put out a kol on me.

741
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:26,930
They were like,
we're going to kill that motherfucker.

742
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,931
Nobody would hang out with me except for
this one crazy Russian street fighter

743
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:34,580
kid named James Concert.
That's the only dude.

744
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,600
So then I said I couldn't go down the
alphabet city at all.

745
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,330
They were waiting there with fucking
guns and bats and like,

746
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,590
we're going to kill that dude.
But because the bad brains were black,

747
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,040
they kind of squashed it over.
But I went up there to face him and they

748
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:57,071
surrounded me like fucking dude was like
ready to fucking off me and doc and

749
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:59,190
Darryl Docs,
the guitar player,

750
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,860
the Bass player came running out,
Yo,

751
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:01,191
Yo,
Yo,

752
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:01,911
Yo,
Yo chill,

753
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,920
chill.
And they were like,

754
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,010
you know,
he was just,

755
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,120
you know,
standing up like y'all came in,

756
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:09,290
they're trying to stab everybody.

757
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,340
You would have done the same shit.
And the one dude's name was crazy eddie.

758
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,260
And uh,
he got,

759
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,460
I think he got murdered now,
but he did mad time and he just looked

760
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:22,970
at me and it was that moment or this
standoff where I didn't know what the

761
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:26,390
fuck he was going to do,
but he just goes out to all the white

762
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,790
motherfuckers over here.
You're the only one with heart.

763
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,070
We ain't never gonna fuck with y'all
again.

764
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:35,420
Just don't hang out outside the store
front because there was gigs at one 71

765
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:38,310
a.
that's where bad play beastie boys.

766
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,730
And then the bad brains let me move in.
And then they recorded our first album,

767
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:48,240
which MCA for the bad brains.
Greatest Hardcore punk album of all

768
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,220
time.
The Rock has set the lightning bolt.

769
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,460
Smith.
I was there for the whole recording and

770
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,880
uh,
then they got me a job and this is where

771
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:58,260
the Christian thing comes in.

772
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,240
I always,
I always come full circle.

773
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,710
But uh,
so this punk band named the dots who put

774
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:07,800
out the first bad brains,
single Jimmy quit was in a band and he

775
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:12,690
put out a single quote,
stay close to me and pay to come and

776
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,470
vinny work that this health food store.
So they started giving us food and

777
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:20,060
that's when I started changing over to
the Diet because bad brains were like,

778
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,440
you.
Hr would be like,

779
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,290
you don't eat the fuckery.
You don't eat the Babylon food.

780
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,520
You got to eat it.
I tell is vitas can be fatal.

781
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,780
Took me to the hell it is.
I tell it means pure,

782
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,560
pure plant based food.
No,

783
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,570
no oil,
no fucking salt.

784
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,740
It's like oil.
Yeah.

785
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:38,640
Dude.
This district,

786
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,660
it's like the avocado oil.
Coconut oil.

787
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,940
No,
like if you take coconut and you and you

788
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:48,480
fucking shred it down so fine at the oil
comes out of it,

789
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:49,020
that's fine.

790
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,650
But they don't do processed oils.
That's a different thing when you

791
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:55,670
process the oil.
If you have health problems like what

792
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,680
they proved in forks over knives,
then it becomes a toxic oil to the body

793
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,350
and if you have any kind of heart
conditions and stuff like that,

794
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:06,450
you should be really avoided.
So anyway,

795
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:10,110
what they did was they got me,
they were smart because they wanted me

796
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,820
to give them free food,
the bad brains,

797
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,060
and they got me in the health food store
and the dude was like,

798
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:18,900
this hippie Yogi dude hooked up with
Satchidananda Swami.

799
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,690
It was called Pronto foods.
And he's like,

800
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:24,660
well,
you're going to do Karma Yoga when you

801
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,010
first come in here.
In other words,

802
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,170
you're not going to get any money.
You're going gonna,

803
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:31,440
you know you can eat and it's Karma Yoga
is good for your Karma.

804
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,350
So then I told everybody in the
motherfucking neighborhood,

805
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,184
I was like,
Yo,

806
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,710
I'm working at this health food store.

807
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,020
Come over and get some food.
So bad brains would come and load up

808
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:42,650
groceries.
I worked at juice bars given our fuck

809
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,440
sandwiches didn't.
Entire neighborhood due to sit there

810
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,180
watching me and after the end of the day
he goes,

811
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,050
excuse me,
did,

812
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,390
did any of those people pay for that
food?

813
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:51,901
I go,
Nah,

814
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:54,270
man,
that's that Karma Yoga Shit you talking

815
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,350
to me about.
He's like,

816
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,070
you're on salary as a tomorrow,
do not give away any more food.

817
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,910
So then I was like,
I worked there for a little while and

818
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,570
vinny took me to the Hari Krishna Temple
on 55th street.

819
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,420
So I kept trying to defeat this dude.
Philosophically.

820
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,500
I was like,
Yo.

821
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,960
But,
and he knew the whole philosophy of the

822
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:15,900
Vedas and the Bhagavad Gita is where all
the yoga

823
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,020
or the yoga sutras and all of that comes
out of the Bhagavad Gita and prob.

824
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:24,120
I put out the Bhagavad Gita as it is,
which,

825
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,400
which the original Bhagavad Gita from
India.

826
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,290
And uh,
I kept trying to defeat it all the time.

827
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,290
Every day I read Bhagavad gita stream on
bog of the time.

828
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,820
What do you think?
Who Soma?

829
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,060
What's does Salma Salma Ross?
So morass that is a drink that they

830
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:44,620
drink on the heavenly planets.
It's a,

831
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,710
it's a beverage on a heavily planets
that they get in toxic intoxicated.

832
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,660
The big question is like,
what's in it?

833
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,050
No one knows.
There's elements.

834
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,050
You know when people say you didn't use
lying on the planets.

835
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:57,820
I'm like,
what are you fucking Momma Luke?

836
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,120
Of course there's life on other.
You think you're the only fucking life

837
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,140
in the universe.
Come on,

838
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:02,801
man.
Well,

839
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:07,540
that's one of the things in the Bhagavad
Gita is a flying crafts and Soma is one

840
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,270
of them.
Someone's one of the interesting things

841
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,890
rather and Soma,
they.

842
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,200
It's some sort of a psychedelic
concoction,

843
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,820
but nobody knows exactly what it is.

844
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,220
They think it might be a combination of
several things.

845
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,370
They think for sure psilocybins in it,
but they think it might also be hashish

846
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,710
that has.
She might be in it.

847
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,070
Yeah.
I mean there's elements in the,

848
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:31,720
in the upper planetary system that
Brahmaloka and all these different

849
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:35,650
planets in the solar.
The vedic astrology is much different

850
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:40,651
than the western astrology,
so they talk about planets way above

851
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,350
earth.
You know that,

852
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,470
what they're teaching you,
the Bhagavad Gita,

853
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:45,800
the.
What do they describe Soma,

854
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,520
so like what are they called it Soma
Ross,

855
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:51,750
and it was a beverage that's drunk in
the heavenly planets.

856
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:56,770
It's not available on the earth planet
is is the demi gods drink soma,

857
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:59,620
Ross demigods on,
on other planets.

858
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,540
That's the only time people drink it.
She did she bite,

859
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,150
smoke the Ganja and stuff like that and
I don't know,

860
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,880
you know,
they put the ashes to the crematorium on

861
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:11,320
their bodies and stuff like that.

862
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,460
But they,
you know,

863
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,270
the thing about,
there's four principles in the Hari

864
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,550
Krishna when you live as a Brahmin monk,
which I did,

865
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:21,930
and it's no intoxication at all.
No,

866
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,440
no eating of meat,
fish,

867
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:24,370
eggs,
none of that.

868
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,520
No gambling and no.
We'll listed sex.

869
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:32,521
So I was actually a 100 percent brahma
choice celibate monk for how long?

870
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,340
For two years.
And I trained martial arts in Hawaii and

871
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:41,341
the hills with this one black dude who
was fucking fierce and he was a Brahmin

872
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,740
Shari too.
So we would train and completely

873
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,620
celebrate.
I was getting up 2:00 every single day

874
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:51,250
in the morning.
I was in bed by eight and training and

875
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:53,440
working and just,
you know,

876
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:54,790
trying to heal my,
uh,

877
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,470
my assault.
But that came because when I first was

878
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:02,500
going to the temple I wrote,
I would write down my questions.

879
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,960
I know I'm going to get these
motherfuckers tomorrow because I was

880
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:07,190
reading Gorgie,
Krishnamurti Rom dots.

881
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,660
Like I studied it.
I know I saw all those guys.

882
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:15,130
Uh,
I went to see a krishnamurthy speak and

883
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:15,964
meditate.
I was,

884
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,400
I was just eating it up.
Like once that light came on a

885
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,370
metaphysically for the meditation and
the Yoga and everything,

886
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,150
I just went full bore into it.
So it started from the health food

887
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:28,810
store?
Yeah,

888
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,800
because store mini signal rally who's
now the drummer for the unsane.

889
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,060
He still plays drums.
He was in the dots.

890
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:41,720
He was in turbo hydromatic.
It's a bunch of bands in New York and he

891
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:44,780
just started hitting me with questions.
What do you think?

892
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:45,890
This is what he thinks.
I was like,

893
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:49,160
I don't know man.
And then after giving me this book,

894
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:51,920
He gave me this book called the science
of self realization.

895
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:53,540
And I read it and I was like,
dude,

896
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,300
this Yoga Master Ac Bhaktivedanta Swami
Pot.

897
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,360
I was like,
I got to find out more.

898
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:00,740
Whereas this guy,
and he said,

899
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:03,080
oh,
he left the planet in [inaudible] 77,

900
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,020
but you could go to the temple and see
the whole process.

901
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:06,651
I was like,
Yo,

902
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,770
I want to call.
And I went and they had this ceremony

903
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,240
and it's called greeting as a dds.
And then the song that gets played,

904
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:17,900
George Harrison plays Bass on it and I
was like,

905
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,200
Yo,
it was from the promise some heater.

906
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,840
And I was.
I just was attracted to it.

907
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,890
Everything I've known in my life was
pain and violence and just fucking

908
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:29,060
crazy.
I mean,

909
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:32,770
you know,
so it was a pathway to some sort of an

910
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,660
escape from the Pr,
the trappings of your past.

911
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,230
It was a pathway to enlightenment.
It was a pathway to peace.

912
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,060
Absolutely piece.
But some of the most fierce warriors.

913
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,270
And what I loved about Bhagavad Gita is
spoken on a battlefield between

914
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:48,180
Christian on Juno.

915
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,050
Juno was [inaudible] Krishna's this
line,

916
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:53,420
this,
this sound pro diet comes from the

917
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:56,990
warrior class.
And if you read any books on martial

918
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,460
arts,
they're going to tell you the martial

919
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:02,250
arts originated in India,
the original martial arts school.

920
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:07,251
We're all in India and at one point
Sanccob charia chased all the Buddhists

921
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,030
out of India and they fled across the
Himalayas into China.

922
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:16,031
So this is actual history that you and
you can see where the martial arts

923
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:20,510
spread out across across the planet,
but you know,

924
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,240
a lot of it,
uh,

925
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,870
a lot of things that are around today
originated in India.

926
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,470
So to me that really,
I was always in,

927
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,360
you know,
I was a street fighter.

928
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,420
I messed around,
uh,

929
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,530
even,
you know,

930
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,050
with some going to martial arts schools,
always on the outskirts.

931
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,430
I even went and trained with Ron van
Cleef when he had his school in New

932
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,430
York.

933
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,020
But yeah,
but he would,

934
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,330
he would always be trained in police
forces.

935
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:51,390
And I was the only white dude in the
class and it was all black and Puerto

936
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,690
Rican.
And when it came time to spot,

937
00:43:52,691 --> 00:43:56,210
they beat the shit out of me.
I was getting fucking wrecked by the,

938
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,860
by the black belts.
Byb,

939
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,810
uh,
you know,

940
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:01,970
I was no lights barnbrook then.
No nobody water.

941
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,790
There was schools,
victim Vega,

942
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,490
Ron van Cleef,
Ron Tag,

943
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:08,950
and now she does do doc,
uh,

944
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:09,920
uh,
uh,

945
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,350
this other dude named Rodin who ran the
school,

946
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:16,550
University of streets,
they would run from into the Dojo like

947
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:21,480
20 dudes and just all out fucking Bra.
Like even Brian Callahan,

948
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,510
his teacher and all these guys,
they train under master Choi and some

949
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:31,811
them joy and he encouraged you to fight.
You are training to fight.

950
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,430
Like

951
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,090
it was very common back then.
That was a big part of it because you

952
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:39,510
had to develop people that could
actually perform in competition and one

953
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,030
of the best ways to do that was deaf
challenge matches.

954
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,430
So like what you're talking about,
smokers,

955
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,640
they used to allow that in la up until
real recently,

956
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,180
over the last 10 years or so,
they banned smokers but used to be able

957
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:56,181
to get your experience in actual fights,
the smoker and that was a little bit

958
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,330
more prepared than the Dojo storming
days.

959
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,060
But the Dojo stormy days,
that's how a lot of people go.

960
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:03,930
Good.
And said like,

961
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:05,820
you have real fights,
he would go in there,

962
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,340
some guy would come from another school
and you knew you going to hit each other

963
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:09,510
as hard as you could.
It wasn't.

964
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:11,010
It wasn't.
It wasn't really sparring.

965
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,130
Well,
I'll tell you a lot of that spun into

966
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:16,580
gang bonds too because a lot of people
that were the martial arts teacher,

967
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,350
this one dude jr,
he's famous.

968
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:21,470
He was in the New York Times.
He was one of the biggest heroin

969
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:24,650
traffickers on the lower east side.
He was one of the first guys to get

970
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:29,651
busted onto the rico statute.
He did the full 25 and he trained all of

971
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:35,270
the dudes as Sol for him and all his
street soldiers were all trained in

972
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:38,360
martial arts.
So a lot of these guys were doing shady

973
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:43,190
shit behind the scenes because that's
what alphabet city in the lower east

974
00:45:43,191 --> 00:45:47,810
side and that's what New York was about.
I'm actually good friends with tae mock

975
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,960
time mark in the last dragon time.
Mocks father is a Christian.

976
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,290
His name is cosmo.

977
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,730
I met him in La like fucking 20 years
ago.

978
00:45:57,731 --> 00:45:58,750
He came to a show,
I was like,

979
00:45:58,751 --> 00:45:59,800
that's the last dragon.

980
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,760
Yeah,
well,

981
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:01,900
you know,
he,

982
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,000
I won't say names,
but he out is somebody that tried to do

983
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:10,720
some shit to him in and they blackballed
him in Hollywood and the guy say,

984
00:46:10,721 --> 00:46:12,820
you're never going to make another
motherfucking movie,

985
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:15,820
and he hasn't.
He got fucking dude.

986
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,020
He that happen a whole cogan.
Somebody tried to fuck Hulk Hogan.

987
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,450
Yeah.
Imagine a giant human being.

988
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,040
I was like,
I'm going to suck your Dick.

989
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,030
And he's like,
no brother.

990
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,880
Real step up to the slim.
This is like this Terry Cruz thing or a

991
00:46:34,881 --> 00:46:38,020
lot of people made fun of Terry crews
because how does this big stud of an

992
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:40,450
athlete,
who cares if who grabs your Dick just

993
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:42,100
swat that guy in the head,
but he's saying,

994
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:43,100
no,
this is a.

995
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,800
This is a system systemic problem.
When you have people that are in power

996
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:52,150
and they control your destiny and that's
where a lot of that they'll ruin you may

997
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,991
have.
And they did.

998
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:53,770
A lot of people

999
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,760
listen like the whole like,
you know the whole me too.

1000
00:46:57,761 --> 00:46:58,690
Shit.
First of all,

1001
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:03,810
my mother was raped twice,
so if some dude is pushing his weight

1002
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,550
around a on a on a female,
I think that Shit's fucked up and then

1003
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:12,250
they're going to turn around and fucking
fuck these people.

1004
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:15,490
I say,
fucking get him the fuck added here and

1005
00:47:15,491 --> 00:47:19,510
I'm going to tell you a story because
I'm Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips

1006
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,420
date.
They've fucking produced one of my

1007
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:27,160
favorite movies of all time,
which was taxi driver and close

1008
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:28,900
encounters.
They did all those movies.

1009
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,960
She wrote a book called,
you'll never do lunch in this town

1010
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:33,430
again.
In the eighties.

1011
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,850
She had the cro mags come and play in a
movie at the rich.

1012
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,270
They flew us off the motorhead tour,
picked us up in limos.

1013
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,880
She wanted to shit to be lip song.
I said,

1014
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:46,930
now if you want the cro mags is a
fucking real show and we're going to

1015
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:47,890
fucking lay it down.

1016
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,890
We had like a thousand of our fans.
They will tape do just crazy shit.

1017
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,860
And two people broke their necks during
the shooting.

1018
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,030
So the movie's called.
It's called the beat.

1019
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,100
Yeah.
But the thing was,

1020
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:05,101
she was one of the first people to put
out an expose these fucking scumbags for

1021
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:10,261
doing that shit to people in Hollywood
exposed a lot of that in a book that you

1022
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,890
never do lunch in his town again.
And when the book came out she was on

1023
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:19,180
the set for interview with a vampire and
they came and pulled it off the set and

1024
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:22,180
she was fucking blackballed from fucking
Hollywood.

1025
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:25,720
She never made any more fucking movies.
And then even pre internet,

1026
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:28,650
this was pre internet and get away with
things like that.

1027
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:31,570
But she just fucking put up the middle
finger to all of them.

1028
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:32,321
Like,
fuck you.

1029
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,030
She,
she passed away of cancer.

1030
00:48:34,031 --> 00:48:37,870
But she was like a real fucking punk
rock a man she fucking took on the

1031
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:40,330
system,
the boy's Club in Hollywood.

1032
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,970
And you know,
even the shit,

1033
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,430
I don't know how legit decore filming,
you know,

1034
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,000
stuff is.
I know him and whatever.

1035
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:50,290
But like she's saying

1036
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,600
problem that you don't.
Yeah.

1037
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,270
It's one of those things where I don't
know what to do.

1038
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,580
Yes,
there's some shenanigans,

1039
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,040
but I know that it's something happened.
Yeah,

1040
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,660
I know it,
I know it goes on,

1041
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:01,490
something happens,

1042
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,250
not just him.
I mean the list is a mile long and for

1043
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,040
everybody that comes forth is a million
people that are sitting back on,

1044
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,850
I don't want to say anything because I
don't want to take that shame on.

1045
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,420
Well,
that's what happened with me.

1046
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:13,010
You know,
it was the same day like,

1047
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,061
uh,
you know,

1048
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:15,920
you have this wrapping,
whatever the fuck,

1049
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:18,470
but that's all false ego.
Even all of that stuff.

1050
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,520
And then the person that I was with at
the time said,

1051
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:24,680
you know,
this story is going to help a lot of

1052
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:29,681
people you by you coming forward and
saying what happened to you and how

1053
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:31,810
you're dealing with it now.
And that's what,

1054
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,160
that's what I even did.
I got this new book,

1055
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:38,420
the PMA effect coming out and the whole
shit is about healing people and help.

1056
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,390
I mean,
I've helped thousands of people kicked

1057
00:49:41,391 --> 00:49:44,600
drugs,
kick a suicidal thoughts.

1058
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:45,820
Uh,
and,

1059
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,570
and you know,
it's not that I'm like,

1060
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,850
I'm turning him into a Vegan.
It's like,

1061
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:52,540
dude,
I'm going to show you the system that

1062
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:55,160
worked for me.
That's all I can do is tell you,

1063
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,770
I'm like the fucking mailman,
you know,

1064
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,320
I'm just delivering the fucking mail to
you.

1065
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:04,220
I didn't come up with it,
but I'm showing you the yoga to plant

1066
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:06,440
based diet,
to meditation,

1067
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,530
to training,
constantly fucking training.

1068
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,140
Well through all the things you're
doing,

1069
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,190
you're committed and you're,
you're disciplined and that's attractive

1070
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:16,001
to people,
right?

1071
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:19,540
People look to for people that are doing
things that they wish they were doing,

1072
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,880
so they see someone.
I mean that's the whole cult of

1073
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:22,691
personality,
right?

1074
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,400
They see you,
they see you,

1075
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,220
you've got this powerful personality and
your positive and you're doing

1076
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,700
things and people gravitate to that and
they want to be a part of that.

1077
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,620
I mean that's,
that's what happens with people,

1078
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,830
but the first thing that I,
and I said it because vice did a whole

1079
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:38,480
18 minutes special on me.
If you,

1080
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:43,481
if you just google a fucking a Vegan
iron man,

1081
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:47,000
this shit comes up.
They did an 18 minute documentary and

1082
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:48,460
one of the things I said,
first off,

1083
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,300
don't say you can't do it.
You could do any fucking thing.

1084
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:56,300
You apply yourself too,
you just haven't tried.

1085
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:59,820
You could do what I'm doing and I'm
going to tell you I go to racist,

1086
00:50:59,821 --> 00:51:03,320
these iron mans all over the fucking
world and these guys show me pitches.

1087
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:06,860
One guy was fucking.
He lost 100 fucking pounds.

1088
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:09,800
Dude was so depressed.
He was on meds for depression,

1089
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,040
so everything that I'm doing is coming
at a service.

1090
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,430
It's service to help people.
It's not.

1091
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,280
I come at them right from the same
fucking platform I'm like,

1092
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,150
and even the Vedas,
what does it say?

1093
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,790
Not a piece.
Han and throw money down an idea Yaka.

1094
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:25,880
Danielle said that,
hurry.

1095
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,430
You should think of yourself lower than
destroying the street,

1096
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:33,050
more tolerant than a tree.
Always ready to offer respect to others.

1097
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,920
In that state of mind,
one can constantly chant the holy names

1098
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:39,470
of Hari Krishna.
So that's the philosophy.

1099
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,570
So where is the false ego?
And thinking,

1100
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:44,750
I'm better than you because I eat a
motherfucking vegetable and you eat a

1101
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:48,170
fucking piece of meat or whatever.
It's not about that.

1102
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,850
It's about trying to help people and
have compassion to people and that's

1103
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:56,690
something that's really getting lost in
this world is compassion.

1104
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,760
Everybody wants to kick people when
they're down and I just don't understand

1105
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:04,560
where this fucking sickness came from
it.

1106
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:09,530
And I think a lot of it has to do with
reality TV and this whole microwave,

1107
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,380
insta fame fucking culture that exists
now.

1108
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,510
It's like what you said,
they think that if,

1109
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,880
if they put down somebody that's going
to make,

1110
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,170
they're going to gain power from it.
It's like,

1111
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,740
it's just crazy.
I don't come from that.

1112
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:23,360
I come from like,
Yo,

1113
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:26,180
man,
let's help one another to make this

1114
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:28,940
world a better place.
How are we going to save the oceans?

1115
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:30,800
How are we going to save?
You know,

1116
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,110
and you know,
my thing is this,

1117
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:34,840
look,
they just said that the,

1118
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,850
the fucking commercial meat and dairy
industries are now the most toxic.

1119
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,990
Uh,
they're the most toxic of companies on

1120
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:47,750
the fucking planet.
They just surpassed fossil fuel with the

1121
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:50,630
destruction they're doing to the planet.
So I'm like,

1122
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,890
eat a little less news is coming from it
just I just,

1123
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,560
it's,
it's,

1124
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,820
it was just all on.

1125
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,860
Where did I read it?
It was on,

1126
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,310
uh,
one of the main sites like that.

1127
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:06,390
So is this by a,
from methane gas as a from fossil fuels

1128
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,610
runoff.
Look,

1129
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,660
here's,
here's the thing.

1130
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,200
So before that Gulf oil spill ever
happened,

1131
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:15,170
there was a fucking dead zone in the
Gulf of Mexico,

1132
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:19,270
the size of New Jersey.
Why all the fucking run off of the

1133
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:23,360
[inaudible] and the farms with the
fucking toxic pesticides,

1134
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,620
the fucking,
all this shit that these guys are

1135
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:28,690
spraying roundup and everything else.
And,

1136
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,580
and the nitrogen that's in the fucking
shit when these lagoons that have

1137
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:36,480
100,000 fucking gallons of pig shit,
you know,

1138
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:40,470
it all was draining into,
into the Mississippi and then draining

1139
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:43,860
into the Gulf.
So if you look at what's going on in

1140
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:45,690
North Carolina right now,
because I was just there,

1141
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,450
motherfuckers can't even swim in the
rivers anymore.

1142
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,860
And it's happening in Europe too.
They just had to cancel the swim on the

1143
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:56,670
Iron Ironman in,
in Homburg because of the green allergy

1144
00:53:56,671 --> 00:54:00,450
and all this shit that's happening now
because of all the runoff that's

1145
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:03,430
happening with the farms and everything
is just we're.

1146
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,930
We're making this planet of fucking
toxic wasteland

1147
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:11,730
we've done with farms and it's gotten.
We developed cities.

1148
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:16,731
We have giant groups of people that are
growing anything and then we give people

1149
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:20,910
incentive to make as much profit as
possible and when they're trying to make

1150
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:24,390
as much profit as possible without
ethics or morals and consideration are

1151
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:28,410
or the impact on the environment.
They set off a process in motion that we

1152
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:30,570
are many,
many decades into right now.

1153
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,110
So to try to correct it.
Now we're just seeing the effects and

1154
00:54:34,111 --> 00:54:37,440
then on top of that there's all these ag
gag laws and that gag laws are

1155
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:41,310
devastating because when you see.
Like one of the reasons I became a

1156
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:46,311
hunter is because I was watching these
films of factory farming and I was like,

1157
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:48,810
I'm not.
I'm not participating in this.

1158
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:49,920
I have to figure out what I'm going to
do.

1159
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:52,740
I'm either going to become a vegetarian
or I'm going to become a hunter.

1160
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,440
I decided to become a hunter and that's
how I get my meat,

1161
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:00,570
but when you see those videos,
those are the videos that expose people

1162
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:04,260
to the realities and the horrors of
factory farming and those are illegal in

1163
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:04,810
most places.

1164
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,080
Yeah.
You go to prison now you go to federal

1165
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,480
for showing horrible,
immoral acts that are done to these

1166
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:14,390
animals and the way they're treated and
the way they're contained,

1167
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:18,710
and we were talking yesterday about this
video of a pig farm that there's this,

1168
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:22,310
there's this pig farm where these pigs
are smashed into this place where they

1169
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:24,670
can't move at all.
They're all in these cases and then

1170
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,290
it's.
There's a runoff from where they shit

1171
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:32,291
and piss and there's a giant lake
outside of pig shit and pig pis and no

1172
00:55:32,301 --> 00:55:34,700
one who lives anywhere near that could
avoid that smell.

1173
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:38,150
You drive anywhere near that area.
It's a horrific toxic smell,

1174
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,130
so it's already gotten to this almost
like incorrect double position like

1175
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,520
that,
that that business is a toxic business,

1176
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,760
but it's not a regular like a Joel
Salitan farm.

1177
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,260
You know what?
That guy has never heard of him.

1178
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,620
He runs this farm called polyface farms
and what he does is he has all these

1179
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:59,300
animals live like normal animals,
like the pigs,

1180
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,220
they're not in these cages.

1181
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:05,870
He has them roam free and they set.
They set up these enormous portable

1182
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:07,940
fences,
so they take the pigs,

1183
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:10,400
they roam in this one area like pigs
naturally do,

1184
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,520
and then they moved the fence to a
different area and they transport.

1185
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,150
They did move the pigs over with it,
so the pigs are never contained.

1186
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:21,350
The chickens run free and then they go
back into the chicken house at night and

1187
00:56:21,351 --> 00:56:24,250
then they try not to have mono.
Like when you have,

1188
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,040
when you have a thousand acres of
soybeans,

1189
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,350
that shit ain't normal.
That's not how plants are supposed to

1190
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:31,780
be,
and then you have to throw pesticides on

1191
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:34,840
them and then when you roll them up,
you have to grind everything up.

1192
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:37,990
But these gigantic machines and
everything gets caught up in their mice

1193
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:39,780
and rabbits and everything that might be
in the,

1194
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:42,160
in the neighborhood while these machines
are rolling over.

1195
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,450
All of that is unnatural and it's not
how human beings are supposed to grow

1196
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:48,640
food.
It's not food is supposed to be.

1197
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,580
Some of these plants or animals are
supposed to be interacting with the

1198
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:53,770
environment.
But what we're doing with these things

1199
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:56,440
is making an incredible amounts of
profit.

1200
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,270
And these people are addicted to this
profit.

1201
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,310
These corporations are addicted.
These profit,

1202
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:04,480
they have this constant growth mentality
where every year,

1203
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:07,450
every quarter has to have more.
It's a never ending.

1204
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,850
And they make the laws.
And the only way,

1205
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:10,760
the other thing,
well,

1206
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:15,670
they have massive amounts of money.
So they bribe politicians and they use

1207
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:16,820
all of these,
uh,

1208
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,320
these lobbyists.
And what they do is they get these laws

1209
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:24,100
passed where it's illegal to film them
doing immoral shit.

1210
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,940
And so then you don't see this,
you just go to the store and you buy a

1211
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:30,130
cheeseburger,
you go to Jack in the box,

1212
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:32,440
you go wherever you go,
and you buy these things,

1213
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:35,800
you get corn,
you know where you get corn Syrup in

1214
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:38,190
your soda,
you don't think twice about what,

1215
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:42,310
what has to happen for that corn to
become syrup and how much environmental

1216
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:43,720
damage has to take place.

1217
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:49,380
I mean this is the world we're living in
right now is just waking up to what has

1218
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:52,060
been in motion for many,
many decades.

1219
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,800
I think what's really important though
is that we're honest about health and

1220
00:57:56,801 --> 00:58:01,000
they were honest about the consequences
of our actions in terms of like our

1221
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,700
purchasing power,
what we're doing with food.

1222
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,880
We got to be honest about all of it.
And one of the problems that happens

1223
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:11,080
with hunters are carnivores or even
vegans or vegetarians,

1224
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:15,130
is people only want to look at things
that support their position.

1225
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,980
And with Vegans,
there's a lot of people out there that

1226
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:22,510
only want to look at things that support
Vegan positions in terms of health.

1227
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,210
And this becomes a real problem because
they start,

1228
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,330
they start using studies that are very
shaky,

1229
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,990
they start adding things to
documentaries that aren't necessarily

1230
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:36,370
true or proven and it becomes propaganda
and it becomes propaganda both ways.

1231
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,460
I see what this carnivore diet now,
there's a lot of people that would this

1232
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:41,950
carnivore diet that are like,
this is the only way to go,

1233
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,360
you know,
just eat all meat.

1234
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:44,194
And I'm like,
man,

1235
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,020
I don't know about all that.
I don't see any blood work.

1236
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:49,390
I see blood work only I talked to.
Um,

1237
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,040
uh,
Sean,

1238
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,170
what is his last name?
Sean?

1239
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:55,200
The doctor.
Goddammit.

1240
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,570
Fuck.
He's the main carnivore guy.

1241
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,590
How can I not remember his name?
What is,

1242
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,310
how,
how's that slipping?

1243
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,930
My,
my Sean Baker,

1244
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:07,030
Sean Being Sean Baker,
he released his blood work.

1245
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:08,420
It's not good.
It's blood.

1246
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:10,150
Work's not good.
Testosterone's low.

1247
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,340
There's also all sorts of.
And I just want to say,

1248
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,050
uh,
who were the Haas?

1249
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:18,610
Let's just look at it this way.
Who are the hospitals filled with that

1250
00:59:18,611 --> 00:59:22,610
are having procedures for bypass?
Who were the procedures

1251
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,140
being done for people?
Removing your limbs for diabetes is not

1252
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,200
the people that it's the people that are
eating this toxic diet that Americans to

1253
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:37,370
the standard American diet and what
people have become accustomed to eating,

1254
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,220
rolling up,
and even these carnival people.

1255
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:45,300
Let's just take that for instance,
if you do all meet sure your body let

1256
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,850
that motherfucker might've been on a
Dorito Diet.

1257
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:52,670
We don't know what the fuck he was
eating prior prior to that.

1258
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:57,650
So then you put the bodies a perfect
machine so it at the beginning of when

1259
00:59:57,651 --> 01:00:00,650
you're doing all meet,
the body's become accustomed to that,

1260
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:05,630
but you know the analogy that I use is
that's like getting off heroin and

1261
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:07,940
getting on Methadone because the
methadone,

1262
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,280
Yo,
I kicked dope when I'm on fucking meth

1263
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:15,281
now because the method on down the road
is going to take even a longer tool and

1264
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:19,190
I've seen people that are doing
methadone for 20,

1265
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,540
30 years and that's why I love the
analogy because the long term studies of

1266
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:27,410
those diets do not exist right now.

1267
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,880
No,
there's no longterm studies for the

1268
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:31,970
current,
but if you look at the blue zones around

1269
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:35,400
the planet of the people who were the
most centurions and the people that live

1270
01:00:35,401 --> 01:00:37,940
the longest,
they have three things in common.

1271
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,560
Okay.
And there's,

1272
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,650
there's blue zones in Japan,
Costa Rica,

1273
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,340
grease around the United States while
the top five,

1274
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,320
uh,
with the most and then,

1275
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,260
and then California.
And it's the adventist seventh day

1276
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,320
adventists.
So the three things that they have most

1277
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,330
in common with the people that live the
longest.

1278
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,820
Number one,
they have a meditation,

1279
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:03,020
spiritual practice.
They do something every day for pma,

1280
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,380
positive mental attitude,
whatever their higher power is,

1281
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,930
they do that every day.
Number two,

1282
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,270
they moved their bodies.
They're working,

1283
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,670
they work in the farm,
they're exercising.

1284
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:17,690
Number three,
they eat primarily a plant based diet.

1285
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,100
They may have a piece of fish in Japan
or whatever,

1286
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:27,310
or a piece of meat once in awhile,
but primarily the seven day adventist

1287
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:32,180
study was actually the best one because
it was all from different people with

1288
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:33,560
different ethnic backgrounds.

1289
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,380
And the one thing that they had in
common,

1290
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:39,230
the seven day adventists don't eat meat.
And uh,

1291
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,110
that's my point with the whole thing and
you know,

1292
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,060
when it comes down to diet is I just see
what,

1293
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:51,190
what worked for me and I try to relay
that to people and not not be like my

1294
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:54,680
way's the only way and this and that
because people,

1295
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,710
people doing other people are doing
other things,

1296
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,570
uh,
in their way.

1297
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:01,850
There's raw foodist is all these
different people.

1298
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,790
And the problem is with the false ego in
a human being,

1299
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,030
everybody wants to think that the class
is full.

1300
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,070
Don't try to tell me Shit.
I know it all.

1301
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,090
Here's an issue with centurions,
the centurions century.

1302
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:16,460
Aaron's centenarians,
centenarians,

1303
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,533
centenarians.
Yeah.

1304
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,800
Um,
people that lived to be 100 years

1305
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,410
is one thing we have to take into
consideration.

1306
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,920
You're talking about people that lived
already to be 100 years.

1307
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,440
So when they were 50 was 50 years ago.
All right,

1308
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:32,400
we're talking about 1967.
Nobody knew shit about diet back then.

1309
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,650
This is the fact that,
okay,

1310
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,810
so the people that did live that long
and they were living this,

1311
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,800
it's almost a,
an accident in some ways are

1312
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:42,600
inconsequential.
Like what?

1313
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:46,780
What is going on today with people's
Diet and how long will people live too.

1314
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:51,510
There's far more information in terms of
nutrition and what you should do and

1315
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:54,990
shouldn't do for your body.
So what I'm concerned with is like what

1316
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,930
optimizes people today.
I want to see blood work.

1317
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,810
I want to see like what is going on with
your blood lipids,

1318
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,850
what is going on with your nutrient
levels,

1319
01:03:02,851 --> 01:03:06,750
what is going on with that?
And in that case we don't have.

1320
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:10,800
We have just a few studies from a few
people or if you test from a few people

1321
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:13,500
that have done this carnivore diet,
we have some people that have done the

1322
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:15,840
Vegan diet and have had real hard
problems with that.

1323
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,760
Yeah,
but let's just.

1324
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:19,850
Let me just say one thing,
because to throw the word Vegan on

1325
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:22,220
something that does not make it a
healthy diet.

1326
01:03:22,221 --> 01:03:24,770
I know Reagan's data fucking 100 pounds
overweight.

1327
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,140
They eat nothing but fried chicken
pizza.

1328
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,980
You say in organic whole food,
plant based Diet.

1329
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,250
That's what I roll with,
right?

1330
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:35,090
I don't.
I don't fucking say I took a Vegan diet

1331
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:38,420
can mean anything,
but when you say whole food foods in

1332
01:03:38,421 --> 01:03:40,160
their original source,
organic,

1333
01:03:40,161 --> 01:03:41,930
no pesticides,
whole food,

1334
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,030
plant based Diet.
That's what I roll with,

1335
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,930
so that's why I don't go around.
Nutrient dense mineral dense and the

1336
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:49,400
minerals mineral dense

1337
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,920
with people that live a long time.
One of the things that you get from a

1338
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:56,280
lot of plants,
especially like rich green leafy plants,

1339
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,200
you get a lot of minerals.
Absolutely,

1340
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,610
and more importantly if these things are
raised in an organic environment,

1341
01:04:02,611 --> 01:04:06,200
you're getting soil that's not depleted
and this is a big problem with model.

1342
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:11,740
Did you see the article that just came
out today that 40 years ago and orange

1343
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:15,350
was 10 times more and more nutritious?
I think it was.

1344
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,920
I think it might've been CNN online or
something.

1345
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:23,921
They posted an article that said the
fruits and vegetables from 40 years ago

1346
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:28,931
were 10 times more nutritious than the
than the way they're being grown today

1347
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:33,110
because like you said,
rows and rows and rows.

1348
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:36,080
That makes sense.
How do they extract the nutrients

1349
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,410
properly from the soil?
It's impossible.

1350
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:40,261
Well,
you know,

1351
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:42,690
they have to actually add nutrients to
the soil.

1352
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:45,810
Most of the time it just adding nitrogen
and a few other different minerals,

1353
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:46,644
but

1354
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,050
pig shit.
Like what?

1355
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,260
What they do is to get.
How did they get rid of that pig shit.

1356
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,670
They're spraying it on the fucking crops
and you know,

1357
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,650
well you're.
You're supposed to rotate crops in

1358
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,600
rotation.
What you plant next to each other that

1359
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,180
are extra.
I'm not a farmer composting,

1360
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:11,500
but I have a friend that is an organic
farmer and his name,

1361
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:16,530
his name is Keith and he farms up in New
Hampshire and he knows all about crop

1362
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:22,450
rotation as Keith Leon Forte.
If you have to do,

1363
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:23,740
you can do it.
That's what he does.

1364
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:24,910
He has a small farm.

1365
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:29,250
The small farms are legit.
Like you can have a small farm and be in

1366
01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:32,790
symbiosis,
so like you could be in harmony with the

1367
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:34,170
land,
but man,

1368
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,610
you're starting,
you're growing,

1369
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,370
you know,
fucking a thousand acres of corn for

1370
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:39,780
cattle feed.
There's,

1371
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,090
you might as well be making oil.
Well,

1372
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,010
I mean you're,
you're,

1373
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,670
you're doing something that's kind of
crazy,

1374
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,290
that environment.
It's not natural.

1375
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:46,610
And,
and,

1376
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,590
and,
and listen,

1377
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,530
you know,
I saw a Ted knew Jim play with fucking

1378
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:54,370
ACDC and Black Sabbath and 76 at Madison
Square Garden.

1379
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,540
I went to all them shows,
but you know,

1380
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,080
when he came on and the shit that he was
talking,

1381
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:03,340
I was just like the fucking gmo crops.
Okay.

1382
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,900
Eighty percent of the GMO crop is being
fed to animals for fucking slaughter to

1383
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,440
the,
what he called to stupid vegans are not

1384
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:15,700
the ones that are eating that shit that
most of the crops that are genetically

1385
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,980
modified,
because you have these corporations,

1386
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,200
Mcdonald's,
every one of these corporations,

1387
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,680
they want every fucking piece of meat.
It tastes the same.

1388
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:27,100
They want every fucking French fries,
potato to be the same.

1389
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:32,250
So the only way they can control it is
the control of the genetic markers.

1390
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:37,620
So that's why they're using all of the,
all the majority of the genetically

1391
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:40,120
modified grains.
And Monsanto,

1392
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,970
uh,
you know,

1393
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:46,150
who just got bought out by bear and
they're changing the name because

1394
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:50,320
Monsanto is such a big rap rap rap.
If you don't know it,

1395
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:52,060
bear just bought them.
Now,

1396
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,670
do you know the history of bear from
surgical company?

1397
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,720
No,
but no.

1398
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,980
Prior to that they made this cast that
went into the Nazi death chambers.

1399
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,540
Well that's,
you know what's funny,

1400
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:08,220
that nightclub,
cyclops gas was created by Fritz Haber.

1401
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:11,970
Fritz harbor is also the guy who created
the process of extracting nitrogen from

1402
01:07:11,971 --> 01:07:12,960
the air.
Really?

1403
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:15,720
So he's the guy.
The reason why we can grow the crops

1404
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:17,820
that we have today is because of Fritz
harbor.

1405
01:07:17,821 --> 01:07:21,600
They say that 50 percent of the nitrogen
and the nitrogen and most people's DNA

1406
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:25,200
comes from the harbor method.
He also created cycle on a,

1407
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:29,150
on a client,
be the Nazis.

1408
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,440
Well,
he created cycle on a and they added

1409
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:34,150
this smell to it so that you could smell
this toxic gas.

1410
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:36,750
You would know it when it was coming so
you can get out of the way.

1411
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:42,080
The Nazis switched to design B.
Fritz Harbor was actually a Jew and they

1412
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:47,130
took his invention and cut out the smell
portion of it so that they could gas

1413
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:47,964
Jews with

1414
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,990
dark shit.
I said,

1415
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:52,670
Joseph Smart motherfucker.
I'm learning today.

1416
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,790
It's dark shit,
but bob or method

1417
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,610
saved a lot of people and killed a lot
of people.

1418
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:03,270
They wanted to try that guy for crimes
against humanity while he was winning

1419
01:08:03,271 --> 01:08:07,380
the Nobel Prize for science at the same
time as he was also the first people.

1420
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:11,940
He was one of the first people that
implemented a gassing program where they

1421
01:08:11,941 --> 01:08:12,870
used it,
the gas,

1422
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:15,030
the allied troops in World War One.
That was.

1423
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,820
Wow.
That was a big part of that.

1424
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,380
I didn't.
I did not know that.

1425
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,630
Yeah,
it's crazy shit.

1426
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,330
So that is how we get nitrogen.
We get nitrogen from the harbor method

1427
01:08:24,331 --> 01:08:26,040
when they're poor nitrogen into the
plant,

1428
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:28,710
into the soil.
So they can grow plants.

1429
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,740
That's a big part of it.
When you say genetically modified to

1430
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,150
the,
a big part of that is like we want to

1431
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,000
think about,
oh like labs and science and all this

1432
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:38,520
jazz,
but almost everything we eat is

1433
01:08:38,521 --> 01:08:40,890
genetically modified including all of
our grains.

1434
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,140
Like especially all of our fruits and
vegetables.

1435
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:48,240
We were saying about tomatoes or
orange being different than it was 10

1436
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:50,730
years ago.
Fucking everything's different because

1437
01:08:50,731 --> 01:08:54,120
they want these things to be durable so
they could throw them in a bus or a

1438
01:08:54,121 --> 01:08:55,990
truck rather than travel close to
French.

1439
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,760
Well here's the thing,
and I know what they do.

1440
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:03,761
They take the DNA of a flounder and
injected into tomatoes so it can resist

1441
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,960
the fraud.
How the fuck did they do?

1442
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:07,280
I don't fucking know.
It's.

1443
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,470
That's real.
So if you eat a tomato,

1444
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:11,750
does it have flounder right now?
Vegans?

1445
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:14,570
If you're eating GMO shit,
maybe you're not eating Vegan food.

1446
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:16,910
You could be eating a fish.
Tomato thing

1447
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:21,390
is if you eat plants,
plants absorb like you.

1448
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:26,420
They've found salmon DNA in some plants
because plants absorb this fish thing

1449
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,840
that people use for fertilizer.
Yeah,

1450
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,890
no.
So you're getting some of that animal,

1451
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:35,710
but it's a natural cycle that you're
getting it through.

1452
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:38,200
I mean,
animals eat animals,

1453
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:39,760
plants eat animals,
animals,

1454
01:09:39,761 --> 01:09:42,040
even eat plants.
I mean this is fucking crazy plants in

1455
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,060
South America.
It looks like a,

1456
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,200
like a vase and these rats,
they get attracted this sweet smell

1457
01:09:47,201 --> 01:09:51,310
around the edges and it's slick and they
fall into the hole and the plant closes

1458
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,070
in and swallows them and eats them.
Yeah.

1459
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,023
Well,
well,

1460
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,560
you know,
the other thing is this,

1461
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,920
you have chemical companies making you
food.

1462
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:04,210
Their job is not to feed the world,
not to keep you healthy.

1463
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,760
Their job is to sell fucking pesticides.
Let's,

1464
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:10,970
let's be fucking straight up about it.
So yeah,

1465
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:13,190
they created.
What was the other,

1466
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,910
across a genetic.
There's a,

1467
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,300
there's a,
uh,

1468
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,390
a vegetable,
I think it was brought up.

1469
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,070
Was it cauliflower?
Broccoli?

1470
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,190
They mixed two things and came out with
a.

1471
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:28,730
it's a different process.
What they're doing now and really what

1472
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:33,731
they do when they can take roundup and
pesticides and put it in the fucking

1473
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,050
seed,
right,

1474
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:37,190
is what they're doing now.
And

1475
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:41,640
so the plant from the growth cycle is
resistant to these brands

1476
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,210
and,
and all the people that have in the gut

1477
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:45,620
issues.
I don't know if you listen,

1478
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,630
you know,
I know you had rich roll on twice.

1479
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:50,310
He's my boy.
He's a homie dude.

1480
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,970
He's fucking.
Everyone asked me like what's time

1481
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,370
motherfucker life and what's he like in
real life.

1482
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:58,010
I'm like,
that's the most genuine fucking dude,

1483
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,800
you know,
you ever have anything going on?

1484
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,930
He just wrote the forward to my new
book,

1485
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,550
the PMA effect.
I mean,

1486
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,920
he's such a fucking.
He's a solid cat.

1487
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,800
Very solid.
But um,

1488
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,020
where was I going with that?
You took me down to plans.

1489
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,050
Glyphosate.
Yeah.

1490
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:15,180
So he just had Dr Zach Bush.
Come on.

1491
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,430
Who's a doctor?
This is clinical research.

1492
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:21,300
This is not speculation.
This is not fucking Vegan propaganda.

1493
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:24,600
This is fucking science.
And he proved that glyphosate.

1494
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,760
And what's happening now with the gut
health,

1495
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,940
gut health is such a huge issue.
Everything,

1496
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,320
the bad fucking disease,
it starts in the gut and the glyphosate

1497
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:38,910
is eating through the stomach wall and
causing leaky gut and all these other

1498
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,890
physical diseases from happening.
Now,

1499
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:47,190
the other thing is you have to realize
what these pesticides are.

1500
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:51,330
They're neurotoxins and then the ones
that they're putting inside the seed.

1501
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:53,730
When the bug eats the leaf,
it fucking dies.

1502
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:58,080
So you're eating these fruits and
vegetables that are completely fucking

1503
01:11:58,081 --> 01:11:58,770
toxic.

1504
01:11:58,770 --> 01:11:59,890
Well,
here's what happens.

1505
01:11:59,891 --> 01:12:01,510
When they created it,
one of the things,

1506
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,370
one of the reasons why they were able to
implement it,

1507
01:12:03,371 --> 01:12:06,370
they said it doesn't kill people.
It kills plants and it kills bacteria.

1508
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,270
So everybody's like,
oh,

1509
01:12:07,271 --> 01:12:07,960
fine.
Yeah,

1510
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,630
no problem.
It only kills plants and bacteria that's

1511
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:14,030
totally safe.
Know your body is filled with bacteria

1512
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:17,080
or your good bacteria,
the gut as more eco live than there's

1513
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:19,090
ever been a human being on the planet
ever.

1514
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:24,091
There's more cola in your staff and any
humans that have ever lived more numbers

1515
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,720
and you need them and need to.
The bacterial flora gets destroyed by

1516
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:30,450
glyphosate gets destroyed by.

1517
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,580
That's uh,
that's,

1518
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:36,500
that's.
I mean that podcast that he did that

1519
01:12:36,501 --> 01:12:40,910
episode with Dr Zach Bush is fucking.
It's fucking unbelievable and I'm

1520
01:12:40,911 --> 01:12:42,290
surprised like,
you know,

1521
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,910
motherfuckers didn't try to take
tattooed out at this point.

1522
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:46,570
Well,
it's,

1523
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,110
they're making so much money and people
aren't listening and there's so much

1524
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:51,730
signal.
There's so many noises and they use the

1525
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:55,500
word that everyone loves to use.
The two words.

1526
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,430
Conspiracy theories.
Yeah.

1527
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,040
That's a good one.
But here's the thing.

1528
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:03,090
Once you can prove something in this
data and evidence to back it up,

1529
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,330
it's no longer a theory.
It's a fucking fact.

1530
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,850
So there's been a conspiracy.
It's just it.

1531
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,400
And by the way,
when they implemented it,

1532
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:13,890
they probably did think that they could
get away with it.

1533
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:17,040
They think it would have been fine.
They really probably didn't know as much

1534
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:20,340
as we know today about gut biome.
That's all new shit.

1535
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:25,070
That's all within the last couple of
decades was already tree.

1536
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:27,840
Yeah.
Kimchi is fucking amazing.

1537
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:30,150
I drink a lot of water.
Yeah.

1538
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:32,340
I drink a lot of Kombucha.
Eat a lot of Kimchi.

1539
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,140
That's where I get it from primarily.
Yeah.

1540
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:35,250
Good.
That's good stuff.

1541
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,160
Yeah,
I mean gut biome is gigantic,

1542
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:39,930
you know,
to the point where people make memes

1543
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:43,680
joking around about me saying gut biome
because I say it so much

1544
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,020
and,
and you know,

1545
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:47,960
the other reason that I was,
I didn't know where this whole

1546
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:52,330
conversation would go because I have
respect for you as a martial artist.

1547
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:56,210
Like I said,
I know Brian since the eighties and you

1548
01:13:56,211 --> 01:13:57,620
know,
he always talked about you,

1549
01:13:57,621 --> 01:14:02,420
but rich roll wrote you and said that I
was up at his house and heard that I was

1550
01:14:02,421 --> 01:14:06,110
coming on the podcast and you responded
to him in a text message and said,

1551
01:14:06,111 --> 01:14:07,730
yeah,
it's so fucking toxic.

1552
01:14:07,731 --> 01:14:09,470
What's going on?
Like,

1553
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,970
I just want to sit down.

1554
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,610
Yeah.
It's another form of identity politics,

1555
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:14,990
you know,
and people,

1556
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:16,460
look,
there's a lot of people that I'm friends

1557
01:14:16,461 --> 01:14:18,310
with that have all sorts of dis.
Uh,

1558
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,690
they agree with things that I don't
agree with.

1559
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,610
They have ideas that I don't agree with.
I mean,

1560
01:14:22,611 --> 01:14:25,640
you're allowed to have varying opinions.
That's what human beings,

1561
01:14:25,641 --> 01:14:27,530
we're all about.
We're supposed to be able to communicate

1562
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:29,360
our ideas,
but you're not my enemy.

1563
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:31,430
If you eat plants,
that's crazy.

1564
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,320
Right?
And the problem is I eat plants too.

1565
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:36,220
I eat a shitload of them.
Like this idea that you know,

1566
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:38,990
that vegans and mediators are supposed
to be enemies.

1567
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:41,280
I mean,
I had a strange man.

1568
01:14:41,281 --> 01:14:43,620
I'm going to tell you straight up,
I hang out with dudes.

1569
01:14:43,621 --> 01:14:46,890
Dad fucking eat McDonald's.
Like I have friends.

1570
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:51,480
Like I don't look like I said I'm not
the fly looking for the shit,

1571
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:55,410
you know,
I try to look to the positivity of every

1572
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:58,780
human being and some of them eat meat.
My brother fucking my,

1573
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:01,200
my brother eats meat.
I'm supposed to hate my brother because

1574
01:15:01,201 --> 01:15:03,360
my brother eats,
eats fucking meat,

1575
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,090
you know it,
it's,

1576
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:08,220
it's just like,
it's like you said,

1577
01:15:08,221 --> 01:15:13,221
it's identity politics and I don't roll
with that because if in my line of work

1578
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:16,320
and what I'm doing,
which is getting people out of some

1579
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:20,010
really dark fucking shit in their lives,
like this documentary I'm doing now

1580
01:15:20,011 --> 01:15:25,011
called 30 to life to shit that these
fucking inmates have been through.

1581
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:26,480
And the,
you know,

1582
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:27,870
I'm,
I met one guy,

1583
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,120
he did 50 fucking years man.

1584
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,120
And he's 90 years old and his story is,
he's in amity foundation and it's out

1585
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:37,110
now.
He's in this.

1586
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:41,670
He just got paroled after 50 years,
90 years ago in my fucking phone.

1587
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:46,620
And listen to his story before you judge
a motherfucker cause they got locked up.

1588
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:51,870
He served in World War II in the army.
He served in Korea,

1589
01:15:51,871 --> 01:15:55,500
in the army.
He had his friends fucking blown up in

1590
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:57,830
front of him.
Fucking do.

1591
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:01,290
He's seen shit we can't even imagine in
two wars,

1592
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:02,910
Korea.
You know what?

1593
01:16:02,911 --> 01:16:06,000
Then motherfuckers went through over
there with the cold and fucking,

1594
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:10,770
I couldn't even bury the bodies brode it
had the fucking stack them with just

1595
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:12,060
insane.
And,

1596
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,360
and he came back and went onto the
streets with ptsd.

1597
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:19,290
They didn't even know what the fuck ptsd
was back then when he was going through

1598
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:23,310
it and some shit happened,
which I did not.

1599
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,330
He got double life.
So obviously something really bad

1600
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,460
happened and I don't know the
circumstances,

1601
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:34,240
but he's 90 fucking years old right now.
And he survived the,

1602
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:39,180
the riots and folsom.
He survived insane fucking shit.

1603
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,900
And I'm like Yo.
And he's out now,

1604
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,100
he's out now.
He's nine.

1605
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,380
There's a fucking picture of him.

1606
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:47,510
A picture of what is it,
what is it like when,

1607
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,750
when you're out after fucking 50 years.

1608
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:54,440
And he's the most humble,
genuine fucking dude.

1609
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:58,160
All of these guys like I just got what
we're training to do.

1610
01:16:58,161 --> 01:17:01,550
A five k enrich role is leading the run.
And uh,

1611
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:06,380
and I just got Nike to fucking give them
all a air pegasus,

1612
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:09,080
new fucking sneakers skies every fucking
tears.

1613
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:12,140
They're like,
nobody gave a fuck when we first went in

1614
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:14,120
there and met these brothers,
one of the,

1615
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:18,690
one of the biggest Tuv this scariest
motherfuckers broke down in fucking

1616
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:20,660
tears.
And was I gail?

1617
01:17:20,661 --> 01:17:25,370
Nobody gave a fuck about me man.
The fact that you guys are coming in

1618
01:17:25,371 --> 01:17:26,860
here and doing this for us,
you don't,

1619
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,600
you don't know how much this means to
me.

1620
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:33,170
And I mean he had to leave the room.
He was crying.

1621
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:34,850
He,
I'm going to show you the picture of

1622
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:35,870
this cat it.
Yeah.

1623
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,430
I mean,
that's why I do here.

1624
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:39,530
This is him right here.
Read that text.

1625
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:42,890
Wow.
Look at them there.

1626
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:45,800
Man.
That's crazy and he's trying to hit on

1627
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:50,801
all the female camera girls like he's a
fucking Papi Chulo I nicknamed or I lost

1628
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,700
it.
Sorry.

1629
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,650
Just disappeared on me.
Yeah,

1630
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:55,484
right here.

1631
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,161
Wow.
Yeah.

1632
01:17:58,161 --> 01:18:03,161
He served in both was honorably a ptsd
and I think,

1633
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:07,280
you know,
he said people fuck with him on the

1634
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:09,170
streets.
So what is he,

1635
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,990
what is he doing with his life now?
He's in this program.

1636
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:15,920
So they get parole to this program
called Amity Foundation and they serve

1637
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:19,340
out their sentence and try to
reintegrate them.

1638
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:25,600
So what I did was
when I pitched it and it's kept who did

1639
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,400
what to health and in cowspiracy and
whatever,

1640
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,220
and I,
I hooked up with Paul de gelder.

1641
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:34,180
I don't know if you know him.
He's the Australian navy seal guy.

1642
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,930
Lost his arm and leg to the bull shark.
Oh,

1643
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:41,960
we were talking about him yesterday that
mother had carbon fiber is dude.

1644
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:46,340
He's one of the baddest motherfucking,
most positive people you'll ever meet.

1645
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,020
His fucking stories.
Insane.

1646
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:51,440
I just read crazy easy seeing him walk
around with that fake arm if they can,

1647
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:53,120
like it's totally normal.

1648
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,610
Gave me a fucking,
like I was sitting in the chair and he

1649
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:58,760
came up and was like,
I heard like the hand and I'm like,

1650
01:18:58,780 --> 01:18:59,570
no,
fucking.

1651
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:03,590
He almost ripped my fucking shoulder.
Our hand strong dude is fucking.

1652
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,860
He's like,
hey,

1653
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,400
areas.
Wow.

1654
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,930
You know,
I had to be really careful because,

1655
01:19:08,931 --> 01:19:11,450
you know,
I used to take care of my business with

1656
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:14,960
the right hand and then like,
that's so crazy man.

1657
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:15,501
Yeah,
dude,

1658
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,080
hit a bull shark,
took his arm and leg and now he's on the

1659
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:22,820
discovery channel shark week and he
fights for ocean conservation because if

1660
01:19:22,821 --> 01:19:27,050
you kill the lead Predator in the oceans
and the calling that's going on.

1661
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,450
So I,
I,

1662
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:30,950
I contacted him and I go,
Paul,

1663
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:35,180
I'm going to tell you right now the
whole Vegan shit is becoming this shit

1664
01:19:35,181 --> 01:19:39,080
for rich fucking people.
And the people that really need it are

1665
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:42,980
the ones they can't afford.
Twenty $5 to go to a vege fest and all

1666
01:19:42,981 --> 01:19:47,300
this shit.
It's becoming this pompous fucking shit

1667
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:52,070
and the food and you go to try to have a
fucking meal and it's like fucking 50

1668
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,710
bucks.
And just in fucking appetizers and the

1669
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:57,650
people that really needed a not getting
access to this.

1670
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:01,730
And I saw 13th,
the documentary about the prison

1671
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:03,680
industrial complex in America,
you know,

1672
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,990
you see that.
So you know what's going on.

1673
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:08,370
And I was,
it's prison is basically

1674
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:08,700
slave

1675
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,620
slavery.
It did,

1676
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:11,750
is it,
there's a loophole in the law that if

1677
01:20:11,751 --> 01:20:16,070
you're incarcerated and do a crime that
you can be put to work and not get paid.

1678
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,490
If you get a dollar they're in.
They're making Victoria secret fucking

1679
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:22,100
underwear and all this other shit.
It's fucking crazy.

1680
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,680
So it really fucking lit a fire under my
ass.

1681
01:20:24,681 --> 01:20:25,700
And I said,
Paul,

1682
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,230
I said all this.
A lot of these documentaries are like,

1683
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,600
you know,
I eat Vegan and I got big muscles and

1684
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:34,040
fucking whatever the fuck.
I'm like,

1685
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:36,170
what about the motherfuckers that really
needed?

1686
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:39,260
What did I go through?
I've been to fucking hell as a kid.

1687
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,900
I was on the streets in New York.
I went to.

1688
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,950
I was in the same place.
Mike Tyson was profit in the bronx.

1689
01:20:45,951 --> 01:20:47,900
Only white dude in the whole fucking
place.

1690
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,270
Fucking went upstate.
Did all this shit.

1691
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,710
I'm like,
what changed me,

1692
01:20:51,711 --> 01:20:54,020
man?
It was this process.

1693
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:56,000
I said,
the people that need this shit,

1694
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:57,770
they're not getting access to it.
I said,

1695
01:20:57,771 --> 01:21:01,280
let's come up with something and fucking
help these people.

1696
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:04,490
Let's go fucking help these dudes who
were coming out of prison.

1697
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:06,920
And then we contacted kip.
He's like,

1698
01:21:06,921 --> 01:21:11,730
I want to direct it to me and me and
Paul wrote up the whole treatment and

1699
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,940
uh,
and then they contacted.

1700
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:15,620
We were going to try to put him in an
Arabic.

1701
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:19,520
These dudes in a house.
And then we found that the producer

1702
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:23,330
found Elizabeth,
who's the producer,

1703
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:27,050
African-american Chick.
These girls are fucking their money man.

1704
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:29,000
They're fucking great.
Dawn.

1705
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:32,000
And they found this place called Amany
Foundation.

1706
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,100
And they're like,
they're already doing this.

1707
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,540
They,
they have him in here.

1708
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:39,200
They're doing meditation drum circles,
American Indian chance.

1709
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:43,220
When you were young and your life is
filled,

1710
01:21:43,221 --> 01:21:47,480
the turmoil and chaos,
you found the hard as you found this

1711
01:21:47,481 --> 01:21:51,900
discipline and becoming a monk and stick
into this plant base training guy,

1712
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:56,240
but you had a be.
It became your ideology became your

1713
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:58,540
life.
If we came like a path and this will,

1714
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,770
a lot of people need,
they need a path.

1715
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:05,440
It gives them a feeling of purpose.
It gives them an identity and an

1716
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:08,780
and to made to feel like they matter and
that's what

1717
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:14,390
these motherfuckers that they don't
matter and they even punish you after

1718
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:16,310
you do your time.
That's why they're trying to do.

1719
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:21,290
They're trying to sign this legislature.
That's a do away with the box.

1720
01:22:21,530 --> 01:22:23,600
I don't know if you heard about that in
California,

1721
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:27,410
you have to check off a box that you've
been convicted of a crime,

1722
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:31,370
so they're trying to do away with that
because you did your time,

1723
01:22:31,371 --> 01:22:34,430
you served your fucking,
you served your time,

1724
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,181
you,
you know,

1725
01:22:35,181 --> 01:22:39,140
you served your debt to society.
Why should you continue to be fucking

1726
01:22:39,141 --> 01:22:43,880
punished and they can't even get a job
working anywhere because no one will

1727
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:46,190
fucking hire them.
So it's a whole.

1728
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:50,690
So what we're doing is I have Dante Ross
coming in.

1729
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:52,410
He's,

1731
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:00,650
Another dude wants to play guitar.
I just hooked up with Yamaha.

1732
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,350
They're going to give them good a guitar
amp.

1733
01:23:03,351 --> 01:23:07,270
All these shit.
Tal Ronen who owns crossroads

1734
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,280

Yeah.

who knows?
Who knows?

1749
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:51,330
But it was about giving these guys
facility to change their lives.

1750
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:55,220
And that's what this documentary 30 life
it is because like,

1751
01:23:55,221 --> 01:23:57,910
well they told me,

1752
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,680
you're going to change your
motherfucking life.

1753
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,780
And that's what I did.
And I stuck with it.

1754
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,530
And you know,

01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:22,390
I still hit the weights,
hit the bags,

1761
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:25,360
do whatever.
I'm all about recovery now.

1762
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,590
Uh,
my friend Aaron J,

1763
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:29,200
a drug,
a drug,

1764
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,870
a zoo ski runs recovery in New York
City.

1765
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:35,560
So I'm all about the see Vac pod and the
new calm,

1766
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:38,770
which provides a,
in 30 minutes you get three hours of

1767
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:41,350
restorative sleep.
His whole shit,

1768
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,510
dude.
It's fucking amazing,

1769
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,470
man.
I went up there.

1770
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:46,090
I'm like,
it's fucking Guinea pig.

1771
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,940
Like all the shit that he's learning,
massage school,

1772
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:52,390
fucking trigger point therapy,
everything that he's been learning.

1773
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,150
And he's a bad motherfucker.
He fought in the golden gloves.

1774
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:59,740
He has black belts.
He's a hardcore dude all tatted up and

1775
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:02,290
you know,
I just been on this and I went into

1776
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:05,710
crunch because they were offering a
special thing and he was,

1777
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,400
he,
he,

1778
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,560
he led the boxing and he taught
kickboxing and worked with all the five

1779
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:11,830
points.
Guys would all be in,

1780
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,480
you know,
five points more Thai.

1781
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:14,920
So yeah,
before that,

1782
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,960
uh,
they were all up in crunch,

1783
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:17,823
uh,
you know,

1784
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,480
training and then they opened up the
school,

1785
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,670
but he was there and I said,
Yo,

1786
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:25,960
I want to do this ironman.
He started training me from day one to

1787
01:25:25,961 --> 01:25:29,530
do my first race.
I started with him and in 2010 I did my

1788
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:31,380
first race,
2012 New York,

1789
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:34,930
New York iron man.
So then his whole journey,

1790
01:25:34,931 --> 01:25:38,480
now they open up this place recoveries
right up the block from Hansel Gracie's

1791
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:39,820
on,
on 30th street.

1792
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:45,160
So they have to see Vac pod which takes
you to elevation and increases your vo

1793
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:47,500
two Max by like five point eight
percent.

1794
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:52,030
And I think doping doing the EPO and
everything only gives you three percent.

1795
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:57,370
And then he does the Neukom.
So now I tried to test the shit and I'm

1796
01:25:57,371 --> 01:25:57,970
like,
alright,

1797
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:02,170
Neukom it fucking works with the wiring
in your brain.

1798
01:26:02,171 --> 01:26:04,070
So you put this,
these fucking,

1799
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,850
you put blinders on and you sit there
with these fucking headphones and he has

1800
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:11,150
electrodes.
He puts this gel by the way.

1801
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:15,490
I have his card and he said,
you come to New York next time for

1802
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:16,383
lunch,
right?

1803
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,870
Yeah.
So the thing was I tried to fight it and

1804
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:21,704
be like,
no,

1805
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:24,290
I'm fucking not going to pay.
I'm not going to go out.

1806
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,470
And the vibrations that they designed
that,

1807
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:30,650
the sound vibration that's coming
through these headphones,

1808
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,910
like I'm,
I'm just trying to fight passing out.

1809
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,350
And I just fucking went out and then
they woke me up and they're like,

1810
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:41,420
Yo,
how long do you think you were out?

1811
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:42,620
I said,
15 minutes.

1812
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:44,780
They were like,
you out for an hour and 20.

1813
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,250
I'm like,
what?

1814
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:49,220
And it's just,
it's fucking bizarre.

1815
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:51,620
Like they're learning so much about
recovery.

1816
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:53,550
And now all this,
uh,

1817
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,840
all kinds of pro athletes are coming
into recovery in New York.

1818
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:57,390
Uh,
the,

1819
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:02,390
the studio over there on 30th street all
handles guys handles a nephew who just

1820
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,920
won.
What did he just,

1821
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:08,660
what was that?
A MMA tournament.

1822
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:11,780
He just won something.
Fuck it.

1823
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:16,070
He had some fight and he won in.
A lot of those guys are coming in and a

1824
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:19,070
lot of pro athletes,
there's a lot of endurance athletes

1825
01:27:19,071 --> 01:27:21,830
that's a go at that are going in.
How does it work?

1826
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:23,080
Then?
There's electrodes that are on,

1827
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,580
he puts like,
do you have a tens machine,

1828
01:27:25,581 --> 01:27:26,390
you know,
a day.

1829
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:28,550
The gluey fucking pads,
right?

1830
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:32,540
So it's the squares and then he puts
this gel and he puts it behind

1831
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,960
productive gel and he puts it behind
your ear here.

1832
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,080
And then the headphones and the
blinders.

1833
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:43,850
But it's sending a pulse into your body
and the sound vibrations at attached to

1834
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:44,990
a big machine.
It's a,

1835
01:27:44,991 --> 01:27:46,940
it's a fucking little machine like this.

1836
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,110
So it's something that we could have
here.

1837
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:48,621
You can,
yeah,

1838
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:50,390
you can have it.
I'm telling you,

1839
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:51,890
man,
you will bug the fuck out.

1840
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:54,350
That sounds crazy.
Like he's an expert in it.

1841
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:58,220
Like the guy who manages the whole shit.
He's an expert in the new comp stuff,

1842
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,740
so,
so like,

1843
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,390
you know,
he's a big fan of yours by the way too.

1844
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:05,270
He got out to Aaron.
So this is it right here.

1845
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:07,160
Oh,
so when you put this on,

1846
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:13,280
is it on a timer like it's over when
it's over?

1847
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,930
No,
they had to wake me up,

1848
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:17,030
man.
That's a those pads.

1849
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:20,160
They woke me to fuck up.
I thought I was out for like 15 minutes.

1850
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:24,970
Step two microcurrent stimulation.
Step two for newcomb is to.

1851
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,420
Is to use a sub sensory microcurrent to
catalyze the effectiveness of the new

1852
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:32,630
comp supplementation.
So you take pills with it to know I

1853
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:34,360
didn't take any pills.
I just.

1854
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:39,200
The combination of the supplementation,
the micro current works on the midbrain

1855
01:28:39,201 --> 01:28:41,230
to interrupt the body's natural sleep
stress.

1856
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:44,660
Natural stress response.
Research shows this microcurrent helps

1857
01:28:44,661 --> 01:28:48,950
balance the brain's neurochemistry by
reestablishing optimal neurotransmitter

1858
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:52,340
levels.
You won't feel it in Swahili as far as

1859
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:54,180
that should help.
The way your brain works.

1860
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,390
It's,
it's insane dude.

1861
01:28:56,410 --> 01:29:00,380
And and they're the only,
like the only ones in New York that are

1862
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:02,160
doing a new calm.
They're the only ones

1863
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,270
in the east coast that have a fucking
evac pod.

1864
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,170
One of the universities out here,
they've got one in Orange County.

1865
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:12,600
Ian Mccall was using that shift for
awhile.

1866
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:16,410
He said great,
but the woman who holds the world record

1867
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:21,390
time trial,
I believe she was doing see vac the pod.

1868
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:25,590
It's fucking insane.
You go in this thing and it's like,

1869
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,210
uh,
you,

1870
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:28,410
you go,
you have to work up because you can't

1871
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:30,440
just go to level five and,
and you,

1872
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:31,830
you,
you fucking shit.

1873
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:35,550
We'll just bug the fuck out.
So I worked all the way up to level

1874
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:38,340
five.
But how long did it take you to work up

1875
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:40,440
to?
It took me like a couple of weeks,

1876
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:43,620
you know,
but like what I really noticed was with

1877
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:48,000
my running because I mark my threshold
and everything,

1878
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:50,820
so every run when I was training for the
last race,

1879
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:54,300
I just,
I just did Chattanooga a half ironman.

1880
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,480
So every run I was doing it's going in
the back and then go in and do the new

1881
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:01,910
calm.
And then I do the normatec boots.

1882
01:30:01,911 --> 01:30:05,130
Like they have everything at this place
recover,

1883
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:10,370
so like they're just using and then they
have this other fucking magnetic blanket

1884
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:15,540
that fucking you,
you sit on it and then his isolation pad

1885
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:18,690
on top and it sends these frequencies
through your body.

1886
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,710
Oh,
I've done that wasn't mean,

1887
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:24,711
what does that call fucking I'm spacing
on the cryo place and they're getting,

1888
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:28,440
they got cryo coming down and,
and,

1889
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:33,460
and it just flushed like I've noticed
that I can go fucking hardest.

1890
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:38,530
I mean I would have to bike 120 miles
and do a brick and get off the bike and

1891
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:43,851
go run 13 miles and I'm like fucking
breaking threshold fucking records

1892
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:49,050
because I started taking up any athlete
who's serious about even handles,

1893
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:54,090
I think it was his nephew is something
that just had that fight.

1894
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,760
The coach was like,
you know,

1895
01:30:56,850 --> 01:31:00,300
what the fuck are you doing?
And he's coming into the evac twice,

1896
01:31:00,301 --> 01:31:02,220
three times a day.
And he's like,

1897
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:02,821
dude,
he's,

1898
01:31:02,821 --> 01:31:04,320
he,
he his gas tank.

1899
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:05,910
He just doesn't run out.
And he's just,

1900
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:10,080
he's fucking grappling.
He's doing everything and he's never

1901
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:11,040
fucking tired.
He's,

1902
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:13,470
I've never seen him perform at this
level.

1903
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:16,290
So the success is there.
Even this woman,

1904
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:20,400
she broke the world record,
I think it was for tt time trial or

1905
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:23,760
track or road or something.
This woman's cycle is,

1906
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:28,350
did see vac and she and they accused her
of fucking doping.

1907
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,840
That's at the banner.
Yammer.

1908
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:34,110
Physical fucking legit.
They have that there too.

1909
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:36,900
It does something.
It does something because,

1910
01:31:36,901 --> 01:31:37,740
uh,
I've been,

1911
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,060
you know,
you're always getting hurt,

1912
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:41,370
you know that too.
I'm always dealing with a fucking

1913
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:44,930
nagging fucking injury.
You got something now like a growing

1914
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:45,400
issue?

1915
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,950
Yeah.
So,

1916
01:31:46,951 --> 01:31:47,600
uh,
you know,

1917
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:47,920
um,
the,

1918
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,150
I've never had a race.
I,

1919
01:31:49,151 --> 01:31:51,960
I've got my,
I got my nose broken Cabo ironman.

1920
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:54,090
I'm swimming out in shark infested
waters.

1921
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:57,540
Fucking leaking.
But even from boxing I knew,

1922
01:31:57,541 --> 01:32:00,010
don't blow your nose because your eyes
are going to swell shut.

1923
01:32:00,011 --> 01:32:01,420
So I had to do all mouth.
We,

1924
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:04,570
I've,
my first ironman I ever did was New York

1925
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:07,990
City and a chromosome.
The drama mackey book,

1926
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:09,910
the fucking show.
This is hardcore,

1927
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,620
uh,
the night before.

1928
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:15,070
So we play to like 3000 motherfuckers
going off.

1929
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:20,071
You know that whole mosh and shit and we
fucking lay it down and I fucking had my

1930
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:23,770
brother come down.
He drove me back to New York City.

1931
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:28,270
I had a stress fracture in my foot.
I took a shower and I went to the swim

1932
01:32:28,271 --> 01:32:31,030
start and I did an ironman in August
twelfth,

1933
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:36,480
2012 in fucking 95 degrees,
New York city humidity.

1934
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,900
But I was not going to be an extra in
your foot.

1935
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:44,470
Stress fracture in my fucking foot.
And the thing is right where the cleat

1936
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:46,060
is.
That's where it pressed.

1937
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:49,420
That's where my stress fracture,
the second metatarsal.

1938
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:51,730
And it was just.
And I didn't take aspirin.

1939
01:32:51,731 --> 01:32:53,680
I didn't take nothing.
I'm just like,

1940
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:57,380
you know,
videos like David Goggins volcano,

1941
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,420
that fucking maniac.
I'm like,

1942
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:01,420
fuck my pain,
you know,

1943
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:05,710
it took me 13 hours.
And how long did it take you to get over

1944
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:08,530
the stress?
It took months.

1945
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:11,520
It took months.
And that's why I started wearing hocus.

1946
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:16,560
Now I run with Hoka,
Hoka Hoka these shoes and there's other

1947
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:21,130
big patents.
So that's like a two inch pad.

1948
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:23,980
What is the day your shoe goes down in
there?

1949
01:33:23,981 --> 01:33:28,690
It's not actually,
but it's this scientifically designed

1950
01:33:28,691 --> 01:33:32,320
foam that absorbs shock from the,
from the road.

1951
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:33,630
So,
um,

1952
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:37,030
a lot of the top heather Jackson runs in
him.

1953
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:39,460
She just fucking has been winning like
crazy.

1954
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:41,320
She was just so fucking better
Christian,

1955
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:43,240
a better cushion and when you get,
you know,

1956
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:48,241
I'm 56 so it's like I'm not a fucking
dude that's recovering so quick as I

1957
01:33:48,311 --> 01:33:52,240
used to in my twenties or whatever.
So I might fuck with barefoot running

1958
01:33:52,241 --> 01:33:53,260
shoes.
I can't,

1959
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:53,680
man.
It's,

1960
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,630
there's no,
there's no cushioning.

1961
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:57,310
I just can't do it.
But you're running.

1962
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:02,350
Do you do a lot of your run on some may
need some time in New York.

1963
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:05,440
I live in New York City.
I might run the trail,

1964
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:08,800
uh,
the bridle trail in central park if I

1965
01:34:08,801 --> 01:34:12,910
can or run around the reservoir.
But mostly my shit is all in the city

1966
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:16,230
and the hope is just fucking like,
you know,

1967
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,360
I'll be the next day.
People say to me,

1968
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:21,330
Yo,
you must be fucked up for a week after

1969
01:34:21,331 --> 01:34:22,164
the race.
I was like,

1970
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:27,250
I did Conan world championships two
years in a row and the first year I did

1971
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:32,251
it 2016,
I fucking went snorkeling with my girl

1972
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,850
the next day for like three hours.

1973
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,600
So like the inflammation's not there.
I'm getting really dialed in on the

1974
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:43,510
equipment aspect,
getting fitted for the bike,

1975
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:48,511
getting the right shoes to run in it.
It literally took me six years to get

1976
01:34:49,781 --> 01:34:53,620
dialed in on,
on even the nutrition aspect and doing

1977
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:58,490
them racist because you don't want to
get a belly full of fucking gels and all

1978
01:34:58,491 --> 01:35:00,370
this other shit,
you know,

1979
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:04,460
so anyway,
but the recovery aspect of,

1980
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,340
of what I do,
like I just watched,

1981
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:10,160
um,
coggins was on the rich roll podcast and

1982
01:35:10,161 --> 01:35:14,000
he was talking about how much yoga and
stretching that he's doing now.

1983
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:14,930
Two,
three,

1984
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:19,730
four hours of fucking street.
And I know you're into yoga lover.

1985
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:21,170
Yeah,
it's fucking great.

1986
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:23,660
And that's what I need to start getting
back into my girl.

1987
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:26,810
Erica is always pushing me.
She's like fucking bought me,

1988
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:27,644
uh,
a,

1989
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:33,010
a kiosk thing for fucking integral yoga.
And she bought that shift for me last

1990
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:33,973
year.
I still,

1991
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,073
you know,
it's,

1992
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,420
it's what you resist.
Like if you read,

1993
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:44,720
have you read the war of art by Steven?
I fucking love it.

1994
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:46,063
You have in mind,

1995
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:50,230
I bought a stack of his books.
I used to give them out to my guests

1996
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,140
don't take
things that are

1997
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:55,290
the war of art,
do the work.

1998
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:59,460
But he talked about resistance and the
main thing about resistance is usually

1999
01:35:59,461 --> 01:36:02,070
we're the most resistant to things we
need the most.

2000
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,090
Yes.
Yeah.

2001
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,460
You know,
and it's this deep shit.

2002
01:36:05,461 --> 01:36:09,990
That book I was grateful every morning I
sit down to write my screenplay or my

2003
01:36:09,991 --> 01:36:12,180
next book,
I read his shit,

2004
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:13,890
you know,
because it's just.

2005
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:16,730
And the four agreements,
I'm big into two.

2006
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:22,070
I went to actually somebody got me
tickets to see a Miguel speak,

2007
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,920
Don Miguel,
and it was a life changing encounter for

2008
01:36:25,921 --> 01:36:27,150
me.
The four agreements,

2009
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:29,550
don't take things personal,
always do your best,

2010
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:32,970
be impeccable with your word and don't
make assumptions.

2011
01:36:32,971 --> 01:36:36,420
Which I always thought I've created wars
in my fucking mind.

2012
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,190
And then they're like,
dude,

2013
01:36:38,191 --> 01:36:40,520
I wasn't even taking that.
What the fuck is your problem?

2014
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,510
That's classic fucking Dude,
that shit is fucking crazy man.

2015
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:50,430
And I think if everybody just slowed
down and read some literature on some of

2016
01:36:50,431 --> 01:36:54,780
these teachers that
humanity could do so,

2017
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:55,330
so much

2018
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:57,130
better.
I agree.

2019
01:36:57,610 --> 01:37:01,000
Pressfield's great man,
and what he does say about resistance is

2020
01:37:01,001 --> 01:37:02,950
so,
so powerful because there there is

2021
01:37:02,951 --> 01:37:05,860
something that keeps you from doing
things that you know you're supposed to

2022
01:37:05,861 --> 01:37:08,230
do and when you do them,
you feel so much better.

2023
01:37:08,231 --> 01:37:09,610
It's like,
why didn't I just do it?

2024
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,670
Why did it?
What was all this procrastination and

2025
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:16,420
bullshit that was involved in me?
Like putting this off and then when you

2026
01:37:16,421 --> 01:37:18,630
finally do,
every time I walk out of a yoga class,

2027
01:37:18,631 --> 01:37:20,140
I'm like,
I gotta do that again tomorrow.

2028
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:23,020
I got to keep this ball rolling.
This is a part of my life.

2029
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:26,110
I got to go.
Especially for a guy like you because

2030
01:37:26,111 --> 01:37:29,440
everything is tight,
Nino's racing and running and

2031
01:37:29,441 --> 01:37:31,300
everything,
and then when you're on stage,

2032
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:33,070
everything is crushed,
crushed,

2033
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,030
crushed,
crushed,

2034
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:35,110
destroyed.
Yeah.

2035
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:37,870
You know what I mean?
It's like the thing about yoga is that

2036
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:41,740
static,
these poses and stretches and your core

2037
01:37:41,741 --> 01:37:44,500
gets activated and everything gets
lengthened.

2038
01:37:44,501 --> 01:37:46,350
It's just smart way to make it.

2039
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:47,760
Well,
you know what it is.

2040
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,690
I try to justify it by going,
well,

2041
01:37:49,691 --> 01:37:53,920
I do yoga at the gym when you know,
because I'll do my trigger point and

2042
01:37:53,921 --> 01:37:56,790
then I do all my trigger point,
myofascial release,

2043
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:59,160
all that,
and then last 15 minutes my girls like

2044
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:01,800
that shit don't count.
Then it's better than nothing.

2045
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:02,890
You need to.
No,

2046
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:06,840
but I remember how I used to feel when I
would come out of those yoga classes in

2047
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:09,300
81 and I,
I would feel like I could jump over a

2048
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:12,750
fucking building and I need need.
I need to get back to that.

2049
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:17,930
But even in the resistance aspect,
what not doing what you resistant and it

2050
01:38:19,111 --> 01:38:20,100
could be something like,
oh,

2051
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:23,700
I made an agreement with myself to
fucking straighten out the papers on my

2052
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:26,490
desk and go to all this shit and if I
don't do it,

2053
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,840
it puts me in the worst fucking mood.
Sure.

2054
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:33,260
Because that's what resistance.
When you cave in and you give into

2055
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:34,350
resistance,
man,

2056
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:38,970
it's like you and it could be the
smallest little little thing like you

2057
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:40,650
know,
anything.

2058
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,790
Yeah.
And it just,

2059
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,220
it just irks the fuck out of you.
I'm like,

2060
01:38:44,221 --> 01:38:46,110
Yo.
So I try to.

2061
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,090
That's a good philosophy to live by and
you know,

2062
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,130
to have something that's been fucking
with you.

2063
01:38:51,131 --> 01:38:54,610
Some things you're putting off,
whether it's getting back into yoga or

2064
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:57,310
cleaning up your daughter to quitting
smoking or whatever it is.

2065
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,500
Having that thing over your head where
you know,

2066
01:38:59,501 --> 01:39:02,450
you haven't taken care of,
it makes you think less of yourself and

2067
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:03,880
make yourself less.

2068
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:04,850
Yeah.
And,

2069
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,280
and that's one of the things I tell
these,

2070
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:12,000
everybody I work with because I mean
literally today and I'm not bullshitting

2071
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:13,530
on unsure,
I don't try to be like,

2072
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,450
you know,
I don't even say I'm some kind of

2073
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:16,081
teacher.
Whatever.

2074
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:17,940
I just pass the info to these
motherfuckers.

2075
01:39:17,941 --> 01:39:21,540
I today I had fucking four people come
up to me on the street.

2076
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:23,220
Yo,
I heard you on rich.

2077
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:26,820
Well fucking so you want to love what
you doing man?

2078
01:39:26,821 --> 01:39:29,280
You fucking help me.
I got into triathlon now,

2079
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:31,770
I quit fucking drugs.
This guy told me that today,

2080
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:32,941
and he's like,
Yo,

2081
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:35,490
I quit drugs.
I fucking stopped drinking that.

2082
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:39,870
That's what it's all about.
That is what am I going to give a fuck

2083
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:43,530
them be like zone in on something and
find fault with what the fuck he's

2084
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:44,281
doing.
I was like,

2085
01:39:44,281 --> 01:39:45,990
Yo man,
props to you dude.

2086
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:47,400
Fucking,
you know,

2087
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:50,280
you could do anything you know,
you apply yourself to.

2088
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:52,140
And nance really,
you know,

2089
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:54,660
um,
my whole thing in life is to just,

2090
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,290
you know,
and that's what part did proper.

2091
01:39:57,390 --> 01:40:01,350
Came to America in his seventies of
border geology to cross two oceans,

2092
01:40:01,351 --> 01:40:04,020
had two heart attacks almost passed
away.

2093
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:09,440
But his teacher in India said to go to
America at 70 years old with $7 in a

2094
01:40:11,131 --> 01:40:15,120
case of bog of toms.
And he came to America to the lower east

2095
01:40:15,121 --> 01:40:17,340
side to the bowery.
What's a burger with Tom?

2096
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,480
The Bagua.
Tom Srimad.

2097
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:21,030
Bhagavatam is what's known as the
spotless Parana.

2098
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:24,270
It's a,
the bog of a time she went back to the

2099
01:40:24,271 --> 01:40:27,030
time is an ancient literature in India.
It's called.

2100
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:29,640
It's part of the Puranas is called the
spotless Paranas,

2101
01:40:29,641 --> 01:40:33,120
so there's 10 days of the book,
10 candles he didn't even have.

2102
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:38,010
He brought the original texts that have
been passed down from one teacher to the

2103
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:39,210
next to the next,
to the next in India,

2104
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:42,780
and they said his teacher
Bhaktisiddhanta said,

2105
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:47,070
you need to write these books in English
for the world to help the world,

2106
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,390
so he didn't owe the people in India
with like Swamiji,

2107
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,170
you know you are.
You're at the end of your life.

2108
01:40:53,171 --> 01:40:55,600
Why are you going to go to America?
It's a very dangerous place,

2109
01:40:55,601 --> 01:40:58,930
not only to go to America.
He went to fucking New York to the

2110
01:40:58,931 --> 01:41:00,340
bowery.
They robbed him.

2111
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,710
He slept on the floor.
He Fed people.

2112
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:06,940
He cooked me.
Alan Ginsburg Academy's first storefront

2113
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:11,980
over there called matches gifts,
and they saw the humility of this person

2114
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:15,700
probably pod and what he did for people.
How he has so much love.

2115
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:19,480
He would cook the meals,
serve everybody clean up before you

2116
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:22,300
would even eat a grain and rice.
He had no possessions,

2117
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:22,840
none.

2118
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:27,840
He slept on the floor on a mat and they
saw the humility of him and he just.

2119
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:31,750
And when I learned this story,
there's a great documentary on him

2120
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:36,190
called you're ever well wisher on
youtube and it's about his life and how

2121
01:41:36,191 --> 01:41:38,620
he came and you know,
uh,

2122
01:41:38,621 --> 01:41:42,130
Charya means one who leads by example.
It's not what,

2123
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:45,580
and I've learned this just by these big
mounds that are out there that talked so

2124
01:41:45,581 --> 01:41:46,840
much shit.
It ain't,

2125
01:41:46,841 --> 01:41:48,820
what the fuck you say,
it's what you do.

2126
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:53,050
It's about your action and your words
and how you interact with other people

2127
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:57,190
and how you see other people,
even these fucking so-called celebrities

2128
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:00,130
is when the camera's ain't on.
How do you treat people,

2129
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:02,830
you know,
what the fuck is the real core of your

2130
01:42:02,831 --> 01:42:04,660
existence?
What are you here to do?

2131
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:07,960
And when I saw a proud part and,
and,

2132
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:08,794
and,
um,

2133
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,740
you know,
read all this stuff on him and then

2134
01:42:11,741 --> 01:42:13,990
started taking up the process,
I was like,

2135
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:15,430
you know,
um,

2136
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:18,790
it just changed,
changed my life so that you know,

2137
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,500
for the better so

2138
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:24,880
well by you saying that.
And it was very enticing for people,

2139
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:26,710
right?
Like the guy I want to do what he's

2140
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:28,450
doing,
I wanna I want to feel better,

2141
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:31,690
like he's feeling better.
That's what's amazing about having

2142
01:42:31,691 --> 01:42:35,770
someone who's a great role model,
meaning like me.

2143
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:37,690
You might not even think of yourself as
a role model,

2144
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:41,560
but by living your life by example,
by doing things that you should do,

2145
01:42:41,561 --> 01:42:44,680
but being healthy by being active and
enthusiastic,

2146
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:48,130
but you've got passionate about what
you're doing about your music,

2147
01:42:48,131 --> 01:42:50,050
about pushing yourself,
about your books,

2148
01:42:50,051 --> 01:42:53,320
about the exercise.
And when you do that,

2149
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,330
people that don't have purpose in their
life,

2150
01:42:55,331 --> 01:42:57,280
they see that and they go,
that's what I'm missing.

2151
01:42:57,281 --> 01:42:59,860
I'm missing because we're missing so
many things in this life.

2152
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,320
But one of the things that people are
missing is role models.

2153
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:04,750
They're missing someone who they can
look up to and go,

2154
01:43:04,751 --> 01:43:05,530
oh,
I.

2155
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:06,540
This is the way to do it.
And it.

2156
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:10,360
And when you emulate their lifestyle and
start thinking the way they think and

2157
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:13,150
using their lessons and applying them to
your own life,

2158
01:43:13,151 --> 01:43:18,151
you start seeing benefits and then that
passes down to other people who see you.

2159
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:21,630
It's like a candle.
One candle can light up.

2160
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:26,130
Like hr was that for me,
like her could have been telling me to

2161
01:43:26,131 --> 01:43:28,770
worship fucking cheetos and and I would
have done it.

2162
01:43:28,771 --> 01:43:32,880
Thankfully he was into the right shit.
But I would see him go on stage and I

2163
01:43:32,881 --> 01:43:35,820
would see his humility.
He wouldn't.

2164
01:43:35,821 --> 01:43:39,600
He would always say,
John is the ability of anything that I

2165
01:43:39,601 --> 01:43:42,510
have.
He would always give praises to the most

2166
01:43:42,511 --> 01:43:46,320
high to John.
Rastafari humble is fucking hell.

2167
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:51,470
And the best musicians to ever.
Those four motherfuckers are praise by

2168
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:55,220
every single fucking musician today.
If you talk Doc Daryl,

2169
01:43:55,580 --> 01:44:00,330
earl and Gary doctor know every
motherfucker musician out there,

2170
01:44:00,331 --> 01:44:02,540
it will be like,
those dudes are fucking Don's because

2171
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:05,510
they study music.
They were into jazz and they were into

2172
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:08,480
fucking return to forever.
And John Mclaughlin,

2173
01:44:08,481 --> 01:44:13,481
Mahavishnu dark in 81 was like,
they call me squids because they met me

2174
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:15,200
in an Aeo squids.

2175
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:19,640
I'm going to take it to the palladium
return to forever because they met me in

2176
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:20,610
the navy.
Oh,

2177
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,980
squid,
squid.

2178
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:24,860
Squid.
That's hilarious.

2179
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:26,150
Yeah.
And then,

2180
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:28,020
uh,
and then they call me Johnny Joe.

2181
01:44:28,021 --> 01:44:30,830
So that's where the John Joseph,
I didn't use my last name.

2182
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:32,930
[inaudible].
I was fucking a future there for 15

2183
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:33,591
years.
Oh,

2184
01:44:33,591 --> 01:44:34,520
that's funny.
Yeah.

2185
01:44:34,521 --> 01:44:35,670
So,
uh,

2186
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,400
the,
the thing was,

2187
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:42,440
he's returned to forever as al Di Meola,
Lenny White Stanley Clarke.

2188
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:47,510
And I'm missing chickarina fucking do

2189
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,940
So you want to go down a motherfucking

2190

2191
01:44:52,311 --> 01:44:56,960
You want to go down a rabbit hole with
how fucking amazing these fucking

2192
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:00,620
musicians are,

2193
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:01,850
you know,
Maha Vishnu,

2194
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,090
birds of fire.
Like they started turning me and he

2195
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:05,930
would say,
squids,

2196
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,230
this is how we learn to play with the
fuck we play.

2197
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:11,930
And nobody could touch the bad brains
musically.

2198
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:13,580
Energy on stage.
Nothing.

2199
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,590
And I would see these dudes.
I'd be like,

2200
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:19,820
what the fuck are you into?
And then the role models that,

2201
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:22,010
like you said it,
you know,

2202
01:45:22,011 --> 01:45:24,220
we need good role models.
There's,

2203
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:27,020
you know,
there's so many fucked up people that

2204
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:29,870
these kids want to emulate today.
You know,

2205
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:31,940
and I see it because I came up in New
York,

2206
01:45:31,941 --> 01:45:34,220
I worked in all the underground hip hop
clubs.

2207
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:39,020
I work for the Pope or pot.
I used to deliver pot to all the rap

2208
01:45:39,021 --> 01:45:41,270
stars.
I delivered pot pot.

2209
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:42,620
My friend,
uh,

2210
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:44,870
the student Matt worked for Tristar.
You like,

2211
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:49,070
Yo meet me at the Boston Comedy Club.
There's this black comedian there and

2212
01:45:49,071 --> 01:45:53,060
he's gonna be fucking huge.
And I would show up on my bike and you

2213
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:54,610
know who you know,
who the fuck it was?

2214
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:56,130
Dave Chappelle,
Chappelle,

2215
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,470
they fucking Chappelle.

2216
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:01,040
And when he did half baked,
did you notice that he put the weed

2217
01:46:01,041 --> 01:46:04,490
delivery guy in all bike here?
Where the fuck he think he got that

2218
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:06,200
phone?
I used to show up.

2219
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:10,730
I never carried a bag.
I showed up with a $4,000 carbon fiber

2220
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,630
carbon fiber frame and I had a black
water bottle.

2221
01:46:14,631 --> 01:46:17,150
And all the weed bags was in the two
water bottles.

2222
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:21,680
So it just looked like I was a cyclist
out on a motherfucking out on a ride.

2223
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,450
Oh,
Dave Chappelle.

2224
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:25,100
Yeah.
And then they,

2225
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,210
uh,
Dave Chappelle,

2226
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:27,240
we didn't,
he,

2227
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,960
he blew up so fast.
Matt Heine was the guy's name.

2228
01:46:29,961 --> 01:46:34,700
He was the publicist at Tristar pitches
and then I delivered to them at the

2229
01:46:34,701 --> 01:46:38,900
Boston comedy club and within like
months he was living in some police show

2230
01:46:38,901 --> 01:46:42,650
fucking spot on second avenue and 15th
in the.

2231
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:43,611
And I'm like,
Yo,

2232
01:46:43,611 --> 01:46:45,910
how the fuck did you get from their
head?

2233
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,150
He just,
you know.

2234
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,410
But yeah,
it's like,

2235
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,640
um,
you know,

2236
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:54,150
just thankfully the dudes show me the
right path in life.

2237
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:55,740
And uh,
I've been,

2238
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:58,380
I've been trying to stick with it and
pay it forward.

2239
01:46:58,410 --> 01:47:00,240
That's my whole thing is paying it
forward,

2240
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:04,620
paying the knowledge forward pain.
You go out of my way to fucking help

2241
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:06,420
people.
I feed the homeless in New York.

2242
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:11,421
I sponsor a soup kitchen.
I've done benefits that have been on MTV

2243
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:13,920
because you know,
I grew up being starved,

2244
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:16,980
man in the foster home,
like this bitch fed us.

2245
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:20,880
She would take a oreos and she didn't
like to fill in,

2246
01:47:20,881 --> 01:47:24,750
so she would scrape off the filling and
spit it in a bowl and put it on green,

2247
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:26,910
moldy bread.
That was our meal for the day.

2248
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:31,020
So we had to learn to scam as kids.
They fed us rotten food.

2249
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:32,520
We were never allowed in the house.

2250
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:35,460
They beat the shit out of us.
They were so cheap.

2251
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:38,520
They made us clean their carpets with
toilet bowl brushes,

2252
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:40,890
new toilet bowl brush,
because they didn't want to run the

2253
01:47:40,891 --> 01:47:44,790
electricity.
All seven kids had to take a bath in the

2254
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:48,450
same fucking bathtub water,
one after the other.

2255
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:52,560
So how do we get around that?
We went to the fucking gas station and

2256
01:47:52,561 --> 01:47:56,250
we would fucking bathe,
do pocket showers and everything was

2257
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:58,740
about survival.
It was all survival,

2258
01:47:58,741 --> 01:48:00,480
survival.
Even even on the streets.

2259
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:03,600
I was a heroin mule.
That's how I survived.

2260
01:48:03,601 --> 01:48:05,280
I,
I left St John's.

2261
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:07,410
That's how I got into punk rock.
You know,

2262
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:08,370
the Ramones,
rock,

2263
01:48:08,371 --> 01:48:09,150
rock,
rock,

2264
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:12,450
rock away,
beach St John's home for boys,

2265
01:48:12,451 --> 01:48:14,310
rockaway beach,
1976.

2266
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:14,881
I'm like,
Yo,

2267
01:48:14,881 --> 01:48:17,550
I'm weird.
And I started getting into iggy pop and

2268
01:48:17,551 --> 01:48:19,300
all that and then,
you know,

2269
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:21,690
it was,
and then I'm seeing the ramones hanging

2270
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:24,090
out at 116th street at the circle.

2271
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:27,870
And um,
and when I split from the boys home,

2272
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:31,050
I moved in with these junkies in this
bungalow and they're like,

2273
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:32,610
Yo,
go down the alphabet city,

2274
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:33,710
you're gonna,
you're gonna.

2275
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:38,720
Carry all the heroin back for us.
So that was my gig and then he set the

2276
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:41,370
guy up and robbed him and all this crazy
shit.

2277
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:46,400
Then I was making fake acid and go into
the garden and it just a fucking street

2278
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,900
urchin.
And then I got into the angel dust,

2279
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:53,010
a selling it in forest park at the dome.
Frank Grillo.

2280
01:48:53,011 --> 01:48:54,450
His father knew who,
you know,

2281
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:55,890
Frank Grillo to actor.
Yeah.

2282
01:48:55,891 --> 01:48:57,240
He's friends with talent.
Yeah.

2283
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:59,160
Very good friends.
Fucking,

2284
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,610
he's another great human being man.
Uh,

2285
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:02,663
frank.
Uh,

2286
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,130
I know from crunch I met him at crunch
actually,

2287
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:08,520
like there was a lot of cool people that
were in his father.

2288
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:09,241
He goes,
Yo,

2289
01:49:09,241 --> 01:49:12,030
I just read this guy's book,
like you hung out.

2290
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:14,510
His father was like supposedly homeless
and flaws.

2291
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:18,510
You remember this kid that used to hang
out with disco and oldies and Bobby Byrd

2292
01:49:18,511 --> 01:49:20,340
and all these guys.
And so he's like,

2293
01:49:20,341 --> 01:49:22,920
Yo,
where the fuck did you hear those names?

2294
01:49:22,921 --> 01:49:24,920
Like is this Guy John,
you know,

2295
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:27,450
John Joseph v was a fucking kid back
then.

2296
01:49:27,451 --> 01:49:28,820
And,
and uh,

2297
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:29,693
you know,
it was,

2298
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:32,100
was on the streets over there and
fucking selling,

2299
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:34,820
selling dust at the dome.
And uh,

2300
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:36,300
so just all,
you know,

2301
01:49:36,301 --> 01:49:39,960
all that crazy.
Like I've been around all those negative

2302
01:49:39,961 --> 01:49:41,970
people and try to like,
you know,

2303
01:49:41,971 --> 01:49:43,830
I had people,
this one guy,

2304
01:49:43,831 --> 01:49:46,260
junior nuts and ducky host and they both
got murdered,

2305
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:48,730
but they will be like,
take that pipe and go smash that guy in

2306
01:49:48,731 --> 01:49:52,330
the fucking face with it.
And I would do it because I was 14 years

2307
01:49:52,331 --> 01:49:55,930
old.
I'm on the fucking streets and you know,

2308
01:49:55,931 --> 01:50:00,931
you try to impress crazy motherfuckers
by being crazy and I did a lot of fucked

2309
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:06,931
up stupid shit in my life.
Then I'm still trying to write a,

2310
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:13,180
the karmic scales for.
So my work will never be done until the

2311
01:50:13,181 --> 01:50:16,150
last breath I take in,
in his lifetime.

2312
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:18,160
I,
I'm trying to help trying to help

2313
01:50:18,161 --> 01:50:19,810
people.
And uh,

2314
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,570
you know what,
by whatever methods I can,

2315
01:50:22,571 --> 01:50:23,540
you know,
that's what.

2316
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,900
Well,
that's a beautiful path,

2317
01:50:24,901 --> 01:50:25,411
man.
I mean,

2318
01:50:25,411 --> 01:50:28,530
you've turned a terrible situation and a
terrible,

2319
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:33,560
terrible circumstances into a way that
you've created now where you're

2320
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:36,750
inspiring people all the time.
That's very positive.

2321
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:39,000
I mean,
just the impact that you have.

2322
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:42,300
I think one of the things that we were
talking about earlier about all the

2323
01:50:42,301 --> 01:50:46,410
negativity that people have online.
I think part of the problem with that is

2324
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:49,980
I don't think people totally understand
communication.

2325
01:50:49,981 --> 01:50:54,420
I think what we're handed is these tools
to distribute our thoughts and our

2326
01:50:54,421 --> 01:50:58,800
information and we're trying to get
rudimentary reactions and we're not

2327
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:03,810
understanding that these reactions don't
just stop with the person that we're

2328
01:51:03,811 --> 01:51:06,300
interacting with.
They affect ourselves because they

2329
01:51:06,301 --> 01:51:09,990
affect how we feel about ourselves.
If you write some petty shit about

2330
01:51:09,991 --> 01:51:12,420
someone you don't respect yourself,
you,

2331
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:14,370
you.
If you write some nasty,

2332
01:51:14,371 --> 01:51:17,100
snarky,
petty shit about someone and you're

2333
01:51:17,101 --> 01:51:20,520
insulting for no reason,
you know you're insulting for no reason

2334
01:51:20,521 --> 01:51:21,720
and you feel it yourself.

2335
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:24,300
You don't have great self respect for
yourself for that,

2336
01:51:24,301 --> 01:51:26,910
and then on top of that,
that person that you hurt their

2337
01:51:26,911 --> 01:51:29,280
feelings,
they might perhaps interact with other

2338
01:51:29,281 --> 01:51:31,380
people negatively because of that as
well.

2339
01:51:31,381 --> 01:51:35,820
Chain reaction they might get.
They might become the first to attack

2340
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:38,460
next because they'd been attacked before
too,

2341
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:42,390
so they start acting that way in the for
what it is is a lack of understanding

2342
01:51:42,391 --> 01:51:43,890
that a lot of us have,
all of us,

2343
01:51:43,891 --> 01:51:47,070
I've been guilty of it to have the
impact that our,

2344
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:51,390
that our communication has because we're
not thinking about it in a comprehensive

2345
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:56,160
widescale look with thinking about in
terms of that is annoying to me,

2346
01:51:56,161 --> 01:51:59,430
so I'm going to fuck that guy's world up
by saying shitty things about him and

2347
01:51:59,431 --> 01:52:02,070
his fat,
stupid face and whatever you want to say

2348
01:52:02,071 --> 01:52:03,420
about them.
And insult them,

2349
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,280
and

2350
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,800
I'm going to tell you what a lot of the
problem is too.

2351
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:11,890
And I see it all the time.
We're losing the art of even having a

2352
01:52:12,111 --> 01:52:17,111
conversation between human beings
because this is what everybody does when

2353
01:52:17,181 --> 01:52:20,480
you see them going down the
motherfucking street and Yo New York is

2354
01:52:20,481 --> 01:52:23,870
still motherfucker's dangerous.
And now all these motherfucking texting

2355
01:52:23,871 --> 01:52:27,510
zombies can come out of the club and
they fucking

2356
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:30,980
rob.
They're getting run over there getting

2357
01:52:30,981 --> 01:52:32,540
fucking crazy,
you know.

2358
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:36,200
But the thing is,
is like this right now,

2359
01:52:36,201 --> 01:52:39,440
we have a law.
I go out with my friend Jake from rocks

2360
01:52:39,441 --> 01:52:42,620
off in New York City.
He does all the rocks off towards it,

2361
01:52:42,621 --> 01:52:44,480
does all this stuff.
He has a role.

2362
01:52:44,570 --> 01:52:48,120
When he out to dinner,
everyone has to hand them motherfuckers

2363
01:52:48,121 --> 01:52:52,340
cell phone in to the fucking Maitre d
and no cell phones.

2364
01:52:52,490 --> 01:52:54,650
So that you sit there and talk with each
other.

2365
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:58,680
You have the conversation and it's,
what is it?

2366
01:52:58,681 --> 01:53:01,400
You know,
I saw this whole special and it was um,

2367
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,730
it was on CNN and it was Anderson
Cooper.

2368
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,520
And um,
it was the guy that was teaching

2369
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:11,000
mindfulness,
I forget he's been teaching meditation.

2370
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:14,300
I wrote about him in my book.
So the whole rule was they had to be

2371
01:53:14,301 --> 01:53:17,720
mindful the entire time that they were
at this thing.

2372
01:53:17,721 --> 01:53:19,430
They had that no cell phone,
no TV,

2373
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:22,310
no nothing.
And they had to be mindful when they ate

2374
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:24,200
mindful,
when they took a shower,

2375
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:25,760
mindful when they walked down the
street,

2376
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:30,850
remaining mindful during conversations,
respecting other people and like it was

2377
01:53:33,021 --> 01:53:36,740
heads of the heads,
the CEO of fucking Google and all these

2378
01:53:36,741 --> 01:53:41,741
big companies were there and what they
learned at this retreat for the 10 days

2379
01:53:42,261 --> 01:53:43,820
or whatever,
that they were there a week.

2380
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:49,040
It was so powerful that they took that
and implemented that in their companies.

2381
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,490
And now google,
they make everybody sit down and in

2382
01:53:52,491 --> 01:53:57,491
fucking auditorium before they start
their day up there in a silicone valley

2383
01:53:57,921 --> 01:54:01,220
or wherever the fuck they are.
And they have to just sit there for 10

2384
01:54:01,221 --> 01:54:05,210
minutes and be mindful and meditate and
be mindful.

2385
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:10,390
And that's something that's becoming a
lost part of humanity because it,

2386
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:12,820
you know,
the,

2387
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:13,301
the,
the,

2388
01:54:13,301 --> 01:54:17,240
the Internet and all of this shit.
It's like people are losing touch with

2389
01:54:17,241 --> 01:54:21,410
themselves and with each other.
You don't validate me.

2390
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:22,460
I don't got to,
you know,

2391
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:25,430
what I do with them.
People when they even knew I was coming

2392
01:54:25,431 --> 01:54:28,170
on here and they was talking shit I
fucking deleted.

2393
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:29,430
I didn't even read them off.
Uh,

2394
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:32,750
comments.
Once I saw a few toxic words,

2395
01:54:32,751 --> 01:54:33,830
I'm like,
fuck you,

2396
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:36,290
delete block.
See a fucking later.

2397
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,510
To me it's out of sight,
out of mind.

2398
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:42,660
I just don't have time for people
capable of.

2399
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:44,570
Yeah.
Because you know,

2400
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:49,130
I still have the tendency to do the for
disagreements.

2401
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:51,350
I,
I do take things personal.

2402
01:54:51,351 --> 01:54:52,890
I will make assumptions.
I'm,

2403
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:55,400
I'm a work in progress.
I'm not healed.

2404
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:58,160
Just like I say,
I'm always going to be an addict.

2405
01:54:58,161 --> 01:55:01,700
There's always that possibility that I'm
going to fucking.

2406
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:06,880
I have to have my coat of armor,
which I say in my sword of fucking pma

2407
01:55:07,311 --> 01:55:09,930
and my coat of armor,
which is everything I do everyday,

2408
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:13,220
but I'm not beyond the shit.
I'm China,

2409
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:17,360
so you know,
why the fuck do I want to go hang out

2410
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:21,300
with very negative people or listen,
you know,

2411
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,660
or if somebody starts talking shit about
somebody else,

2412
01:55:23,661 --> 01:55:25,430
you know what I say to them now,
Yo my man,

2413
01:55:25,431 --> 01:55:28,700
did you tell so and so that,
why the fuck you telling me I don't

2414
01:55:28,701 --> 01:55:31,670
want,
I don't want to hear it and I forget

2415
01:55:31,671 --> 01:55:34,250
which philosopher said it,
but he goes,

2416
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:40,360
the only true a examination of a,
like when we find fault in others,

2417
01:55:41,781 --> 01:55:44,070
it's really what we're seeing in
ourselves.

2418
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:48,370
We're pointing out the bad shit and
ourselves for sure constantly for

2419
01:55:48,371 --> 01:55:50,400
finding,
you know,

2420
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:54,360
with other people.
And it comes back to that fly mentality,

2421
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:55,380
man.
I just,

2422
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:59,370
you know,
and try to set the good example and

2423
01:55:59,371 --> 01:56:03,900
that's another thing Paul said examples
better than precept and right now you

2424
01:56:03,901 --> 01:56:07,920
just have a motherfucker,
a bunch of people talking shit instead

2425
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:11,160
of trying to be the example and try to
live it and do it.

2426
01:56:11,161 --> 01:56:15,750
There are a ton of people out there that
is crushing it and staying positive and

2427
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:16,860
doing,
you know,

2428
01:56:16,861 --> 01:56:19,080
getting off drugs,
getting off alcohol,

2429
01:56:19,081 --> 01:56:23,040
like even the people in this program and
you don't even notice shit that these

2430
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:25,410
guys have been to.
It's fucking insane.

2431
01:56:25,411 --> 01:56:30,411
Can you imagine spending 20 years in a
fucking jail cell or going to Pelican

2432
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:34,650
Bay or going at Pelican Bay,
being in the shoe,

2433
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:38,460
like what the fuck that does to human
beings.

2434
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:42,390
Like the strength that that takes,
and I'm going to tell you,

2435
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:46,950
and the other reason I got involved is
because my uncle back in the day worked

2436
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:50,730
at Chino prison in the seventies and
eighties.

2437
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:53,970
He was like the assistant warden or
something in Chino,

2438
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:56,370
Chino,
if you know the prison system,

2439
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:59,130
what they call it here in California is
gladiator school,

2440
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:04,200
but there's a documentary about this guy
and he's a former navy seal and he went

2441
01:57:04,201 --> 01:57:08,820
in there and the documentary's called
salvage lives and he went in there and

2442
01:57:08,821 --> 01:57:11,590
taught these guys.
He put them through like a little buds.

2443
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:13,500
Dang squirted him with holes,
trained them.

2444
01:57:13,501 --> 01:57:16,770
Fucking hot as hell.
Taught him every aspect of commercial

2445
01:57:16,771 --> 01:57:21,771
diving and when they got released he got
them jobs on oil rigs and all this

2446
01:57:23,041 --> 01:57:25,650
stuff,
making six figures and the guys who were

2447
01:57:25,651 --> 01:57:29,580
working for these oil companies,
they said these are the most skilled

2448
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:34,080
fucking people that we've ever had come
to work for these companies.

2449
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:39,680
So between trying to be the set a good
example and seeing that people before me

2450
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:43,650
that's done it and wanting to reach out
and help people have seen and my uncle

2451
01:57:43,651 --> 01:57:47,400
telling me about this guy and then
seeing the documentary when it came on,

2452
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:51,360
I was just like,
I gotta try to do something to turn the

2453
01:57:51,361 --> 01:57:55,080
tide and having a platform like Netflix
or whoever is going to pick up this

2454
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:56,370
documentary.
It's like,

2455
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:00,150
you know,
if it could show people listening,

2456
01:58:00,151 --> 01:58:01,920
stopping costs,
aerating motherfuckers.

2457
01:58:01,921 --> 01:58:04,650
It's about education,
not incarceration.

2458
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:07,380
These are not animals.
These are human beings.

2459
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:09,210
It's a broken system.
It is.

2460
01:58:09,211 --> 01:58:09,780
Sure.

2461
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:12,330
It's not helping anybody.
It's just making people harder.

2462
01:58:12,331 --> 01:58:15,540
Criminals and it's just punishing them
by keeping them locked in a cage and

2463
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:18,720
they never get any better.
And then the idea is that you're

2464
01:58:18,930 --> 01:58:22,650
removing the dangerous elements of
society and protecting the rest of us.

2465
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,670
Yeah,
I get that.

2466
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:27,300
But there's this idea of rehabilitation.
It's nonexistent

2467
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:30,960
now.
They even removed the exercise equipment

2468
01:58:30,961 --> 01:58:33,870
in the prison because now if you watch
13 years,

2469
01:58:33,871 --> 01:58:34,704
right?
Yeah,

2470
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,160
they,
you know,

2471
01:58:36,290 --> 01:58:41,290
it's basically like warehousing bodies,
man and violate them.

2472
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:45,460
One dude got violated for smoking a
cigarette in a facility and they sent

2473
01:58:45,461 --> 01:58:47,740
them back to serve the rest of his
fucking sentence.

2474
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:51,850
There is crazy.
And especially out here in California

2475
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:56,851
like California and Texas and Florida,
man is fucking crazy.

2476
01:58:58,270 --> 01:58:59,150
You know.
And,

2477
01:58:59,210 --> 01:59:00,011
and,
and look,

2478
01:59:00,011 --> 01:59:04,030
I look back to the whole situation that
went down in the eighties because I

2479
01:59:04,031 --> 01:59:07,810
really try to do research and the whole
thing that went down.

2480
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:11,890
You had a nancy fucking Reagan saying,
just say no.

2481
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:16,480
And you know what George Bush senior was
doing the fondos operations in South

2482
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,990
America.
You know about that selling crack.

2483
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:21,760
Fuck is selling motherfucking crack.
The vice president was bringing the

2484
01:59:21,761 --> 01:59:23,440
cocaine landed in freeway.

2485
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:27,610
Ricky on Holy Shit landing the planes in
Arkansas.

2486
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:31,120
Right?
But Governor Clinton and transporting

2487
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:34,420
the cocaine and then decided the Tom
Cruise movie.

2488
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:35,560
Fuck yeah,
I saw it.

2489
01:59:35,561 --> 01:59:36,580
I loved it.
What is it called?

2490
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:38,860
Made in America.
America made in America.

2491
01:59:38,861 --> 01:59:40,630
Yeah.
And the thing was,

2492
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:45,190
and then they passed.
They passed these draconian fucking drug

2493
01:59:45,191 --> 01:59:46,990
laws like,
I think you could get caught.

2494
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:52,080
I forget what the exact amount of grams.
We're of minute portion of crack

2495
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:55,060
cocaine.
And there was dudes getting busted with

2496
01:59:55,061 --> 01:59:59,140
quarter pounds of Co fucking coke,
but that's white man's.

2497
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:01,360
And they would get fucking a slap on the
wrist.

2498
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:03,670
These dudes will go away for 10 years.
So they,

2499
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:07,270
they put the cocaine in neighborhoods,
they funded all their operations in

2500
02:00:07,271 --> 02:00:11,350
South America and then they pass
draconian drug laws.

2501
02:00:11,590 --> 02:00:13,630
And this was the Clintons.
Hello,

2502
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,550
Michael.
Rupert.

2503
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:17,560
Michael.
Rupert was exposed all that.

2504
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:21,880
Do you remember they had those town hall
meetings with the Dea and the CIA and

2505
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:26,770
the Michael Rupert who was a,
he was a homicide detective for the Los

2506
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:26,940
Angeles Police Department.

2507
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,130
You know what I did?
I did,

2508
02:00:29,131 --> 02:00:30,330
I did.
I think

2509
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:32,800
it wasn't a homicide.
It was homicide.

2510
02:00:32,801 --> 02:00:34,330
Right.
And he,

2511
02:00:34,331 --> 02:00:39,331
um,
he went in front of this big meeting on

2512
02:00:39,371 --> 02:00:42,730
CNN and explained it to everyone was
cspan or CNN,

2513
02:00:42,731 --> 02:00:45,220
I don't remember,
but it was on television and he

2514
02:00:45,221 --> 02:00:50,221
explained that he busted the CIA selling
drugs in the inner city and that he has

2515
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:55,360
documents that can prove there's a
detailed history of them selling drugs

2516
02:00:55,361 --> 02:00:56,710
than using those profits overseas.

2517
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:00,630
There was a documentary about it that
came out and it was these big,

2518
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:05,970
uh,
the big drug dudes in La said,

2519
02:01:05,971 --> 02:01:07,710
yeah,
these guys would just show up with

2520
02:01:07,711 --> 02:01:10,200
fucking van loads of fucking cold.

2521
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,930
Can you ever see that video of him
talking in front of those people?

2522
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,990
See if you find that video because it's
fucking crazy eyeopening video.

2523
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:19,500
But there's,
they're having this town hall meeting.

2524
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:21,060
Here it is right here.
Oh yeah.

2525
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,550
I saw drugs throughout this country for

2526
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:29,710
fuck him.
How been

2527
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:38,240
crazy
allegations of CIA involvement in

2528
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:39,580
it.
They,

2529
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,290
they

2530
02:01:40,290 --> 02:01:43,790
listened.
I obvious way.

2531
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:46,530
That is an answer for a lot of you.
And now had you played.

2532
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:50,790
I refer now.
Can you place I to right?

2533
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,073
Wait,
wait,

2534
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:54,093
wait,

2535
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:04,740
what the fuck?
The CIA selling drugs just told

2536
02:02:04,741 --> 02:02:05,580
everybody that.

2537
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:09,820
Do you know that they declassified those
papers to fucking those.

2538
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,230
You can read all of those papers now
online that they fucking did that shit.

2539
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:17,980
Then they invested in the fucking
prisons.

2540
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,890
So they're making money.
That's the crazy thing.

2541
02:02:20,891 --> 02:02:21,910
Is privatized prisons

2542
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:26,800
the most evil thing that you can make
money and therefore you're incentivized

2543
02:02:26,801 --> 02:02:30,610
to make draw the drug laws are more
strict so you can get more people in

2544
02:02:30,611 --> 02:02:32,200
prison.
So you generate more income.

2545
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,220
13th man,
if you ain't seen [inaudible]

2546
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:37,750
documentary.
When I saw that,

2547
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:42,770
I knew what my calling was to do because
you know Noah Levine,

2548
02:02:43,021 --> 02:02:45,450
he wrote this book,
Dharma punks and he's been a Buddhist.

2549
02:02:45,451 --> 02:02:48,310
He was a heroin addict.
He used to do a Buddhist ministry and

2550
02:02:48,311 --> 02:02:53,311
the prisons in and change these people's
lives and you know,

2551
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:54,091
he,
he,

2552
02:02:54,091 --> 02:02:57,570
they came out in his magazine called
Satya and I read this article.

2553
02:02:57,750 --> 02:03:01,200
So Satya in Sanskrit means the motive
goodness.

2554
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:04,740
So that's what this magazine was called.
And I read this article about these

2555
02:03:04,741 --> 02:03:09,210
inmates daddy was working with and one
of them said he was never getting out.

2556
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:10,670
He's,
you know,

2557
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:14,910
life without the possibility.
And he said if I had access to the

2558
02:03:14,911 --> 02:03:17,430
information of what I've learned through
this program,

2559
02:03:17,431 --> 02:03:21,240
I wouldn't be where I'm at.
So then that planted the seed in me and

2560
02:03:21,241 --> 02:03:25,470
then just seeing what the whole shit
turned into,

2561
02:03:25,471 --> 02:03:29,520
how the people that really need the food
deserts in everything that's going on in

2562
02:03:29,521 --> 02:03:32,850
this country and the research I've done
and everything I've been talking about

2563
02:03:32,851 --> 02:03:37,800
and fighting for change by taking action
against the fucked up shit.

2564
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:41,940
And then 13th coming out and just lit
another fire under me.

2565
02:03:41,941 --> 02:03:42,774
I'm like,
man,

2566
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,960
let's fucking like help these people,
man.

2567
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:46,950
And,
and um,

2568
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:50,250
but yeah,
the whole I knew about all that coke

2569
02:03:50,251 --> 02:03:54,120
shit back in the fucking day.
And at first I was like,

2570
02:03:54,121 --> 02:03:56,310
Yo,
because congress wouldn't cut a check to

2571
02:03:56,311 --> 02:04:00,420
him to do his dirty fucking shit down in
South America.

2572
02:04:00,430 --> 02:04:02,470
Good.
We got our hands in wars all over this

2573
02:04:02,471 --> 02:04:06,310
fucking trying to take down governments
all over this fucking planet,

2574
02:04:06,311 --> 02:04:07,900
man.
It's insane.

2575
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:10,410
Yeah.
That barry seal story's fantastic.

2576
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:13,560
That's the guy who they the Tom Cruise
played in that movie.

2577
02:04:13,561 --> 02:04:15,150
I mean,
it's a fucked up version of it in the

2578
02:04:15,151 --> 02:04:16,800
movie.
I'm sure it's not totally accurate,

2579
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:20,280
but that guy was selling drugs and he
was going to South America and bringing

2580
02:04:20,281 --> 02:04:23,700
them over and dropping them off in
Arkansas while Clinton was the governor.

2581
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:27,260
Any part of them.
There's The da do it was like,

2582
02:04:27,261 --> 02:04:28,970
I fucking got you.
Yup.

2583
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,620
Call comes.
Let them go.

2584
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:32,300
Guess who it was?
Bill Clinton.

2585
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:33,810
Yeah.
That's fast.

2586
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:37,710
That's a fucking fact.
That really happened and you get,

2587
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,160
you know

2588
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,750
Hillary Clinton,
I'm for black people in this and that.

2589
02:04:40,751 --> 02:04:42,420
No you ain't you.
And now she's like,

2590
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:44,580
yeah,
we have to change the fucking prison

2591
02:04:44,581 --> 02:04:46,970
laws and the sentencing laws on drugs
though.

2592
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:50,190
You created those two.
Three strikes was your fucking husband.

2593
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:55,000
She's a fascinating character because
people want to think of her as being

2594
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:57,910
this super progressive person because
she's a woman and because she's a

2595
02:04:57,911 --> 02:05:00,100
Democrat,
she didn't believe in gay marriage

2596
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:01,650
until 2013.
Sorry,

2597
02:05:01,690 --> 02:05:03,480
Shit I got.
I got fucking.

2598
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,320
I saw videos of talking shit against gay
marriage and,

2599
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,390
and like,
you know,

2600
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:14,660
marriage should be to unity of a man and
a woman and guy like it's all political.

2601
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:16,740
It's all mouthpieces.
They,

2602
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,710
they changed it.
No one can take a stance and say,

2603
02:05:19,711 --> 02:05:22,740
this is who the fuck I am.
The matter what group I'm talking in

2604
02:05:22,741 --> 02:05:25,350
front of that.
So I look to and have respect.

2605
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:27,390
I don't change my stance on shit.

2606
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:29,090
Well,
you remember when Bernie Sanders is

2607
02:05:29,091 --> 02:05:31,450
trying to get it to release the
transcripts of those speeches that she

2608
02:05:31,451 --> 02:05:33,110
gave in front of the bankers.
Come on,

2609
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:37,100
tell us what you.
Those fucking things buried long gone

2610
02:05:37,101 --> 02:05:38,180
like,
no chance.

2611
02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:41,570
You're not going to release those.
That would be some dark shit where she's

2612
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,580
making sure that you're going to make
more money.

2613
02:05:43,581 --> 02:05:46,280
You can me an office.
I'm going to make sure you keep making

2614
02:05:46,281 --> 02:05:48,140
money.
We're here to make you make more money.

2615
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:49,950
I,
I've seen,

2616
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:54,520
uh,
your comments on trump to some pong.

2617
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:56,110
What do you think about homeboy

2618
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:58,230
this?
I think no one should be president.

2619
02:05:58,290 --> 02:06:02,460
And I think the idea of having a
popularity contest fucking ridiculous.

2620
02:06:02,490 --> 02:06:03,540
It's ridiculous.
Well,

2621
02:06:03,541 --> 02:06:07,750
we should have as a council of wise
people and they should have school,

2622
02:06:08,150 --> 02:06:13,080
the real shit be a group of the most
wise a codified yes,

2623
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:15,020
but I mean you should.
Your.

2624
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:17,970
Your work should be judged like it
shouldn't be partisan.

2625
02:06:17,971 --> 02:06:21,390
It shouldn't be.
You're trying to appeal to social

2626
02:06:21,391 --> 02:06:25,540
justice warriors are radical
progressives or radical conservatives or

2627
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:30,240
right wing Christian fundamentalists.
It should be you're making sense because

2628
02:06:30,241 --> 02:06:34,320
you understand law and fairness and
ethics and morals and values and you

2629
02:06:34,321 --> 02:06:38,910
understand like with an objective sense
and an educated sense of how to

2630
02:06:38,911 --> 02:06:43,170
establish a quality community of human
beings,

2631
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:48,260
civilization in which people can prosper
in which laws are fair and in which we

2632
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:51,810
we established what are what,
what,

2633
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:55,110
what do we find necessary?
What do we find important?

2634
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:57,510
What's imperative?
Education,

2635
02:06:57,870 --> 02:07:00,720
community,
all these different values and enforce

2636
02:07:00,721 --> 02:07:05,610
those in it somehow or another,
figure out a way to make this world a

2637
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:09,270
better place than what it is now.
Engineer a better place.

2638
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,750
That's not what we get.
What you get is some person who says

2639
02:07:12,751 --> 02:07:15,180
they're going to do all kinds of shit
until they get in there and they very

2640
02:07:15,181 --> 02:07:15,860
rarely do.

2641
02:07:15,860 --> 02:07:19,640
Did you see the Ab shit that they just
put up for all of fucking trump,

2642
02:07:19,641 --> 02:07:23,300
like the shitty promise on the campaign
and now we're actually doing.

2643
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:24,770
It's fun.
No one's done any different,

2644
02:07:24,771 --> 02:07:27,350
but Obama did the same shit.
Bama did the same shit.

2645
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:29,570
They get.
Listen,

2646
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:31,310
Hillary would've done the same shit.
They all,

2647
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:32,680
they all do the same shit.
And,

2648
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:37,120
and the thing that fucked me up the most
is the vote doesn't decide who the fuck

2649
02:07:37,121 --> 02:07:40,300
gets in tradition.
It's fucking the electoral college is.

2650
02:07:40,301 --> 02:07:43,450
What the fuck is that shit?
Who is that?

2651
02:07:43,451 --> 02:07:44,790
Who the fuck?
Wonderful.

2652
02:07:45,330 --> 02:07:49,140
The government was a great idea when you
had to get on a fucking horse and take

2653
02:07:49,141 --> 02:07:51,570
your ass to Washington in order to place
your votes.

2654
02:07:51,750 --> 02:07:54,570
You don't have to do that anymore.
You could vote instantaneously.

2655
02:07:54,690 --> 02:07:57,240
People should be able to vote on issues
with their phone.

2656
02:07:57,390 --> 02:07:58,860
Okay?
Your phone's in your pocket all the

2657
02:07:58,861 --> 02:07:59,910
time.
You should be able to.

2658
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:01,770
First of all,
you should have some sort of

2659
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:05,040
understanding what you're voting on.
You should have to pass some sort of

2660
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:06,270
test.
They should say,

2661
02:08:06,271 --> 02:08:07,890
look,
do you want to vote about,

2662
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:10,260
you know,
do you want to vote on spending?

2663
02:08:10,261 --> 02:08:13,230
Do you want to vote on healthcare?
How much do you understand about

2664
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:14,100
healthcare?
Well,

2665
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:17,310
let's take a test and the people that
can pass the test,

2666
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:20,070
understanding what the consequences are,
why they're doing this,

2667
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:24,240
then you should be able to vote,
but this should be something that you

2668
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,890
should have some skin in the game.

2669
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:30,240
There should be some understanding of
what the system is.

2670
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:32,070
Instead,
you know,

2671
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:34,770
look,
I'm not a giant supporter of any

2672
02:08:34,771 --> 02:08:37,800
mainstream media,
whether it's a right wing or left wing,

2673
02:08:37,801 --> 02:08:41,940
but there's something fucked up about
these people from CNN go to these trump

2674
02:08:41,941 --> 02:08:45,300
rallies and you got hundreds of people
giving them the finger.

2675
02:08:45,301 --> 02:08:47,160
Fuck you.
You're fake news.

2676
02:08:47,170 --> 02:08:49,530
Fucking they got an American flag tee
shirts on.

2677
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:50,733
It's.
Yeah,

2678
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:51,740
there's,
there's a,

2679
02:08:51,741 --> 02:08:55,110
a nonsense almost pro wrestling aspect
to all this.

2680
02:08:55,111 --> 02:08:58,170
What has become it,
but he's profiting off this.

2681
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:00,330
Trump is.
This is for his,

2682
02:09:00,331 --> 02:09:01,350
his,
his advantage.

2683
02:09:01,351 --> 02:09:05,160
He set this up because he found a broken
system and he said,

2684
02:09:05,190 --> 02:09:07,170
oh,
I just fucking rigged the system.

2685
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:09,480
I know how to get people to like me.
I've been doing this forever.

2686
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:12,090
I'm a cocky,
arrogant billionaire.

2687
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:14,310
That's my shtick.
I'm going to walk up there with my

2688
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:16,320
$5,000 suit on and I'm going,
wow,

2689
02:09:16,410 --> 02:09:20,340
the shit out of these dummies and I'm
going to have cheered for me until these

2690
02:09:20,341 --> 02:09:22,440
guys are fake news.
You sit down,

2691
02:09:22,441 --> 02:09:24,030
you're fake news,
and everybody goes crazy.

2692
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:26,190
Yeah.
Did you see that somebody just.

2693
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:28,500
His video was,
I think it was.

2694
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:34,700
Might've been seen in and posted and it
was like the toxic level of it was his

2695
02:09:34,921 --> 02:09:37,130
group and they were just yelling at Jim
Acosta.

2696
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:40,330
Yeah,
that was talking about that too.

2697
02:09:40,350 --> 02:09:44,380
I saw it and they were all like,
fuck you fucking screen.

2698
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:47,490
I'll tell you something because I'm a.
I'm a native New Yorker and I have

2699
02:09:47,491 --> 02:09:51,390
friends that are in the unions and they
built fucking trump.

2700
02:09:51,391 --> 02:09:56,391
Burned a lot of fucking people and got
rid of fucking skilled labor and skilled

2701
02:09:58,201 --> 02:10:03,201
fucking a union people and burned union
people and hired illegals to do the

2702
02:10:03,811 --> 02:10:05,910
fucking work and his fucking bill.
All this shit.

2703
02:10:05,911 --> 02:10:08,790
This guy says he's,
you know,

2704
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:13,710
everybody says what they have to say in
order to get the votes.

2705
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:16,250
And he didn't have a good reputation
amongst console.

2706
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:17,810
Terrible,
terrible.

2707
02:10:17,811 --> 02:10:19,840
So not for paying his bills to,
hey yo.

2708
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:24,240
So many lawsuits against in school that
he fucking trump university,

2709
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:29,130
trump university.
If you gave that motherfucker your

2710
02:10:29,131 --> 02:10:30,900
money,
but you know what the doesn't mean that

2711
02:10:30,901 --> 02:10:32,480
Hillary would have been a good choice.
Now.

2712
02:10:32,610 --> 02:10:34,010
She was a terrible choice.
She's

2713
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,680
a corrupt politician.
One of the most unlikable people that's

2714
02:10:36,681 --> 02:10:39,500
ever run for office.
She in so many ways,

2715
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:41,210
crazy shit.
We're trying to get it.

2716
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:45,320
They were trying to get people to be
supporting her just because she's a

2717
02:10:45,321 --> 02:10:46,760
woman.
There was a lot of that.

2718
02:10:46,761 --> 02:10:48,380
It's like,
this is going to be your history.

2719
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:49,790
You know,
women ladies,

2720
02:10:50,090 --> 02:10:52,400
I stand with her.
So there's all these women at this

2721
02:10:52,401 --> 02:10:54,260
blind,
allegiance towards this career

2722
02:10:54,261 --> 02:10:57,050
politician.
It's completely full of shit.

2723
02:10:57,051 --> 02:11:00,290
She's been full of shit forever.
If you watched the conversation between

2724
02:11:00,291 --> 02:11:04,490
James Komi when James Comey testified
about what he did and what they found

2725
02:11:04,491 --> 02:11:07,400
with the Hillary Clinton emails and then
her version of it,

2726
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:12,640
she's just a straight liar.
She deleted 33,000 emails.

2727
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:14,180
Do you do that?
And then,

2728
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:15,150
and then,
uh,

2729
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:18,080
even worse than that,
when they rig the DNC,

2730
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:21,080
they've rigged the primary so that
Bernie Sanders was gonna lose.

2731
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:23,300
They mean they,
she had her people to.

2732
02:11:23,301 --> 02:11:27,530
The DNC was an advanced that Donna
Brazil book about his mind.

2733
02:11:27,570 --> 02:11:31,130
Yes.
The thing was he was packing fucking

2734
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:33,500
stadium.
She couldn't even fill a fucking

2735
02:11:33,501 --> 02:11:37,340
highschool gymnasium.
She was pulling all the strings and she

2736
02:11:37,341 --> 02:11:41,120
had all the favors that she was pulling
in and she had a shit ton of money

2737
02:11:41,121 --> 02:11:45,020
behind her and they were completely
arrogant and all the liberal elite and

2738
02:11:45,021 --> 02:11:47,840
the media thought that it was no chance
she was going to lose.

2739
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:50,840
She's 95 percent shoe in to win the
presidency.

2740
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:54,150
And she walked around like she was.
She thought she won.

2741
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:57,920
But you had to Bengazi Shit.
What the fuck was up with that?

2742
02:11:58,010 --> 02:12:00,720
Exactly what the fuck was going on over
there?

2743
02:12:00,721 --> 02:12:02,730
That lie and you know,
uh,

2744
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:05,330
with the dirt that's on a,
I hope,

2745
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:06,223
you know,
whatever.

2746
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:10,510
Bill Clinton,
I know you eat vegan sometimes so nobody

2747
02:12:11,100 --> 02:12:12,250
had a real problem with it.

2748
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:13,453
When,
when,

2749
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:16,220
when,
when the hate rotten them out

2750
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:20,310
all times he pulled.
But like,

2751
02:12:23,770 --> 02:12:26,670
but like she get away with that.
Like what?

2752
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:30,140
Like how about shaming all the women
that came out and accused him.

2753
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:32,440
She would attack those women and go
after them and the,

2754
02:12:32,441 --> 02:12:34,730
you know,
they mean bordain talked about that

2755
02:12:34,731 --> 02:12:39,731
recently before he killed himself.
There was a thing about what she had

2756
02:12:40,401 --> 02:12:43,400
done to attack the women who were
victims of bill,

2757
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:46,160
especially earlier career.
Oh God.

2758
02:12:46,161 --> 02:12:49,340
She fucking represented trauma Lester.
So it was one of the things that she did

2759
02:12:49,341 --> 02:12:51,320
earlier in her career.
She got them off,

2760
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,090
you know,
there's a,

2761
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:56,000
there's a videotape that Dave Smith was,
she was laughing in one of them about

2762
02:12:56,001 --> 02:12:57,260
the victims.
Like I'm like,

2763
02:12:57,261 --> 02:13:00,020
what the fuck is wrong with me?
She was laughing about the effectiveness

2764
02:13:00,021 --> 02:13:01,280
of lie detector tests.
And like,

2765
02:13:01,281 --> 02:13:02,330
obviously I don't work.

2766
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:04,420
Ha Ha.
Yeah.

2767
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:07,700
She's a piece of work.
She is man.

2768
02:13:07,730 --> 02:13:11,780
She's a long time lifelong politician
and a lawyer.

2769
02:13:11,781 --> 02:13:14,690
And what's all the shit that went down
in Arkansas?

2770
02:13:14,691 --> 02:13:17,600
The shit that the whole day were all
accused of back in the day.

2771
02:13:17,601 --> 02:13:19,190
What was that?
The a whitewater.

2772
02:13:20,530 --> 02:13:23,990
The Whitewater shit like.
And just the string of people that have

2773
02:13:23,991 --> 02:13:26,540
been fucking whack to Vince.
Yo,

2774
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:30,320
what is a great book I read a long time
ago called the strange death of Vince

2775
02:13:30,321 --> 02:13:31,170
foster.
It's like,

2776
02:13:31,171 --> 02:13:32,070
wait a minute.
What?

2777
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:35,010
They found the gun in his hand,
which you never do when you kill

2778
02:13:35,011 --> 02:13:36,690
yourself,
when you shoot yourself,

2779
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:38,840
when you shoot yourself,
he pulled that trigger blam.

2780
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:41,130
Everything goes,
the gun goes flying.

2781
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:44,530
You don't hold onto it is recoiling the
gun like you know,

2782
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:46,950
and you blow your brains out.
You're not holding your gun anymore.

2783
02:13:46,951 --> 02:13:47,784
It goes flying.

2784
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:51,060
And he was.
He had the gun in his hand and the blood

2785
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:53,790
that was missing from his body was not
on the scene of the crime.

2786
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,330
So the researchers think that they moved
his body.

2787
02:13:57,690 --> 02:13:59,960
He was dead.
They put them there and make the crime

2788
02:13:59,961 --> 02:14:01,480
scene.
They put a gun in his hands up,

2789
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:04,470
case closed.
But what was he testified he was going

2790
02:14:04,471 --> 02:14:06,810
and fucking,
he knew he had information about

2791
02:14:06,811 --> 02:14:08,130
Whitewater.
I mean,

2792
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:10,560
what he was going to say and who knows
they killed them.

2793
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:12,600
We'll never find out.
How about the guy that,

2794
02:14:12,601 --> 02:14:15,090
uh,
was one of the whistleblowers for Enron,

2795
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:20,270
shot himself in the head twice and he
threw that shit sylaria shoot yourself

2796
02:14:21,211 --> 02:14:21,930
in the head twice.
Luck.

2797
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:24,780
Case closed.
That's clearly a suicide.

2798
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:27,000
I mean,
I guess you could kind of graze your

2799
02:14:27,001 --> 02:14:29,430
head if you pussied out like,
ah.

2800
02:14:29,610 --> 02:14:30,361
And he's like,
fuck,

2801
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:30,870
I'm bleeding.

2802
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:34,080
I could do it.
It is possible,

2803
02:14:34,230 --> 02:14:38,280
but it's more likely somebody killed.
People kill people.

2804
02:14:38,281 --> 02:14:41,940
It's part of the thing when you're
involved with billion dollar deals with

2805
02:14:41,941 --> 02:14:45,600
giant corporations and they also tied
into the military industrial complex,

2806
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:49,110
who by the way,
kill innocents all the time and write it

2807
02:14:49,111 --> 02:14:51,570
off like all this shit that happened
with drones.

2808
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:54,000
What's the number?
It's like in the high eighties or 90

2809
02:14:54,001 --> 02:14:55,980
percent innocent people killed by
drones.

2810
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,560
They don't worry about that.
You think they're going to worry about

2811
02:14:58,561 --> 02:15:00,660
some guy's gonna sink,
Monsanto,

2812
02:15:00,661 --> 02:15:03,780
or sink and faucet or sink the Clintons
or sync.

2813
02:15:03,781 --> 02:15:05,160
Anybody?
Fuck that.

2814
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:08,370
Send the boys whacked out,
cleaned it up.

2815
02:15:08,371 --> 02:15:11,520
Absolutely chops off the head twice.
This conference.

2816
02:15:11,521 --> 02:15:13,350
We're all good.
Everything's wonderful.

2817
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:18,270
Here's Monsanto with some new glyphosate
that's going to fix your corn.

2818
02:15:18,450 --> 02:15:22,010
You'll never have to fucking pigweeds,
but I,

2819
02:15:22,011 --> 02:15:26,160
I read this thing that most of the,
most of the glyphosate that's being put

2820
02:15:26,161 --> 02:15:29,130
out there is by people on their fucking
own homes,

2821
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:31,320
like they don't know any better.

2822
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:33,010
They spray roundup.
It's A.

2823
02:15:33,490 --> 02:15:37,980
I have a friend who had bone cancer and
he lived near a golf course and they put

2824
02:15:37,981 --> 02:15:41,640
so many pesticides in the golf course
that had got into the groundwater.

2825
02:15:41,641 --> 02:15:42,271
Right?
And he said,

2826
02:15:42,271 --> 02:15:45,030
all these people in his neighborhood got
cancer and he wound up.

2827
02:15:45,390 --> 02:15:48,870
He has a fake femur bone.
One of his femur bones,

2828
02:15:48,871 --> 02:15:50,700
a metal.
It's a metal bone.

2829
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:54,150
You got bone cancer.
They cut his bone out and they replaced

2830
02:15:54,151 --> 02:15:55,980
it with this metal pipe.
Well,

2831
02:15:55,981 --> 02:15:57,390
my uh,
you know,

2832
02:15:57,391 --> 02:16:00,210
the,
the history of them two was agent orange

2833
02:16:00,211 --> 02:16:05,160
and all this other shit and my uncle was
forced recon in the marines and he got

2834
02:16:05,161 --> 02:16:10,161
fucking like everyone in his unit that
got behind fucking enemy lines and airy

2835
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,400
got Ms. Cancer,
fucking the shit.

2836
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:16,980
They was spraying that shit on our own
fucking troops.

2837
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:18,030
Yeah.
Well they figured,

2838
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:20,450
look this,
this is the way we got to get with.

2839
02:16:20,530 --> 02:16:22,170
The problem is they're hiding in the
jungle.

2840
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:25,260
We got to get rid of the jungle.
It's just killed the jungle with poison,

2841
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:29,800
with this crazy thinking.
They just sprayed chemicals all over the

2842
02:16:29,801 --> 02:16:30,280
jungle

2843
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:32,950
to kill the fucking forest so they could
see where the enemy are hardened.

2844
02:16:33,650 --> 02:16:36,100
And then they had the troops walking
through those chemicals.

2845
02:16:36,101 --> 02:16:37,930
It's fucking nuts.
It is.

2846
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:42,790
History will not judge them kindly when
they step back and think about what they

2847
02:16:42,791 --> 02:16:47,791
actually did mean.
It's in the 19 sixties were our parents

2848
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:52,630
generation and the way we look at it as
almost like this unfortunate thing that

2849
02:16:52,631 --> 02:16:54,970
happened,
but I almost think we're too close to it

2850
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:59,770
to recognize how horrific it is that the
soldiers who were putting their lives on

2851
02:16:59,771 --> 02:17:03,580
the line in their thought to defend our
freedom over in America,

2852
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:06,600
we're getting poisoned by their own
government.

2853
02:17:06,610 --> 02:17:06,700
Okay,

2854
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:07,421
good.
Iraq,

2855
02:17:07,421 --> 02:17:09,730
where would they put knowledgeable.
Depleted uranium.

2856
02:17:09,731 --> 02:17:12,520
Exactly.
These soldiers coming back from the Gulf

2857
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:15,010
War and everything else.
We're dumping all the fucking depleted

2858
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:17,830
uranium over and over there.
It's a dumping ground for us.

2859
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:22,920
They're getting fudges dumping they were
using and we're using it as meant they

2860
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:27,190
were putting it in in they in.
They will weaponizing and and then all

2861
02:17:27,191 --> 02:17:30,700
the fucking troops are coming back.
Having fucking kids with deformities and

2862
02:17:30,701 --> 02:17:34,150
getting cancer and all this shit turned
down for their benefits.

2863
02:17:34,190 --> 02:17:37,120
Yeah,
they denied it was even it fucking.

2864
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:38,170
What the fuck is that

2865
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:41,170
care that it's all about money for them.
They're there.

2866
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:45,370
They're distantly removed from it.
The same way someone's distantly removed

2867
02:17:45,371 --> 02:17:48,490
from factory farming.
If they buy a burger at a restaurant or

2868
02:17:48,491 --> 02:17:53,350
a burger at a fast food joint,
then not thinking about a pig that's in

2869
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:55,990
that can,
that makes that mcrib they're not

2870
02:17:55,991 --> 02:17:57,890
thinking about that.
And the people that connect.

2871
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:59,680
Yeah,
and the people that are thinking about

2872
02:17:59,681 --> 02:18:00,960
the numbers on the paper.
Look,

2873
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,240
they're number crunchers.
They gotta to save the government some

2874
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:04,660
money,
deny them,

2875
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:05,920
deny them,
make them fight

2876
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:09,890
for syndrome.
My uncle gave up.

2877
02:18:09,891 --> 02:18:12,040
Did you see the attachment?
Speaking of,

2878
02:18:12,041 --> 02:18:13,820
uh,
the military industrial complex,

2879
02:18:13,821 --> 02:18:17,050
did you see the latest movie that came
out with Woody Harrelson?

2880
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:17,960
Shocking.
Alive.

2881
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,741
You seen that?
You know,

2882
02:18:18,741 --> 02:18:20,750
I didn't say about how.
Oh,

2883
02:18:20,751 --> 02:18:24,740
they uncovered the whole fucking thing
about how the fucking weapons of mass

2884
02:18:24,741 --> 02:18:29,660
destruction was just a complete lie.
Every news media outlet except for one

2885
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:34,840
lied and backed up the government's
claim and the whole shit that times all

2886
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:37,820
times ended up apologizing like we got
it wrong.

2887
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:41,570
So you go in there,
you fucking send troops in there,

2888
02:18:41,571 --> 02:18:46,571
you fucking kill how many millions of
fucking innocent people over there and

2889
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:50,420
add it to what to sell to sell fucking
weapons.

2890
02:18:50,421 --> 02:18:51,500
And,
and push another

2891
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:53,830
in the eye and then there's the
justification after the act.

2892
02:18:53,831 --> 02:18:54,101
Well,
hey,

2893
02:18:54,101 --> 02:18:57,550
it was a good thing to get Saddam
Hussein there out of there anyway.

2894
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:58,630
He was a bad guy,

2895
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:02,830
but you haven't worked with him in the
early eighties and gave him the fucking

2896
02:19:02,831 --> 02:19:05,750
gas that he used.
So what the fuck is like?

2897
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:09,040
You know,
that was just some yeehaw shit.

2898
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:10,450
Fucking homeboy.

2899
02:19:11,150 --> 02:19:12,350
No,
well it was,

2900
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:14,990
it was.
They took advantage of an opportunity.

2901
02:19:14,991 --> 02:19:16,280
We got attacked,
you know,

2902
02:19:16,281 --> 02:19:19,790
September 11th.
The planes get hit by the towers,

2903
02:19:19,791 --> 02:19:22,520
got hit by the planes.
Everybody wanted to action and this was

2904
02:19:22,521 --> 02:19:26,420
an opportunity for them to take
advantage of this call for action.

2905
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:30,920
And though we're going against someone
that had nothing to do with the attacks

2906
02:19:30,921 --> 02:19:33,410
on September 11th,
people felt like something was

2907
02:19:33,411 --> 02:19:33,990
happening.

2908
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:35,700
The head guy from,
from,

2909
02:19:35,730 --> 02:19:38,780
from a department of defense was like,
well,

2910
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:41,220
what do you mean they're fucking,
you gotta see this movie.

2911
02:19:41,221 --> 02:19:42,930
It's all fact based too.
It's like,

2912
02:19:42,931 --> 02:19:45,840
what do you mean we're going in Iraq?
Didn't have anything to do with it.

2913
02:19:45,841 --> 02:19:47,400
What the fuck are we going into,
IRA?

2914
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:48,413
Oh,
well he,

2915
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:51,240
you know,
and then they tried to say he led a

2916
02:19:51,241 --> 02:19:56,241
Osama bin Ladin if the NSF,
if Osama bin Ladin met Saddam was saying

2917
02:19:57,561 --> 02:19:59,730
face to face,
he would tell them to go fuck himself.

2918
02:19:59,790 --> 02:20:03,600
That's how different ideologies.
Those two hats.

2919
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:05,990
Yeah,
Sama Bin Ladin was religious.

2920
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:07,333
He's.

2921
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:10,330
It's fucking crazy.
Yeah,

2922
02:20:11,810 --> 02:20:13,250
they just sold it.
They kept.

2923
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:18,490
But what's great about the movie is it
shows how they just started force

2924
02:20:18,681 --> 02:20:23,030
feeding the information out there to
create this fucking feverish,

2925
02:20:23,031 --> 02:20:23,930
kill,
kill,

2926
02:20:23,931 --> 02:20:26,930
kill fucking mentality that the
Americans.

2927
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:28,990
Well,
the same thing.

2928
02:20:28,991 --> 02:20:31,750
You're seeing what these people
screaming at Jim Acosta and you can

2929
02:20:31,751 --> 02:20:34,960
manipulate dummies mindsets and this is
what they do.

2930
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:38,920
I mean this is an easy way to pull the
strings of the most easily lead.

2931
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:42,310
You got to think who's going to these
rallies in the first place?

2932
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:45,610
Most of these people that are going to
these trump rallies or something like

2933
02:20:45,611 --> 02:20:47,020
that,
they're morons.

2934
02:20:47,140 --> 02:20:48,520
That's why they're going to these
things.

2935
02:20:48,521 --> 02:20:51,010
They don't have shit to do.
Even if you're a trump supporter,

2936
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:53,320
if you're an intelligent trump
supporter,

2937
02:20:53,321 --> 02:20:56,350
which I do believe is possible,
you're a person who's not going to go to

2938
02:20:56,351 --> 02:20:57,240
a rally.
You have,

2939
02:20:57,310 --> 02:20:58,143
you have a job.

2940
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:01,430
Jimmy Brady,
he's a fucking iron man.

2941
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:05,160
He's a firefighter in New York.
He's fucking got three kids,

2942
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:08,670
a lot of the New York city fire fire
department and Police Department

2943
02:21:08,671 --> 02:21:10,800
supported trump.
He ain't going to no fucking trump

2944
02:21:10,801 --> 02:21:11,970
rallies.
I mean he's,

2945
02:21:12,810 --> 02:21:15,360
you know,
he's a fucking really smart cat and,

2946
02:21:15,361 --> 02:21:16,194
and,
and

2947
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:21,010
those people are lost people and they
found their hero and this,

2948
02:21:21,011 --> 02:21:23,560
the problem with a guy like trump is,
he's like,

2949
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:29,100
he's an asshole,
but like he's an asshole on purpose.

2950
02:21:30,430 --> 02:21:33,880
Like this is part of his shtick is you
attack me,

2951
02:21:33,881 --> 02:21:35,310
I'll attack you back,
you know,

2952
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:37,970
and he starts making fun of Rosie
O'donnell or making fun of this.

2953
02:21:38,140 --> 02:21:41,020
Had Amanda,
we knew how to deal with people like did

2954
02:21:41,021 --> 02:21:43,450
you see his whole shit that they put in
the 13th?

2955
02:21:43,451 --> 02:21:44,560
And like,
you know,

2956
02:21:44,620 --> 02:21:47,050
he was talking to the black people that
were in the fucking.

2957
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:51,940
We knew the cops knew how to deal with
these guys back back in the day,

2958
02:21:52,210 --> 02:21:53,670
punch him in the face,
Kinnaman,

2959
02:21:53,770 --> 02:21:58,770
and then they were.
He's inciting a lot of this shit going

2960
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,030
rabble rouser.
Yeah,

2961
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:01,720
I mean,
that's part of being an asshole.

2962
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:03,970
Divide and conquer,
divide and conquer.

2963
02:22:03,971 --> 02:22:07,990
If they could keep the people fighting
each other over stupid shit,

2964
02:22:08,230 --> 02:22:10,570
then you're not going to take the time
to sit back.

2965
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:12,800
I compare those,
you know,

2966
02:22:12,850 --> 02:22:14,220
what's really going on?
I,

2967
02:22:14,221 --> 02:22:16,810
I use the analogy of,
of a magician.

2968
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,390
They're trying to tell you,
look what's in the left hand,

2969
02:22:19,391 --> 02:22:21,820
but what the real shit is in the right
hand.

2970
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:25,060
So by doing all this shit and causing
all these problems,

2971
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:28,770
you're not going to go back and look at
the shit that he's pushing through his

2972
02:22:28,771 --> 02:22:32,540
agendas.
He just cut taxes to the fucking

2973
02:22:32,590 --> 02:22:35,400
enriches people that,
uh,

2974
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:38,880
the billionaires and cooperation,
which he said he wasn't going to do.

2975
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:42,330
He's gone back on everything.
So if he could just get people,

2976
02:22:42,331 --> 02:22:46,290
fuck you and fuck you.
And getting people to hate each other

2977
02:22:46,291 --> 02:22:50,100
and keep this country is to United
States of America.

2978
02:22:50,101 --> 02:22:54,750
When the fuck,
how did we become united as a country

2979
02:22:55,140 --> 02:23:00,140
like I think a lot of these countries
right now who may pose a threat or

2980
02:23:00,331 --> 02:23:02,700
whatever,
they're seeing what the fuck's going on

2981
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:03,960
and they're like,
Yo,

2982
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:06,600
this country has never been more fucking
divided.

2983
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:11,190
It's divided states of America,
not the United States of America.

2984
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:12,900
Well,
what he's doing with these,

2985
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:17,370
these rallies is he's getting people
excited about being a part of a team and

2986
02:23:17,371 --> 02:23:18,780
a team that's winning.
You know,

2987
02:23:18,781 --> 02:23:21,960
like where the team is kicking ass and
this is team fake news over there.

2988
02:23:21,961 --> 02:23:24,310
You tell them to go fuck themselves and
nobody gets Ya,

2989
02:23:24,311 --> 02:23:24,900
Ya,
Ya.

2990
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:29,040
He's consolidating his support.
He and it doesn't have to make sense and

2991
02:23:29,041 --> 02:23:31,440
especially it doesn't have to make sense
with the people that are going to these

2992
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:33,750
rallies because they're not smart people
in the first place.

2993
02:23:33,990 --> 02:23:36,870
There are people that are easily led,
but that's the same thing with people

2994
02:23:36,871 --> 02:23:38,500
that would go to the rallies for Hillary
Clinton.

2995
02:23:38,501 --> 02:23:40,560
There are people that go to the rallies
for almost all these people.

2996
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:44,490
A giant chunk of them are just,
they're just lemmings.

2997
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,690
I don't know what to do.

2998
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:50,870
I do have to hit one thing and that was
when fuck it and Hillary Clinton Clinton

2999
02:23:54,031 --> 02:23:59,031
was losing and the faces of the crying
people who were like fucking losing

3000
02:23:59,851 --> 02:24:02,460
their shit when trump won.
I was like,

3001
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:05,490
I'm sorry,
but like fucking dude,

3002
02:24:05,491 --> 02:24:09,840
if that's the fucking truth of your
existence that you put every fucking

3003
02:24:09,841 --> 02:24:13,770
ounce of your shit into this fucking
corrupt as politician,

3004
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:19,010
whether it's fucking Hillary Clinton or
Bernie Sanders on any of them.

3005
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:23,190
I feel fucking sorry for you.
I was laughing at those people when she

3006
02:24:23,191 --> 02:24:25,710
lost,
enabled losing their shit on TV.

3007
02:24:25,711 --> 02:24:28,620
Like they were just fucking stand that.
I'm like,

3008
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:32,970
because you don't realize I travel
through America and people may be

3009
02:24:32,971 --> 02:24:37,520
progressive on the outskirts,
but go into the middle.

3010
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:42,360
It is motherfucker.
And see what you got fucking step voted

3011
02:24:42,361 --> 02:24:43,194
for that.

3012
02:24:43,650 --> 02:24:46,050
Yeah.
Well there was also people realize that

3013
02:24:46,051 --> 02:24:47,310
she was corrupt.
I mean,

3014
02:24:47,311 --> 02:24:49,260
you did a good job of calling her
corrupt

3015
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:50,620
Hillary.
Absolutely.

3016
02:24:50,621 --> 02:24:51,540
The.
He just kept.

3017
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:56,150
The mantra was going,
he loves mantras and he pushes those

3018
02:24:56,151 --> 02:24:57,950
fucking.
But they just had.

3019
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,833
Yes.
Yeah,

3020
02:24:59,210 --> 02:25:01,190
correct.
So Tracy,

3021
02:25:01,191 --> 02:25:03,960
Bernie crazy burn,
he's

3022
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:04,600
a,
he's a,

3023
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:08,710
he's a good manipulator in that sense,
but she knows she didn't do any

3024
02:25:08,711 --> 02:25:10,810
services,
but there was also like a lot of the

3025
02:25:10,811 --> 02:25:15,250
women that were really upset where like
this guy was in that video saying you

3026
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:17,470
take girls and grab them by the Pussy,
and so they,

3027
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:22,180
they felt like this was going to give
men a licensed to be sexually abusive.

3028
02:25:22,210 --> 02:25:27,210
And I think that in a of ways is what
started the ball rolling with the me too

3029
02:25:27,491 --> 02:25:30,970
movement.
It wasn't just the exposing of monsters

3030
02:25:30,971 --> 02:25:34,450
like Bill Cosby,
but it was also the fact that you're

3031
02:25:34,451 --> 02:25:37,660
dealing with this guy who gets in the
White House.

3032
02:25:37,661 --> 02:25:40,210
That's clearly not what you want.
You want.

3033
02:25:40,570 --> 02:25:43,360
If it's a man,
you want a man who respects women,

3034
02:25:43,361 --> 02:25:48,340
who's a statesman,
who's a person who has worked their life

3035
02:25:48,341 --> 02:25:50,650
to get to that position.
Not a person who did it as an

3036
02:25:50,651 --> 02:25:52,300
afterthought once they were already
famous.

3037
02:25:52,890 --> 02:25:54,250
See,
like the difference between a guy like

3038
02:25:54,251 --> 02:25:56,140
Obama,
like Obama's probably.

3039
02:25:56,440 --> 02:26:00,040
He's probably measured his words ever
since he was in college because he was

3040
02:26:00,041 --> 02:26:03,670
hoping one day he would be president.
Whereas a guy like donald trump's just

3041
02:26:03,671 --> 02:26:08,590
been banging hoes and fucking flight
around the jet with his name on it since

3042
02:26:08,591 --> 02:26:11,050
the eighties.
I mean this is what the guy did.

3043
02:26:11,051 --> 02:26:13,350
So then once he's in office,
people like,

3044
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:16,720
no,
I couldn't believe like how could this

3045
02:26:16,721 --> 02:26:19,000
have happened?
This is the pussy grabber.

3046
02:26:19,001 --> 02:26:22,390
He's not supposed to be in there and I
get their pain.

3047
02:26:22,391 --> 02:26:24,490
I understand it.
It is also funny.

3048
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:27,820
No,
but something like the women's on her

3049
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:29,730
knees with the glasses.
You ever seen a check with the

3050
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:31,930
screaming.
She's like,

3051
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:34,270
she's a meme.
She will.

3052
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,420
She will again.
They made a,

3053
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:43,600
they call it trump derangement syndrome
now because people are literally,

3054
02:26:43,601 --> 02:26:47,200
they're so angry that he is in power and
there's nothing they can do about it,

3055
02:26:47,201 --> 02:26:52,201
but the problem is that anger and that
that going derange that that empowers

3056
02:26:54,071 --> 02:26:55,090
the people that support him.

3057
02:26:55,090 --> 02:26:57,610
They don't understand when you're on
your knees screaming,

3058
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:02,240
fuck the people on the other side of the
trump supporters,

3059
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:04,740
their fucking red hats on.
They think that's hilarious.

3060
02:27:05,670 --> 02:27:07,930
This is the liberal left,
unhinged,

3061
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:10,060
detached from reality.
Meanwhile,

3062
02:27:10,061 --> 02:27:13,570
we're making America great again and
black unemployment is at an all time low

3063
02:27:13,810 --> 02:27:14,670
and you know,
it's,

3064
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:18,880
it's a weird time for the truth because
there's so many people that don't want

3065
02:27:18,890 --> 02:27:23,890
to go any further past the surface that
the truth is this guy figured out a way

3066
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:28,420
to win a rigged system.
He did.

3067
02:27:28,450 --> 02:27:29,420
He figured out a way,
uh,

3068
02:27:29,421 --> 02:27:33,670
when a rig system by pretending to be a
republican guy was a democrat his whole

3069
02:27:33,671 --> 02:27:36,070
life,
democratic supporters his whole life

3070
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:37,350
figured out a way.
Oh,

3071
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:38,590
just puck a,
be a Republican.

3072
02:27:38,591 --> 02:27:41,080
They're easier to scam weaseled his way
in,

3073
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,240
figured out a way.
This whole make America great again.

3074
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:43,841
Yeah.
Ra,

3075
02:27:43,841 --> 02:27:44,470
Ra,
Ra,

3076
02:27:44,470 --> 02:27:47,450
call people a bunch of stupid shit
campaign like a motherfucker.

3077
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:50,080
Take Diet pills,
keep that energy high.

3078
02:27:50,230 --> 02:27:53,970
Just travel all across the country doing
these rallies and one,

3079
02:27:54,310 --> 02:27:56,290
you know,
and want a system that really shouldn't

3080
02:27:56,291 --> 02:28:00,220
be there to win.
And I think that we need a better way to

3081
02:28:00,221 --> 02:28:03,820
run our government.
And the idea is fucking genius.

3082
02:28:03,880 --> 02:28:07,660
Having an Alpha male or Alpha female,
that one person,

3083
02:28:07,661 --> 02:28:10,940
the one at the top of the peak running
$300,

3084
02:28:10,941 --> 02:28:14,860
million people's insane 300 people's
insane.

3085
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:17,640
You have 300 people,
one person running shit.

3086
02:28:17,650 --> 02:28:19,690
You're going to have disagreements.
You're going to have people that are

3087
02:28:19,691 --> 02:28:23,270
upset that this one person gets to
dictate for the next four to eight

3088
02:28:23,271 --> 02:28:25,700
years.
The path of everyone in this group and

3089
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:28,260
your financial future,
your health care,

3090
02:28:28,261 --> 02:28:30,680
your.
You're all these how much taxes you pay,

3091
02:28:30,830 --> 02:28:34,280
all depending on what dipshit winds the
popularity contest.

3092
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:38,000
That's outrageous.
It's an archaic way of handling things.

3093
02:28:38,270 --> 02:28:41,630
It's just not necessary,
but the problem with letting everybody

3094
02:28:41,631 --> 02:28:45,320
vote too is that people are really
easily manipulated and they're really

3095
02:28:45,321 --> 02:28:48,710
undereducated people.
They don't have any incentive to pay

3096
02:28:48,711 --> 02:28:52,820
attention to the real issues and what's
at stake and what the consequences of

3097
02:28:52,821 --> 02:28:56,210
each vote are.
They just vote with whatever feels good

3098
02:28:56,390 --> 02:28:59,860
and they're busy and people are tired
because they're eating shitty food and

3099
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:03,340
exercise and they're working all day in
a job that sucks and they come home,

3100
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,970
their wives,
Bitch Adam and they're on

3101
02:29:04,971 --> 02:29:08,950
antidepressants and pills and there the
kids are all fucked up and they don't

3102
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:11,240
have the time.
They don't have the time and they don't

3103
02:29:11,241 --> 02:29:15,300
have the incentive to be enlightened.
They don't have the incentive to have an

3104
02:29:15,301 --> 02:29:20,301
objective in lightened approach to how
you handle the future of our society and

3105
02:29:21,141 --> 02:29:22,670
what our children are going to be left
with.

3106
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:25,280
Well,
that's why it's the genius of these

3107
02:29:25,610 --> 02:29:28,350
commercials if you.
I mean it's.

3108
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:31,400
I,
I can't even watch TV when it's election

3109
02:29:31,401 --> 02:29:35,600
time because it's just like one dude
after the next shitting on each other or

3110
02:29:35,601 --> 02:29:38,780
this person saying that we should mark
them for you.

3111
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:42,380
It's like the two things that you get
when that shit goes on.

3112
02:29:42,410 --> 02:29:45,950
One of those political commercials in
into was all the commercials for the

3113
02:29:45,951 --> 02:29:49,370
pharmaceuticals,
but that's every fucking night.

3114
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:51,950
There's two countries on earth,
New Zealand,

3115
02:29:51,980 --> 02:29:54,290
New Zealand,
and America is where you're allowed to

3116
02:29:54,291 --> 02:29:58,210
direct advertising to customers,
to patients.

3117
02:29:58,211 --> 02:30:01,330
What the fuck is that race?
Is that crazy?

3118
02:30:01,331 --> 02:30:04,250
And I love the commercials now where the
dude figures it out.

3119
02:30:04,290 --> 02:30:08,350
Well,
you asked about Warfarin and I'd be

3120
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:12,590
happy because people were walking down
the street and you see cartoon flowers

3121
02:30:12,591 --> 02:30:17,591
around them and butterflies and now if
your antidepressants is not working,

3122
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:20,420
fine,
we'll fix that up.

3123
02:30:20,810 --> 02:30:23,690
A side effects include suicidal thought.
It's like motherfucker.

3124
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:26,030
I had suicidal thoughts before.
Like Roche's,

3125
02:30:26,031 --> 02:30:29,900
rectal bleeding,
know some of the side effects are crazy.

3126
02:30:30,170 --> 02:30:31,430
It's fucking insane.

3127
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:33,730
Vilifies the.
It's an anti psychotic.

3128
02:30:33,731 --> 02:30:35,920
It's the number one prescribed
medication in the country.

3129
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:38,270
Abilify,
abilify,

3130
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,170
really?
Number one.

3131
02:30:39,171 --> 02:30:40,490
Prescribed medication.
The country.

3132
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:42,920
Wow.
It's an anti psychotic fuck.

3133
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:44,150
Yeah.
What?

3134
02:30:44,210 --> 02:30:45,380
Insane.
I know you're like,

3135
02:30:45,381 --> 02:30:46,820
what?
That's insane.

3136
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:48,020
Pull that up.
Make sure that's true.

3137
02:30:48,021 --> 02:30:49,970
I know I read that,
but make sure that it's true.

3138
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:51,740
Somebody talked about that on the
podcast.

3139
02:30:51,741 --> 02:30:54,680
Who Was it?
Do you remember article in Twenty 15

3140
02:30:54,681 --> 02:30:56,570
saying it is the America's top selling
drug.

3141
02:30:58,250 --> 02:30:59,520
Pinson,
anti-psychotic,

3142
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:02,780
Yo.
Abilify is the biggest,

3143
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:06,860
biggest selling prescription jug and the
US is a fucking pill.

3144
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:12,710
Damn top seller.
A drug has to be expensive.

3145
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:17,660
It's also widely used.
Holly's abilify is both expensive and

3146
02:31:17,661 --> 02:31:20,520
wildly used.
It's the 14th prescribed brand name

3147
02:31:20,521 --> 02:31:23,460
medication and it retails for $30 a
pill.

3148
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:26,500
So it's the biggest selling prescription
drug in the US.

3149
02:31:26,620 --> 02:31:29,100
So it's the biggest thing in,
of WHO's behind it.

3150
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:30,810
It's a good question.
Who is behind it?

3151
02:31:30,811 --> 02:31:34,260
Put Satan.
Satan pharmaceuticals.

3152
02:31:34,290 --> 02:31:37,500
America's top selling drug.
I best like abilify.

3153
02:31:38,990 --> 02:31:41,470
It's terrifying.
Fishel site.

3154
02:31:42,950 --> 02:31:44,270
Let's see.
Scumbag.

3155
02:31:46,330 --> 02:31:50,360
They're the worst.
Did you ever read confessions of Duka?

3156
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:54,210
Did you ever read Sukha?
Sukha,

3157
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:55,920
Sukha.
They're probably,

3158
02:31:55,921 --> 02:31:57,350
they probably changed names.
Cloud,

3159
02:31:57,470 --> 02:32:00,120
they do keep switching up their names.
You ever did?

3160
02:32:00,150 --> 02:32:00,931
Well,
now they,

3161
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:03,760
uh,
they changed a fucking,

3162
02:32:04,410 --> 02:32:05,830
what do you call it to,
um,

3163
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:10,800
changing the name on all these
ingredients that are in food to like,

3164
02:32:10,801 --> 02:32:12,960
um,
what is the,

3165
02:32:12,961 --> 02:32:14,700
uh,
the additive,

3166
02:32:15,070 --> 02:32:18,840
the sweetener that Donald Aspartame,
aspartame,

3167
02:32:18,841 --> 02:32:22,670
they changed their name to Aminos suite
now because you know,

3168
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:26,760
who owns the patent on fucking as
aspartame didn't.

3169
02:32:26,761 --> 02:32:28,600
Donald,
Donald,

3170
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:30,780
Rumsfeld,
Donald Rumsfeld had something to do with

3171
02:32:30,781 --> 02:32:31,610
it.
Own Stat.

3172
02:32:31,610 --> 02:32:33,300
Well,
you had something to do with passing it.

3173
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:35,340
Yeah.
He had something to do with ignoring

3174
02:32:35,341 --> 02:32:36,410
evidence,
but see,

3175
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:41,480
someone told me that the amount of
chemicals they had to give to rats,

3176
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:45,780
the amount of aspartame,
they had to give the rats to kill them

3177
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:48,420
or to give them cancer was very high and
I'm like,

3178
02:32:48,421 --> 02:32:49,530
okay,
that's good.

3179
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:53,880
That's reassuring,
but there's a great book about the

3180
02:32:53,881 --> 02:32:57,080
corruption of the pharmaceutical
companies and it's a.

3181
02:32:57,300 --> 02:33:01,710
can you google this title real quick?
It's called confessions of Gwen Olson

3182
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:06,740
wrote a book called confessions of an Rx
drug pusher and I think it was her niece

3183
02:33:07,201 --> 02:33:10,680
died of a drug interaction that they
knew about and she exposed the whole

3184
02:33:10,681 --> 02:33:12,570
corruption in the pharmaceutical
industry.

3185
02:33:12,571 --> 02:33:17,571
She was a top pharmaceutical rep and
they said they know how does a drug get

3186
02:33:17,671 --> 02:33:22,671
approved by the FDA and then they turn
around and fucking they pull it and

3187
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:26,730
people are dying and they settle for
pennies on the dollar.

3188
02:33:26,731 --> 02:33:29,730
That's the fucking game.
They know there's going to be lawsuits

3189
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:31,710
and they're like,
okay,

3190
02:33:31,711 --> 02:33:35,550
we just made $3,000,000,000 off this
drug and we settled that lawsuit for

3191
02:33:35,551 --> 02:33:38,470
$200 billion.
So that's a hundred million,

3192
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:39,600
200 million.
Right?

3193
02:33:39,601 --> 02:33:41,930
So that's the game.
That's.

3194
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:43,500
But her book is amazing.

3195
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:47,220
It's called confessions of an Rx drug
pusher and that's what she was.

3196
02:33:47,221 --> 02:33:50,700
And she would buy out the doctors.
Half the people that they put on these

3197
02:33:50,701 --> 02:33:53,820
medications,
all they have to say is change your

3198
02:33:53,821 --> 02:33:55,080
fucking lifestyle,
dude.

3199
02:33:55,410 --> 02:33:59,280
What is,
what is the father of modern medicine?

3200
02:33:59,281 --> 02:34:00,570
Hypocrisy is,
what did he say?

3201
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:03,540
Let thy food be thy medicine and
medicine be thy food.

3202
02:34:03,541 --> 02:34:05,100
There's also an IRA.
Vedic,

3203
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:09,090
I don't know if you know about the Irish
vedic system of Madison and it says

3204
02:34:09,091 --> 02:34:09,721
when,
when,

3205
02:34:09,721 --> 02:34:10,554
when,
uh,

3206
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:12,030
when,
uh,

3207
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:14,950
you know,
there's a whole quote about diet and,

3208
02:34:14,951 --> 02:34:16,400
and made it and,
and uh,

3209
02:34:16,460 --> 02:34:17,230
and,
and,

3210
02:34:17,230 --> 02:34:17,980
uh,
seeing a

3211
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,660
doctor and stuff like that.
And it's all,

3212
02:34:19,730 --> 02:34:21,550
it comes back to one thing,
man.

3213
02:34:21,551 --> 02:34:23,980
Diet and lifestyle.
Like what the fuck are you doing?

3214
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:27,340
Tell people.
And that's what's great about a movie

3215
02:34:27,341 --> 02:34:31,660
like forks over knives where there's
anecdotal evidence that says,

3216
02:34:31,661 --> 02:34:32,710
Yo,
if you stopped,

3217
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:36,940
do you see the change right there?
The fucking diabetes goes away,

3218
02:34:36,941 --> 02:34:38,640
the fucking heart disease,
all,

3219
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:41,100
all of this stuff is,
uh,

3220
02:34:41,170 --> 02:34:44,830
is cured by the fact that these people
get to assets moving and they stopped

3221
02:34:44,831 --> 02:34:46,150
eating all this shitty food.

3222
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:49,000
Yeah.
Shitty food is the number one problem is

3223
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:50,660
the number one problem.
Sugar,

3224
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:54,770
refined carbohydrates,
your body processing massive amounts of

3225
02:34:54,771 --> 02:34:58,100
stuff that it's not supposed to get in.
Everything boils in everything.

3226
02:34:58,101 --> 02:35:01,560
And you know,
all these processed vegetable oils like

3227
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,140
cooking things in

3228
02:35:03,290 --> 02:35:06,410
all that stuff.
And People Think,

3229
02:35:06,411 --> 02:35:07,690
oh,
you know,

3230
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:08,533
even to assert

3231
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:09,570
what do you got here,
Jeremy?

3232
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:14,570
Donald run.
So the FDA actually banned aspartame

3233
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:19,310
based on his findings,
only to have cereal chairman Donald

3234
02:35:19,310 --> 02:35:21,290
Rumsfeld,
currently secretary of defense at the

3235
02:35:21,291 --> 02:35:25,970
time they wrote this article,
vow to call in his markers to get it

3236
02:35:25,971 --> 02:35:30,830
approved on January 21st 1991 the day
after Ronald Reagan's inauguration.

3237
02:35:31,460 --> 02:35:36,230
Cyril,
I guess that's c a r l e reapply to the

3238
02:35:36,231 --> 02:35:40,910
FDA for approval to use aspartame.
And food sweetener and Reagan's new FDA

3239
02:35:40,911 --> 02:35:45,911
Commissioner Arthur Hayes Hall junior
appointed a five person scientific

3240
02:35:46,071 --> 02:35:48,950
commission to review the board of
inquiry.

3241
02:35:48,951 --> 02:35:52,310
Decision became clear.
The panel would uphold the band by a

3242
02:35:52,311 --> 02:35:54,540
three to two to two decision,
but then hold,

3243
02:35:54,541 --> 02:35:58,250
then install the sixth member on the
commission and the vote became

3244
02:35:58,251 --> 02:36:01,760
deadlocked.
He then personally broke the tie and

3245
02:36:01,761 --> 02:36:04,400
aspartame favor what a piece of shit.

3246
02:36:04,530 --> 02:36:06,090
But this is,
this puts,

3247
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:09,090
they found evidence.
This shit makes holes in the brain.

3248
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:13,440
It might induce the.
The evidence grains might induce

3249
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:14,730
migraine tumors.

3250
02:36:15,650 --> 02:36:18,440
Right?
And the thing is now everyone got hipped

3251
02:36:18,441 --> 02:36:22,520
to aspartame.
Now you have to read because that's why

3252
02:36:22,521 --> 02:36:26,720
the process.
Food is so fucking any of that here,

3253
02:36:26,721 --> 02:36:30,410
that fake sweetness shit.
And now they call it amino suite is the

3254
02:36:30,411 --> 02:36:32,890
new name that they changed it to.
So.

3255
02:36:33,220 --> 02:36:33,800
Well you,
you.

3256
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:36,050
Do you ever drink your drinks?
Soda,

3257
02:36:37,340 --> 02:36:39,890
Soda sweetened with Stevia.
Stevia.

3258
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:42,620
It's fucking delicious.
Stevia's from plants.

3259
02:36:42,670 --> 02:36:45,550
It's a sweetener and people don't like
it,

3260
02:36:45,580 --> 02:36:49,180
great taste of Stevia.
It tastes good.

3261
02:36:49,210 --> 02:36:53,660
But I do have too much protein powders
that have a,

3262
02:36:53,661 --> 02:36:56,620
you know,
a Stevia in it and stuff.

3263
02:36:56,950 --> 02:37:01,680
Clean machine has a protein powder
that's a lentin and uh,

3264
02:37:01,710 --> 02:37:03,430
the water lentils,
they call them.

3265
02:37:03,431 --> 02:37:04,510
It's real,
real clean.

3266
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:05,610
Yeah.
Are on it.

3267
02:37:05,611 --> 02:37:07,620
Hemp force protein.
We were using Stevia.

3268
02:37:07,621 --> 02:37:09,430
Stevia for that.
I've called Stevia nuts,

3269
02:37:09,450 --> 02:37:12,240
debbie.
But that title potato,

3270
02:37:12,241 --> 02:37:15,380
which just doesn't taste the same,
tastes good.

3271
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:16,070
It's a matter

3272
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:17,360
of.
But it's so potent.

3273
02:37:17,361 --> 02:37:19,370
The problem is like if people have a cup
of coffee,

3274
02:37:19,371 --> 02:37:21,680
I would have stevie out and people put
it in there and be like,

3275
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:22,630
oh,
I'd be like,

3276
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:24,890
you put too much in.
He can't put it in like sugar.

3277
02:37:24,980 --> 02:37:27,560
That's way more potent.
You just need a tiny dash.

3278
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:30,770
Like even back in the day,
I remember my mom being like,

3279
02:37:30,771 --> 02:37:31,431
oh,
Yay,

3280
02:37:31,431 --> 02:37:35,720
nutrasweet and this and that.
Let's put all these other like,

3281
02:37:36,110 --> 02:37:40,640
cane sugar is better for you than these
fucking fake sweeteners.

3282
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:44,920
Sugar still terrible for you.
Terrible for you.

3283
02:37:44,970 --> 02:37:47,090
You're not close as a sugar daddy in the
body.

3284
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:50,270
You're going to do sugar.
You should do eat fruit.

3285
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:54,050
Come to the fibers in your body,
slowly digesting it,

3286
02:37:54,051 --> 02:37:55,610
which is the way you're supposed to
consume it,

3287
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:58,490
but you'd be able to get like a
gatorade.

3288
02:37:58,491 --> 02:38:00,710
It's got like fucking 80 grams of sugar
and they're like,

3289
02:38:00,711 --> 02:38:02,060
that shit's terrible for you.

3290
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:04,250
All that stuff terrible for you.
Soda,

3291
02:38:04,251 --> 02:38:07,070
and they got all the pros pushing it.
Like these kids,

3292
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:11,180
you go to these a basketball camp,
so football cancel or whatever,

3293
02:38:11,181 --> 02:38:12,950
or high schools and what are they
drinking?

3294
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:15,200
They're all drinking,
drinking the Koolaid.

3295
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:16,400
Well,
you know what,

3296
02:38:16,401 --> 02:38:19,760
if you're exerting yourself like very
strenuously,

3297
02:38:19,761 --> 02:38:21,920
you could use some of that glucose and
that's okay,

3298
02:38:22,310 --> 02:38:26,600
but for the average person that goes to
a fucking 7:11 and gets a big gulp and

3299
02:38:26,601 --> 02:38:27,770
his downing,
you know,

3300
02:38:28,250 --> 02:38:32,540
64 ounces of Coca Cola,
that is a crazy amount of sugar for your

3301
02:38:32,541 --> 02:38:35,180
body to get in one serving.
Your body doesn't know what to do with

3302
02:38:35,181 --> 02:38:37,010
that shit.
So it stores it as fat.

3303
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:42,190
What I forget how many tablespoons of
sugar they said he's in one of them.

3304
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:45,980
Fucking a big gulp.
Do they did a thing where they showed

3305
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:51,160
all the various sizes of soda next to
have the sugar and you see the actual,

3306
02:38:52,460 --> 02:38:55,640
the actual sugar.
It's crazy.

3307
02:38:55,641 --> 02:38:57,710
Yeah.
This is our number one problem and one

3308
02:38:57,711 --> 02:38:59,890
of the things that I did when I cut
sugar out of my died,

3309
02:38:59,891 --> 02:39:04,620
there it is.
There's the image that's a kilo of coke

3310
02:39:04,710 --> 02:39:07,020
son,
sides of that.

3311
02:39:07,230 --> 02:39:10,940
That's so much sugar.
Your body doesn't know what the fuck's

3312
02:39:10,941 --> 02:39:14,750
going on when you take that much sugar
and it's insane and it's freaking thing

3313
02:39:14,751 --> 02:39:17,920
is.
You got kids jacked up on that all day

3314
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,600
long.
Bouncing off the wall.

3315
02:39:19,710 --> 02:39:21,140
Yeah,
and then they put them on Ritalin

3316
02:39:21,141 --> 02:39:24,020
because Johnny's got too much energy.
Johnny's on drugs.

3317
02:39:24,021 --> 02:39:24,980
Yes.
Sugar drug

3318
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:26,570
long.
Yeah.

3319
02:39:26,571 --> 02:39:28,420
I mean,
and then on top of that,

3320
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:33,480
here's one of the problems with people
consuming that kind of stuff and then on

3321
02:39:33,881 --> 02:39:36,920
top of it's saturated fat or your kids
set.

3322
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:39,160
See,
there's studies now that are showing

3323
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:44,050
that cholesterol and saturated fat are
healthy for your diet and healthy for

3324
02:39:44,051 --> 02:39:47,740
your body in less.
You're consuming carbohydrates and

3325
02:39:47,741 --> 02:39:49,900
refined sugars because when you're doing
that,

3326
02:39:49,901 --> 02:39:53,620
then your body's not burning fat,
so your body is just storing fat and on

3327
02:39:53,621 --> 02:39:56,620
top of that you're pouring massive
amounts of sugar in there,

3328
02:39:56,621 --> 02:39:59,440
so you're getting hardening of the
arteries and clogging of the arteries

3329
02:39:59,770 --> 02:40:03,850
and people think that this is.
They're conflating and confusing all

3330
02:40:03,851 --> 02:40:04,690
this and thinking,
well,

3331
02:40:05,050 --> 02:40:06,880
well,
this is because you're eating

3332
02:40:06,910 --> 02:40:08,770
cholesterol and saturated fat.
Nope,

3333
02:40:08,980 --> 02:40:10,660
it's not.
It's because you're eating cholesterol

3334
02:40:10,661 --> 02:40:13,890
and saturated fat along with simple
carbohydrates,

3335
02:40:13,891 --> 02:40:17,490
refined carbohydrates and sugars.
There's a chemical reaction that your

3336
02:40:17,491 --> 02:40:21,180
body has that when you're eating these
two things together becomes toxic.

3337
02:40:21,390 --> 02:40:21,860
It's

3338
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:23,990
dangerous night.
Trust Semites as well.

3339
02:40:23,991 --> 02:40:26,470
When you say that's the average American
diet,

3340
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:29,300
and then combine it with alcohol and the
rest of this stuff,

3341
02:40:29,301 --> 02:40:34,301
it creates a a chemical reaction in the
body that then causes a problems for you

3342
02:40:36,801 --> 02:40:40,100
health wise and your immune system and
gut health and everything else.

3343
02:40:40,310 --> 02:40:41,080
Yeah,
there's A.

3344
02:40:41,080 --> 02:40:46,080
There's a ton of problems with people's
bodies and you could trace it back to a

3345
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:48,690
host of different things.
You could.

3346
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:52,910
You could trace it back to pesticides.
You could trace it back to a lack of

3347
02:40:52,911 --> 02:40:55,550
minerals.
You can trace it back to excess sugar,

3348
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:57,890
you can trace it back to processed
vegetable oils,

3349
02:40:57,891 --> 02:41:00,170
you can trace it back to sedentary
lives.

3350
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:05,200
There's so many different things that
are a factor in people's health issues,

3351
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:09,860
but one of the problems with ideologies,
whether it's this carnivore diet

3352
02:41:09,861 --> 02:41:14,000
ideology or Vegan Diet audiology,
is people want to look at one thing.

3353
02:41:14,001 --> 02:41:16,700
There's one thing that's wrong and you
fix this thing,

3354
02:41:16,701 --> 02:41:19,010
and if you just do this one thing,
you're going to be healthy.

3355
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:22,610
That's not necessarily the case,
and there's a lot of people out there on

3356
02:41:22,611 --> 02:41:26,750
both sides that are spreading
misinformation because it supports their

3357
02:41:26,751 --> 02:41:29,230
view.
It supports their bias positioning

3358
02:41:29,390 --> 02:41:34,250
studies that were funded by the same
companies that are making money off of

3359
02:41:34,251 --> 02:41:39,251
selling foods that are high in saturated
fats or cholesterol or trans fats,

3360
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:42,260
trans fats in it.
There's companies.

3361
02:41:42,410 --> 02:41:46,040
So you always have to look between the
fucking lines.

3362
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:50,570
That's where the truth lies because the
milk industries.

3363
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:52,490
What was the other,
uh,

3364
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:55,450
the other documentary that came out,
um,

3365
02:41:56,690 --> 02:42:00,140
fuck it was about.
It started with the cigarettes and the

3366
02:42:00,141 --> 02:42:02,030
uh,
and the chemicals that they were using

3367
02:42:02,031 --> 02:42:04,940
in furniture day.
There was this documentary to,

3368
02:42:04,970 --> 02:42:08,780
and I always blank on it.
I'm fucking old man brain and I have.

3369
02:42:08,810 --> 02:42:13,400
It was a documentary about how they paid
these people to put out false

3370
02:42:13,430 --> 02:42:14,080
information.

3371
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:15,640
I know you're talking about merchants of
death,

3372
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:18,970
merchants of doubt,
amazing fucking shame.

3373
02:42:18,971 --> 02:42:22,780
People that are doubting climate change.
We're also touting cigarettes being

3374
02:42:22,781 --> 02:42:24,210
addicted the same

3375
02:42:24,660 --> 02:42:29,660
and they're using the same tactics that
they've been using and to push the

3376
02:42:30,531 --> 02:42:35,360
chemicals and put.
They had motherfuckers spraying DDT on

3377
02:42:35,361 --> 02:42:38,630
their fucking clothes hanging in their
closet to stop moths.

3378
02:42:38,870 --> 02:42:41,540
Can you fucking believe that shit,
dude,

3379
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:46,010
it's in that.
It's in the way they had them spraying

3380
02:42:46,011 --> 02:42:51,011
fucking Dick Cancer causing chemicals on
this shit.

3381
02:42:52,060 --> 02:42:54,490
When you see those guys have the same
guys that were trying to say that

3382
02:42:54,491 --> 02:42:57,700
cigarettes are not,
they're not addictive and the same

3383
02:42:57,701 --> 02:43:00,640
people that are there,
there were dismissing climate change.

3384
02:43:00,641 --> 02:43:02,020
You're like,
what?

3385
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:03,400
Like,
how can you be so obvious?

3386
02:43:03,401 --> 02:43:04,600
You don't even use new people.

3387
02:43:04,690 --> 02:43:05,210
They,
they,

3388
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:08,600
they did the thing with the guy from
Monsanto and roundup,

3389
02:43:08,601 --> 02:43:11,010
because I would drink fucking roundup
and he.

3390
02:43:11,310 --> 02:43:13,270
Okay,
I'm going to go get you a fucking glass.

3391
02:43:13,330 --> 02:43:16,450
Here's a glass of fucking drink,
like drink it.

3392
02:43:16,470 --> 02:43:17,410
He's like,
nope.

3393
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:18,670
Who does this?
Jamie?

3394
02:43:19,350 --> 02:43:21,200
Is that DDT wallpaper?
Yeah.

3395
02:43:21,470 --> 02:43:23,620
Oh my God.
Look at that.

3396
02:43:23,830 --> 02:43:27,670
Containing Ddt as the active
insecticide,

3397
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:32,700
genuine cedar wood made into wallpaper.
So these people made DDT closet

3398
02:43:33,761 --> 02:43:37,720
wallpaper with fucking,
with genuine cedar wood.

3399
02:43:38,360 --> 02:43:39,500
Well,
the other thing is,

3400
02:43:39,501 --> 02:43:41,780
even the chemicals that they put in the
furniture,

3401
02:43:41,781 --> 02:43:45,050
there's a big thing now to remove
because it's calming the fucking

3402
02:43:45,051 --> 02:43:48,950
children.
Do you know that rugs and furniture

3403
02:43:48,951 --> 02:43:52,760
actually will release chemicals into the
air in your house.

3404
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:54,080
Oh,
you have this protective.

3405
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:56,010
Sure.
Children's against disease carrying

3406
02:43:56,011 --> 02:43:57,660
insects,
DDT,

3407
02:43:57,661 --> 02:43:59,490
children's room,
wallpaper.

3408
02:43:59,700 --> 02:44:04,700
How many kids got cancer from that shit?
Crazy fucking bed is so insane.

3409
02:44:05,130 --> 02:44:07,260
Kills insects.
Mosquitoes,

3410
02:44:07,261 --> 02:44:08,820
flies.
Ants.

3411
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:09,953
And you,

3412
02:44:10,230 --> 02:44:11,640
you know,
one of the biggest,

3413
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:15,420
one of the.
One of the biggest ways that toxins

3414
02:44:15,421 --> 02:44:19,620
enter the body is not by walking around
the streets of La or New York and

3415
02:44:19,621 --> 02:44:22,200
breathing into pollution.
It's the fucking home,

3416
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:25,920
the amount of chemicals that are in the
fucking home,

3417
02:44:25,921 --> 02:44:29,730
and they talk about that in merchants of
doubt to chemicals in the furniture,

3418
02:44:29,731 --> 02:44:33,000
the chemicals in the closed,
the chemicals in the fucking diapers to

3419
02:44:33,001 --> 02:44:36,240
chemicals in everything in the plastic.
It's chemicals,

3420
02:44:36,241 --> 02:44:37,230
chemicals,
chemicals,

3421
02:44:37,231 --> 02:44:40,290
chemicals.
You're bombarding your fucking child

3422
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:44,880
with fucking dozens and dozens of
chemicals every fucking day.

3423
02:44:45,330 --> 02:44:49,410
And while it's immune throughout that
child's immune system is developing and

3424
02:44:49,411 --> 02:44:51,690
then you're feeding it pesticides,
you're feeding it.

3425
02:44:52,020 --> 02:44:54,120
This fucking animal that's been
tortured.

3426
02:44:54,121 --> 02:44:56,940
It's whole life and Fed fucking steroids
and hormones.

3427
02:44:56,970 --> 02:45:01,320
And you're wondering why these kids are
coming out and they're so fucked because

3428
02:45:01,321 --> 02:45:03,810
it's when they're getting into their
teens,

3429
02:45:03,811 --> 02:45:06,660
it's because all of that shit's taken a
toll.

3430
02:45:06,780 --> 02:45:09,020
Not just physically,
but you know,

3431
02:45:09,570 --> 02:45:11,660
psychologically it's fucking,
it's,

3432
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:12,773
you know,
then,

3433
02:45:12,940 --> 02:45:15,460
you know,
there's so much other shit they're doing

3434
02:45:15,510 --> 02:45:16,140
to,
to the,

3435
02:45:16,140 --> 02:45:17,580
to the food put in,
put in.

3436
02:45:17,581 --> 02:45:20,170
Um,
there's an episode,

3437
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:22,320
you know,
that they put in the corn and the soy

3438
02:45:22,321 --> 02:45:24,130
now and it's fucking,
uh,

3439
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:27,330
it was done by this company in La and
they will,

3440
02:45:27,370 --> 02:45:29,400
oh,
I was down in California somewhere,

3441
02:45:29,401 --> 02:45:31,950
episode e p I c Dot y,
t,

3442
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:35,680
and it fucks with the sexual
reproduction organs of,

3443
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:39,090
of fetuses and children and all kinds of
shit they do.

3444
02:45:39,150 --> 02:45:43,650
They're conducting like fucking mad
science on human beings right now.

3445
02:45:43,651 --> 02:45:47,230
What the fuck is going on?
Just for profit even in Hawaiian,

3446
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:49,530
I got to tell you,
I have friends that are out there and

3447
02:45:49,531 --> 02:45:51,470
they did organic farming,
organic farming.

3448
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:54,690
Do you know that?
All the world seed banks right now for

3449
02:45:54,691 --> 02:45:59,691
GMO or fucking grown in Hawaii
because of it's a closed ecosystem

3450
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:05,370
that's closed off from everywhere else.
So there's no other factors.

3451
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:09,030
So they go and they spray motherfucking
chem trails,

3452
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,033
the air

3453
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:12,980
that calmed down onto the fucking ground
and they can,

3454
02:46:13,490 --> 02:46:15,140
for instance,
and I wait a minute,

3455
02:46:15,290 --> 02:46:19,130
what do they do?
They're spraying aerosol spraying the

3456
02:46:19,131 --> 02:46:20,840
crops.
So the aerosol,

3457
02:46:20,841 --> 02:46:25,841
so some sort of.
So what they do and they do aluminum.

3458
02:46:26,031 --> 02:46:27,200
Barium,
strontium.

3459
02:46:27,201 --> 02:46:28,520
Now I'm going to tell you,
I have,

3460
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:30,650
I have friends that actually are doing
this.

3461
02:46:31,400 --> 02:46:34,970
They were aghast farmers and I had to
give up their farm and what they do is

3462
02:46:34,971 --> 02:46:37,220
they make the,
to the uh,

3463
02:46:37,430 --> 02:46:42,430
the making the soil so acidic the Ph,
then nothing will grow except for

3464
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:48,680
genetically modified seeds that have
been genetically modified to resist

3465
02:46:48,681 --> 02:46:50,660
aluminum and resist all this other
stuff.

3466
02:46:50,661 --> 02:46:52,940
So now the spraying aluminum,
like where's that coming from?

3467
02:46:52,970 --> 02:46:54,170
It's,
it makes it,

3468
02:46:54,171 --> 02:46:58,820
makes the soil various civic it,
it changes the Ph.

3469
02:46:58,821 --> 02:47:03,821
I think aluminum has the greatest,
a change to the soil and what's the

3470
02:47:03,981 --> 02:47:08,330
benefit of them doing that because then
they can control the food supply because

3471
02:47:08,331 --> 02:47:11,900
if you don't buy the GMO seeds,
the organic farmers are going out of

3472
02:47:11,901 --> 02:47:13,040
business in Hawaii.

3473
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:14,510
And this ain't no,
wait a minute.

3474
02:47:14,511 --> 02:47:18,320
So you're saying that they're spreading
things out of the sky that poisoned the

3475
02:47:18,321 --> 02:47:23,321
ground so that only organic farmers are
so that only gmo farmers can grow crops

3476
02:47:25,011 --> 02:47:25,844
there.
Right?

3477
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:28,440
That's proven.
That's what's going on.

3478
02:47:28,441 --> 02:47:31,520
And it sounds crazy though,
but here's the thing,

3479
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:35,030
and I'm not saying they're going like
some of these other camp trail people,

3480
02:47:35,031 --> 02:47:37,280
$35,000,
they're spraying all the cities I'm

3481
02:47:37,281 --> 02:47:40,070
spraying.
I'm saying that coming in and spraying

3482
02:47:40,130 --> 02:47:45,110
chemicals on the ground,
but they're not doing it as a pesticide.

3483
02:47:45,111 --> 02:47:48,320
You're saying they're doing it as a
grand conspiracy to make the ground

3484
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:51,500
infertile for anything.
Do you ever read Monsanto's.

3485
02:47:51,530 --> 02:47:53,720
Did you ever see the world according to
Monsanto?

3486
02:47:54,050 --> 02:47:55,310
Okay.
So what do they say?

3487
02:47:55,311 --> 02:48:00,311
We want to control the world's food
supply from seed to motherfucking to

3488
02:48:01,190 --> 02:48:03,610
farm to table,
all the way through.

3489
02:48:03,690 --> 02:48:04,730
We want to control.

3490
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:09,350
So how did they do that?
How do they actually make that happen?

3491
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:15,050
And I see it happening to farmers in
Hawaii and friends of mine are ag.

3492
02:48:15,051 --> 02:48:17,890
I just did ironman.
What do you see happening?

3493
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:19,680
Because what they're doing,
the,

3494
02:48:19,690 --> 02:48:20,170
the,
the,

3495
02:48:20,170 --> 02:48:23,600
the,
the organic Papaya farmers have had to

3496
02:48:23,601 --> 02:48:28,601
all go either give up their farm or go
switch to a GMO Papaya because none of

3497
02:48:30,471 --> 02:48:33,710
their shit is growing.
It's just that because the depletion of

3498
02:48:33,711 --> 02:48:35,560
the soil,
not it's,

3499
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:40,780
but they say that the fucking day
spraying the chemicals on the soil,

3500
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:44,560
but do you know how much they'd have to
spray on the soil to make it infertile?

3501
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:48,710
It's much more likely candidate to the
same issues that we're having in this

3502
02:48:48,711 --> 02:48:52,310
country with mono crops that they're
just depleting their soil because

3503
02:48:52,311 --> 02:48:53,710
they're constantly growing on it.
No,

3504
02:48:53,720 --> 02:48:57,710
because these guys are doing organic
study chem trails that study chem trails

3505
02:48:57,711 --> 02:49:00,800
for quite a while because I was doing a
television show on them and one of the

3506
02:49:00,801 --> 02:49:03,860
things that I found with this,
this is a lot of Malarkey.

3507
02:49:04,310 --> 02:49:07,040
Absolutely shit,
and one of the things that they find is

3508
02:49:07,290 --> 02:49:07,921
they're like,
oh,

3509
02:49:07,921 --> 02:49:08,070
they're

3510
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:12,120
spraying aluminum and then when they do
samples of the water,

3511
02:49:12,270 --> 02:49:16,230
they find aluminum in the water.
Now they're doing samples of sludge.

3512
02:49:16,420 --> 02:49:20,760
This do samples of water with dirt.
Do you know with one of the most common

3513
02:49:20,761 --> 02:49:23,520
metals that you'll ever find on earth is
aluminum.

3514
02:49:23,521 --> 02:49:25,740
Aluminum.
Most dirt has aluminum in it,

3515
02:49:25,741 --> 02:49:28,800
so when they're testing this water,
they're testing positive for aluminum.

3516
02:49:29,070 --> 02:49:32,790
What they're doing is it tested dirt,
dirt tested positive for being dirt.

3517
02:49:32,940 --> 02:49:34,950
That's what it is.
So when they find a aluminum,

3518
02:49:34,951 --> 02:49:35,611
they say,
oh my God,

3519
02:49:35,611 --> 02:49:38,520
they're spraying aluminum.
There's no benefit to spraying aluminum

3520
02:49:38,521 --> 02:49:41,190
on anything.
It's never been proven that there's some

3521
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:44,700
evil government cabal that wants to
spray aluminum on everything and that's

3522
02:49:44,701 --> 02:49:47,160
the reason why papayas don't grow.
Right.

3523
02:49:47,340 --> 02:49:50,880
It's way more likely that these papayas
are growing in a place where they've

3524
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:54,240
been grown papayas for a long time and
they've depleted the soil,

3525
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:57,540
especially dealing with soil that's
really coming out of a volcano in the

3526
02:49:57,541 --> 02:49:58,100
first place.

3527
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:01,280
Well,
I mean I understand that aspect of it,

3528
02:50:01,281 --> 02:50:04,820
but it's the combination of other
chemicals that they're using.

3529
02:50:04,821 --> 02:50:09,110
And here's the thing.
Before these seed banks showed up over

3530
02:50:09,111 --> 02:50:10,900
there,
they never had this problem.

3531
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:14,650
There's also before large scale
agriculture made its way to Hawaii as

3532
02:50:14,651 --> 02:50:15,191
well,
right?

3533
02:50:15,191 --> 02:50:18,580
So they probably had years and years and
years of doing this and getting away

3534
02:50:18,581 --> 02:50:21,010
with it to the soil started getting
depleted.

3535
02:50:21,370 --> 02:50:23,830
Just like we have evidence of it getting
depleted all over the world.

3536
02:50:24,070 --> 02:50:25,600
India,
they have issues with this,

3537
02:50:25,601 --> 02:50:27,880
with mono crops,
with anywhere in the world where they

3538
02:50:27,881 --> 02:50:31,930
grow crops in the same area,
in these massive scales,

3539
02:50:32,170 --> 02:50:34,870
you're going to deplete the ground of
minerals and nutrients.

3540
02:50:34,871 --> 02:50:39,070
I mean it's just a part of the problem
and when they offer up that solution

3541
02:50:39,071 --> 02:50:39,401
like,
hey,

3542
02:50:39,401 --> 02:50:42,850
our genetically modified crops are
better in are genetically,

3543
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:45,210
you know,
people modified crops are,

3544
02:50:45,211 --> 02:50:47,920
you know,
they can survive in these harsh climates

3545
02:50:47,921 --> 02:50:52,921
and you can also add all of our nitrogen
and our fertilizers are nasty shit to

3546
02:50:53,271 --> 02:50:54,104
the.

3547
02:50:54,150 --> 02:50:59,150
Everything else around it will die when
we spray except for our crops because

3548
02:50:59,281 --> 02:51:02,040
we've been genetically engineered to
resist.

3549
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:05,370
We been genetically engineered to
resist.

3550
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:09,010
Yeah,
that's scary.

3551
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:11,920
That glyphosate shit is any,
anything that kills everything.

3552
02:51:11,921 --> 02:51:13,840
But what you,
what you want it to is like what?

3553
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:15,760
Like what's it doing to what you wanted
to.

3554
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:19,870
What happens to that food?
What is that stuff out of that food by

3555
02:51:19,871 --> 02:51:20,704
the time you eat it?

3556
02:51:20,940 --> 02:51:23,050
Um,
I don't think so.

3557
02:51:23,170 --> 02:51:24,410
I don't think so either.
I mean,

3558
02:51:24,730 --> 02:51:28,450
when
it comes out in the leaves and the bugs

3559
02:51:28,451 --> 02:51:30,270
eat this shit and it blows their
stomach,

3560
02:51:30,320 --> 02:51:30,500
there's a

3561
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:32,390
great documentary on it called what's
with wheat,

3562
02:51:32,450 --> 02:51:36,830
where they try to break down why wheat
all the sudden became a huge problem in

3563
02:51:36,831 --> 02:51:39,560
the American diet,
whereas in the early 19 hundreds it was

3564
02:51:39,561 --> 02:51:42,420
nothing and it was a slow genetic
modification where they.

3565
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:47,860
They started changing the weed itself
and breeding it to make higher yields,

3566
02:51:48,050 --> 02:51:50,900
so it's got more complex gluten's in it,
but then on top of that,

3567
02:51:50,901 --> 02:51:55,130
it's the glyphosate.
The glyphosate breaks down your gut

3568
02:51:55,131 --> 02:52:00,131
barrier and people get leaky gut and the
rest of the yeah buts it kills the

3569
02:52:01,011 --> 02:52:01,821
bacteria.
I mean,

3570
02:52:01,821 --> 02:52:03,860
this is what they're trying to do that
trying to kill bacteria,

3571
02:52:04,040 --> 02:52:06,100
but they don't realize your made out

3572
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:08,770
of bacteria.
Your body's an ecosystem of bacteria,

3573
02:52:08,790 --> 02:52:09,670
right?
Yeah.

3574
02:52:09,700 --> 02:52:14,700
That's just the problem with the whole
government is evil thing is they're just

3575
02:52:14,921 --> 02:52:18,280
greedy or evil because they're greeting,
right?

3576
02:52:18,281 --> 02:52:19,114
Yeah.

3577
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:21,930
Thing and,
and you saw the world according to

3578
02:52:21,931 --> 02:52:24,870
Monsanto and it's this revolving door
policy.

3579
02:52:24,871 --> 02:52:29,460
How they come at a massage,
Monsanto or even what he was doing,

3580
02:52:29,461 --> 02:52:31,740
Rumsfeld,
when he was the CEO of Searle.

3581
02:52:31,741 --> 02:52:33,480
And then so they get into the
government,

3582
02:52:33,481 --> 02:52:37,800
they pass legislation and they go back
to the corporations to reap the benefits

3583
02:52:37,801 --> 02:52:41,250
of the laws that they passed.
You have a lot of that going on.

3584
02:52:41,730 --> 02:52:43,740
So I think,
uh,

3585
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:48,000
you know,
whether or not she could really be what

3586
02:52:48,001 --> 02:52:51,870
the fuck motherfuckers is saying it is
in Hawaii or anywhere else and the truth

3587
02:52:51,871 --> 02:52:55,110
is going to possibly come out eventually
or maybe not,

3588
02:52:55,440 --> 02:53:00,440
but me personally,
I tend to try to stick to locally farmed

3589
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:06,150
organic like I go to the farm is mark,
how do you get it in New York?

3590
02:53:06,290 --> 02:53:09,280
This farmer's market from upstate and
yeah,

3591
02:53:09,281 --> 02:53:10,320
they could.
They come up,

3592
02:53:10,770 --> 02:53:12,060
they come into the city.

3593
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:13,430
Um,
I mean I'm,

3594
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:18,550
I'm not going to bullshit.
I go to a health food store and eat shit

3595
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:23,720
that's out of season because I like my
fucking Broccoli and Kale or whatever

3596
02:53:24,181 --> 02:53:27,600
the fuck and some fruit or whatever.
But um,

3597
02:53:28,020 --> 02:53:29,670
you know,
how do they grow that stuff,

3598
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:33,300
shipped it shipped in from Cali.
And in Florida,

3599
02:53:33,301 --> 02:53:33,871
I mean,
you know,

3600
02:53:33,871 --> 02:53:35,220
it's not the best,
but hey,

3601
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:39,710
when you take into equation the fact
that I've eliminated this,

3602
02:53:39,810 --> 02:53:42,990
this,
the other foods that used the highest

3603
02:53:42,991 --> 02:53:45,940
amount of fossil fuels to grow the crops
and,

3604
02:53:45,941 --> 02:53:49,440
and everything else that's involved with
producing the,

3605
02:53:49,490 --> 02:53:51,630
a huge,
you know,

3606
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:53,280
these farms that are,
that are,

3607
02:53:53,460 --> 02:53:56,640
uh,
these animal agriculture system than the

3608
02:53:56,641 --> 02:53:58,680
amount of fossil fuels.
I mean,

3609
02:53:58,681 --> 02:54:02,030
I had motherfuckers writing me,
you take a fucking plane and go on tour.

3610
02:54:02,040 --> 02:54:04,650
Fuck you.
Like the thing we were talking about

3611
02:54:04,660 --> 02:54:07,380
earlier,
fault every fucking thing,

3612
02:54:07,770 --> 02:54:08,461
you know.
But,

3613
02:54:08,461 --> 02:54:10,480
but a true though,
we all do.

3614
02:54:10,620 --> 02:54:12,250
Do you sda both

3615
02:54:12,700 --> 02:54:14,860
poisoned sky a little bit when we fly.

3616
02:54:15,340 --> 02:54:16,330
So,
hey,

3617
02:54:16,331 --> 02:54:18,400
you know,
I'll take,

3618
02:54:18,450 --> 02:54:19,570
I'll take the hit man.

3619
02:54:20,040 --> 02:54:23,580
We live in a real problem.
I mean that's one of the things they

3620
02:54:23,581 --> 02:54:27,510
found after September 11th with the lack
of plane flights changed the Earth's

3621
02:54:27,511 --> 02:54:28,650
temperature.
I mean,

3622
02:54:28,651 --> 02:54:30,120
it's fucking nuts,
man.

3623
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:32,990
Wow,
that's crazy.

3624
02:54:33,010 --> 02:54:35,580
Yeah.
The also the cloud cover that's created

3625
02:54:35,581 --> 02:54:38,940
by contracts like that cools the earth
down a little bit.

3626
02:54:39,240 --> 02:54:41,640
It's very interesting.
They've admitted to it.

3627
02:54:41,690 --> 02:54:46,690
The government has actually admitted to
a program to try to sprain shit,

3628
02:54:46,731 --> 02:54:47,564
to try to

3629
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:52,600
cool the earth's well.
They've admitted to experimented with

3630
02:54:52,601 --> 02:54:56,890
weather manipulation and to,
to having strategies for dealing with

3631
02:54:56,891 --> 02:54:59,740
it,
whether it is for dealing with hostile

3632
02:54:59,741 --> 02:55:03,980
foreign governments where trying to
starve them out or trying to put

3633
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:06,230
rain.
I mean they've been around forever.

3634
02:55:06,670 --> 02:55:09,020
We have a space.
Would you see the fucking video?

3635
02:55:09,021 --> 02:55:12,080
Hey guys made on space for now.
What is it?

3636
02:55:12,170 --> 02:55:14,360
Is it funny?
It's fucking hilarious.

3637
02:55:14,361 --> 02:55:15,021
They,
they,

3638
02:55:15,021 --> 02:55:16,740
uh,
it's on youtube.

3639
02:55:17,030 --> 02:55:19,600
The spool on,
on trump's space.

3640
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:22,940
It's fucking.
But here's the thing.

3641
02:55:22,970 --> 02:55:27,580
It's like China repair is trying to
patch a shotgun wound with a bandaid.

3642
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:32,360
Like let's reduce the fossil fuel.
If you want to fucking cool the earth

3643
02:55:32,361 --> 02:55:36,050
and everything and save the fucking
oceans and all the rest of this shit.

3644
02:55:36,051 --> 02:55:40,730
It's why don't we check how the fuck we
live our lives.

3645
02:55:40,731 --> 02:55:43,340
But everybody wants to pass the buck and
say,

3646
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:45,980
oh,
well why should I do it?

3647
02:55:45,981 --> 02:55:47,690
You know,
let the next motherfucker do it.

3648
02:55:47,691 --> 02:55:51,620
But you know,
you buy what you put in your car and how

3649
02:55:51,621 --> 02:55:54,950
you live your life and you have fucking
how many people in America?

3650
02:55:54,951 --> 02:55:56,060
$200.
How many?

3651
02:55:56,090 --> 02:55:57,170
Three hundred million.
$300.

3652
02:55:57,171 --> 02:55:59,690
Fucking million motherfuckers passing
the buck along.

3653
02:55:59,691 --> 02:56:04,490
You're not getting anywhere.
And China's how many billion in India?

3654
02:56:04,491 --> 02:56:08,420
And it's like they're not fucking,
they're not going to stop fucking doing

3655
02:56:08,421 --> 02:56:09,250
what they're doing.

3656
02:56:09,250 --> 02:56:10,390
No,
no they're not.

3657
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:14,440
And it's again,
it's like what we were talking about

3658
02:56:14,441 --> 02:56:17,200
with all the other aspects of gigantic
culture.

3659
02:56:17,201 --> 02:56:19,570
There's so many moving pieces.
It's so,

3660
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:22,780
it's so difficult because we're,
we're talking about these pieces that

3661
02:56:22,781 --> 02:56:27,230
have been in place for decades and so to
try to make corrections now and you

3662
02:56:27,231 --> 02:56:28,360
know,
and some people are,

3663
02:56:28,361 --> 02:56:32,920
they are going to organic farms.
They are going to raising their own food

3664
02:56:32,921 --> 02:56:34,020
and having it,
you know,

3665
02:56:34,090 --> 02:56:36,730
having everything be local.
And that's definitely better.

3666
02:56:36,970 --> 02:56:40,150
But the real problem it seems to me is
overpopulation.

3667
02:56:40,210 --> 02:56:43,180
And the real problem is when you jam,
you know,

3668
02:56:43,181 --> 02:56:47,530
Los Angeles is a perfect example.
There's 200 million people just here in

3669
02:56:47,690 --> 02:56:49,780
it just to get a million,
excuse me,

3670
02:56:49,781 --> 02:56:51,260
20 million,
20 million people.

3671
02:56:52,770 --> 02:56:55,720
That's ridiculous.
20 million people just here and then

3672
02:56:55,721 --> 02:56:57,280
there's Orange County which has more
people.

3673
02:56:57,281 --> 02:57:01,780
San Diego has more people as you get
north of people in San Francisco because

3674
02:57:01,781 --> 02:57:04,350
we got like morning.
He people fucking millionaire.

3675
02:57:04,351 --> 02:57:07,450
There's more people.
There's more people in California just

3676
02:57:07,451 --> 02:57:08,620
in Santa,
just in La.

3677
02:57:08,621 --> 02:57:11,530
The more people in Los Angeles than
there is in all of Australia.

3678
02:57:12,790 --> 02:57:17,500
Just all just insane.
So there's so many people and no one's

3679
02:57:17,501 --> 02:57:21,160
grown anything other than we just weeds
being grown here and that's it.

3680
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:24,970
So all the food is being shipped in from
everywhere else and so you've got fossil

3681
02:57:24,971 --> 02:57:26,810
fuels being used and then

3682
02:57:28,270 --> 02:57:31,150
you pay more in Hawaii for a fucking
pineapple.

3683
02:57:31,151 --> 02:57:33,190
Then you do on the mainland.
That crazy dude.

3684
02:57:33,191 --> 02:57:35,230
It's fucking insane.
You haven't been there.

3685
02:57:35,231 --> 02:57:36,560
How expensive for cat food?

3686
02:57:36,850 --> 02:57:38,950
Everything's very expensive.
Fucking insane.

3687
02:57:39,340 --> 02:57:41,530
It's a beautiful,
beautiful place though and that's why

3688
02:57:41,531 --> 02:57:43,430
people are willing to take that hit.
We.

3689
02:57:43,610 --> 02:57:48,610
We live in a place that humans like
yourself and myself and people that are

3690
02:57:49,721 --> 02:57:53,020
alive today,
we are stuck in a system that was

3691
02:57:53,021 --> 02:57:54,670
created many,
many decades ago.

3692
02:57:54,700 --> 02:57:58,540
It was put into place many decades ago
and it wasn't put into place with our

3693
02:57:58,541 --> 02:58:00,970
interests in mind.
It was put into place with the interest

3694
02:58:01,050 --> 02:58:04,140
mind a profit,
and it was also to deal with the,

3695
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:07,620
to accommodate millions and millions of
people that are all jammed into one

3696
02:58:07,621 --> 02:58:11,190
place where no one's growing any food.
It's a very unnatural way to live.

3697
02:58:11,190 --> 02:58:13,410
You know,
they started coming down on all the

3698
02:58:13,411 --> 02:58:18,411
people fucking growing a shade on their
front lawns and yards now because urban

3699
02:58:19,081 --> 02:58:21,140
organic farm into,
you know,

3700
02:58:21,141 --> 02:58:23,100
I'm,
I'm in touch with a lot of those people.

3701
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:24,610
As a matter of fact,
there's one in,

3702
02:58:24,630 --> 02:58:29,010
in New York City I ride from New York
city out to like Long Island Jones beach

3703
02:58:29,011 --> 02:58:32,320
and all that.
And I pass in far rockaway.

3704
02:58:32,321 --> 02:58:36,840
It is a guy that he's doing like a big
urban farm.

3705
02:58:36,841 --> 02:58:39,900
The in this thing and you know,
in this crop of land,

3706
02:58:40,590 --> 02:58:41,790
and uh,
you know,

3707
02:58:42,140 --> 02:58:47,140
it's the urban farming is becoming a big
thing because if I it the food desert

3708
02:58:47,970 --> 02:58:50,580
is,
and there was one guy on abc and he

3709
02:58:50,581 --> 02:58:54,300
walked home from work every night and it
was five miles African American guy and

3710
02:58:54,301 --> 02:58:55,920
he's trying to lose weight and get
healthy.

3711
02:58:56,100 --> 02:58:56,933
Well,
guess what?

3712
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,970
Every motherfucking night all he passed
was KFC.

3713
02:59:00,120 --> 02:59:00,661
This,
that,

3714
02:59:00,661 --> 02:59:01,740
the other thing,
7:11.

3715
02:59:01,830 --> 02:59:06,830
He could not buy a fucking piece of
fruit or a fucking apple in any of those

3716
02:59:06,931 --> 02:59:08,250
fucking places.
None.

3717
02:59:08,610 --> 02:59:10,080
So then they said,
well,

3718
02:59:10,081 --> 02:59:12,830
how the fuck are we going to get food if
we ain't got no car,

3719
02:59:12,850 --> 02:59:17,010
we can go seven,
10 miles out of town to the supermarket.

3720
02:59:17,190 --> 02:59:20,250
So now urban,
organic farming is becoming a big thing

3721
02:59:20,251 --> 02:59:23,240
where they're showing these pen,
now they're starting to crack down.

3722
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:27,890
The cities are trying to crack down on
these people that are growing fucking

3723
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:29,180
food.
That's ridiculous.

3724
02:59:29,600 --> 02:59:32,000
Crazy.
I had Ron Finley on this podcast and

3725
02:59:32,001 --> 02:59:34,670
he's got a similar program in south
central and uh,

3726
02:59:34,730 --> 02:59:39,440
he helps these kids and people that live
there use vacant lots.

3727
02:59:39,470 --> 02:59:43,120
Use Medians in Detroit too.
Yeah,

3728
02:59:43,121 --> 02:59:44,390
it's fantastic.
Yeah.

3729
02:59:44,450 --> 02:59:46,490
Grow food.
You got all fucking fruit.

3730
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:48,080
Food would be free.
Grow it,

3731
02:59:48,081 --> 02:59:49,280
grow it.
And Patches of land.

3732
02:59:49,281 --> 02:59:52,190
I mean,
what would be ideal is if every

3733
02:59:52,191 --> 02:59:54,920
community,
instead of just having a house jam next

3734
02:59:54,921 --> 02:59:56,150
to a house,
gym next to a house,

3735
02:59:56,300 --> 03:00:00,110
every community have one community lot
and that community lot.

3736
03:00:00,111 --> 03:00:01,220
We all grow our food in,

3737
03:00:01,290 --> 03:00:02,460
you know,
not hard to do.

3738
03:00:02,490 --> 03:00:06,900
I mean even in a fucking closet did,
showing how to do like they just had

3739
03:00:06,901 --> 03:00:10,350
this,
they had a shipping container in New

3740
03:00:10,350 --> 03:00:15,350
York and it was a demonstration and they
put it on a Lafayette and Lafayette

3741
03:00:15,510 --> 03:00:19,170
Street and Houseton and it was a
shipping container and they did all.

3742
03:00:19,171 --> 03:00:23,610
And when you walked in there,
it was a fucking farm and I forget how

3743
03:00:23,611 --> 03:00:27,480
many thousand pounds of organic produce
that,

3744
03:00:27,481 --> 03:00:31,920
that fucking farm inside that shipping
container was able to grow.

3745
03:00:32,280 --> 03:00:33,690
But it's insane.

3746
03:00:34,160 --> 03:00:35,820
No,
that's the artificial light.

3747
03:00:35,821 --> 03:00:40,740
But you could do that with real life,
the real streets that you see everywhere

3748
03:00:40,741 --> 03:00:42,520
you go,
what,

3749
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:46,440
where concrete is,
it could be dirt and then it is possible

3750
03:00:46,441 --> 03:00:51,240
that we could cordon off a small section
of every community and have a community

3751
03:00:51,241 --> 03:00:54,960
garden and it would also be a good.
It would be good for the community in

3752
03:00:54,961 --> 03:00:58,920
terms of people interacting with each
other and feeling like they're a part of

3753
03:00:58,930 --> 03:01:02,710
something and taking responsibility for
taking care of.

3754
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:04,850
Get your hands in the dirt too,
man.

3755
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:06,460
You know,
it's,

3756
03:01:06,510 --> 03:01:07,830
it's very,
like,

3757
03:01:07,831 --> 03:01:10,680
that's one of the programs that we did
in this documentary.

3758
03:01:10,681 --> 03:01:14,970
We added a guy's going to fall organic
farms and getting their hands in the

3759
03:01:14,971 --> 03:01:16,410
dirt and seeing,
you know,

3760
03:01:16,620 --> 03:01:19,080
people just as a disconnect between
like,

3761
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:21,300
you know,
farmers man,

3762
03:01:21,390 --> 03:01:22,290
I gotTa,
you know,

3763
03:01:22,291 --> 03:01:25,350
it's like that's a fucking hard ass
fucking job.

3764
03:01:25,380 --> 03:01:27,780
Fucking hard ass job.
Fucking hard man.

3765
03:01:27,930 --> 03:01:32,070
We don't show the appreciation.
And I think who was the,

3766
03:01:32,071 --> 03:01:34,530
um,
the one black activists who used to run

3767
03:01:34,531 --> 03:01:39,000
the marathons and shit.
He forget his name in the sixties and

3768
03:01:39,160 --> 03:01:41,070
Gregory Dick fucking Gregory,
man.

3769
03:01:41,071 --> 03:01:43,320
He always talked about,
you know,

3770
03:01:43,321 --> 03:01:45,690
growing your own fucking food and,
and

3771
03:01:46,350 --> 03:01:50,480
no Dick Gregory's the guy who brought
the Zapruder film to television is

3772
03:01:50,490 --> 03:01:52,440
approved or film of Kennedy being
assassinated.

3773
03:01:52,600 --> 03:01:54,340
It looks like he's being shot from the
front.

3774
03:01:54,370 --> 03:01:55,660
What?
Yes.

3775
03:01:55,720 --> 03:01:59,220
Dick Gregory brought that to the Geraldo
Rivera show.

3776
03:01:59,320 --> 03:02:01,990
Wow.
Years after the assassination.

3777
03:02:01,991 --> 03:02:03,670
It might've been more.
More than eight.

3778
03:02:03,970 --> 03:02:06,190
Might have been more.
Know a lot of shit.

3779
03:02:06,250 --> 03:02:07,083
Yeah.
The,

3780
03:02:07,570 --> 03:02:09,790
it might've been 10 years after the
assassin.

3781
03:02:09,850 --> 03:02:11,560
Something crazy,
but it didn't.

3782
03:02:11,770 --> 03:02:15,430
People didn't see Kennedy get
assassinated until many,

3783
03:02:15,431 --> 03:02:18,160
many,
many years after when this guy's

3784
03:02:18,161 --> 03:02:21,130
approved or who was there on the spot
was filming.

3785
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:24,970
They took his,
his film and he sold it to time life

3786
03:02:24,971 --> 03:02:28,270
magazine.
They use stills of it and then they

3787
03:02:28,271 --> 03:02:29,240
didn't show it.
What,

3788
03:02:29,650 --> 03:02:31,840
12 years?
Twelve years later.

3789
03:02:31,900 --> 03:02:33,140
Seventy five.
Wow.

3790
03:02:33,170 --> 03:02:35,410
So on 75 and the Geraldo Rivera show,
they,

3791
03:02:35,510 --> 03:02:40,030
they premiered the Zapruder film footage
of the assassination of President

3792
03:02:40,031 --> 03:02:43,270
Kennedy from like fucking 20 yards away.
He was right.

3793
03:02:43,290 --> 03:02:46,390
That NDC Kennedy's head go back into the
left.

3794
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:48,730
It's,
you see the spray of blood and you're

3795
03:02:48,731 --> 03:02:49,550
like,
what?

3796
03:02:49,550 --> 03:02:52,330
So was it,
did they show that it was more than one?

3797
03:02:53,090 --> 03:02:56,750
They can't tell for sure and there's a
lot of speculation because there's so

3798
03:02:56,751 --> 03:03:00,050
many men in black and white and they
were shaky back then.

3799
03:03:00,051 --> 03:03:03,170
They've since use computers to stabilize
the image,

3800
03:03:03,560 --> 03:03:08,560
but what it looks like to the untrained
eye is that he shot more than once and

3801
03:03:09,201 --> 03:03:12,410
probably shot from multiple different
angles and the reason why they came up

3802
03:03:12,411 --> 03:03:14,380
with the magic bullet theory,
because they account,

3803
03:03:14,540 --> 03:03:17,960
they had to account for another bullet
that didn't hit the president.

3804
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:22,360
They had to account for a bullet that
hit it ricocheted under an underpass and

3805
03:03:22,490 --> 03:03:23,840
hit a guy.
So yeah,

3806
03:03:23,841 --> 03:03:28,841
the bullet had to go through to people
and it had a leave traces of the bullet

3807
03:03:28,851 --> 03:03:31,700
behind that weren't missing for the
bullet from the book.

3808
03:03:31,850 --> 03:03:34,250
And it had a shattered bone and not
distort.

3809
03:03:34,490 --> 03:03:35,670
Which doesn't happen.
Yeah.

3810
03:03:35,870 --> 03:03:38,390
If you know anything about bullets,
if you shoot anything,

3811
03:03:38,780 --> 03:03:40,130
bullets get Jack.
They get,

3812
03:03:40,190 --> 03:03:41,470
they tear up.
They,

3813
03:03:41,510 --> 03:03:42,620
they been,
they get,

3814
03:03:42,650 --> 03:03:43,650
they get sleep.

3815
03:03:43,830 --> 03:03:45,440
Yeah.
You could take fucking lead.

3816
03:03:45,550 --> 03:03:46,450
Exactly.
Yeah.

3817
03:03:46,451 --> 03:03:48,520
Even if it's jacketed,
it's still going to get fucked up.

3818
03:03:48,521 --> 03:03:51,370
It's hitting bones and shattering at a
ridiculous speed.

3819
03:03:51,730 --> 03:03:55,060
The single bullet theory was also
created by Arlen Specter and those

3820
03:03:55,061 --> 03:03:56,850
fucking guys from the Warren Commission
report,

3821
03:03:57,050 --> 03:03:58,550
bunch of evil assets

3822
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:02,420
is a great book on it called a best
evidence by David Lifton.

3823
03:04:02,450 --> 03:04:06,530
David Lipton was an accountant who went
over the Warren Commission report step

3824
03:04:06,531 --> 03:04:09,710
by step every step of the way,
and she found all these contradictions

3825
03:04:09,980 --> 03:04:13,400
in the reporting like this is a bullshit
document like when they were trying to

3826
03:04:13,401 --> 03:04:16,190
do was just wrapped this bitch up nice
and tight.

3827
03:04:16,191 --> 03:04:19,520
They weren't trying to solve the crime.
They were trying to wrap this thing up

3828
03:04:19,521 --> 03:04:23,240
tight and the most ridiculous aspect of
it is the magic bullet theory,

3829
03:04:23,540 --> 03:04:25,550
but before anybody saw this uproot or
film,

3830
03:04:25,551 --> 03:04:28,490
it didn't look that ridiculous.
We heard what we were told.

3831
03:04:28,700 --> 03:04:32,720
Kennedy got shot by Oswald and Jack Ruby
shot ours walled.

3832
03:04:33,100 --> 03:04:34,910
Very convenient,
very convenient.

3833
03:04:35,060 --> 03:04:37,880
The whole thing is ridiculous.
I don't know why they killed them,

3834
03:04:38,210 --> 03:04:42,230
but it's very likely that there was
quite a few people involved and not just

3835
03:04:42,231 --> 03:04:43,810
Lee Harvey Oswald,
and he was probably involved.

3836
03:04:44,170 --> 03:04:44,681
Well,
you know,

3837
03:04:44,681 --> 03:04:49,681
that he passed a resolution.
He was fucking with the Federal Reserve.

3838
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:52,510
Oh yeah.
What was the,

3839
03:04:52,511 --> 03:04:54,310
uh,
one one one.

3840
03:04:54,550 --> 03:04:55,460
Uh,
it was a.

3841
03:04:56,070 --> 03:04:57,070
well,
there's a lot of problems.

3842
03:04:57,110 --> 03:04:58,090
They have pigs.
Hey,

3843
03:04:58,091 --> 03:04:58,690
a pig.

3844
03:04:58,690 --> 03:04:59,480
Yeah.
There was a,

3845
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:02,110
he wanted to get rid of the Federal
Reserve.

3846
03:05:02,111 --> 03:05:04,040
He wanted to get rid of the CIA.
Started printing.

3847
03:05:04,130 --> 03:05:07,080
Nope.
A currency backed by.

3848
03:05:07,140 --> 03:05:10,020
He wanted to go back to the gold,
silver standard.

3849
03:05:10,021 --> 03:05:14,100
He started printing up notes.
Fucking if you could find those notes

3850
03:05:14,101 --> 03:05:17,250
from when he was in silver certificates.
And he said,

3851
03:05:17,251 --> 03:05:20,130
why a private banks controlling our
money,

3852
03:05:20,131 --> 03:05:22,530
the Federal Reserve.
It wasn't,

3853
03:05:22,531 --> 03:05:24,720
I think one of the acts that,
uh,

3854
03:05:24,860 --> 03:05:27,660
George Bush junior passed before he
left,

3855
03:05:27,661 --> 03:05:32,400
or this executive order on one one,
one zero to give him the printing of the

3856
03:05:32,401 --> 03:05:36,750
money back to the fucking take it away
from the Federal Reserve.

3857
03:05:36,850 --> 03:05:40,380
They whacked him just a couple of months
later and give it back to the secretary.

3858
03:05:40,470 --> 03:05:42,990
His father said that they're going to
kill you for this.

3859
03:05:43,620 --> 03:05:46,530
His father told him that you fuck with
them.

3860
03:05:46,531 --> 03:05:47,460
Bankers,
man.

3861
03:05:47,550 --> 03:05:48,860
True.
It's uh,

3862
03:05:48,870 --> 03:05:50,310
you know,
comes back to,

3863
03:05:50,370 --> 03:05:51,203
to,
you know,

3864
03:05:51,210 --> 03:05:54,990
power is not about a conspiracy.
It's about Yo.

3865
03:05:55,320 --> 03:05:58,170
It's about,
they want the ultimate greed.

3866
03:05:58,200 --> 03:06:01,290
It's the ultimate greed.
We control everything.

3867
03:06:01,320 --> 03:06:02,160
Well,
especially back then

3868
03:06:02,190 --> 03:06:03,200
then.
I mean,

3869
03:06:03,210 --> 03:06:07,200
the amount of accountability that
politicians had back then you can get

3870
03:06:07,201 --> 03:06:11,340
away with a lot.
There was a lot of wiggle room and you

3871
03:06:11,341 --> 03:06:13,770
know,
it's most likely that somebody other

3872
03:06:13,771 --> 03:06:17,250
than just Lee Harvey Oswald and he
probably had something to do with it

3873
03:06:17,251 --> 03:06:18,480
too.
I mean,

3874
03:06:18,481 --> 03:06:18,860
he was

3875
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:21,380
probably Manchurian candidate.
It's man,

3876
03:06:21,381 --> 03:06:23,000
who knows,
they grabbed these guys.

3877
03:06:23,001 --> 03:06:25,780
They fucking.
Who knows does what within,

3878
03:06:26,390 --> 03:06:27,830
you know,
they're still doing it.

3879
03:06:27,930 --> 03:06:32,930
I believe to this day know a lot of
these fucking motherfuckers trying to

3880
03:06:34,761 --> 03:06:38,420
fucking shoe bombers and this fucking
clown and this,

3881
03:06:38,960 --> 03:06:40,880
you know,
there's so much shit going on.

3882
03:06:40,881 --> 03:06:44,570
Like even the shoe bomber,
like who the fuck did he get on a plane

3883
03:06:44,571 --> 03:06:46,010
with no passport?
You know,

3884
03:06:46,011 --> 03:06:49,820
it's like there's so much shit to just
go home.

3885
03:06:50,070 --> 03:06:52,320
Well you remember that God,
that they busted in Dallas,

3886
03:06:52,380 --> 03:06:57,380
who is a god that they'd set up.
They set him up to be an Islamic

3887
03:06:58,231 --> 03:07:00,210
terrorist.
They trained him,

3888
03:07:00,390 --> 03:07:04,290
they gave him the weapon and then as he
was trying to detonate the weapon,

3889
03:07:04,291 --> 03:07:07,290
they arrested him.
It's like you guys talked him into doing

3890
03:07:07,291 --> 03:07:10,740
this,
you gave him the bombs and then you

3891
03:07:10,741 --> 03:07:13,170
arrested him.
Like what would he have done if you guys

3892
03:07:13,171 --> 03:07:15,150
weren't even there?
We've done anything.

3893
03:07:15,151 --> 03:07:16,090
They,
they,

3894
03:07:16,140 --> 03:07:18,690
they thought that this guy was a person
who was suspicious.

3895
03:07:18,870 --> 03:07:21,690
So they literally set up an entrapped
him

3896
03:07:21,810 --> 03:07:23,940
entrapment.
It's Kinda going on.

3897
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:25,620
It's going on a lot,
man.

3898
03:07:25,621 --> 03:07:30,621
It's fucking like we don't even notice
shit that's going on behind the walls of

3899
03:07:30,850 --> 03:07:33,140
the fucking offices.
Man.

3900
03:07:33,141 --> 03:07:35,650
It was fucking scared of fucking
Bejesus.

3901
03:07:35,670 --> 03:07:36,960
Addy.
If he knew,

3902
03:07:37,710 --> 03:07:40,450
you know,
what the fuck was,

3903
03:07:40,460 --> 03:07:42,150
uh,
you know what?

3904
03:07:42,151 --> 03:07:44,980
These people's minds,
you know,

3905
03:07:45,140 --> 03:07:48,890
well you get accustomed to make and
rationalizations that will cross people

3906
03:07:48,891 --> 03:07:53,420
their lives and I think anybody that can
send a drone to shoot down an apartment

3907
03:07:53,421 --> 03:07:55,230
building because of Metadata,
you know,

3908
03:07:55,240 --> 03:07:59,060
you found the metadata that seems to
indicate that the cell phone of a

3909
03:07:59,061 --> 03:08:03,350
certain criminal is on the 14th floor.
Let the fucking hell fire missiles fly

3910
03:08:03,351 --> 03:08:04,010
baby.
Yeah,

3911
03:08:04,010 --> 03:08:05,510
I mean that's decisions that they make.

3912
03:08:05,510 --> 03:08:10,510
That's Virginia city x box controller.
Fucking like,

3913
03:08:10,700 --> 03:08:14,390
you know,
disconnected from everything.

3914
03:08:14,930 --> 03:08:17,510
If you talked to someone from the CIA,
they tell you it's all lawyers who make

3915
03:08:17,511 --> 03:08:20,840
those decisions to lawyers do all the
calculations and they go,

3916
03:08:20,841 --> 03:08:21,674
yeah,
you can do it.

3917
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:25,100
Crazy.
Crazy man.

3918
03:08:25,120 --> 03:08:26,120
Yeah,
dude,

3919
03:08:26,121 --> 03:08:28,550
we just did three hours a day.
We flew by.

3920
03:08:28,790 --> 03:08:29,810
Well,
you know what they say.

3921
03:08:29,811 --> 03:08:33,230
How do you know when a lawyer is lying?
His lips are moving.

3922
03:08:34,970 --> 03:08:36,280
Hey,
I got a good lawyer though.

3923
03:08:36,360 --> 03:08:38,090
Let me tell you,
this guy would be good lawyers.

3924
03:08:38,150 --> 03:08:39,940
There is good people,
good people.

3925
03:08:40,070 --> 03:08:42,650
Peter Nussbaum I love yet.
Shout out to Peter.

3926
03:08:42,690 --> 03:08:46,370
He just bombed my lawyer.
He's not a criminal attorney,

3927
03:08:46,820 --> 03:08:49,520
so come to the fights this weekend I was
invited.

3928
03:08:49,521 --> 03:08:51,890
I was like,
hopefully we get along and have a

3929
03:08:51,891 --> 03:08:54,140
fucking dope because we got along.
It was fine.

3930
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:56,270
I have massive respect,
you know,

3931
03:08:56,310 --> 03:08:58,430
Brian's a crazy motherfucker.
I tell a story,

3932
03:08:58,700 --> 03:09:00,850
you know,
that whole school down there was I,

3933
03:09:00,890 --> 03:09:03,290
I wanted to tell her story about mine
because he

3934
03:09:04,910 --> 03:09:06,250
fucking.
He's hilarious.

3935
03:09:06,320 --> 03:09:09,220
He's hilarious.
I used to take A.

3936
03:09:09,350 --> 03:09:10,010
Tony

3937
03:09:10,010 --> 03:09:13,280
[inaudible] is one of the senior
students have mastered Choi.

3938
03:09:13,310 --> 03:09:15,260
Another guy,
we'll call him chuck,

3939
03:09:15,261 --> 03:09:19,070
but he's with the government now.
He's a fucking bad motherfucker.

3940
03:09:19,700 --> 03:09:21,820
So they always used to go around and,
and,

3941
03:09:21,821 --> 03:09:24,290
and want to fight balances and all this
shit.

3942
03:09:24,291 --> 03:09:27,830
That was what they did.
They would fucking fight the biggest

3943
03:09:28,220 --> 03:09:31,640
scariest looking motherfuckers and just
destroyed them.

3944
03:09:31,910 --> 03:09:34,490
So blue worked.
I said his name,

3945
03:09:34,491 --> 03:09:37,430
sorry,
but my friend worked with a cro mags and

3946
03:09:37,431 --> 03:09:38,330
stuff.
We took them out,

3947
03:09:38,360 --> 03:09:41,750
security with us in case we had problems
or whatever.

3948
03:09:41,751 --> 03:09:44,780
So it was like everything always went
smooth.

3949
03:09:44,781 --> 03:09:49,190
So one time I used to work at all the
underground hip hop clubs in New York.

3950
03:09:49,191 --> 03:09:54,191
So my friend was doing a party and it
was all fucking deep heads,

3951
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:57,150
fucking like homeboys and shit,
like the real deal,

3952
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:59,950
this hip hop club.
And I take Brian,

3953
03:10:00,070 --> 03:10:05,070
another dude from the school and Tony
and we go over there and Brian is in the

3954
03:10:06,910 --> 03:10:10,360
middle of the dance floor doing the
Funky fucking white boy nerd dance and

3955
03:10:10,361 --> 03:10:13,150
all these fuck.
And the floor just opens up and these

3956
03:10:13,151 --> 03:10:17,980
fucking black fucking hip hop crazy
fucking homeboys that like,

3957
03:10:17,981 --> 03:10:20,490
Yo,
look at this mother fucking white boy

3958
03:10:20,491 --> 03:10:22,870
like his bucket.
And he don't give a fuck.

3959
03:10:22,871 --> 03:10:27,510
He's less seriously,
like a fucking piss to roll with.

3960
03:10:28,030 --> 03:10:30,760
So then I might go,
uh,

3961
03:10:30,761 --> 03:10:32,500
I gotta go.
But listen man,

3962
03:10:32,590 --> 03:10:35,110
I know what y'all motherfuckers do.
Don't start.

3963
03:10:35,111 --> 03:10:37,150
No Shit,
please.

3964
03:10:37,151 --> 03:10:40,000
It's my friend's club.
So I get home,

3965
03:10:40,030 --> 03:10:42,350
go to sleep,
wake up the next day I get a fucking

3966
03:10:42,351 --> 03:10:43,410
phone call,
Yo.

3967
03:10:44,170 --> 03:10:45,970
Like he didn't know that they were with
me.

3968
03:10:45,971 --> 03:10:46,460
He's like,
Yo,

3969
03:10:46,460 --> 03:10:50,320
there was these three fucking karate
experts in the club last night.

3970
03:10:50,320 --> 03:10:53,170
And they beat up all my fucking
bouncers.

3971
03:10:53,171 --> 03:10:54,910
Dude.
It was fucking crazy.

3972
03:10:54,911 --> 03:10:59,911
Like and one bounce a walked up and
started some shit with a Tony was trying

3973
03:11:00,761 --> 03:11:02,160
to talk to a girl,
whatever.

3974
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:03,910
And,
and then like,

3975
03:11:03,911 --> 03:11:05,680
you know,
this guys all on the juice,

3976
03:11:05,681 --> 03:11:09,290
rips off his shirt.
Like I fucking Tony throws a kick

3977
03:11:09,330 --> 03:11:12,850
fucking dislocates the guy's fucking
kneecap.

3978
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:14,890
And then,
uh,

3979
03:11:14,950 --> 03:11:18,640
the melee just ensued in it.
It was just constant.

3980
03:11:19,120 --> 03:11:22,150
These fucking huge bouncers,
common Adam.

3981
03:11:22,151 --> 03:11:25,030
And Brian's like fucking prior could
fight.

3982
03:11:25,630 --> 03:11:27,820
Brian is a,
uh,

3983
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:28,960
you know,
he's,

3984
03:11:29,050 --> 03:11:30,340
he's,
he's a comedian,

3985
03:11:30,341 --> 03:11:34,810
but he could throw down and then he,
Brian just told me this because I didn't

3986
03:11:34,811 --> 03:11:35,860
hear the other part.
He goes,

3987
03:11:35,861 --> 03:11:38,920
yeah.
Then all of a sudden I'm fucking whack

3988
03:11:38,921 --> 03:11:42,850
and these dudes and us with fight and
these guys and then this fucking

3989
03:11:42,851 --> 03:11:47,560
gigantic motherfucker.
Like I was just like a little fucking

3990
03:11:47,561 --> 03:11:51,790
baby in his arms,
lifts me up and carries me out the

3991
03:11:51,791 --> 03:11:54,670
fucking door and throws me across this
car.

3992
03:11:54,850 --> 03:11:58,090
And I look and I turned around and I'm
ready to go.

3993
03:11:58,091 --> 03:12:02,650
And then Brian says,
and I look and it's this fucking crazy

3994
03:12:02,651 --> 03:12:07,651
white dude with a fucking scar from one
end of his face down his throat and he

3995
03:12:08,141 --> 03:12:12,040
points at Brian Goes,
don't even think about it.

3996
03:12:12,160 --> 03:12:13,900
And like Brian was like,
Yo.

3997
03:12:14,290 --> 03:12:16,240
But my friend called me up the next day,
he's like,

3998
03:12:16,241 --> 03:12:18,520
these motherfuckers.
And I called them up and I'm like,

3999
03:12:18,521 --> 03:12:20,860
Brian,
the fuck did you do man?

4000
03:12:20,861 --> 03:12:23,230
I told you guys to fucking keep Chili's
like,

4001
03:12:23,231 --> 03:12:25,150
Yo,
these bouncers were assholes.

4002
03:12:25,151 --> 03:12:27,370
And you know,
he's,

4003
03:12:27,400 --> 03:12:29,050
he's a,
he's a character.

4004
03:12:29,051 --> 03:12:31,570
Like I said,
I was at his first comedy show ever.

4005
03:12:31,840 --> 03:12:36,220
He lived a wild life in his young days.
I met him after all that stuff.

4006
03:12:36,221 --> 03:12:38,960
I met him when he was more calm.
I met him in the nineties.

4007
03:12:38,961 --> 03:12:40,150
Yeah,
yeah,

4008
03:12:40,210 --> 03:12:42,760
yeah.
They were in big time master choice.

4009
03:12:42,761 --> 03:12:47,590
It was all about fucking getting out
there and fucking contact.

4010
03:12:47,591 --> 03:12:51,740
There was a lot of martial arts coaches
or instructors that wanted you to get in

4011
03:12:51,741 --> 03:12:52,040
street

4012
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:54,530
fights because you had practice cause
it,

4013
03:12:54,531 --> 03:12:57,620
like street fights would show you how
things would work in the real world that

4014
03:12:57,621 --> 03:13:00,050
the more you did it,
the more you understood urgency,

4015
03:13:00,380 --> 03:13:02,060
closing the distance,
you know,

4016
03:13:02,061 --> 03:13:04,250
delivering the first strike,
all that kind of shit.

4017
03:13:04,251 --> 03:13:06,560
Like people are hesitant because
inspiring.

4018
03:13:06,561 --> 03:13:08,740
You always hold back.
So like,

4019
03:13:08,780 --> 03:13:10,560
you know,
I knew many more sites.

4020
03:13:10,630 --> 03:13:13,130
Quando background started.
Yeah.

4021
03:13:13,420 --> 03:13:15,130
Brian told me that about you.
He goes,

4022
03:13:15,131 --> 03:13:16,090
Yo,
I got kicked.

4023
03:13:16,091 --> 03:13:21,091
Like a fucking horse shit because I'll
see you on fear factor.

4024
03:13:23,290 --> 03:13:25,390
We want something before that to news
radio.

4025
03:13:25,440 --> 03:13:25,991
Yes.
Yeah,

4026
03:13:25,991 --> 03:13:26,761
yeah,
yeah,

4027
03:13:26,761 --> 03:13:27,730
yeah.
And,

4028
03:13:27,731 --> 03:13:28,750
and,
and he's like,

4029
03:13:28,751 --> 03:13:29,540
yeah,

4030
03:13:29,540 --> 03:13:31,300
That's my dude man.
He fucking,

4031
03:13:31,720 --> 03:13:32,411
you know,
he's like,

4032
03:13:32,411 --> 03:13:35,380
Yo,

4033
03:13:35,381 --> 03:13:36,820
And so I,
you know,

4034
03:13:37,130 --> 03:13:37,780

4036
03:13:41,860 --> 03:13:44,990

4037
03:13:45,060 --> 03:13:46,640

4038
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:48,510
weekend.
Fights are going to be awesome.

4039
03:13:48,540 --> 03:13:49,920
It's a sick card size.

4040
03:13:51,220 --> 03:13:53,850
You know,
I've been found the UFC since day one

4041
03:13:53,851 --> 03:13:56,880
and originally,
and when that first came around,

4042
03:13:56,881 --> 03:14:01,881
it was the gracies that put a fucking.
Dave took out an ad in a karate karate

4043
03:14:02,791 --> 03:14:07,770
magazines and they said we will take
anybody $100,000 if they can beat us.

4044
03:14:08,190 --> 03:14:13,190
That's,
I saw UFC one rem co pardot and dude,

4045
03:14:13,470 --> 03:14:15,750
I've been watching that shit since day

4046
03:14:15,830 --> 03:14:16,663
Uh,
you know,

4047
03:14:17,060 --> 03:14:18,540
into a live one.
No.

4048
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:19,291
Oh,

4049
03:14:19,291 --> 03:14:24,291
I went to a who to Douglas Crosby,
who was the judge very well.

4050
03:14:24,570 --> 03:14:27,700
Doug Doug's my man dog,

4051
03:14:28,480 --> 03:14:30,840
Took me to some fights and stuff.
And uh,

4052
03:14:31,020 --> 03:14:33,330
in Jersey actually I did go to a live
one.

4053
03:14:33,870 --> 03:14:36,930
Uh,
Jake from rocks off took me to the UFC

4054
03:14:36,931 --> 03:14:41,910
when it was in newark and there was
fucking fights breaking out was this,

4055
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:46,020
this was probably like four or five
years ago in Newark,

4056
03:14:46,021 --> 03:14:47,750
a down,
you know,

4057
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:49,740
they,
they have UFC in Newark.

4058
03:14:49,800 --> 03:14:54,450
And I went to that and uh,
there was a fight on the main floor.

4059
03:14:54,630 --> 03:14:58,140
That was the best fight of the night.
These two fucking guys just started,

4060
03:14:58,800 --> 03:15:00,120
you know.
And then when you left,

4061
03:15:00,150 --> 03:15:04,440
everyone's doing good in school.
Every fucking Rama.

4062
03:15:04,450 --> 03:15:09,450
Luke got a school and a flyer.
That's how I love to fight the fights.

4063
03:15:10,300 --> 03:15:12,240
You know,
I've been watching the boxing matches

4064
03:15:12,241 --> 03:15:14,310
since the seventies.
All the super fights.

4065
03:15:14,311 --> 03:15:17,940
Fucking Muhammad Ali and Ken Norton and
Fucking,

4066
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:19,380
uh,
what was the great one?

4067
03:15:19,381 --> 03:15:22,320
Hagler hearns.
Yeah.

4068
03:15:22,490 --> 03:15:23,100
I'm trying

4069
03:15:23,100 --> 03:15:26,850
Marvin Hagler on the podcast now.
He's like the only guy that retired

4070
03:15:26,851 --> 03:15:27,870
clean.
He's like,

4071
03:15:27,871 --> 03:15:31,830
I'm good at last to sugar ray Leonard.
Last decision that a lot of people

4072
03:15:31,831 --> 03:15:36,720
thought he should have won that fight.
It's just like this done walked away.

4073
03:15:36,750 --> 03:15:37,590
No one ever done that.

4074
03:15:37,950 --> 03:15:41,200
Made a hitman.
Her boxing used to be like,

4075
03:15:41,790 --> 03:15:44,410
you know,
I just posted a picture of Mike Tyson,

4076
03:15:44,411 --> 03:15:48,520
Jake Lamata and um,
and fucking Graziano on my,

4077
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:51,390
on my instagram.
Like those three cars.

4078
03:15:51,391 --> 03:15:55,200
My father boxed at gramercy gym,
which was run by custom motto,

4079
03:15:55,201 --> 03:15:58,760
which they knocked it down.
It was right near the palladium and all

4080
03:15:58,761 --> 03:16:00,450
that.
So you had Julian's billiards,

4081
03:16:00,451 --> 03:16:02,940
which I do a walking tour in New York is
coming out on.

4082
03:16:03,130 --> 03:16:07,560
I know I've seen that before.
Fuck the three,

4083
03:16:08,430 --> 03:16:10,500
you have a contract city,
I'll give you a private one,

4084
03:16:10,501 --> 03:16:13,740
but it's like it's been,
although I've been on the today show a

4085
03:16:13,741 --> 03:16:15,900
Sunday today,
show the Times fucking.

4086
03:16:16,300 --> 03:16:21,030
It's like the best underground fucking
walk into of crime,

4087
03:16:21,031 --> 03:16:23,370
music and history on the lower east
side.

4088
03:16:23,371 --> 03:16:27,980
And we go by that whole way to palladium
was where to clash.

4089
03:16:28,260 --> 03:16:31,740
September 21st the cover of the
classroom learning,

4090
03:16:31,741 --> 03:16:34,740
calling with shot there,
Paul Seminar and smashing his base.

4091
03:16:34,920 --> 03:16:39,540
He had Julian's billions right there.
All the fucking pool hall hustle is.

4092
03:16:39,541 --> 03:16:40,790
And uh,
and,

4093
03:16:40,791 --> 03:16:43,710
and before the palladium it was called
the academy of Music.

4094
03:16:43,711 --> 03:16:45,690
Dizzy Gillespie.
Everybody played there.

4095
03:16:45,870 --> 03:16:48,480
And then up the street from that was
custom models.

4096
03:16:48,481 --> 03:16:51,990
Jim called the grammercy Jim and
everybody,

4097
03:16:52,170 --> 03:16:56,480
Floyd Patterson for that.
If you pull up pictures of a grammar

4098
03:16:56,500 --> 03:16:57,301
Nazi,
Jim,

4099
03:16:57,301 --> 03:17:00,750
you can see there's a picture.
And Floyd Patterson's work in the speed

4100
03:17:00,751 --> 03:17:03,020
bag.
And when that closed down,

4101
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:05,700
cut my.
And I was just walking by one day when I

4102
03:17:05,701 --> 03:17:07,920
was with my mom and she goes,
your father,

4103
03:17:07,960 --> 03:17:12,750
because pc richards took over the space
and they put a plaque and it said,

4104
03:17:12,751 --> 03:17:14,720
this is where custom models,
Jim,

4105
03:17:14,721 --> 03:17:15,940
we train,
uh,

4106
03:17:15,990 --> 03:17:19,470
was it Jose Torres,
the world champions than all of these

4107
03:17:19,471 --> 03:17:21,380
weight classes.
And My,

4108
03:17:21,500 --> 03:17:22,530
my mother just goes,
oh,

4109
03:17:22,531 --> 03:17:23,430
your father,
box day.

4110
03:17:23,431 --> 03:17:24,264
I said,
what?

4111
03:17:25,050 --> 03:17:28,500
And there it is.
Look how they spell grammercy to g,

4112
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:29,551
G,
R a.

4113
03:17:29,551 --> 03:17:32,920
They spelled it wrong.
Grandmas see grandma's grandma's.

4114
03:17:32,921 --> 03:17:36,370
See that's crazy.
They spells my name with general.

4115
03:17:37,590 --> 03:17:41,390
I think that it looks here.
I think it is for Patterson.

4116
03:17:41,630 --> 03:17:43,200
Wow.
School.

4117
03:17:43,230 --> 03:17:44,820
Yeah.
So we do this whole thing.

4118
03:17:44,821 --> 03:17:48,540
We go to a Tony Danza.
Yeah.

4119
03:17:48,541 --> 03:17:52,710
He took some shots and fucking I saw
some of his fights.

4120
03:17:53,160 --> 03:17:54,220
He could park.
Yeah.

4121
03:17:54,600 --> 03:17:55,650
Uh,
yeah.

4122
03:17:55,651 --> 03:17:58,030
And,
and then we go by Irving Plaza where

4123
03:17:58,031 --> 03:18:00,300
John Belushi sounds like a lot of fun.
Dude.

4124
03:18:00,301 --> 03:18:01,620
It's fucking hours.
Listen,

4125
03:18:01,621 --> 03:18:04,590
I had these four old Israeli ladies
come,

4126
03:18:04,591 --> 03:18:06,060
right?
And I'm like,

4127
03:18:06,090 --> 03:18:08,070
and,
and all the tours meet in this area.

4128
03:18:08,071 --> 03:18:10,050
And they're like,
we're here for the tour.

4129
03:18:10,051 --> 03:18:12,120
I said,
I think you'd want the food tour over

4130
03:18:12,121 --> 03:18:12,780
there.
They like,

4131
03:18:12,780 --> 03:18:14,460
they showed me their tickets.
They like,

4132
03:18:14,790 --> 03:18:16,680
they like in his sixties from Israel.

4133
03:18:16,680 --> 03:18:17,640
They're like,
no,

4134
03:18:17,641 --> 03:18:22,620
we're here for the crime tour.
And they fucking did the whole three

4135
03:18:22,621 --> 03:18:23,490
hours.
They're like,

4136
03:18:23,491 --> 03:18:28,491
that was fascinating.
So in New York and Steve Lacy just texts

4137
03:18:28,751 --> 03:18:31,860
me.
So I'll tell you what the fuck it is.

4138
03:18:31,861 --> 03:18:34,950
Hold on here.
You do these on a regular basis every

4139
03:18:34,950 --> 03:18:37,080
week when I'm in New York or weak,
uh,

4140
03:18:37,250 --> 03:18:38,100
every,
every,

4141
03:18:38,101 --> 03:18:39,330
uh,
Sunday.

4142
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:44,490
So Steve Lacy just texts me.
Where the fuck is it when you need it?

4143
03:18:44,520 --> 03:18:46,350
How do you have the time to do all these
things?

4144
03:18:46,410 --> 03:18:47,120
Dude,
man,

4145
03:18:47,120 --> 03:18:48,190
uh,
you know,

4146
03:18:48,191 --> 03:18:49,840
I get,
I get to bed early.

4147
03:18:49,841 --> 03:18:50,531
Oh,
here it is.

4148
03:18:50,531 --> 03:18:53,350
So if you're in New York City,
August 25th,

4149
03:18:53,360 --> 03:18:56,560
6:30 on Fox,
it's called winner's Win New York.

4150
03:18:56,561 --> 03:18:59,440
Rocked Rock,
soft rock and roll history,

4151
03:18:59,441 --> 03:19:03,280
walking tours.
The presses underneath it.

4152
03:19:03,590 --> 03:19:08,590
And we go everywhere we go to fucking
the five points a.

4153
03:19:09,310 --> 03:19:11,590
and I've had more press.
This is actually old.

4154
03:19:11,730 --> 03:19:14,060
You get a kick out of doing this in love
it,

4155
03:19:14,080 --> 03:19:18,370
you do it every week and I'll tell you
every week you run into these

4156
03:19:18,371 --> 03:19:21,250
motherfuckers on the street from the old
days and I don't usually,

4157
03:19:21,700 --> 03:19:24,820
it's just something about it.
I'll fucking do the tour.

4158
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:26,820
Like we ran into,
um,

4159
03:19:27,340 --> 03:19:31,240
dudes.
I'm Mick Jones from the clash or who do

4160
03:19:31,241 --> 03:19:33,880
we run it and nobody knew because he had
a suit on and I was like,

4161
03:19:33,900 --> 03:19:36,340
y'all motherfuckers know who that is.
Nobody knew it was Mick Jones.

4162
03:19:36,341 --> 03:19:36,821
I said,
Yo,

4163
03:19:36,821 --> 03:19:38,440
mic,
come on.

4164
03:19:38,470 --> 03:19:39,110
He's like,
oh,

4165
03:19:39,110 --> 03:19:39,820
well,
you know,

4166
03:19:39,820 --> 03:19:40,653
I was like,
listen,

4167
03:19:40,930 --> 03:19:44,290
I was one of the ones riding in 81 when
you played bonds,

4168
03:19:44,291 --> 03:19:47,170
if you go to the video clash on
Broadway,

4169
03:19:47,410 --> 03:19:52,410
I was there a rioting because they
oversold the club and Mayor Koch ordered

4170
03:19:54,101 --> 03:19:56,530
the promoter and the clash to do enough
shows.

4171
03:19:56,950 --> 03:19:59,080
It's called the clash on Broadway,
on Youtube.

4172
03:19:59,350 --> 03:20:04,270
And they ordered the class to do enough
shows and the promoter sold something

4173
03:20:04,271 --> 03:20:05,560
like a ticket.
It was,

4174
03:20:06,270 --> 03:20:08,890
I don't know,
something like 20,000 tickets for a

4175
03:20:08,920 --> 03:20:13,920
venue that held 2,500.
So you had close to 20,000 punk rockers

4176
03:20:15,071 --> 03:20:18,630
show up in Times Square.
The fire department closes the fucking

4177
03:20:18,670 --> 03:20:21,280
club down and there's a riot in times
square.

4178
03:20:21,460 --> 03:20:24,220
Now I'm a war at a time.
I'm smashing motherfucking windows.

4179
03:20:24,530 --> 03:20:26,820
I stopped traffic,
I'm running on cabs.

4180
03:20:26,821 --> 03:20:29,470
Fuck.
And then I started seeing people getting

4181
03:20:29,471 --> 03:20:30,340
arrested.
I'm like,

4182
03:20:30,370 --> 03:20:33,070
oh,
it's time to go.

4183
03:20:33,460 --> 03:20:36,130
But yeah,
like and then Saturday night live,

4184
03:20:36,131 --> 03:20:39,610
I was on that when fear played John
Belushi,

4185
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:41,900
John Belushi used to come to all the
punk rock shows.

4186
03:20:41,901 --> 03:20:45,730
So we go to all the venues and the
famous murder spots.

4187
03:20:46,150 --> 03:20:49,480
And like I lived in a building with the
East village butcher,

4188
03:20:49,481 --> 03:20:51,160
Daniel Rakowitz.
He chopped up,

4189
03:20:51,161 --> 03:20:54,280
his girlfriend made soup out of her and
fed it to the homeless.

4190
03:20:54,280 --> 03:20:55,650
I lived in that building.
That was,

4191
03:20:55,980 --> 03:20:59,020
that was 700 east night.
I squatted in that building.

4192
03:20:59,290 --> 03:21:01,570
So it's all these fame,
the murder of a bleed.

4193
03:21:01,620 --> 03:21:04,730
Liba wall who on Second Avenue Deli like
and,

4194
03:21:04,770 --> 03:21:08,080
and famous movies.
Then we go to the smuggling tunnels of

4195
03:21:08,081 --> 03:21:10,360
prohibition.
A lot of shit you saw on boardwalk

4196
03:21:10,361 --> 03:21:15,361
empire.
So it's a pretty fascinating tour.

4197
03:21:15,460 --> 03:21:19,360
And I always like the first time I did
it and I'll just leave it as,

4198
03:21:19,361 --> 03:21:22,780
it was really funny because I had like
40 people in,

4199
03:21:22,781 --> 03:21:27,781
some of them were from Germany.
So I'm going down and I'm fucking,

4200
03:21:29,080 --> 03:21:31,280
we'd go down to avenue B and I'm like,
yeah,

4201
03:21:31,281 --> 03:21:34,390
that was a big fucking drugs by here.
So this huge black dude.

4202
03:21:34,391 --> 03:21:37,570
I know he just got out of prison.
He's like fucking six,

4203
03:21:37,571 --> 03:21:40,840
five key Lloyd scar across his face.
He's like,

4204
03:21:40,841 --> 03:21:42,070
Yo,
what's up man?

4205
03:21:42,610 --> 03:21:44,170
Fuck you doing man.
What's up?

4206
03:21:44,171 --> 03:21:45,980
I ain't seen you in a minute.
I was like,

4207
03:21:45,980 --> 03:21:47,210
Oh,
I do this tour,

4208
03:21:47,211 --> 03:21:48,500
you know,
these are all tourists.

4209
03:21:48,501 --> 03:21:51,680
I'm taking them around to all the drugs
spots and letting them know about the

4210
03:21:51,681 --> 03:21:53,120
crime.
There is like word.

4211
03:21:53,570 --> 03:21:57,090
So he gets up on the curb.
He's like huge dude,

4212
03:21:57,100 --> 03:21:58,300
you know,
prison build.

4213
03:21:58,330 --> 03:22:00,870
Like he say,
let me tell you all motherfuckers some

4214
03:22:00,960 --> 03:22:04,010
right now,
y'all better listen to this man because

4215
03:22:04,011 --> 03:22:07,490
none of y'all motherfuckers would have
calmed down your back in the day.

4216
03:22:07,491 --> 03:22:11,630
I would have fucking rob all you got to
take taking your sneakers,

4217
03:22:11,631 --> 03:22:14,420
everything.
And they were like,

4218
03:22:14,890 --> 03:22:15,860
and then he's like,
Yo,

4219
03:22:15,890 --> 03:22:18,960
peace my mastery around blood clot.
And they were like,

4220
03:22:19,220 --> 03:22:21,920
you hear these Germans go,
oh my God,

4221
03:22:21,921 --> 03:22:26,720
that guy was fucking crazy.
So you will see all the dude.

4222
03:22:26,721 --> 03:22:29,000
You can't make this shit up.
I gotta wrap this up.

4223
03:22:29,001 --> 03:22:30,700
I got Joseph.
Thank you.

4224
03:22:30,710 --> 03:22:32,220
Great job.
Thank you very,

4225
03:22:32,221 --> 03:22:34,010
very much.
We're going to have some fun this

4226
03:22:34,010 --> 03:22:35,210

4227
03:22:35,270 --> 03:22:36,770
We'll be back tomorrow with mark.
Delegate.

4228
03:22:37,490 --> 03:22:38,050
