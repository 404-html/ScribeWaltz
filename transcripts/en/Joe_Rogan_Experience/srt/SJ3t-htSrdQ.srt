1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,540
This is the first time he's ever had a
false darn.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,630
He's getting tricky.
That's real.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,010
That's real world live.
Shane.

4
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:08,940
Dorian,
how are you brother?

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,871
What's going on?
Great.

6
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,830
Thanks.
Thanks for doing this,

7
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:11,880
man.
I really appreciate it.

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,171
Yeah,
no problem.

9
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,580
I'm happy to be here.
Thanks for having me.

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,810
My pleasure.
You know,

11
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,150
um,
you come highly recommended by my friend

12
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,890
Ben O'brien,
who's an awesome dude.

13
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,470
And apparently you guys had a great time
in New Zealand.

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,110
Bowhunting.
Yeah,

15
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,250
he's very,
he's very Texas.

16
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,590
We had a really good old time down
there.

18
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,950
I'd never been to.
I'd never been to New Zealand for

19
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,300
hunting before.
I'd been there for surfing,

20
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,750
so it was really cool to go and see
different parts of the country and do

21
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,300
some hunting out there.
We did some back country stuff surfing

22
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:41,370
there.
Is it as dangerous as surfing in

23
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,000
Australia?

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,470
As far as like sharks a?
No,

25
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,540
not as dangerous.
I'd say.

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,441
You know,
there are,

27
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:48,070
there are sharks there.
It's pretty close to Australia.

28
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:49,390
It's like a one hour flight.
So yeah,

29
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:51,870
that's what I was thinking sharks here
or over there,

30
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:52,411
but I don't,
I don't know.

31
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:55,200
I don't really think of sharks as as
much.

32
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,390
There's no,
you have a yellow,

33
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,410
a total radical fear of sharks are
scary,

34
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,190
scary creatures.
And then I'm fucking horrified.

35
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,050
How close have you shouldn't be.
You shouldn't be.

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,730
Um,
very close.

37
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,780
Yeah.
I got bumped off my board when I was a

38
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,190
kid.
Oh No.

39
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,580
Surfing into a place.
A sort of near my house,

40
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:20,490
but the water was that the sand was
black.

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,090
So yeah,
like I can really see the is actually

42
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,300
clear,
but the Sam is black,

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,260
so it bumped me and I never really got
to see what it was.

44
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,800
But I'm pretty sure it was a shark and
A.

45
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,730
There's a lot of sharks in Hawaii,
a lot of sharks,

46
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,560
wherever the waves are good.
It seems like there's a lot of sharks,

47
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,520
man.
Yeah.

48
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,500
That's not a coincidence,
is it?

49
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,761
I don't know,
man.

50
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,760
They're just everywhere.
They're crazy.

51
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,090
As you know.
It's funny about sharks.

52
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,780
As I was
growing up,

53
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,040
I always thought,
you know,

54
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,330
the only real sharks I had to worry
about where,

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,160
you know,
great whites and you know,

56
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,840
I was born and raised in Hawaii,
assess where I grew up surfing and um,

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,310
you know,
I always thought like great white

58
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:58,110
sharks,
they're always in really cool places.

59
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,950
I don't really have to worry it around
home and they've been finding a ton of

60
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,170
great white sharks around where I live
now.

61
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,940
They're all over Hawaii now and I'm a
great white sharks are actually warm

62
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:13,800
blooded so they can actually,
they can totally adjust their,

63
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,903
their,
uh,

64
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,960
I guess I guess their body temperature
to be able to,

65
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,130
to totally survive and thrive in warm
water as well as cold.

66
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,870
So they just go wherever the hell they
want.

67
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,230
Every time I go to Hawaii,
whatever,

68
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,000
I turn on the news,
the local news.

69
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,410
Some dude got bit.
Oh yeah,

70
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,180
yeah.
How often does it happen?

71
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,150
They're pretty often.
There's a lot of sharks.

72
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,250
And you know,
what's funny is it never used to happen

73
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,410
when I was a kid.
It wasn't even really a thought for me.

74
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,700
I mean,
I was scared of sharks and all that

75
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,170
stuff,
but people didn't really get start

76
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:43,050
getting chomped until I was a little bit
older in the last,

77
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,450
in the last 10 years,
there's been tons and tons of shark

78
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,430
attacks in Hawaii.
A friend,

79
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,460
a friend of mine and Bethany Hamilton,
she's a really,

80
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,990
really talented surfer.
She got bit.

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,380
She had her arm chomped right off her
body for a young girl.

82
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

83
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,740
And Hawaii surfing perfect waves out
with their friend and shark came up and

84
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,840
just ripped her arm right now for body
gangsters.

85
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,390
She,
that she just gets right back on the

86
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,550
board and she survived.
She's bad ass.

87
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,670
She's super bad ass.
She,

88
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,970
she actually served some of the biggest
waves,

89
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,811
uh,
all year.

90
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,260
Last year she got towed into a place
called Jaws on Maui and surfing 50 foot

91
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,690
waves with one arm,
um,

92
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,630
you know,
getting pounded by giant waves and she,

93
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,770
she paddles into some huge ways with one
arm.

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
Wow.
And gets held under water with one arm

95
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,090
and magic magically held under from a,
a giant wave underwater,

96
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,133
you know,
like trying to,

97
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,790
you know,
just,

98
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,560
I mean,
I know people who are terrified of

99
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,560
surfing big waves with two arms and you
know,

100
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,600
they're under water wanting a breath and
she's under there with one arm.

101
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:41,590
Imagine having like your arm tied to
your side and having to try and swim to

102
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,780
the surface the way it is.
Pretty scary.

103
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,070
Now when you get hit by a big wave like
that and you get sucked under,

104
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,620
how long are you under normally for
a,

105
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,180
usually a pretty,
pretty short amount of time.

106
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,590
But it really varies.
Um,

107
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,570
you know,
the,

108
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,350
the,
the worst thing about surfing really big

109
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:01,930
waves and the,
we've had a lot of people die surfing

110
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,850
big waves and it is super dangerous.
Um,

111
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,660
the thing that kills people is getting
held under for two waves.

112
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,690
So if you fall on,
it's like if you take off on a wave and

113
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:13,450
you fall and you're underwater for a
super long time.

114
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,100
And this has happened to me a couple of
different times.

115
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,490
You're underwater really far and then
you start,

116
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,460
you know,
the wave hold you under and it's rolling

117
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,060
you along the reef towards the shore and
you're underwater near the bottom or at

118
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,360
the bottom and then the waves just
starts to dissipate and lose a little

119
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,600
bit of power and he can finally start
swimming up and then the next wave is

120
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,810
meanwhile it's on its way and you're
swimming up,

121
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,510
swimming up and the waves coming at you
and you don't get a breath in.

122
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,920
The wave takes you straight back down
and that.

123
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,750
And that's how people die.
Yeah,

124
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,260
it's scary shit.
So how long have you been held under?

125
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:49,261
For about a minute and 10 seconds.
It's a long time.

126
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,990
The only reason I know that is because
a,

127
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,490
I had a terrible wipe out at a,
at a big wave place in northern

128
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:59,350
California called Mavericks.
It was my first trip ever there and I

129
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:00,880
was having this awesome trip.
It's like,

130
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,650
you know,
it's one of the best big waves in the

131
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:04,300
world.
I always wanted to go there,

132
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,880
but I was pretty scared of it and I
ended up going there and having a.

133
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,040
The first day I was there,
it was super good.

134
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,240
I had a,
I had a blast.

135
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,280
I didn't fall once.
I had to just it with like a dream

136
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,720
session,
cuddle these big waves.

137
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,110
Thought I was killing it next day,
just absolutely smashed me.

138
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,900
I took it off on a wave,
ate shit down the face,

139
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,990
got sucked over the falls,
held under forever on the reef and was

140
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,200
swimming towards the surface and the
next day it was like a 50 foot face

141
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,830
broke right on top of me,
shoved me straight back down to the

142
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,810
reef.
And like,

143
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,490
as I was swimming up to try and get a
breath,

144
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:35,620
I was doing those involuntary,
you know,

145
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,190
when you're going like that.
And I was like,

146
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,540
shit,
I got to get a breath now.

147
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,460
And then all of a sudden I was at,
at the bottom.

148
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,080
And um,
yeah,

149
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,460
it was really scary.
But the scariest,

150
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,080
scariest time of my life.
And,

151
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,914
and,
and,

152
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,900
um,
meanwhile,

153
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,360
meanwhile there was a woman on a boat
and she was filming the whole ordeal.

154
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,390
My board was like,
they call it tomb stoning where you can

155
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,930
only see half your board and then
you're,

156
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,890
and there's a leash,
right?

157
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,500
And you're connected to the bottom.
And a was like this,

158
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,330
you know,
you can only see half the half the board

159
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:06,530
for the next wave passed me by and my
board was still like that for over a

160
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,360
minute and I was like a minute and 10
seconds at a way,

161
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,253
way too long.

162
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,370
Wow.
That's,

163
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,380
it's hard to hold your breath for a
minute.

164
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,230
Just doing nothing.
Yeah.

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,020
It is holding your breath for a minute
while you're struggling.

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,980
And also your adrenaline's kicking in.
You're freaking out.

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,010
Yeah.
And you're realizing that you got to get

168
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,844
some air soon.

169
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,470
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

170
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,560
And that's when,
you know,

171
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,800
I mean,
that's the whole thing is,

172
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,461
is uh,
you know,

173
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,070
learning about breath,
hold the whole thing that speeds up

174
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,020
your,
your,

175
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,261
your,
your breath.

176
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:39,640
Hold is,
is uh,

177
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:42,850
or I should say shortening your breath.
Hold is panicking.

178
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,173
You know,
once you,

179
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,350
if you're able to stay,
stay calm and know that you're going to

180
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:48,510
be okay,
you know,

181
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,770
you don't use up your breath very,
very fast,

182
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,000
but if you start to panic it's like it's
like flooring the gas and it just speeds

183
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,340
up the whole thing.
And um,

184
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,020
so panicking is lasting that you want to
do,

185
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,930
but when you're really terrified,
that's what happens to everybody.

186
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,280
There's a big connection between Jujitsu
and surfing.

187
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,900
A lot of people that I know that Love
Jujitsu also love surfing and they do it

188
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,540
all the time.
And um,

189
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,320
that breath thing is something that
comes into play in both situations

190
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,830
because if you're in a bad position,
like if someone's choking you or

191
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:23,310
something like that,
you can relax and stay calm and kind of

192
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,420
barely get out of things.
Whereas if you freak out and you start,

193
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,720
you start hyperventilating or panicking,
you just,

194
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,940
you just have to tap,
you run out of gas,

195
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,970
you run out of air.
And then the choke sinks in deeper in.

196
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:40,530
Some people are just really good at
surfing and for some reason that like

197
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:44,430
Hicks and Gracie is a famous example,
he's really good at Yoga,

198
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,080
which is also really big for controlling
your breath and staying calm and

199
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,650
regulating your heart rate.
And then he's also obviously a master at

200
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:57,540
Jujitsu,
but he loves surfing and I think in some

201
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,440
way those things are kind of connected
that you have to sort of maintain some

202
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:03,570
sort of control over your physical body.

203
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah,
for sure.

204
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,320
And you know,
and you know,

205
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,470
I think um,
you know,

206
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,390
knowing,
knowing how long you can hold your

207
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:12,300
breath,
I'm especially under pressure,

208
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,920
especially with a high heart rate is the
key.

209
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,601
You know,
I,

210
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,550
I,
I did a breath holding course.

211
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,540
It was like a,
it was actually a specifically tailored

212
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,890
to surviving big waves.
Uh,

213
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,630
this course I did was four days long and
the first couple of days they just,

214
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,880
they just kind of taught us with the
science behind breath,

215
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:31,650
hold on,
how to get your breath,

216
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:33,030
hold up.
And then they basically,

217
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:35,490
uh,
worked our way up to our highest static

218
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:39,900
hold.
And then from there we had to hold our

219
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,690
breath for a quarter of that time under
stress.

220
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,220
Hm.
So when you take a breath hold course,

221
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,330
like what are they teaching?

222
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,820
Uh,
just the science behind the how,

223
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,730
how some people can hold their breath
for a long time and some people can't.

224
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,810
And you know,
the difference,

225
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:55,920
the,
it's,

226
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,990
it's,
it's basically psychological.

227
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:00,360
It's all in your mind really?
Oh yeah.

228
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,530
It definitely is.
I mean,

229
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,020
if you think you can hold your breath
for like if right now you tried to hold

230
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,170
your breath for and you could only make
it a minute for sure.

231
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,750
You can hold your breath for 300
percent.

232
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,970
It's all in your mind.
Like if you believe that you are going

233
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,620
to be fine,
it just,

234
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,510
you know,
your body tells you that you need to

235
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,200
breathe.
I'm like,

236
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,860
Kinda for that course.
I think the first day I tried to hold my

237
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,830
breath,
I'm and I'm in relatively good shape and

238
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,990
I never ever practice holding my breath
at all.

239
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,480
But you know,
pretty good lung capacity because I was

240
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,220
training all the time,
especially at that time,

241
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,540
the longest I could hold my breath.
That first day was like two minutes and

242
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,000
15 seconds or something like that.
And then by date,

243
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,240
the end of the day three,
I was holding it for five minutes and 34

244
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:39,590
seconds.

245
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,960
Whoa,
that's crazy.

246
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:44,510
So it's just techniques and understand
the technique.

247
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,540
What is the world record wasn't a w,
what's the fucking magician guy?

248
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,430
Didn't he break the world record like 17
minutes or something like that.

249
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,940
But yeah,
some weird where it sucked in pure

250
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:59,000
oxygen or something.
Cheating bullshit is night and day.

251
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,750
Yeah.
You can't do this twice.

252
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,130
I,
I think it gives you like,

253
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,630
um,
from,

254
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,710
from what I,
I think that's about twice as long as,

255
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,260
as like a world record holder can
actually hold their breath.

256
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,800
I think he was packing oxygen is totally
different.

257
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:16,180
He's breathing up with pure oxygen for
like a long time.

258
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,530
And it totally,
uh,

259
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,510
you know,
it's basically like,

260
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,940
it like doubles your breath hold.

261
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,931
Yeah.
There it go.

262
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,640
Seventeen minutes and four point four
seconds.

263
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,840
Bad Ass.
It's pretty incredible.

264
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,430
Even with the oxygen

265
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,290
I.
Yeah,

266
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,540
I mean no matter how,
how,

267
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,570
how you slice it,
that's a long ass time to not breathe.

268
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,730
So he held the record for oxygen
assisted static apnea between holding

269
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:43,520
your breath while breathing after
breathing pure oxygen.

270
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,970
That would be super handy for my job.
Pure oxygen,

271
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,000
being able to hold your breath for 10
minutes.

272
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,500
Fuck yeah man.
You'd be like,

273
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,540
fuck these waves,
these waves and got shit on them,

274
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,490
but I'm just going to swim to the bottom
and kick it.

275
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,130
Have you seen that product that they
came up with?

276
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,960
It's a bullshit fake product,
but apparently people have spent like a

277
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,340
million dollars on this thing trying to
buy it.

278
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,430
It's a fake.
Like a gill machine.

279
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,310
They came up with this thing that allows
you to breathe.

280
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,780
It's total bullshit.
It's fake,

281
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,250
but there was like these ads saying that
allows you to breathe underwater and it

282
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:19,910
looks like like a scuba mouthpiece,
but it's just got like.

283
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,830
It looks like two tampons on each side
and this stupid thing doesn't work at

284
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,090
all.
It doesn't do anything,

285
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,620
but apparently it's this giant scam and
there was this article about how people

286
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:35,090
have spent like all this money on this
fake thing that doesn't even exist.

287
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,510
It's crazy what people are right there.
It's absolutely nuts.

288
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,030
What people will actually buy.
This oxygen masks allows underwater

289
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:43,880
breathing without oxygen tanks,
but it's total bullshit,

290
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,010
so I don't understand where the money
went or how it see if you could find an

291
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,320
article of like what the fuck went
wrong,

292
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,010
but a bunch of to be like sucking oxygen
out of the ocean.

293
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,110
Yeah,
like how ridiculous is that?

294
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,510
Like people thought that they were fish.
Oh yeah,

295
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,750
that's all you need is this thing.
You breathe in through those and you

296
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,180
pull off to that,
but it's a total scam.

297
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,190
It's the order.
In the next 59 seconds,

298
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,290
we're going to throw a second one in for
half of the price.

299
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah,
exactly.

300
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,400
I mean it would be cool if someone could
come up with something like that,

301
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,940
but that's just not how it works.
It is bizarre though that there are

302
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,640
things that breathe air out of the
water.

303
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,550
They can find a way to suck air out of
the water,

304
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,180
like,
yeah,

305
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,610
life is very bizarre if you look at it
that way.

306
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,000
Very bizarre.
And then you pull them onto the deck of

307
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,910
the boat and they're like,
yeah.

308
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,280
And then you put us under water.
The opposite.

309
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,870
We start panicking immediately.

310
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,190
So the shark thing,
what did they tribute it to?

311
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,960
Anything.
The reason why they're inviting more

312
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,450
people lately.
Yeah,

313
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,990
it's super debatable though,
you know,

314
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,110
like a global warming type thing.
Yeah.

315
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,680
There's all types of stuff like that.
There's,

316
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,590
you know,
there's a lot less fish than it used to

317
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:51,910
be.
And then the other thing is,

318
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,330
you know,
the thing I think is a,

319
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,880
is a huge component is,
is that going to sixties,

320
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,180
if someone got bit,
they would do a short call,

321
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,040
like they,
like people will get pissed,

322
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,410
you know,
some little girl get bit and then all

323
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:04,270
the fishing boats to go out and kill a
ton of sharks.

324
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,250
And that's what happened in Hawaii.
You know,

325
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,930
there was,
I think in the sixties there was,

326
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,310
there was some shark attacks and um,
there was a huge shark cold,

327
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,630
like people would just go out and kill
as many sharks they could.

328
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,430
And so it decimated the shark
populations in Hawaii and then,

329
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,640
and then they were,
and then they were protected in the

330
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:25,180
seventies and eighties.
So now there's this mega shark shark

331
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,260
population because they're protected,
you know,

332
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,450
you're not really supposed to kill
sharks.

333
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,570
So there's an over abundance of big
sharks.

334
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,990
I wonder if people would be the same if
there was dragons,

335
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,540
would we protect dragons?
We're,

336
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,910
we're required.
We really are retarded for sure.

337
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,760
We would hundred percent like,
you're not going to wipe out the fucking

338
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,680
sharks folks.
Just relax.

339
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,980
Skill kill them all around where people
are.

340
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,780
Yeah,
it's,

341
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,140
it's,
it's crazy that they figured out like,

342
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,380
you know,
any technology for every single thing,

343
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,940
but they don't have some sort of,
you know,

344
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,040
I was,
I was thinking it'd be so,

345
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,363
you know,
with,

346
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,390
in this day and age,
like we can do the craziest shit with

347
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:01,930
technology.

348
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,890
Like why can't they put buoys around a
surf break with like some weird magnetic

349
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,190
thing that shoots down to the bottom of
the ocean at that,

350
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,180
you know what it's like 30 feet deep,
you know,

351
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:14,380
like half a mile out from the break and
then everyone can swim there.

352
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:16,000
Everyone can serve their whatever the
hell it is.

353
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,580
Like how come they don't have.
That seems so basic.

354
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,210
It does seem like something they could
figure out how to do like some sort of

355
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:27,211
an electronic fence that keeps them out.
Like they have that for your dog.

356
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,100
Yeah.
Can put that on your yard and the dog

357
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,380
can't go past it.
But it'll probably give you dick cancer.

358
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,790
You know,
they'll probably find out,

359
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,480
you know,
all these surfers and start getting Dick

360
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,230
Cancer.
And everybody went,

361
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,240
what the fuck off the fence.
The fence.

362
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,400
Every cat.
Yeah.

363
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,080
Can put up the magnetic fence because
all the sharks,

364
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,470
all the sharks or get cancer and then
yeah,

365
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,860
for Sharks get Dick Cancer.
Then Peta would get upset.

366
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,030
He came over to

367
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,770
become a huge issue.
I'm not a fan of sharks.

368
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,290
I don't like them.
They scare the fuck out of me and that's

369
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,220
what's keeping me from surfing.
Surfing looks like it's fucking awesome.

370
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,450
I see guys like you on those big waves.
If I don't know about the big ways that

371
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,780
that's beyond me.
I believe it.

372
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,590
Even when I was young,
I don't think I ever like this,

373
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,870
this kind of shit that's not.
I'm not designed for that.

374
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,850
It's not fun looking.
Nope,

375
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,520
that's not me.
We're looking at a fee for people who

376
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:22,190
are listening will look at an image.
Is that you?

377
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,940
Who's.
Who is that?

378
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,670
That's me.
Well,

379
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,380
Jesus,
dude,

380
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,260
tell me about this.
Looks like I'm falling off the building.

381
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,160
Falling off several buildings stacked on
top of each other.

382
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,420
That,
that,

383
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,760
that

384
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,700
actual number right there.
I actually felt like I was falling off a

385
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,960
building.
I was absolutely sure I was eating shit

386
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:40,794
right there.
So.

387
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,551
And you didn't.
Um,

388
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:42,211
I didn't.
Yeah,

389
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,730
it was a miracle.
I actually fell from the top and landed

390
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:47,130
on my board and made the wave.
And there's a big wave at a,

391
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,560
at a wave,
uh,

392
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:51,090
off the north coast of Maui called jaws.
Now,

393
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,620
how high is that wave?
Probably 50 feet on the face,

394
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,300
maybe,
maybe more.

395
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,343
Maybe 60.

396
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,900
So you're falling off the top of the
wave,

397
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:05,770
like it breaks and you're coming over
the lip or the,

398
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,140
what would you call it?
What do you call the edge of the wave?

399
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,093
Yeah,
yeah,

400
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,590
yeah.
I'm falling from the lip.

401
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,870
But the cool thing is you're doing it
with your hands.

402
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:13,980
You know,
like you're doing it with your bare

403
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:16,320
hands.
Like this wave comes in and you have to

404
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:17,610
read the wave.
You have to time it,

405
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:21,180
you have to position yourself so you
have to catch it in the steepest part

406
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,170
right before it throws over like that
because he could throw it over you eat

407
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,560
and shit.
So you know,

408
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:27,750
you gotta it's just,
it's so precise,

409
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,610
you know,
it'd be able to tighten it on a giant

410
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:31,410
wave like that.
Especially like the bigger the wave is,

411
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:33,540
the faster it moves.
So it gets really,

412
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,510
really technical and so you know,
a few successfully ride one of those

413
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:37,530
ways.
It's a lot of fun.

414
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,260
I would imagine.
It gets super addictive when you're in

415
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:42,480
that tube.
And you're slicing through it and you

416
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:43,690
see the water.
Oh yeah.

417
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,590
Going over the top of you.
Yeah,

418
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,630
it is.
It is

419
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,940
so much fun.
It's like,

420
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,420
um,
it is,

421
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:50,530
it's such a blast.
It's,

422
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,510
um,
it's super addicting.

423
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,344
I,
you know,

424
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,630
I've been surfing since I was,
I've been surfing on,

425
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,070
on a surfboard standing up since I was
five on my surfboard from my dad.

426
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:03,100
And um,
I'm still totally obsessed with it.

427
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:05,220
It's weird.
There's nothing else in my life like

428
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,320
that where I'm absolutely psyched.
Like when the waves are good,

429
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,970
I'm,
I'm like a little kid still.

430
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,210
What is it about it,
dude?

431
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,320
It's like,
it's like hunting.

432
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,410
It really is.
It's like I'm out in nature.

433
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,700
No one's bothering me.
I don't need to talk to anybody.

434
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:21,190
I can go do my own thing.
I can go down the beach no matter how

435
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:23,230
shitty of a day I had,
no matter how much stress,

436
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,390
whatever,
like if my kids getting a bad report

437
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,670
card or I had to pay my taxes or
whatever the hell it was,

438
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,370
I can put on my trunks,
dragged down to the beach,

439
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,400
grab my board and I'm good.
I'm soon as I hit the water,

440
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,470
I'm fine and it.
And that's how I am a bowhunting and

441
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,290
people who don't bowhunt,
they don't understand that.

442
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,640
They're like,
why the hell would you do that?

443
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,930
Like what do you,
what do you find,

444
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,801
you know,
like,

445
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,740
what do you find good about that?
Like being out in the forest for days at

446
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:46,030
a time.
It's the same thing.

447
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,750
Well obviously I've never served,
but the bowhunting thing is so difficult

448
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,840
and so primal and I think it hits some
weird ancient switches inside your dna

449
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:00,420
from back when people needed a bow and
Arrow to survive.

450
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,940
And when you were hunting an animal it.
I mean it's,

451
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,520
it's also,
it's so primitive.

452
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,550
Like there's something about rifle
hunting that's not nearly as satisfying.

453
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,490
Rifle hunting is.
It's all exciting and it's,

454
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,390
it's way more effective and you
certainly have you.

455
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,130
You'll have more success and there's
more range to it,

456
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,320
but it's not nearly the same feeling.
There's a switch that goes off that I

457
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:26,610
think is like a part of being a human
being from the thousands of years of us

458
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,010
shooting bows and arrows at things to
stay alive.

459
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:29,850
That,
that,

460
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,720
that reward is like triggered somehow or
another deep inside.

461
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,490
Whatever it is that makes you a person.

462
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,630
Yeah,
it is.

463
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,080
I mean it's,
you know,

464
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,340
it all comes down to the moment of truth
that you worked so hard for that

465
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,610
opportunities,
whatever it is and elk or deer or

466
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:46,800
whatever the hell it is and,
and you bust your ass and you're on your

467
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,130
hands and knees in the hot sun or you
know you're over there freezing your ass

468
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:53,150
off in the dark waiting for.
They get to get light and a pack your

469
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,030
shit from the trail head for miles and
all this hard work and all the thousands

470
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,500
of arrows.
You shoot your target and all of a

471
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:01,920
sudden it comes down to this this
millisecond where the elk stops in front

472
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:05,850
of you and you're sitting there full,
drawn and it's like the moment of truth,

473
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,220
you know,
it's super technical and really

474
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,890
difficult and a lot of people suck at it
and that's why it's so rad.

475
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,720
Yeah,
it's very technical and that is

476
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:16,990
something that I just never took into
account when I saw people shooting bows

477
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:17,530
and arrows.
Like,

478
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,910
oh,
he left arm straight.

479
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,860
You right on pulls back.
You make sure you aim,

480
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:23,980
you let it go and seems like Kinda like
a rifle,

481
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,270
you know,
with a rifle.

482
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:26,980
What do you do?
You sent her the radical,

483
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,050
you know,
you squeeze the trigger and make sure

484
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,340
you don't jerk it.
You're good.

485
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,870
Yeah.
There's so much more involved in the

486
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,480
anchoring of where the string hits the
corner of your mouth,

487
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:42,280
where your hand rest below your jaw,
making sure that your elbows not too

488
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,020
low,
not too high,

489
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:45,770
your back muscles are pulling

490
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,560
and remembering all that stuff in the
moment.

491
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,780
Yeah,
and getting to full draw.

492
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,330
That is the hard part.
That's the big difference,

493
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:52,870
you know,
I mean that's,

494
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,050
I mean that's the main difference is
once that animal's in range,

495
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,740
you still have to get to full draw.
Yeah.

496
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,650
And you're not sitting there like this
wedding without making any motion.

497
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:07,651
You actually have to go full draw and
somehow do that undetected without the

498
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,660
animal getting alert or freaked out or
running away.

499
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,750
Yeah.
It's a crazy little addiction,

500
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,700
isn't it?
It is very,

501
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
very crazy.
And it's also,

502
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,000
I was,
my wife would agree with you.

503
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,840
Mine went to,
um,

504
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,050
I was watching a video of you,
uh,

505
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,400
you were grilling some steaks,
some,

506
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:27,210
uh,
I think it was access deer at your

507
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,090
house.
And you,

508
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,090
when you were talking about it like
this,

509
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,400
like the connection that you have to
your food,

510
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,060
like you went and you found that animal,
you know,

511
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,660
that is a wild animal.
That animal was just living like they'd

512
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:42,080
been living for hundreds of thousands of
years.

513
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:45,240
Just eating grasses and staying away
from predators.

514
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,020
Snuck up on it and you place an hour
right

515
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,550
in his vitals perfectly and cut it up
and brought it home.

516
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:55,480
And now you're eating it and there's
this insane connection to your food when

517
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:56,770
you do something like that.
Yeah.

518
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,480
Well,
especially when you look around,

519
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:02,290
your family's eating in like my key.
I have little kids and they're sitting

520
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:06,550
there with deer on their fork eating it.
Like Dad brought this home is awesome.

521
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,840
I think it's cool.
You know,

522
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:09,810
like I dunno,
I,

523
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,880
there's just something so much more
satisfying about eating food that you

524
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,670
grew or killed or whatever it was.
You know what I mean?

525
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,210
I,
it's,

526
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,380
it's,
it's so cool.

527
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:19,390
When someone has an awesome garden that
their house,

528
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,680
they busted their ass and they'd know
exactly where that food came from.

529
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,400
It only touched their hands.
You know,

530
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,240
it's the same thing and it's even,
it's even more so when you're,

531
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,550
when you spend all that time in the
mountains and,

532
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,160
and you know,
you bring it home and you care for that

533
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,650
meet and make sure it's not dirty and
make sure it's not spoiled and make sure

534
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:36,850
it's taken care of perfectly.

535
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,490
Like you'd go in my,
in my freezer and I'm like a total.

536
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm a,
I'm actually kind of a slob and a lot of

537
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:45,130
like different areas of my life,
like I don't make my bed a lot of times

538
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,710
or whatever it is,
but now when it comes to the meat,

539
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,450
it's like perfect.
Total nerd alert,

540
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,250
go in.
It's like everything's packaged

541
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,810
perfectly.
Everything's a perfect size.

542
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,700
Everything's,
everything's itemized,

543
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,070
cut date,
animal species,

544
00:21:57,071 --> 00:22:00,010
you know?
Well there's a deep respect for that

545
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:02,950
animal data.
Don't tell people who just buy their

546
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,780
meat at a grocery store.
It's,

547
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,250
I don't think they could ever understand
it.

548
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:09,460
I think you can kind of intellectualize
it and you can kind of imagine what it's

549
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,840
like,
but I don't think you could ever really

550
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,880
understand it.
Well,

551
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,080
and I can relate to that because that
wasn't always a hunter and I,

552
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,000
I wasn't,
I wasn't.

553
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,530
I wasn't brought up a hunter.
I didn't,

554
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,850
I didn't come from a hunting family.
Nobody in my family ever hunted all new

555
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:24,340
to me.
I started when I was 30 and I'm 43.

556
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,340
So what was it that got you going?
I moved from the,

557
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,040
from the beach where I lived my whole
life up to the mountains and um,

558
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,820
I bought a piece of property and
everything I planted got dug up by wild

559
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,100
pigs,
so there's wild boars all over the

560
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:41,130
property and my wife started getting
pissed and,

561
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,450
and,
and I didn't know what to do.

562
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,550
I wanted to plant fruit trees and all
this stuff and everything was getting

563
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,230
knocked over and smashed by all the
pigs.

564
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,360
And so my buddy was like,
dude,

565
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:51,450
shoot him with a gun and shoot a couple
and they,

566
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,450
you know,
they'll beat it.

567
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,270
And so he gave me this shotgun or
whatever.

568
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,450
I shot with a shotgun and immediately
gave it back to him and I was like,

569
00:22:58,451 --> 00:22:59,870
I'm not a gun guy.
I just,

570
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,010
I'm not into the loud noises.
And I just was over it.

571
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,140
So I gave it back.
I didn't know what to do.

572
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,080
I didn't know if I should need a fence.
My property.

573
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,080
I didn't want to do that,
you know,

574
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,590
because I didn't want to like mess up.
They're like natural pattern either.

575
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,890
They were there,
they were there long before I was and

576
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,310
um,
and my next door neighbor was a bow

577
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,110
hunter.
He had an extra bowl so I would go over

578
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:23,860
to his house and have a couple beers and
shoot arrows and once I get group some

579
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,200
arrows,
he said I was ready to go hunting and he

580
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:30,400
took me boar hunting and the first night
all these pays were there and,

581
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,170
and I,
and I totally blew it.

582
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,960
I got to full draw and my Arrow fell off
the rest and thing and all,

583
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,930
they all,
they all ran and made a bunch of noise.

584
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,540
But that was it.
The next day I went and bought it.

585
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,830
I used mathews bow down at the bottom
down at the boat shop and you know,

586
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,960
I started a building trees,
downs about my house and you know,

587
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,860
trying to like throw down for the pigs
to come.

588
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:55,190
I didn't know the hell I was doing.
I didn't know any bowhunters and um,

589
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,890
so it's cool.
So it's all like self taught.

590
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,330
It was,
yeah,

591
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,040
it,
uh,

592
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,310
you know,
I started with a good friend of mine at

593
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:04,700
home at the same time I didn't really
have any super close friends that were

594
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,070
bow hunters and.
But it's funny because soon after I

595
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,620
started bowhunting,
then I realized that I did know a bunch

596
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:13,610
of bowhunters and I immediately had a
really cool circle of friends that were

597
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:17,360
all experienced bowhunters and they kind
of took me in and taught me,

598
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,351
you know,
what to do,

599
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:20,630
what equipment to use and you know,
how to hunt.

600
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,970
And then,
and then I had like mentors in hunting

601
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,610
that really taught me how to hunt,
like to kill animals.

602
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,350
Well,
Hawaii is an amazing place for bow

603
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:30,350
hunting and a lot of people would never
imagined this.

604
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,360
It is amazing between axis deer and
mountain goats and all kinds of other

605
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:39,380
crazy shit that you guys and the pig
popular pigs were brought over there.

606
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,440
I'm like hundreds and hundreds of years
ago.

607
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:42,920
Right?
Yeah.

608
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,700
Is the captain cook thing wasn't.
Yeah.

609
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,780
So there was.
So there wasn't really no animals in

610
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:51,920
Hawaii.
Every single thing there is introduced

611
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:53,900
except for like bugs and some birds,
you know,

612
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:55,580
so um,
the deer,

613
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,420
the pigs,
the goats,

614
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,040
the sheep,
everything was all introduced.

615
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:02,120
So you go out in the mountains and
there's lots and lots of different,

616
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,610
you know,
a lot of different animals out there and

617
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,500
they're all introducing,
they're all considered pests.

618
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,000
Wow.
So it's a lot like New Zealand and that

619
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:12,470
sort of a way that is new.
New Zealand has an incredible amount of

620
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,800
wild game,
but it's all introduced and they did it

621
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:20,240
back hundreds of years ago again when
Europeans wanted it as a hunting

622
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:23,120
destination.
So they brought over stags and European

623
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:27,020
animals and access deer and all these
things and just let them loose with no

624
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:28,010
predators.
Yeah,

625
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,830
that's right.
So their populations just exploded.

626
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah.
I mean you came in Hawaii.

627
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,280
What is it?
What is it like over New Zealand?

628
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:36,170
Because when you look at the Lord of the
rings,

629
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,041
you know,
that's,

630
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,100
that's all I know about new New Zealand.
I know Kim Dotcom lives there and the

631
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,870
Lord of the rings and people go over
there to hunt.

632
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,790
It's very much like that,
uh,

633
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,310
um,
I hunted there this year and we hunted

634
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,200
in some places that like I hadn't even
done.

635
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,010
All I do is I take pictures and stare at
the mountains.

636
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,890
It was,
it was mind boggling how incredibly

637
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,110
beautiful it was.
We were hunting these,

638
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,860
these,
uh,

639
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,280
these mountain goats called tar from the
Himalayas there,

640
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:06,300
these hairy goats with this big giant
sable for thing and really small horns

641
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,770
and they live and they liked these
glaciers and he's like vertical cliffs,

642
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,640
maybe like a thousand foot cliff at the
top of like a 5,000 foot mountain of

643
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,660
granite cliff,
like a little step ledge in it that's

644
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,910
like six inches wide.
And that's where the tar would be

645
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,930
standing.
One Star.

646
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,290
Just be standing there looking at all
the other bad ass creatures.

647
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,960
They really don't look real.
Try and go kill one of those things with

648
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,380
a ball on public land and sent me the
picture and all the hail you forever.

649
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,330
They are hard to kill with a bow.

650
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,920
I tell you that much.
Did you get one?

651
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,510
I didn't.
I saw one.

652
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,330
I was at remy who's a friend of yours,
right?

653
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,350
Yeah,
yeah.

654
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:41,790
It was a Ramey warrant and we spotted
one and it's not like,

655
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,160
you know,
like where I come from.

656
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,250
You go hunt access deer.
You could see a thousand deer walk in

657
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,360
the morning.
Yes.

658
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,380
Where mark my words dude soon.
I'm online.

659
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:56,310
I hold dear in a day.
Yeah,

660
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,570
that's insane.
So I'm used to going out and seeing them

661
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:00,990
like tons of pigs and goats and deer and
stuff like that.

662
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,900
I went to,
I went to New Zealand and hunted these

663
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,320
tar and I'm standing there with remy,
the bottom of this valley and we're

664
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,750
hunting or camping in the back country
and we're,

665
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,690
you know,
we're glassing and don't see anything.

666
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:15,400
So we drive like half a mile glass,
you know,

667
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,980
and we're in totally in the background.

668
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,010
She went weren't driving straight up a
river like deep in a river.

669
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:20,940
We got like a,
like a,

670
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,810
a,
one of those like land cruisers with a

671
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,790
snorkel in the middle of the floor.
It's not like these animals are under

672
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:30,450
radical pressure and
all of a sudden we see one,

673
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,240
there's a tar and it's at the top of
this mountain.

674
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:38,241
5,000 vertical feet,
five miles straight up hill or one mile,

675
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,420
right.
Well,

676
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:41,090
I don't know,
whatever the hell it was was vertical.

677
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,180
It's vertical,
right?

678
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,910
Yeah.
I mean it's 5,000 vertical feet,

679
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,070
but you're looking at it and it looks
like it's right there,

680
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:50,430
but it's vert right.
It takes you four hours to walk there

681
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,120
because it's vertical.
And uh,

682
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,650
you know,
we saw it probably we saw it at like

683
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,980
three in the afternoon and it got dark
at like six.

684
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,061
So he's like,
dude,

685
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:02,520
we have three hours.
We need to close the gap.

686
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,820
We need to kill that tar today before
dark.

687
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,870
So we're literally like,
quote unquote running up the mountain

688
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,650
as fast as you possibly could.
And he's in pretty good shape.

689
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:13,820
Remy is,
he's a beast.

690
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,781
He's a beast.
He's,

691
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:15,471
I mean,
that's what he does.

692
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:17,660
He lives in the mountains all the time.
So He's used to that.

693
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,180
He's like,
they did one of those vo two Max test on

694
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:23,430
him and he's got like elite triathlon
endurance.

695
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,650
Yeah.
He's like half human,

696
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:26,920
half tar and uh,
so.

697
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:31,921
So we closed the gap to about 900 yards
and then it got dark time and walk back

698
00:28:32,301 --> 00:28:35,660
down five hours in the dark.
Well,

699
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:39,140
it's fucking exhausting.
Is proposing you don't realize like how

700
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:42,590
hard it is to get up one of those
mountains until you try it and you go,

701
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,570
oh,
like you think I'm in good shape.

702
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:45,710
I work out,
I go to the gym,

703
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,950
I'm on the elliptical machine.
This is going to be a no problem.

704
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,020
I'm not one of these fat guys.
Oh yeah,

705
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,990
no,
no.

706
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,900
It's fucking hard.
It's really hard.

707
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,400
Like any it'll help.
Like being light helps to light and thin

708
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,900
where you're not carrying around a lot
of weight.

709
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,060
Yeah.
But guys like remy and Steven Rinella

710
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:07,570
and the guys that do that all the time,
they will embarrass you with how will

711
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,250
out of shape.
You are just walking up hills.

712
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,840
You're just,
you're just,

713
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,920
you're just keeping them at a,
you know,

714
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,390
at your rate.
It's like,

715
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,330
it's like you're slowing them down all
the time.

716
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,600
Yeah.
So it does pay to,

717
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,351
you know,
to train.

718
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:22,730
Especially like in the mountains like
that.

719
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:24,000
Like if you're going to go on a big hunt
it,

720
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,630
it really helps to train a lot and now
these animals,

721
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,260
how the fuck,
like I've seen goats like on the side of

722
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:33,670
cliffs where they're walking along a
vertical face and they're,

723
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,400
they're standing on the little,
like these little two inch outcroppings

724
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,670
and they're walking along on those.
Like how the fuck do they do that?

725
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:41,860
Like how were they designed?

726
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,910
Like what,
what kind of evolutionary advantage to

727
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:50,911
like walking along the side of a cliff
face like that has led them to be this

728
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:54,460
bizarre beast.
Like most people don't think about them

729
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,720
like what their capabilities are and
they can do like really strange shit.

730
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,500
I get as far as if they're balanced and
how they can make it up the side of a

731
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,760
cliff.
Like look at these fuckers.

732
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,391
Yeah,
look,

733
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:06,470
look at that as exactly how the tar.
Where did.

734
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,160
We're looking at something that just
doesn't even look real.

735
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,900
We're looking at these goats that are
walking along the face of this cliff and

736
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:18,790
the cliff is almost 90 degrees.
It's almost up and down and these things

737
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,550
are somehow or another finding
footholds,

738
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,660
whether their whole body,
like the side of their body is slammed

739
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:29,350
up against the side of the mountain and
they're making it up this cliff

740
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,000
and they're not forced to be on that
cliff.

741
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,190
That's the craziest thing.
Like when I,

742
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,430
when I was hunting those,
those,

743
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,670
those,
those goats in New Zealand and star just

744
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,430
below where they were,
there was like these rolling hills,

745
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:43,190
like really steep still,
but it was rolling hills with grass.

746
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,030
They choose to be on the rocks because
they actually eat some weird stuff that

747
00:30:47,031 --> 00:30:50,180
grows on those vertical cliffs.
So wild.

748
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,300
What are they ripping balls the whole
time.

749
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,700
I'd be kidding me.
The animal's not forced to be there.

750
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,160
He's.
He's choosing to be on that like six

751
00:30:58,161 --> 00:31:00,980
Inch Wide Ledge,
a thousand feet on a vertical cliff.

752
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,270
Oh,
look at that fucking.

753
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:03,910
But we're looking at this picture folks.
Jamie,

754
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,850
what was the Google search?
If someone's listening just like

755
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,070
climbing goat.
This is this picture that we're looking

756
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:14,060
at now,
there's probably like eight of them

757
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,090
and they're on the side of this mountain
and it just doesn't even look real and

758
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,760
the tar does,
they don't look real as it is.

759
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,960
They look like some sort of a mythical
creature from some ancient Greek novel.

760
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,600
Yeah,
it's hard.

761
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:31,170
It's hard to.
It's really hard to appreciate how hard

762
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:33,070
core that kind of hunting is unless you
do it,

763
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,830
you know?
I think that like 90,

764
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,250
I,
I'm gonna I'm gonna Piss people off when

765
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:43,320
I say this,
but like 98 percent of the hunting that

766
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,470
happens in America is like park a truck,
walked to your trees,

767
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Dan getting the trees.
Dan play play words with friends until

768
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:54,920
the deer comes underneath the trees,
down to full draw and,

769
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,360
and you know,
you got your tag filled and which is

770
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,890
great.
I'm sure it's a blast and I like dress

771
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:03,590
downs and all that stuff,
but that kind of hunting is just like a.

772
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,100
it's weird how hunting is at,
clumped in to like,

773
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,113
oh,
you're a hunter.

774
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,380
And as all people sort of need to know,
you know,

775
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,640
there's like so many different kinds of
hunting and so many different ways to do

776
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:13,361
it,
different weapons,

777
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:14,440
different approaches,
different.

778
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,490
You know,
it's like crazy.

779
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:18,720
Like some people are shooting animals
that had 100,

780
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,490
1500 yards of though with high powered
rifles,

781
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,790
they want to be as far as possible,
that's the goal.

782
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,980
And for us it's like we want to be as
close as possible

783
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,130
that that long range stuff is very
strange because there's a lot of ethical

784
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:37,141
questions that come up with that because
any movement whatsoever at 1500 yards,

785
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:42,470
I mean you have to be like a real
fucking expert marksman to pull

786
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,910
something like that off.
So there's this,

787
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,500
there's a lot of Dick Wagon going on
when you're killing something like 700,

788
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:51,080
800 a thousand yards.
It's weird.

789
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,000
It's like you don't really have to do
that.

790
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,950
Like you could get closer to that
animal.

791
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,510
I think that's the goal though.
The goal is to fight.

792
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,280
Anybody can get to 200 yards from any
animal.

793
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,660
Yeah.
I don't care what animal it is.

794
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,790
You can get,
if you can get to 200 yards,

795
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:07,160
you got major problems if you didn't get
to 100 yards.

796
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,620
I mean even from like an antelope.
Yeah.

797
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,060
You can belly crawl your way in

798
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,140
middle of nowhere to 100 yards from
antelope.

799
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,820
Yeah.
Especially if you have one of those

800
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:18,220
Ghillie suits.
You know remy has this show called move

801
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:19,760
super slow.
Yeah.

802
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,780
Have you seen remy show?
It's called Apex Predator.

803
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,000
Haven't seen that one though.
Really good show and it's really

804
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:28,870
interesting because remy remy is a
really good athlete and he's also just a

805
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:33,871
really smart guy and what he does is he
tries to mimic all of the behavior of

806
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:38,911
predatory animals like wolves and he'll
do like him and a bunch of his friends

807
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:44,980
were doing some sort of like a chase the
same way that a wolf would chase down an

808
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:49,210
elk and one of the things that he did
was he put on a Ghillie suit and he

809
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:54,190
crawled up to these antelope and just
slowly creeped is way up to these

810
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:56,830
antelope and as long as you're patient
and you move slow,

811
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:59,920
like he got within like seven feet of
fuckin antelope,

812
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,540
as long as you go slow enough.

813
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,060
Yeah.
That's a mistake I make all the time.

814
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,590
You know,
when I blow stock,

815
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,630
it's almost always because I went too
fast.

816
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,020
No matter how slow you go,
you should almost

817
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,760
always go slower and well.
One of the things that I've found out

818
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,240
recently,
you know Randy Ulmer is famous

819
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,770
bowhunter.
It's like probably one of the most

820
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:21,640
successful bowhunters ever.
He shoots most of his animals with no

821
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:23,200
shoes on his.
He,

822
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,600
yeah,
he takes his boots off and he's got just

823
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:29,590
thick wool socks and he just walks you
just correct

824
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,210
the

825
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,530
nice and slow.
And that's one of the reasons why he's

826
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,000
so successful.
He realized like,

827
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,800
okay,
you can't just be walking around with

828
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:40,890
these fucking clunky boots and snap and
twigs and shit like that.

829
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:44,520
And so he feels everything underneath
them and it's just like.

830
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,040
Have you ever been around a bear like
when a bear is walking through the

831
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,480
woods?
Uh,

832
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:49,201
no,
not really.

833
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:51,510
They don't make any noise.
It's kind of creepy.

834
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,370
Like this big ass fucking 300 pound bear
and it's not making a single sound as

835
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:59,730
it's walking because they have soft pads
and the predators.

836
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,950
So they just fucking,

837
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:02,840
I've

838
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,120
been,
you know,

839
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,600
and that's kind of like the idea of the
approach,

840
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,610
just just creep inch by inch.
Bears blow my mind too because you know,

841
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,990
I've,
you know,

842
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:16,620
I'm from Hawaii so I don't even know
anything,

843
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,180
nothing about bears.
So I think they're all like Yogi bear,

844
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,150
you know,
like they're coming in like your,

845
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,470
your jam and hang out and camp with you
know this,

846
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,090
you know,
they want a hug or something like that.

847
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,760
And,
and a man,

848
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:31,740
I went hunting,
I did a do it yourself over the counter

849
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:36,160
tag elk hunt with my buddy from Hawaii
and we were in Colorado and we're and we

850
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,460
and we hiked into area and we're all
excited and we don't,

851
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,310
we didn't know shit about elk hunting.
I did not call him.

852
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:43,500
I didn't know what they did.
I didn't know how they worked.

853
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,560
I read some articles,
I didn't know what the hell is going on.

854
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,770
So.
And so we dropped off our stuff.

855
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,120
We've got about an hour to hunt and then
we're gonna come back and set up our,

856
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,130
our,
our,

857
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,700
our little camp there,
like a creek.

858
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,370
So I do a big loop.
I come back a little bit early.

859
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:59,940
I'm not going to set up my tent and
stuff and I get to one side of the creek

860
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:03,100
and my friends across the creek setting
up his tent and getting like,

861
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,870
like our food out like Salami and like
whatever else kind of food we had

862
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,560
and I was just about to like yell out to
him like,

863
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:13,320
hey did you see anything?
I was like maybe 60 yards away from him

864
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,840
and I looked to my left and there's a
bear,

865
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,560
a big bear,
big black bear standing on his hind legs

866
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,950
look like one of those targets.
He knows big old target to shoot one of

867
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,720
those things and he was just staring at
my friend.

868
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,160
He had no idea was there.
The bear didn't know I was there and

869
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,340
that my friend had no idea that the bear
was there.

870
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,430
He's sitting there like butt crack
hanging out,

871
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:34,560
like getting all the food out and its
barest just staring out from across the

872
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:37,830
creek.
It was radical and I just immediately

873
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,330
knocked in Arrow and just sat there and
then the bear saw me and then looked at

874
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:43,500
my friend,
looked at me,

875
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,380
looked at my friend,
and then it was this vertical mountain

876
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:49,530
right behind him.
We at the bottom of the creek and a bear

877
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,440
thought about it and then just turned
around and just hightail it straight up

878
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:57,200
this mountain like he was on the flat
ground was crazy and my friend saw that

879
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,360
story that you were telling me before
the podcast started.

880
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,790
Tell that fucking story.
That made me really even more scared of

881
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,624
bears.

882
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,040
Tell.
Tell that story.

883
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,490
Yeah,
so it was a few years ago.

884
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,980
I read this,
I read this story on a bowhunting

885
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,190
magazine and it was a story about this,
this guy and his son,

886
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,680
and they were hunting elk,
not sure which state,

887
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,650
but I'm.
The son was in the front and he was set

888
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:26,400
up and the dad was in the back probably
60 yards back and the dad was cow

889
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:28,860
calling and there was a bowl there and
he was starting to.

890
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,090
He was starting to come into the call
and so the kid was standing there

891
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:35,300
waiting for his shot and the dad was
sitting there,

892
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:40,110
cal calling behind them and all of a
sudden the elk runs off and they thought

893
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:41,880
the wind had waffled on him or
something,

894
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,110
and right behind the elk,
like 50 yards past the elc was a giant

895
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:51,060
grizzly bear standing straight up
staring at him and the kids started

896
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:51,630
getting nervous.

897
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,220
The bear started hightailing it straight
up the kid and the kid turned and

898
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:59,460
started running it.
The Dad and as the kid and the and the

899
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,110
dad went to full draw.
He had a bow.

900
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,010
It was.
It was.

901
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,480
It was archery season.
He had no gun,

902
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,360
so the dad grabbed his bow,
got an Erewhon,

903
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,740
had somehow had the clarity to get to
full draw.

904
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:15,330
As the kid passed his dad,
the dad made a perfect shot on the bear.

905
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,760
The bear right then catches up to the
kid,

906
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:22,590
dives on the kid and starts mauling him
and ends up dying on the kid and there

907
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,600
was a picture in the article is
incredible.

908
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,560
There's a picture in the magazine of the
kid and he's covered,

909
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,120
covered head to toe in blood.
The bear died on him like a heart shot.

910
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,090
Blood all over him for the kid like bear
blood.

911
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,870
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

912
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,220
Just the Olympics.
What is,

913
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,420
um,
how do you find this,

914
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,550
Jamie?
If somebody wants to call Dad,

915
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,210
dad's zero saved son from grizzly attack
to outdoor life.

916
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,030
Fuck is a heavy article man.
It's no joke.

917
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:52,864
And the,
and the,

918
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,790
and the perspective from the dad,
you know,

919
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,930
it's like,
can you imagine?

920
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,823
I mean,
I have,

921
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,690
I have kids and I can't even imagine
like what kind of mental state you'd be

922
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,390
in if you saw a giant bear chasing after
your kid.

923
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,700
It does a bad motherfucker to keep it
together.

924
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,790
Yeah.
That gives me the nerves,

925
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,590
the jellies,
whatever the fuck it is.

926
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,600
My,
my goosebumps are popping up.

927
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,620
I saw a grizzly when I was in Alberta.
Black bear hunting a couple of weeks

928
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,150
ago.
They look at you.

929
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:22,540
So different than black bears are creepy
enough,

930
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,550
you know.
And uh,

931
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,480
Rinella was telling me a story about
this guy who first trip ever hunting

932
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,860
gets attacked in his tent by a 500 pound
predatory black bear.

933
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,670
His friend shoots the bear,
the bullet goes through the bear and

934
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:39,070
hits his friend in the wrist.
So this kid,

935
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,310
first,
first black bear hunt ever first camping

936
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:44,440
trip out is going in the woods.
Like this is going to regroup.

937
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,940
We're gonna.
Get to hang out with nature.

938
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,340
Bear tries to eat him.
And his friend shoots him.

939
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,920
They killed the bear.
They wanted to kill him.

940
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,900
The bear.
But black bears are scary,

941
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:56,800
but they're nothing like grizzlies.
This grizzly looked at us and they look

942
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:58,710
at you like demons.
They're there.

943
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:00,790
They have a total different look in
their eye.

944
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,010
Like there's nothing going on back
there.

945
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,790
It's just dead killed.
Machines look and feel bad when they

946
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,451
can.
They eat.

947
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:11,920
You feel awesome.
Gut feel super delicious right now.

948
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,450
He'd be screaming,
great.

949
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,183
W,
W,

950
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,150
W,
W,

951
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,410
what?
People are so strange,

952
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:20,440
there are detachment from wildlife that
when you're actually around them,

953
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,950
even just around an elk,
like when you're around an elk and elk

954
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:26,050
or call and then making those crazy
sounds just like,

955
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,670
what the fuck is this real?

956
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,670
And they're fighting over the girls.
Yeah.

957
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,590
I just put that blows my mind like,
like hunting deer or elk in the Rut and

958
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:37,810
seeing them fight over the girls is the
best.

959
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,860
It's the best.
And seeing like the one that,

960
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,720
that loses gets his ass kicked and he
kinda like just walks off like,

961
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,250
oh God,
I just got my ass kicked and ended up

962
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,000
bowl.
Or the big dog who,

963
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,640
who wins?
He's on,

964
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,910
that's a whole Harem Harem full of girls
and he's just like,

965
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,070
I'm on the bad ass.
You know,

966
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,470
he just gets his fuck on man.
You can breed them all.

967
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,130
You know,
I was in California to hone ranch last

968
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,130
year and these two huge elk were
smashing horns.

969
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,510
They're both like threesixty class elk,
which is like a for people listening.

970
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,500
Just enormous antlers.
Six points on each side.

971
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Thousand pound animals just running at
each other head butting each other and

972
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:20,650
stabbing each other and uh,
while we were there they found one

973
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:23,410
enormous bowl that had been killed by
another bowl,

974
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,640
been stabbed him in the,
in the side and punctured his lungs and

975
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:32,641
it was laying there jacked enormous bull
as the coolest.

976
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,730
Seeing them like act like how they're
supposed to be in nature,

977
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,230
how they've been doing it for hundreds
of thousands,

978
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,440
millions of years.
It's just nuts to just,

979
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,100
just to be a part of that and see it.
Yeah,

980
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,200
it isn't.
It's almost like we were talking about

981
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:47,570
the goats being able to walk up the side
of these cliffs,

982
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,160
like these animals,
they,

983
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,880
they've evolved to develop horns that
are swartz.

984
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,480
They have like spears going out of their
fucking head and they know it.

985
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,870
Yeah.
They're well aware of that and they were

986
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:00,860
trying to kill the other one because
it's there.

987
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,210
So hopped up and they were just hanging
with that guy a few weeks ago.

988
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,051
Yeah.
Were hanging out,

989
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,220
feeding out in the,
in the,

990
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,080
in the grass,
and they'll hang out with him again if

991
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:09,914
he survived.
Well,

992
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,833
yeah,
they hang out,

993
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,490
but then make these bachelor groups and
they get pissed.

994
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,640
Did you see that video of the lady in
yellowstone that was like,

995
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,150
no,
no,

996
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,240
no.
Hello my friend.

997
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,740
I'm your buddy.
Oh Man.

998
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:25,780
This elk just fucking headbutts this
bitch and sends her flying.

999
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,240
She went flying.
Wow.

1000
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,500
How has that Grizzly man movie?
Do you see that thing?

1001
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,380
I've seen it about 10 times.
You don't see that you're tripping.

1002
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,330
It's so good.
I'm trying to get Werner Herzog to uh,

1003
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,290
he,
he,

1004
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,320
his people contacted me,
the director of it to be on the podcast.

1005
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,154
I'm gonna try.
Look at this.

1006
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,670
She's a kid.
Knew Mr. almost like a comedy.

1007
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,890
You know what I mean?
Like when I watched that movie,

1008
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,910
I felt like it was a comedy.
The Guys Warner please.

1009
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,163
Oh,
oh,

1010
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,220
oh,
oh.

1011
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,450
He goes,
you should get that on video.

1012
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,480
That shit's going to go find her.

1013
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:09,600
Why
45 yard,

1014
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,473
ma'am.

1015
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,230
That's been a long time.
Thank you sir.

1016
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,860
I'm totally used to these elk.
I'm out here every year.

1017
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,680
It's 25 yards.
It's funny.

1018
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:25,040
He's got like a number in his head that
you have to be 25 yards from them.

1019
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,450
Yeah.
And then you're totally safe.

1020
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,830
Yeah,
no problem.

1021
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:30,620
Super Safe.
Please did they decide 50 yards to make

1022
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:33,080
a mad dash you.
He's got a boner and this chick got

1023
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:36,710
scared off and he decides it's you that
scare off and just go spear.

1024
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:39,460
You have no problem.
Do you see the one where there's a guy

1025
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,640
was sitting on the side of the road as a
photographer is a real recent one and

1026
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:48,410
they actually had one of euthanizing the
elk because this elk fucked with this

1027
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:51,530
dude for like the videos like 10 minutes
long.

1028
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,030
They Alex.
so just like head button.

1029
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:56,640
This guy and the guy sitting there
trying to cover his head as a spike and

1030
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,660
really young bull and uh,
this,

1031
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,980
this photographers just hanging there
and this bull starts head butting him

1032
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,540
and the guys just decided to just play
passive.

1033
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,800
This is it.
Yeah.

1034
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,790
And this.
But this goes on forever,

1035
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:15,350
man.
And this bull just kind of not sure what

1036
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,690
to do because he's a really young bull.
You're looking at that bowl.

1037
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,890
A spike is like,
what a year old.

1038
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,880
It's funny how they get so smart so
quick.

1039
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,823
You know,
it's like,

1040
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,380
it's like at that age when it,
you know,

1041
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,770
once I got like a yearling bowl,
like a little spike,

1042
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,350
they're pretty stupid,
you know,

1043
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,650
they'll come to any call and they're
kind of spaced out.

1044
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:33,300
They don't really know what a human
looks like.

1045
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,210
But man,
once they turn into a six by six they

1046
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:37,290
are,
they are not dumb.

1047
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,680
They get turned on.
Yeah.

1048
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,580
But like this elk,
I think I could kill that Alco my hands.

1049
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,300
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure I have to see you try to

1050
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:46,300
get ahold of those.
Antlers are spin around.

1051
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,153
Take his back.

1052
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,870
Rear naked choke.
That's what I'm thinking.

1053
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,640
Yeah.
I'm thinking I get his back and he's

1054
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:55,200
fucking done,
man.

1055
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,770
It'd be fun.
Drive for sure.

1056
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,180
Meanwhile he would back straps and that
guy ride off with me.

1057
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,600
He would,
he would load up the barbecue.

1058
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,880
He would.
I would get her freezer.

1059
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,571
Oh yeah.
Well,

1060
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,790
those are the most delicious ones.
If you actually can,

1061
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,950
can kill one that that's really young
like that.

1062
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,980
They're really tender.
The same with deer.

1063
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,030
You know,
everybody wants to shoot,

1064
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:17,820
but this is the thing about elk.
They're so delicious that even the old

1065
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:20,080
ones,
the old tough bull,

1066
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,650
they taste amazing meat.
You can.

1067
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,290
Yeah.
It's funny because I feel like super

1068
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,300
remorseful when I get an animal on the
ground,

1069
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:29,130
no matter what it is,
no matter if it's like a,

1070
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,190
uh,
an elk or a deer or a pig or whatever.

1071
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,810
I had this weird feeling when I walk up,
I'm like,

1072
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,550
I don't,
I don't feel bad.

1073
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,510
I just feel like just as like heavy
connection with that animal,

1074
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,590
you know,
like I took his life.

1075
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:41,730
That was,
that was my choice.

1076
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,930
You know,
like I could have let it walk,

1077
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,510
but at the same time,
like if it's like a,

1078
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,730
a younger dear,
I'll smoke it,

1079
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,100
you know,
because those are really good eating.

1080
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,810
That's what I'm trying to do.
I'm out there trying to.

1081
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,100
It's funny,
I,

1082
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,950
I don't,
I don't have a list of animals in my

1083
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:58,860
head that I need to get.
Or are you one of those guys where

1084
00:45:58,861 --> 00:45:59,251
you're like,
hey,

1085
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:00,720
you know,
I need to kill them out and go,

1086
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:02,760
I need to get a stone sheep.
I need to get a zebra.

1087
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,640
And you find that weird man.
There's a,

1088
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:06,860
there's a show that I watch you ever
seen that?

1089
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,910
Uh,
Tom Miranda's adventure bowhunter show

1090
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,730
television dude.
I'm like a wookie in the mountain.

1091
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,470
You don't have a TV.
I don't have TV.

1092
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,330
Wow.
Got like Netflix on my computer.

1093
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,170
There's a lot of these guys that are
into the super slams,

1094
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,050
you know,
which means all the North American game

1095
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:25,080
animals and that just seems like a
fetish to me.

1096
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:29,310
It gets real bizarre.
Like I think you're losing sight of what

1097
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:31,900
this thing is supposed to be all about.
Yeah,

1098
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,280
I'm totally fine with however anyone.
You know,

1099
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,030
if someone's in a getting lions or
whatever,

1100
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,530
that that's,
that's their trip,

1101
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,730
you know,
I'm not going to judge them,

1102
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:41,190
but I'm just,
that's not me.

1103
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,990
I don't have a list of animals at all.
If I just hunted mule deer and elk for

1104
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:47,620
the rest of my life and access,
dear,

1105
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,420
that'd be good.
I can hunt all year long and never get

1106
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:52,830
bored with those three animals.

1107
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,770
I feel weird about bears.
Bears are the ones that weird me out the

1108
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,340
most,
like killing a bear and eating it just

1109
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,440
first of all,
it's really like one of the best

1110
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:03,900
animals.
Like from a conservation standpoint,

1111
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,780
it's one of the best animals to kill
because they don't have any predators

1112
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,270
and so if you don't kill them,
they will.

1113
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:11,370
The only thing that kills bears,
there's other bears,

1114
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,530
so they like where we hunt in Alberta,
there's a giant population.

1115
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:19,440
I mean it's not uncommon to see 20,
30 beers in a day.

1116
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,620
It's really,
really overflowing with bears and public

1117
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:23,820
service to get.
Yeah,

1118
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:27,330
like I take a few bears.
It decimates not just the moose

1119
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:29,250
population,
the deer population,

1120
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,370
but the crazy thing is it's bad for the
bear population for there to be this

1121
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:36,340
many bears because the boars eat cubs.
Daryl,

1122
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,560
weird animal,
like elk don't eat elk,

1123
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,390
but bears like they're predatory man.

1124
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,110
They just go for an easy meal.
There was an article recently that I

1125
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:48,520
posted today on twitter that they're
finding the grizzlies are going towards

1126
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:52,030
people when they have cubs and super
fucking dangerous,

1127
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:56,920
but the Mama bears are realizing that
when they're around people that the big

1128
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:00,490
boars won't kill their bed,
their cubs as much to here it is.

1129
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,850
Brown bears are using human shields to
protect their cubs,

1130
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:09,100
but it's incredibly dangerous for people
because when you're around a mama bear

1131
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:11,530
and she's got cubs,
she'll fuck you.

1132
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,940
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1133
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,980
yeah.
You don't want to get near one.

1134
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,680
There's another one that I retweeted
yesterday,

1135
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:22,090
some woman who was in a marathon.
She was running a marathon in New Mexico

1136
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,700
and she ran past a mamma bear with her
cubs.

1137
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,770
The Mama Bear,
just societal Fokker up.

1138
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,440
Just beat the shit out of her.
Cut Her up,

1139
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:31,300
ripped her apart,
and she just played dead.

1140
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,860
And uh,
you know,

1141
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:36,490
she's really jacked and picture of all
scarred up and you know,

1142
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,550
the bear left her alone.
And then some other marathon runners

1143
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,900
came over and saw her huddled up in the
fetal position off.

1144
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,030
Fucking covered with blood as a life
changer right there.

1145
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,170
Oh yeah.
Just the meat bear meat is really good.

1146
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,260
It's really good.
Yeah.

1147
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,110
Yeah.
There's a lot of misconceptions about

1148
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:53,801
bear meat.
Well,

1149
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:58,000
apparently grizzlies are nasty,
especially if you get a coastal grizzly

1150
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,970
that's all fall bears in spring bears,
right?

1151
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,620
Like the taste of them.
I heard,

1152
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:04,660
I heard the,
I forget which one,

1153
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,220
but I heard one is a little bit better
than false.

1154
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:08,950
Supposed to be the best because the fall
bears are eating berries.

1155
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:12,010
I've only killed spring bears.
Spring bears tastes really good.

1156
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,960
Yeah.
And like I was saying like from an

1157
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:16,600
ecological standpoint and from a
conservation standpoint,

1158
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:19,670
it's probably one of the most important
animals to kill other than say white

1159
00:49:19,671 --> 00:49:23,110
tail deer because there's so 2 million
or so.

1160
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,090
What is it?
What was the number like one point $5

1161
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:26,980
million car accidents in the United
States alone.

1162
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:31,270
200 people die in the United States
every year from hitting deer with their

1163
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,760
cars.
That's the thing is people are so quick

1164
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:35,920
to point the finger like,
I can't believe you'd kill a bear,

1165
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:37,660
you can't believe it,
but they just can't wrap their head

1166
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:42,010
around the fact that they need to be
those numbers get so out of control and

1167
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,550
the and the world's never going back to
how it is before we lived where the

1168
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:47,050
bears live,
you know?

1169
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,550
Right.
That argument's a weird argument.

1170
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:49,420
Yeah.
And their land.

1171
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,830
Yeah.
Like I get it,

1172
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,440
that's fine,
but it doesn't matter that point.

1173
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:57,640
It's invalid because all the people live
there and when there's millions of bears

1174
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:58,690
running around,
it's just,

1175
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,470
it's not good for them either,
you know,

1176
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,460
but even knowing that I still feel weird
when I kill a bear.

1177
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,370
It just,
there.

1178
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:09,040
There's so much like a dog almost.
They're looking at enormous big dog.

1179
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,140
It's this,
it's this.

1180
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,000
I think they're cool.
They're cool animals.

1181
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:14,830
I like looking at them.
I want to.

1182
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:16,860
I still want to hug them.
You still want to.

1183
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:18,640
What was that?
What was that show?

1184
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,340
When we were kids,
a grizzly Adams,

1185
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:22,960
grizzly Adams,
and he had that,

1186
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,450
like that was his best friend.
I want her to be grizzly Adams.

1187
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,310
So bad.
That wasn't the beard and the hat or

1188
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:30,200
anything.
I just want to hang out and spoon that

1189
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,270
bear every day.
So awesome.

1190
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,260
I had the original hipster beard.
I used to have.

1191
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,600
That guy would get so many chicks right
now in Venice.

1192
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,561
I know,
right?

1193
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,490
He went to fucking owning it.
Yeah.

1194
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,180
He would be lifting weights.
I didn't know it was [inaudible].

1195
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,680
Sixty eight got a grizzly bear in his
chest.

1196
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,930
Is that dude still alive?
Oh Man.

1197
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:55,100
Grizzly Adams.
It says death is death.

1198
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,860
So I would say no grizzly guy.
He was so cool.

1199
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:58,880
It's funny.
I had a.

1200
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,130
oh,
it just died.

1201
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,880
My,
uh,

1202
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,890
my wife and I,
Dan Haggerty,

1203
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,530
my,
my wife and I got a,

1204
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,370
my wife and I got a Burmese mountain dog
years ago.

1205
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,440
Have you seen those?
It's like a big Swiss dog.

1206
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,520
No.
Awesome.

1207
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,620
Is A.
It's related to a St Bernard.

1208
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,450
So it's very similar to a St Bernard,
but they,

1209
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,870
they're not like a slobbering breed.
They don't have slobber,

1210
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,330
so they're really awesome.
They have this really cool markings,

1211
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,810
but mine was like 130 pounds,
so it was like a grizzly bear and I

1212
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:30,890
swear I was like living my childhood
dream of being adults because I would,

1213
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,320
I'd come home and roll around with my
big bear,

1214
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:35,720
you know,
it's like he was like a big grizzly bear

1215
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:36,554
who's awesome.

1216
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,890
I wonder if that's.
What did grizzly man in like maybe saw a

1217
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:44,720
grizzly grizzly adams when he was a kid
and either that or he had just a bad

1218
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:49,721
batch or something ripping.
Then I laughed the whole movie.

1219
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,720
Oh yeah.
It's a hilarious moment at the end when

1220
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:57,830
he gets wasted by the barrel.
I thought it was comical sheriff,

1221
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,190
if anybody had ever been asking for it.
It was that dude 100 percent.

1222
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,241
Yeah.
Yeah.

1223
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:04,100
I think it was suicide by Bayer.
I really do,

1224
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,630
because he went back into the area where
when you're not supposed to be there

1225
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:10,460
when the air,
the animals are in hibernation,

1226
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:14,510
except for the really desperate ones and
he knew that they were killing cubs.

1227
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,190
Like that was part of the,
uh,

1228
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:18,700
the video.
He stumbled upon these cubs that this

1229
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:20,300
bear had killed.
They were starving to death.

1230
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:23,090
The rivers had no salmon there.
It all dried up.

1231
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,550
There was no salmon run and it was
getting real sketchy.

1232
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,530
He stuck around.
They've accepted me as one of them was

1233
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,260
the best trip.
Oh Man.

1234
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,580
Way to go.
When the sheriff talked about it.

1235
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,850
Oh,
I thought he was retarded.

1236
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,180
Yeah,
it is.

1237
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,170
I think it's a comedy and I want to talk
to Werner Herzog because he's supposed

1238
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:45,801
to.
We're,

1239
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:48,440
we're apparently we're in contact with
people and we're trying to work

1240
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:50,420
something out because he's got something
else that he's promoting,

1241
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:53,930
but there's no other documentaries that
he does that are funny like that.

1242
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,820
Yeah.
Like that one is fucking funny.

1243
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,370
I'm not sure it was meant to be funny,
but it is.

1244
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:00,860
I feel like human being,
you have to look and be like,

1245
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,920
you gotta be kidding me with this dude.
There's some wild people out there

1246
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:04,754
though.
For sure.

1247
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:09,780
Timothy Treadwell desperately wanted to
be one with tobacco

1248
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,180
gold.
The gold.

1249
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,550
I'm protecting these bears.
No one's protecting these bears when he

1250
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:20,720
goes into those rants because he would,
he would film himself going on like

1251
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:23,360
three or four different grants and he
would only use like one of them,

1252
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:27,780
but some of them he would just start
swearing and you park department and

1253
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,380
where's the,
I want to get like the lost tapes.

1254
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,580
They had a whole series and they really
took his,

1255
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:36,810
they took his tapes and they made a
whole series about it and it was

1256
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,320
fucking.
I mean he had like hundreds of hours of

1257
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,080
footage and he got amazing,
amazing,

1258
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:47,840
unprecedented closeup footage of bears
because no ones that fucking snow at

1259
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,920
that crazy.
You got to be nuts.

1260
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah.
And those things.

1261
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:53,970
We're not like close to a town and used
to humans.

1262
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:55,980
It was,
that was like in the middle of nowhere.

1263
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,410
Middle of nowhere.
His were straight up like wild grizzly

1264
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,580
bears doing wild.
Crazy Bro.

1265
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:00,181
Shit.
Yeah.

1266
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:02,760
And he was watching them go to war with
each other.

1267
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:07,170
I mean he got footage from like 20,
30 yards away of these two enormous

1268
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:08,790
grizzly bears.
Tell him to stop it.

1269
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,710
Huh?
Stop fighting with that guy was 100

1270
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:18,270
percent fighting the gay,
like the gay was disturbing him so much.

1271
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:19,950
He decided to go camping with monsters.

1272
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,920
He's like,
I just added Kit can accept the fact

1273
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,770
that I'm gay and so he would fix that
problem,

1274
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:28,460
didn't you?
We grow with them at the time too.

1275
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,590
And apparently,
um,

1276
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,260
apparently there's audio and I don't
know if they destroyed it,

1277
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,340
but that was part of the,
uh,

1278
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:36,450
the documentary.
There's,

1279
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:41,260
it lasted seven minutes because fares
don't fucking tell you.

1280
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,620
They just started eating you.
They can hold you down.

1281
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,330
I'm not trying to kill you.
They just want,

1282
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,020
I just want to eat you.
That's a weird thing about omnivores as

1283
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,320
opposed to predators.
Like,

1284
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,580
predators just kind of kill you.
But I'm divorced for the most part.

1285
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:58,380
They just hold you down like chimps,
chimps to hold things down and eat them.

1286
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,620
The whole like thing where like where we
want to dispatch an animal as quick as

1287
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:04,310
possible to stop the suffering.
They don't have that part in them.

1288
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,880
They're just like,
you want to scream?

1289
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:06,661
Go ahead.
Yeah.

1290
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:08,130
If you're going to get jacked by
something,

1291
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:11,430
a cat is the way to get Jack [inaudible]
cats know how to kill you.

1292
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,320
Yeah,
they're really good at it.

1293
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,680
Mountain lions to be scary man.
Quick though.

1294
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,760
Yeah.
Scary.

1295
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:19,620
But once they get your neck,
yeah,

1296
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,240
you tell us.
It's pretty much it.

1297
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,140
But guys fight them off.
People fought off mountain lions because

1298
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:27,270
I think animals,
they have this,

1299
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,880
this like tipping point where they go,
okay,

1300
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:32,550
could I get fucking injured here?
If I can get injured here,

1301
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:34,320
I'm going to back off and go kill
something stupid.

1302
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,120
I'm going to go fuck someone's dog up or
something.

1303
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,610
You know,
because there's like a tipping point

1304
00:55:38,611 --> 00:55:41,070
where the animal realize like,
this guy is fighting for his life.

1305
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,420
Fuck,
this is too much work.

1306
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,240
I'm out of here.
Yeah.

1307
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,860
You know,
and that brings me back to the shark

1308
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:47,670
thing,
like the,

1309
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,880
that that would be like just a horrific
way to go.

1310
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,360
There's those things are enormous and
when they want to kill you,

1311
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:56,090
they'll kill you.
And it's a three,

1312
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,860
but this is a strange animal.
It's like nature's cleanup crew.

1313
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,110
Nature's just decided,
look,

1314
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,780
there's just too much shit in this ocean
and so we're going to develop this

1315
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,810
insane thing that doesn't even,
it doesn't even get to sleep.

1316
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:10,140
Get to see the footage of none of that.
Did you see the footage of the surf

1317
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:13,920
contest that happened last year in
Africa where the guy gets attacked by

1318
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:16,110
the shark?
That's a good buddy of mine.

1319
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:17,010
And,
and uh,

1320
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,580
they,
I mean that was like a 18 to 20 foot

1321
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:21,600
long.
Great White Shark.

1322
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:22,870
Pull it out up.
Jamie.

1323
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,040
When I saw it,
I was on a plane and that happen and I

1324
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:30,580
was landing in Honolulu and I turned my
phone on and had like all these crazy

1325
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,740
messages from all my friends,
you know,

1326
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:34,090
because it's just,
you know,

1327
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,740
it's,
it's a really small world in the surf

1328
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:38,020
world.
And that was like,

1329
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,610
it was no accident that the giant great
white shark was within a couple of feet

1330
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,623
of him.
You know,

1331
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,770
look at that.
Like everyone's like,

1332
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:46,090
oh,
it wasn't trying to attack them.

1333
00:56:46,091 --> 00:56:47,080
It wasn't,
it wasn't.

1334
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,360
It didn't mean anything.
That's great.

1335
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:51,190
White Shark is that close to a human
being?

1336
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,250
It was having a real good look,
you know,

1337
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,010
I think,
oh fuck yeah.

1338
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,330
It may not have been wanting to attack
them or whatever,

1339
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,340
but it didn't just get accidentally
stuck in his leash.

1340
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:02,200
You know what I mean?
When you do that right.

1341
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:05,860
There is a scare as a human being could
possibly be without getting killed right

1342
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:06,060
there.

1343
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,890
And he's looking at it.
It's behind him and he's swimming.

1344
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,630
That's it right there.
Right.

1345
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:14,440
That's it in front of them.
It was body was right there.

1346
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:15,760
It in.
Oh my God.

1347
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,160
Yeah.
He's hard as nails and,

1348
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:20,080
and,
and the other Guy Julian Wilson,

1349
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,610
that was mick fanning and the blue and
look at him.

1350
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,000
He's just feeling when he got up on that
raft and when that was going down it

1351
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:30,160
was,
it was a full on ordeal of like,

1352
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,870
you know,
it didn't happen like real quick and he

1353
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:32,890
just jumped on,
was like,

1354
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,720
that was like a law.
A lot of seconds right there.

1355
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:39,460
Happening is board got taken away from
him and he had to swim and splash you

1356
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:40,330
splashing water,
you know,

1357
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,740
panicking.
And then the other guy,

1358
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:46,240
Julian Wilson in his,
he was 100 feet away and I was paddling

1359
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:49,420
full speed towards him to try and help
instead of like,

1360
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:51,040
that's like,
that's like when you show your true

1361
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:51,874
colors,
you know,

1362
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,870
that's when you know that Shit's going
down is when you see a friend of yours

1363
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:58,330
getting what he thought was attacked by
a great white.

1364
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:01,990
You probably,
it's probably just a switch that goes

1365
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:03,520
off in your head.
You probably don't even.

1366
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,610
It's probably just pure lizard thinking,
you know,

1367
00:58:06,611 --> 00:58:11,611
it's like the survival feeling.
Like when that thing hit his board and

1368
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:16,860
you're in full on panic mode,
you realize like you have got to get the

1369
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:19,060
fuck away from this town.
There's no other options.

1370
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:22,100
So I watched it and you see him read it.
He doesn't like go.

1371
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,000
What was that?
He reacts super.

1372
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,470
He was ready to like fight.
If that thing was there,

1373
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:28,870
I'm 100 percent sure he started swinging
right it right away.

1374
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,100
If it was right there,
you know,

1375
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,400
I have a friend,
actually I have a friend where I live.

1376
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,200
Um,
he's actually,

1377
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:36,820
he lives on the same island is me,
he's from,

1378
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,460
from where I live in a tiger.
Shark,

1379
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,260
came up,
grabs him,

1380
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,830
takes him under water by the side,
grabs him with a whole mouth bite on his

1381
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:51,040
ribs and his head and takes them under
water like six feet under water.

1382
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,440
And he had a straight up punch up with
the thing underwater.

1383
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,720
Oh my God,
he's beating the shit out of the shark.

1384
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,110
He's a big dude.
But he was at the time he was like 16

1385
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:02,110
years old.
He Oulu and he's a local Hawaiian kid

1386
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:05,050
from where I live and it took them under
water and he's straight up flat.

1387
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:09,250
The shark and I ended up letting him go
yet I think he had like 200 stitches or

1388
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:13,180
300 stitches or something.
I mean his whole side was just cut open.

1389
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,880
It's amazing that he's amazing.
He's okay.

1390
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,780
I can't even imagine what that would a
little look in there.

1391
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:21,210
And the thing like looking at the
eyeball,

1392
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,050
been right there

1393
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,120
like staring at him,
you know.

1394
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,100
And,
and he said he was just hitting thing as

1395
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:26,960
hard as he possibly could.
Luckily he's a big dude.

1396
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,400
It's crazy that they're attributing it.
It makes sense though to overfishing

1397
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,560
that they're just don't have enough to
eat anymore.

1398
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,150
It makes sense.
Totally makes sense.

1399
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,610
And the thing is,
no matter how many attacks there are,

1400
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,040
like there's been,
there's been a shitload of attacks in

1401
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:43,070
Australia,
a lot in certain pockets,

1402
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,290
certain areas.
And there's one area in eastern

1403
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,130
Australia like on the east coast that
is,

1404
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,870
has a ton of attacks and last five years
and another place on the west coast.

1405
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,150
And there's all these groups that are
just like,

1406
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:54,860
nope,
you can't do anything to the sharks.

1407
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,870
You cannot do anything of the sharks,
you know,

1408
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,310
well,
who are these groups and what is there a

1409
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,000
mentalist groups that just like,
no matter what,

1410
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:04,220
you can't,
you can't hurt nature type of thing.

1411
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,390
Is there a shortage of sharks?
Well,

1412
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,070
I've mad it's,
it's,

1413
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,800
it's hard.
But the bottom line is if they were less

1414
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:13,850
sharks,
it'd be less attacks,

1415
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:14,860
right?
Yeah.

1416
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,420
So
difficult.

1417
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:20,240
There's not a real,
there's not a real solution where you

1418
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,680
can,
where are you going to make everybody

1419
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:22,910
happy?
You know what,

1420
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,540
you're never gonna make everybody happy
when you have a environmentalists or

1421
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:31,040
animal rights advocates and there's a
lot of like really fucking crazy and

1422
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:36,100
environmental and anti hunting an animal
rights activists that they're not using

1423
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:39,290
logic or conservation,
they just love animals.

1424
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,100
They want them protected at all costs.
What's interesting is they don't have

1425
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:45,560
any problem with animals,
fucking up animals.

1426
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,930
No.
Like they don't like people eating

1427
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:49,790
animals,
but they don't have any problem with

1428
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,800
animals.
Just ripping animals apart.

1429
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,400
Yeah.
It's weird.

1430
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,330
It is weird.
It's weird because it's like they accept

1431
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:57,710
nature,
they love nature,

1432
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,070
but they don't like the nature of a
human being a predator.

1433
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,700
Like they want to move away from that.
Yeah.

1434
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,930
People are,
are a trip these days.

1435
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:06,240
Man.
I,

1436
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,073
I,
uh,

1437
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,930
it's funny because the whole social
media thing for me is,

1438
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,660
is,
is relatively new.

1439
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,250
It's,
you know,

1440
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:16,340
obviously we didn't grow up with that
and it baffles me because you know,

1441
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,300
I can,
I can spear fish and I've,

1442
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:21,320
I've posted like a photo of me.
Nobody was like of my spirit and my fit.

1443
01:01:21,321 --> 01:01:23,660
There's like a,
like a bloody fish in my hand.

1444
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,640
Good job,
great going.

1445
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:26,960
Awesome.
Great Fish.

1446
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:30,830
No one says a word about anything that I
killed a fish.

1447
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,440
You kill a deer.
Hollow man.

1448
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,850
People just freak out.
See what happens.

1449
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:37,100
Not Kill a bear.
Bear.

1450
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:41,030
I can only imagine the more people who
hated me for that than anything I've

1451
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,080
done.
Besides fear factor.

1452
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,660
Yeah.
Besides fear factor.

1453
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,670
They get so mad.
I'm like,

1454
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:47,360
I'm eating it.

1455
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,710
This is what I eat.
I don't eat.

1456
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:51,170
I don't buy meat.
People have such a problem with that.

1457
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,710
Now I get these done is dumbest comments
like literally like there's plenty of

1458
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,590
meat in the store.
Why would you have to go and do that?

1459
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,850
Oh,
you're a terrible person.

1460
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,760
Like I'm not a terrible person because I
go to the store and eat it.

1461
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,460
You're a terrible person because you go
and get your food yourself.

1462
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:06,590
And,
and kill it because you did the killing

1463
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,690
with your own hands.
You're bad.

1464
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:13,460
I go and buy it with your money.
You don't have to be pretty wild.

1465
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,550
That whole,
it just blows my mind because,

1466
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,160
you know,
I didn't grow up in a city.

1467
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,160
Like I get all these people

1468
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,160
from like Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paolo or
someplace in South America or a big

1469
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:26,870
city.
And I hit the point I,

1470
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:28,920
I'm not pointing the finger at South
Americans or anything like that.

1471
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:30,240
It's like,
but it always,

1472
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,910
it's always people who are in cities
because they have this major

1473
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:34,240
disconnection from their food.
Right.

1474
01:02:34,241 --> 01:02:37,530
And where I live,
I live,

1475
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:39,780
I live in Hawaii.
Everybody I know is a fisherman or a

1476
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:41,520
hunter and they,
you know,

1477
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,220
people have gardens.
It's like there's a way of life where

1478
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:45,630
they,
where we live,

1479
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,360
there's tons of fish everywhere.
If you throw your net,

1480
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:50,460
you're going to get dinner.
That's what people do.

1481
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,790
They know the eat the food that they get
around them.

1482
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,190
And not always,
but that's just a,

1483
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,470
it's very,
very typical to be a hunter or a

1484
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:01,950
fisherman.
And you know like where I live,

1485
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,980
that's viewed as the same exact thing of
fishermen and hunters the same.

1486
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,630
I don't,
I don't see the difference.

1487
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,590
And so that's why it's shocking to me
with the whole how people are totally

1488
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,030
fine.
You clubbing a bunch of fish,

1489
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,630
but the second you kill a deer,
they just lose it.

1490
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,210
Yeah.
Well what exactly what you said.

1491
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,570
It's just the disconnect of not,
not really understanding where their

1492
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:25,080
food comes from.
Not being in any way connected to the

1493
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:29,610
idea of the natural cycle of life.
And then there's also a hierarchy of

1494
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:33,210
animals that you're allowed to kill.
I'm not allowed to kill Turkeys.

1495
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,250
Nobody gives a fuck when you hold up a
dead Turkey.

1496
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,300
No,
don't give a shit.

1497
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,040
No.
But if you hold up a dead bear and a

1498
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,420
dead for a period of those things.
Yeah.

1499
01:03:42,421 --> 01:03:43,990
Pigs,
they don't have a problem with them.

1500
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,440
Shit about pigs.
It's weird.

1501
01:03:45,441 --> 01:03:47,850
Get rid of them.
Especially for takes to.

1502
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,190
Yeah,
like most people.

1503
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:49,320
Yeah.

1504
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,153
Bacon everyday,
right?

1505
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,290
Like,
Yep.

1506
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,840
Get rid of those boards as that's a
disgusting filthy animal.

1507
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,970
Kill it.
I'm going to have my bacon too.

1508
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,470
Yeah.
Why did you shoot that deer though?

1509
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:00,750
Yeah,
but they have to do that.

1510
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:01,331
Yeah.
Yeah.

1511
01:04:01,331 --> 01:04:04,720
Well the bear bears are the big ones
because I think in a lot of ways people

1512
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:08,410
associate bears with trophy hunting.
Trophy hunting is something that.

1513
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,920
I mean I'm,
I get it.

1514
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:16,150
I understand that there's a lot of money
involved in it for the communities where

1515
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:19,900
they shoot these animals and that it
benefits them and then also they have

1516
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:22,120
population issues with a lot of these
animals.

1517
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,720
Like we were talking about it yesterday.
The thing that happened in Zimbabwe with

1518
01:04:25,721 --> 01:04:26,840
Cecil the lion.
Yeah.

1519
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:30,760
How they have to shoot 200 lines now
they have to kill them because they're

1520
01:04:30,761 --> 01:04:32,760
just decimating the underland
population.

1521
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,900
Nobody knows about that.
All those people that were pissed about

1522
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:36,910
Cecil have no idea.
They got to kill the lions.

1523
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:38,760
Yeah.
No idea of how it,

1524
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:41,290
how it works over there,
and the only reason those lands are

1525
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:44,890
alive is because of hunters and they're
losing a million dollars in revenue

1526
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:48,160
because they cost them $50,000 to shoot
a lion.

1527
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,530
So all that money would go to
conservation,

1528
01:04:50,531 --> 01:04:54,780
hiring all the conservation agents and
stop.

1529
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:55,220
I'm

1530
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:55,870
really.
Yeah,

1531
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,120
I mean it's a,
it's a shitty system.

1532
01:04:57,121 --> 01:05:00,540
It's because they're dangerous.
They can't do it.

1533
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:01,560
Like in America,
it's great.

1534
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:02,460
It's like,
you know,

1535
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,400
when I bought my tag for Colorado,
I buy it for 600 bucks,

1536
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,690
like 5:50 goes straight to conservation
and that's awesome.

1537
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,610
And that's why there's so many animals,
you know,

1538
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:14,400
and that's it.
That's a really healthy system of how

1539
01:05:14,401 --> 01:05:16,380
to,
how to like increase populations,

1540
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:18,280
how to,
how take care of habitat

1541
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,370
at a higher more park rangers,
how to,

1542
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,120
how to buy more land and,
and,

1543
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,310
and,
you know,

1544
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,600
make bigger reservations and bigger
conservation areas.

1545
01:05:25,601 --> 01:05:28,120
And I don't think people know that,
but they don't.

1546
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:32,680
Most people have no idea that most of
the money that goes towards wildlife

1547
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,530
habitat,
like maintaining habitat all comes from

1548
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,560
hunters like 90 percent.
And then on top of that there's a tax on

1549
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:41,140
sporting goods that goes to that.
And you know,

1550
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,040
people always say,
well,

1551
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,230
hunting isn't conservation,
but you know what?

1552
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:47,290
Here's the thing.
Hunters and hunting products,

1553
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,900
whether it's a bowhunting stuff or rifle
stuff,

1554
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,040
they did not fight that tax,
but you knew who did fight that tax.

1555
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:58,060
All those other companies that make
hiking stuff and Rei and those

1556
01:05:58,061 --> 01:05:59,310
companies,
they didn't want attack,

1557
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,850
so they've tried to impose another tax
and these people have fought it off and

1558
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:06,220
the reason they fought it off is because
they don't have to pay it.

1559
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,640
They don't have to pay it.
It's going to fuck with their overhead's

1560
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:11,410
going to fuck with the amount of money
that they have to charge for things,

1561
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,820
and so this,
this idea that these hunters aren't real

1562
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,920
conservationist,
they're using it as an excuse.

1563
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,500
The bottom line is that's where all the
money's coming from.

1564
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,090
All of it for habitat protection,
wetland habitat protection law,

1565
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,070
all that comes from hunters and it's all
a lot of money.

1566
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,970
It's like if they stopped hunting,
if they made hunting illegal and they

1567
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:34,090
cut off that supply revenue,
there's a lot of animals that we'd be

1568
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,650
fucked.
There would be.

1569
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:40,270
People don't like it because it's one of
those really weird kind of gray area

1570
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:43,720
things or it just doesn't make you feel
comfortable thinking that the money that

1571
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,190
has come,
first of all,

1572
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,820
the only reason why there's elk and all
the habitats that they're at right now

1573
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:51,430
is because hunters introduced them to
those areas.

1574
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:56,230
They were decimated by the turn of the
19th century or the 20th century,

1575
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:00,130
so in the early 19 hundreds there was
very few elk left in this country,

1576
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,720
so the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation
spent considerable amounts of money,

1577
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:09,700
resource man hours moving animals into
these areas like Kentucky,

1578
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:13,060
like Kentucky has like a huge ell
population now.

1579
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,450
There was nothing there just 30,
40 years ago.

1580
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,500
Nothing,
zero.

1581
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,740
So they've.
They've figured out a way to not just

1582
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,370
maintain populations so hunters can kill
them,

1583
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:27,460
but they've also reintroduced him to
areas where they didn't exist before.

1584
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,230
Increase populations by a hundred times
in a lot of students.

1585
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,320
I mean the elk numbers have never been
as high as they have been in the last 20

1586
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:35,971
years.
Yeah,

1587
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:36,490
no,
no.

1588
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:38,680
There.
It's amazing what they've done and it's

1589
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:40,790
all because of hunters and that's
that's.

1590
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,080
I understand it for people that are
animal rights lovers,

1591
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:49,350
but I just wish they had a more balanced
perspective and they understood what all

1592
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:51,520
the pieces that are in place are.
It's,

1593
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,240
it's an uncomfortable thing for a lot of
people to think that the people who want

1594
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:58,810
to hunt and kill and eat these animals
are the ones that love them the most.

1595
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:01,420
Yeah.
This crazy thinking.

1596
01:08:01,421 --> 01:08:03,700
Right?
Well all the people that are super

1597
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:06,910
butthurt about the hunting thing aren't
doing anything about it.

1598
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,310
Yeah,
of course.

1599
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,140
Yeah.
They're just being angry and lashing out

1600
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,830
with their phone,
but they're not doing anything to say

1601
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:14,800
the animals,
those,

1602
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,020
those,
those people are

1603
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:20,150
on the front lines in Africa trying to
save the lions or the elephants or

1604
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,940
trying to.
Trying to go against poachers and do

1605
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:26,270
something about it.
All those people are just are just chit

1606
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:27,050
chatting,
you know,

1607
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:28,610
well,
there's not enough money.

1608
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,370
I mean,
if they really wanted to do the kind of

1609
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:34,070
work that the hunters who are doing,
they'd have to have some stream revenue

1610
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:38,360
and the stream of revenue that is coming
from hunting is all coming from tags.

1611
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,800
It's all coming from the sale of hunting
gear and products and there's just no

1612
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:44,690
way they can match that.
There's no way.

1613
01:08:44,691 --> 01:08:47,120
There's millions of hunters,
millions of hunters that are

1614
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:49,150
contributing literally a billion
dollars.

1615
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,380
It's probably more than a billion
dollars a year that goes to

1616
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,380
conservation.
Yeah.

1617
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,410
Especially.
So it's,

1618
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,740
it's a weird.
It's one of those weird things.

1619
01:08:57,741 --> 01:09:00,080
It just doesn't.
It seems like it should be cut and dry.

1620
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,270
Well,
and I think people have a misconception

1621
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,210
of about hunting in general,
like in most states,

1622
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:06,620
like,
like say Colorado,

1623
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:09,860
that the areas that I've hunted there,
like on a do it yourself over the

1624
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:14,780
counter tag costs me like 550 bucks,
600 bucks and I go there with my buddy.

1625
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,330
It's in an area that has,
you know,

1626
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:21,680
a seven percent success rate for archery
or maybe less six or seven percent.

1627
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:26,000
So out of 100 hunters,
maybe six or seven people get an elk,

1628
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,180
so all these people are really just
paying for the experience of elk

1629
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:30,080
hunting.
They're not even.

1630
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,450
It's not like they're going in there
buying an animal or nothing like that.

1631
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:34,880
It's like I'm going out,
I'm going to Colorado.

1632
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:38,750
This is my trip for the year.
I choose to go out and just hunt elk for

1633
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:42,110
two weeks or three weeks or one week or
however long you have time and.

1634
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,720
And that's what the hunting experience
is all about for me.

1635
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,700
I mean I,
I love them the meat.

1636
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,620
That's awesome.
I love the successful hunt.

1637
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:50,480
That's great.
For sure.

1638
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:51,500
I love eating it,
but the.

1639
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,020
But the bottom line is if I go elk
hunting and don't get an elk,

1640
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:56,240
it's not an unsuccessful hunt.
I'm so stoked.

1641
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,370
This is like the best experience ever.
Yeah.

1642
01:09:58,371 --> 01:10:02,210
It's a very enjoyable,
deeply rewarding experience just to be

1643
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:05,600
out there trying and attempting it and
when you are successful it makes it that

1644
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:08,330
much more rewarding because you know how
difficult it is,

1645
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,280
especially when you're doing it with a
bow and arrow.

1646
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,500
Yeah,
I mean it is.

1647
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:14,840
You have to get within,
I mean if you're really fucking good,

1648
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:16,550
you could shoot something within 90
yards,

1649
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:18,680
but for the most part you're trying to
get somewhere within 30,

1650
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:19,280
40 yards.

1651
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,113
Yeah,
that's right.

1652
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:21,980
It's about Jim.
What is this?

1653
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:22,641
Oh,
well,

1654
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:26,540
I got sportsmen contribute nearly
$8,000,000 every day.

1655
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,770
Adding two more than two point $9
billion dollars every year for

1656
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:35,540
conservation hunters and target shooters
have paid seven point $1,000,000,000 in

1657
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:40,541
excise taxes since the inception of the
Pittman Robertson act in 1937 sets.

1658
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:45,260
Incredible.
Everybody in America knows about Cecil

1659
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:47,870
the lion.
Everybody knows about Cecil.

1660
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,060
Nobody knows that.
Nobody.

1661
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,520
Only hunters know that,
you know?

1662
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,780
Yeah,
I'm confused here.

1663
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:56,800
How's that work?
It says I get the $8,000,000 everyday

1664
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,120
contributing more than two point $9
million dollars every year for

1665
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,010
conservation.
But this is what I don't understand.

1666
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,200
It says hundreds and target shooters
have paid six,

1667
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,340
seven point 1 billion in excise taxes
specifically that just specifically

1668
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:08,540
excise taxes.
Yeah.

1669
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,460
Okay.
It's a shitload of money.

1670
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,800
Yeah.
So it's tags,

1671
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,130
um,
and

1672
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:17,970
then equipment and taxes.
So I guess the taxes is whereas this is

1673
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:19,370
the billion,
the seven point 1 billion,

1674
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,960
the rest of it is tags,
which is two point $9,

1675
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:23,250
billion dollars a year.
It's amazing.

1676
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,380
It's amazing.
But again,

1677
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,800
it's the people that live in the cities
that are disconnected and I was one of

1678
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:30,270
them.
I mean if you talk to me,

1679
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,110
if you got a hold of me,
you know,

1680
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:36,150
20 years ago when I never even
considered hunting and he asked me about

1681
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:38,220
like it'd be a little assholes shooting
an animal.

1682
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:40,920
Animals are awesome.
Bunch of pussies with their big guns.

1683
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:45,420
Go buy dog food and cat food because I
love animals and buying ground up

1684
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:47,070
fucking chickens.
Yeah,

1685
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,960
I mean that's the funniest one is like
vegans with cats want more than one

1686
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:52,910
point four,
$2,

1687
01:11:52,911 --> 01:11:55,500
billion dollars through state hunting
and fishing license.

1688
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:56,880
Wow,
that's incredible.

1689
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:01,830
One point $4,000,000,000 in conservation
comes from hunting and fishing license

1690
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:03,360
sales.
Six hundred,

1691
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,480
8 million from other revenue.
Seven hundred $49 million to excise

1692
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:09,870
taxes paid solely by sportsmen.
That's amazing.

1693
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

1694
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,580
I mean,
that's where the money comes and if that

1695
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:16,860
money's not going to be replaced by
people who love animals and that's also,

1696
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:21,990
there's a lot of people that think of
hunters like the characters in a movie

1697
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:25,440
like an Elmer Fudd,
some asshole who hates animals,

1698
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,800
but when you listened to like really
good hunting podcasts,

1699
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,660
like there's this guy,
Jay Scott,

1700
01:12:30,661 --> 01:12:35,280
he's got a really good hunting podcast
and cody rich as a rich outdoors and

1701
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,130
Steven Rinella has immediate or
podcasts,

1702
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,080
which is Mike,
my favorite.

1703
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,930
You're,
you're listening to really intelligent,

1704
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,080
really smart,
well educated people that understand a

1705
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:48,060
lot about conservation,
the environment,

1706
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:51,660
the animals they're pursuing and when
they're talking about tactics and

1707
01:12:51,661 --> 01:12:53,790
strategies and details and all the
different,

1708
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:58,110
different areas of your hunting,
all the different places where you're

1709
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,260
putting in for tags,
you realize like this is a complex

1710
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:05,070
system that they're trying to navigate
in order to be successful.

1711
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,690
It's fucking very,
very difficult and it's primal as fuck.

1712
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:13,820
The whole thing is like,
it's a wild experience and like

1713
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,310
literally wild and many different
levels.

1714
01:13:16,311 --> 01:13:17,144
Yeah.

1715
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:18,120
And just,
uh,

1716
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,080
yeah.
I just,

1717
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,180
I don't know.
I can't get enough of it.

1718
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,360
I swear.
Like I,

1719
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,020
I,
I feel like I,

1720
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,610
I like,
I measure my success not so much now

1721
01:13:29,611 --> 01:13:31,680
because my kids are having a family guy
and,

1722
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,170
and that's basically all I care about is
my kids these days.

1723
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:39,171
But I swear like I measure my success by
how many days a year I spent in

1724
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:42,780
camouflage.
That's how I know I had a super good

1725
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,300
year is if I went hunting a lot.
I swear it's like,

1726
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:46,560
and,
and like if I,

1727
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:48,420
if I'm,
if I don't hunt for awhile,

1728
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,120
like my wife will call my friend and be
like,

1729
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:53,340
dude,
you gotta take Shane Hunting.

1730
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,840
He's being a dick.
He's being a total asshole and you need

1731
01:13:58,891 --> 01:14:01,170
to take them honey.
So it's like you need to get your fix.

1732
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:06,060
I know I just get grouchy and grumpy and
I don't even really feel it coming on.

1733
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:07,320
And my wife's like,
you need to go hunting,

1734
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,510
but what is it you think that's causing
that?

1735
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:11,410
It's like the,
I don't know,

1736
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:12,010
is

1737
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,410
it,
is it something's causing hunting?

1738
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,440
Not Hunting.
Hunting is alleviating that and some

1739
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:18,303
sort of a way.
Yeah,

1740
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,080
and surfing I,
I do,

1741
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,160
I've,
you know,

1742
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,130
I need to surf a lot and I need to hunt
a lot.

1743
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,980
It's just who I am now.
It's just like I'm,

1744
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,150
I'm 100.
It's like I'm a surfer.

1745
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,710
It's,
it's not what I do.

1746
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,270
That's the,
I feel like that's who I am.

1747
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:34,900
So it's just being a part of the natural
world.

1748
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:38,560
Like the surfing thing is you're,
even though you're on a board that's

1749
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:40,610
made out of composite materials and you
know,

1750
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,900
you've got wax on and all this jazz and
it's all created by a factor,

1751
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,380
but there's something about your,
you're introducing your life or your,

1752
01:14:48,381 --> 01:14:53,381
your being into the natural world of the
ocean and you feel something like,

1753
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:58,441
they say that the ocean has some sort of
an electro magnetic like feel to it like

1754
01:14:58,931 --> 01:15:01,930
there's something about the ocean
because it's essentially alive.

1755
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,940
You know,
it has living things in it,

1756
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,330
but there's oxygen in the water and
that's,

1757
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:09,610
that's how these plants grow.
And when there's dead spots,

1758
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:12,310
that's why these fish die like this.
It's almost like an,

1759
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:16,510
it's not just like an ecosystem,
it's almost like a giant living thing

1760
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:20,710
and you're swimming around in that thing
sort of absorbing its life for us

1761
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:24,090
and I feel like it just keeps you young.
I think it's like,

1762
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:27,540
I swear like surfing a lot,
being in the sun,

1763
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,230
being in the ocean a lot and not like
sitting there frying yourself or

1764
01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:33,390
anything like that,
but just like spending a life in the

1765
01:15:33,391 --> 01:15:35,370
ocean and in the sun.
Is this good for you?

1766
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:37,440
Yeah,
I know people who are in their fifties

1767
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:40,440
and sixties and nurses healthy,
they look young.

1768
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,360
They don't,
they don't have like tons of physical

1769
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:44,730
problems and um,
I don't know.

1770
01:15:44,731 --> 01:15:46,020
It's just,
I think it's good for you.

1771
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,380
I think spending time in the outdoors,
whether you're in the mountains with

1772
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:51,510
your bow or whether you're in the ocean
doing,

1773
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:53,220
doing whatever you're doing,
it's just good.

1774
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,380
Well,
it's certainly good to be active now and

1775
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:59,380
it's also absorbing vitamin D three or
creating Vitamin d three through the

1776
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:01,270
song.
So that's a rare thing.

1777
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:03,950
Yeah.
Then coming home with organic grass fed

1778
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,780
wild meat is even better.
You know,

1779
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:06,770
yeah,
no,

1780
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:08,530
all those things are,
I mean you,

1781
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,280
you're living a very natural life in a
lot of ways and that what you know,

1782
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:15,340
and again it's,
there's also the satisfaction element,

1783
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:18,010
just like the people who grow a garden
can Kinda,

1784
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:20,260
and I have a garden I get it,
is there's a,

1785
01:16:20,261 --> 01:16:23,800
there's a connection,
like if I grow some tomatoes and some

1786
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:27,190
Kale and I put together a salad when I'm
eating that salad,

1787
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,520
I'm like,
I know we're not,

1788
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,460
not only know where this came from,
I was there,

1789
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,070
I put the seeds in,
I watered it,

1790
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,150
I fertilized.
Yeah.

1791
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:37,150
It's um,
there's something deeply satisfying

1792
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:41,950
about making your own food that you grow
or that you go and get as opposed to

1793
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:43,000
going to a supermarket.
It

1794
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:44,800
only takes a lot more effort to.
Yeah.

1795
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:46,570
So you just have like a,
you know,

1796
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:48,850
like that,
that elk steak that you eat.

1797
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:50,711
Like if you,
if you,

1798
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:54,460
if you did a side like a side by side
comparison with someone who didn't hunt,

1799
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,490
you know,
they may not feel the same way,

1800
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:01,000
but because you packed it out,
you put all the time and on the target

1801
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:02,200
you did all the hunting,
you,

1802
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:04,750
you,
you like look forward to it for six

1803
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:07,590
months that hunt and it just,
that's the best tasting steak you're

1804
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,820
ever going to have because you have the
pride of knowing that you did it all

1805
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:11,550
yourself.

1806
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,900
Yeah.
It's certainly a very,

1807
01:17:12,901 --> 01:17:17,550
very different feeling now living in
Hawaii and being a white guy.

1808
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,810
What is that like?
Because people say weird things about

1809
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:24,300
it.
I've never found Hawaiians to be racist

1810
01:17:24,301 --> 01:17:27,690
or rude or weird,
but I've heard crazy shit and I've

1811
01:17:27,691 --> 01:17:31,830
always wondered like if that crazy shit
is from like rude Americans that come

1812
01:17:31,831 --> 01:17:36,000
over there and are disrespectful or act
like they own the place or.

1813
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:39,470
Well,
there's a little bit of both.

1814
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,000
Yeah.
There's a little bit of both.

1815
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,020
There's,
there's uh,

1816
01:17:42,021 --> 01:17:42,860
you know,
I mean I grew up.

1817
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:46,280
I mean I was born and raised in Hawaii
so I saw a lot of this,

1818
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:48,500
you know,
like in high school and elementary

1819
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:49,550
school,
like if you were a white,

1820
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,980
like everybody wanted to be a Hawaiian
when they are young.

1821
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:53,810
Right?
Like everybody at my school,

1822
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,930
like if you're white you kind of wish
you weren't really.

1823
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,010
That's kind of the deal.
Yeah.

1824
01:17:58,011 --> 01:17:59,990
When you're really young,
especially back in the day,

1825
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:01,600
like is it like seventies and eighties?
Right.

1826
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:05,390
So like when I was a kid there was this
thing called kill holiday,

1827
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,780
not making it up.
I don't like.

1828
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,260
So you know what holly is like a white
dude.

1829
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:13,220
So there was a thing,
it was called kill holiday and it was

1830
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,780
always at the end of the year and it was
like,

1831
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,720
I don't even know if they actually
practiced it when I was a kid,

1832
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:21,710
but it was still,
it was a thing and it was a thing where

1833
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:25,480
like Hawaiians would be like this is it,
like we're almost out of school.

1834
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,350
It's beat up some holly's or whatever
deal was.

1835
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,611
And that's,
I mean,

1836
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:30,500
it didn't really happen when I was when
I was a kid,

1837
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:33,200
but there was a thing called kill
holiday and people would talk about it

1838
01:18:33,201 --> 01:18:35,150
and,
but times have definitely changed.

1839
01:18:35,151 --> 01:18:35,870
And uh,
and,

1840
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,200
and uh,
and the other thing is like,

1841
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:42,230
there's a huge difference between a
white dude who was born in Hawaii and a

1842
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:45,620
white guy who moved to Hawaii.
So if you're from Hawaii,

1843
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:49,910
like born and raised in Hawaii is
totally different than,

1844
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
than if you're a dude from Orange County
that moved to cal moved to Hawaii when

1845
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,800
you're 18.
And then like next thing you know,

1846
01:18:57,801 --> 01:18:59,910
you're trying to talk like the Hawaiians
and stuff like that.

1847
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,990
That's when people freak that,
that's people lose it when the,

1848
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,380
when a dude rolls up and like with the
Hawaiian stickers on their truck and

1849
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:09,680
jumps out and is trying to act like a
local dude,

1850
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,990
that's when guys get angry.
That's not cool.

1851
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:14,330
So it's like a cultural appropriation
thing.

1852
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,613
Yeah,
they just,

1853
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:16,770
it's just like,
um,

1854
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,290
I don't know how to explain it,
but it's,

1855
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,270
it,
it gets a little complicated.

1856
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:22,340
But if you show people respect,
you know it,

1857
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,540
if,
if you're chill,

1858
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,720
if you paddle out in the water at a,
at a localized break and you're mellow,

1859
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,310
you don't have a bunch of Ding dongs
with you.

1860
01:19:28,311 --> 01:19:31,670
If you paddle out by yourself and you
show respect and you're mellow than

1861
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:32,890
everyone gives you.
Respect that.

1862
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,070
That's what I've always found.

1863
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:37,330
So the issue is disrespectful people and
a lot of ways,

1864
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:38,164
right?

1865
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:39,210
Yeah.
It's just a,

1866
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,010
it's just different.
It's like its own country.

1867
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:43,590
It's like I've never been to Texas,
but I hear it's like its own,

1868
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,390
its own kind of place is definitely it's
own country.

1869
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:50,030
If you get off the plane at my house and
you get like a convertible Mustang rent

1870
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:54,360
a car and someone's going 45 and 55 and
a lifted truck,

1871
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,480
you don't pass them.
You know what I mean?

1872
01:19:57,481 --> 01:20:01,110
If you pass them,
they'll chase you down and will really.

1873
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,330
Oh yeah,
that's just disrespectful.

1874
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,740
It's like you're in Hawaii and I'll slow
down,

1875
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,520
you know,
don't,

1876
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:09,750
don't,
don't go 65 and a 55 and a convertible

1877
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,400
Mustang.
It's like they're just,

1878
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,500
it's just a strange place.
It's like,

1879
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,330
it's a,
I don't know,

1880
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:15,931
it's just,
it's,

1881
01:20:15,931 --> 01:20:17,340
it's,
its own kind of place,

1882
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:17,941
man.
Well,

1883
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:19,230
it's,
it's occupied.

1884
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,450
I mean,
it's sort of an occupied country

1885
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,050
completely.

1886
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,550
Yeah.
It's like they don't,

1887
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,880
they're a part of the United States,
you know,

1888
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,300
in quotes,
in air quotes,

1889
01:20:27,301 --> 01:20:29,160
but not really.
That's a country.

1890
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,910
And then people sailed.
They're on sailing canoes from French

1891
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:37,200
Polynesia with stars for navigation.
They got there on their own.

1892
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,780
Anything with them?
It's,

1893
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:40,890
I dunno,
uh,

1894
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,880
it'd be 3000 miles or something like
that.

1895
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:47,460
What in the fuck they did that in a
canoe.

1896
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:49,710
Yes.
I don't even like driving to vegas and

1897
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:50,544
like,
hey guys,

1898
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,960
like we're out of here.
We're actually,

1899
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,460
we're not good.
Just going on a cruise.

1900
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:55,140
We're moving.
We're going to become.

1901
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:57,870
Hawaiians were to bring our babies and
you have kids.

1902
01:20:57,871 --> 01:21:00,930
Imagine bringing your kid on a fucking
whole move to Hawaii.

1903
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:05,070
They live there.
They had their awesome system of the

1904
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:07,560
people in the mountains.
They trade with the people at the beach

1905
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:10,740
for food and sustenance and that's how
they live.

1906
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,330
You know,
there's a mountain people,

1907
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:15,060
there's the ocean people and nobody
owned any land.

1908
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,900
There was no concept of owning land.
People will just share it and got along

1909
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:21,780
and they had their system that worked,
you know,

1910
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:23,550
it was a gnarly time too.
There was,

1911
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,530
there was a lot of gnarly stuff that was
going on.

1912
01:21:25,531 --> 01:21:27,540
It was like a radical time to live.
If you're,

1913
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:28,840
if you did something bad,
you're,

1914
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,800
you're executed and all kinds of crazy
shit and like back in the day.

1915
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:34,150
But um,
you know,

1916
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:37,410
when the white dude showed up when
Captain Cook showed up and the

1917
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:42,411
missionary showed up and their boats and
they were trading a musket for like

1918
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,850
100,000 Acre ranch,
you know,

1919
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:49,050
it was like she got crazy in Hawaiian
and you and you can feel that nowadays.

1920
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:50,850
I mean there's a lot of Hawaiians are
getting pushed out,

1921
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,240
know all these people live in different
places on the mainland and make a bunch

1922
01:21:54,241 --> 01:21:54,900
of money.

1923
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,520
And then they retire in Hawaii because
who wouldn't?

1924
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:57,990
Right?
Everybody wants to live in Hawaii,

1925
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,930
but they bring their money to Hawaii.
It drives the value up.

1926
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:03,990
And then the Hawaiians can't live there
anymore and they get pushed out to these

1927
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:06,420
areas that are less desirable,
that are,

1928
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,730
you know,
and they can't make money in Hawaii.

1929
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,830
So there's a lot of resentment,
you know,

1930
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:11,664
there's,
there's,

1931
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,760
there's a lot of,
there's a crazy dynamic and Hawaiian and

1932
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:17,280
you feel that and I don't know that
that'll never get taken away.

1933
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:20,160
How does that work?
Because the last time I was there,

1934
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:22,200
I was looking at these properties that
were on the beach.

1935
01:22:22,201 --> 01:22:24,540
I was like,
look at the size of this fucking place

1936
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,810
is enormous house that someone built on
this beach.

1937
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,220
And someone was telling me,
yeah,

1938
01:22:29,221 --> 01:22:31,200
that's some ceos,
Jamey,

1939
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:33,840
it's his house,
he's got a fucking helicopter pad and

1940
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:34,010
shit.

1941
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:34,621
And I was like,
okay,

1942
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:37,650
how does that work?
So this guy like flies in,

1943
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:41,650
stays there sometimes and how the people
around feel about that a week,

1944
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,930
a year.
And they spent five years building their

1945
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:47,190
house with like Italian.
Granted that's flown in from Italy and,

1946
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,990
and you know,
you know,

1947
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,880
and,
and it's like.

1948
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,960
And I was like,
guess who's swinging the hammers,

1949
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:53,250
right?
Hawaiians,

1950
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,113
yeah.
Yeah.

1951
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:57,450
And they have to drive there from like
their little zone or wherever,

1952
01:22:57,451 --> 01:22:58,021
you know,
wherever,

1953
01:22:58,021 --> 01:23:00,270
wherever they're living,
they definitely don't live in like a

1954
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,580
private community by the beach golf
course.

1955
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:05,980
Well,
and so how do people feel about those

1956
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,420
people that do that?
They,

1957
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:09,730
do they get upset at them?
Are they angry at them?

1958
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:10,990
Really?
I think they understand.

1959
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,040
I just think they,
they,

1960
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:13,870
uh,
it's just a difficult situation.

1961
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:14,401
You know,
it's like,

1962
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:16,770
it's like a,
it's like a lot of places in America

1963
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,610
really think about it.
It's not,

1964
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:22,120
it's not that unusual situation in
Hawaii.

1965
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:26,620
It just seems odd because it's,
there's so many of these multimillion

1966
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:30,850
dollar vacation estates that are bought
by the beach and you're like,

1967
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,470
that's like some crazy fuck you ceo type
money that you have to have to have one

1968
01:23:35,471 --> 01:23:37,570
of these things.
Like how weird is it?

1969
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:40,570
These people that come to this place and
they occupy the spot,

1970
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:44,140
but there's a bunch of people that have
been here and their ancestors has been

1971
01:23:44,141 --> 01:23:48,100
here for a thousand plus years and this
is kind of their area,

1972
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,170
but you can buy a spot.

1973
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:53,980
There were five days a week their whole
life and they can't buy a house,

1974
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:55,660
you know,
and then the whole,

1975
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,310
you know,
the whole,

1976
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,540
the whole runway where I live is filled
with private jets.

1977
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:00,130
Just sitting there waiting.
Really?

1978
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:03,400
Oh yeah.
People spend 50 million on their house.

1979
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,860
Like there's a,
there's every single one of those guys

1980
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:09,010
in the fortune $500.
A CEO is all the guys from every big

1981
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:11,800
giant tech company.
They all have houses where I live one

1982
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:14,000
week a year and their jet.
That's so strange.

1983
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,560
That's a good while to break in when
they're not there now they got top notch

1984
01:24:17,561 --> 01:24:19,800
security.
Think they wouldn't use it.

1985
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:22,600
Like tech guys.
Roseanne Barr is a friend of mine.

1986
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:24,060
She lives there.
Yeah.

1987
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:25,610
It's a cool place to live.
I mean it's,

1988
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:28,720
it's.
People understand why those people want

1989
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:30,070
to live there.
The weather's great.

1990
01:24:30,071 --> 01:24:31,060
It's a beautiful place.

1991
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,890
No one's,
no one's blaming them for living there.

1992
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:35,530
That's not the problem.
But the problem is them being

1993
01:24:35,531 --> 01:24:37,630
disrespectful to the people that do live
there.

1994
01:24:37,631 --> 01:24:41,110
And if you're going to be there,
relax toy,

1995
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,900
right in a big rush.
Don't overtake me.

1996
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,870
Don't drive like you live in an asshole.
This is not la.

1997
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:47,704
Yeah,
it's not.

1998
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:50,110
You know,
so just when you get to Hawaii,

1999
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,430
just relax a little bit.
Oh,

2000
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:54,070
I got that text shoe this morning.
The texts that you sent me.

2001
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,400
Fuck la traffic.
That's all it said.

2002
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:01,120
It.
She realized like this place is the

2003
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:06,180
exact opposite of the big island.
I mean this place is some strange sort

2004
01:25:06,191 --> 01:25:11,191
of magnet for Weirdos and everybody's
just getting sucked into this giant

2005
01:25:12,581 --> 01:25:16,510
population center.
And you try to get anywhere even in the

2006
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:17,220
middle of the day.
I mean you were,

2007
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:21,190
you were here at noon,
so you're driving around at 11:00 AM.

2008
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:22,750
Eleven am.
Everybody's at work.

2009
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:24,440
No big deal.
Yeah.

2010
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,950
Jammed bumper to bumper.
You should go out.

2011
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:29,860
Go out at four just so you want to kill
yourself.

2012
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,570
Just go get on the four or five at four
in the afternoon.

2013
01:25:32,571 --> 01:25:34,540
You'd be like,
what in the fuck is this?

2014
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,380
What is this?
If you get on the four,

2015
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:41,050
oh,
five between like 11 at night and four

2016
01:25:41,051 --> 01:25:42,940
in the morning.
You beat rush hour traffic.

2017
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:44,020
Yeah.
If you don't.

2018
01:25:44,021 --> 01:25:46,030
Maybe if you.
If you're.

2019
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:47,470
If you.
If it's light outside,

2020
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:48,850
it's rush hour.
Yeah,

2021
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:52,510
straight up.
Because I drove just now from San Diego

2022
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,490
to La.
I stopped in Orange County and get an

2023
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:55,840
MRI,
but I.

2024
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:57,580
It was rush hour traffic the whole way
up.

2025
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:00,010
There was a stop and go and it was like
it was.

2026
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,050
There was no accident.
There was no road construction.

2027
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:02,884
There's nothing.
That's.

2028
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,010
Well sometimes

2029
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,300
you'll be in a bumper to bumper stop.
It's a mile long at two in the morning.

2030
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:10,280
Yeah.
Fuck man.

2031
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:13,010
What the fuck is this as?
I don't know.

2032
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,000
That shit drives me crazy that a parking
in the street sweeping and then they

2033
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:18,530
have these like,
like the,

2034
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,530
like the technology,
like in places like Manhattan beach and

2035
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:22,910
Hermosa Beach,
they have like these,

2036
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,340
like the,
the parking meter dudes.

2037
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:28,730
They have a thing now where if the
parking meter,

2038
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,060
if your money runs out,
they get like a big.

2039
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,980
Like they know where you are and that
your parking meter ran out and they can

2040
01:26:36,981 --> 01:26:39,380
drive over there and they just go right
to it.

2041
01:26:39,381 --> 01:26:41,900
It's not hyper efficient technology to
give you tickets.

2042
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,030
Imagine like the revenue,
right?

2043
01:26:44,031 --> 01:26:44,864
It's like,
yeah,

2044
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,830
but that's kind of what drives me nuts.
That's Kinda what I was getting at when

2045
01:26:48,831 --> 01:26:50,030
I was asking about Hawaii.

2046
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:52,850
It was like,
there's different kinds of weirdness.

2047
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:54,620
There's a different kind of weird just
to live in there.

2048
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,750
And then there's a weirdness to living
here,

2049
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,800
which is the overpopulation weirdness
and the show Biz weirdness.

2050
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:02,930
Yeah.
Like what do you prefer?

2051
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,350
Oh Man.
You know,

2052
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,910
I don't know how I was born and raised
in Hawaii as you know,

2053
01:27:07,911 --> 01:27:12,560
like the pace I liked the.
I liked that no one gives a shit which

2054
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:17,561
school my kids go to or what I drive.
No one judges me if I drive a shitty car

2055
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,050
or they.
You better the opposite.

2056
01:27:21,051 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah.
And,

2057
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,850
and,
uh,

2058
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:23,571
I just,
I don't know,

2059
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:26,090
I dig that it's,
it's people,

2060
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,150
people,
people judge me on who I am as a person

2061
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:31,400
and what I do and how I,
I know,

2062
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:36,410
I feel like it's a little bit more,
it's just a little bit more real I guess

2063
01:27:36,411 --> 01:27:37,290
and just,
you know,

2064
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:40,040
more down to earth where I live,
but I also don't live in like the,

2065
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:41,750
you know,
I live in kind of a small town,

2066
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:46,790
so it's like coffee farms and ranches
and it's pretty chill where I live.

2067
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:47,810
Yeah.
Yeah,

2068
01:27:47,811 --> 01:27:49,880
that's the weirdest thing about the big
island.

2069
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:51,710
Um,
I'm a big fan of the big island.

2070
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:54,560
I love visiting there,
but one of the craziest things about it

2071
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:58,730
is there's so many different ecosystems
in one island or you drive through this

2072
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,890
one area,
it's like completely dry.

2073
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:04,820
It looks like a desert and then you go
into another area is constantly raining.

2074
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,160
It's like a tropical rain forest,
like Hilo,

2075
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:09,200
like up in that area.
Yeah,

2076
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,570
it's wild.
I don't know,

2077
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:12,200
I,
I should look it up.

2078
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:13,990
But uh,
I have uh,

2079
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,110
the,
the big island of Hawaii,

2080
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:18,740
there's like all these,
like a climate zones and they always say

2081
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:21,500
that I forgot the exact numbers,
but it's like out of the,

2082
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,530
out of like these certain sort of
climate zones throughout the world,

2083
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:27,290
like the Big island has like 11 of the
13 or something like that.

2084
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:31,040
So like if you get in your car and drive
for two hours,

2085
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:35,090
you'll go through like a,
like if you just like happen to like go

2086
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:37,760
to sleep and wake up like 15 minutes
later everything looks different and go

2087
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:39,080
to sleep,
wake up 15 minutes later,

2088
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:42,170
everything looks different and it
changes so much.

2089
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:43,004
You know,
it's wild,

2090
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:48,220
it's like a lot of feel desert and like,
like a dry land forest and there's like

2091
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:51,830
a rain forest and jungle and it was just
bizarre.

2092
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:55,250
Well that's the other thing about the
big island is that there's sometimes

2093
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,630
snow there.
Oh yeah,

2094
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:59,480
go snowboarding sometimes.
What the fuck?

2095
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:02,970
Where's the happened?
Like build a kicker and like launch off

2096
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:03,804
it.
And

2097
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:07,530
that's what we do.
And when it was snowing and I was in

2098
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,700
high school,
we drive up there,

2099
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:12,780
I try to go every year to the
observatory.

2100
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:13,810
Keck observatory.
Yeah.

2101
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,880
When it's,
when there's no moon,

2102
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:20,970
so you could see the stars just to freak
myself out because I went once many

2103
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:25,180
years ago and it just changed my world
and I am the one experience changed the

2104
01:29:25,181 --> 01:29:27,070
way it was,
like literally being on a spaceship and

2105
01:29:27,071 --> 01:29:29,390
changed the way I looked at the world
because um,

2106
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:32,860
for people don't know,
there's all these light diffusers.

2107
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:37,570
There's diffused light lamps all around
the big island so that it doesn't give

2108
01:29:37,571 --> 01:29:39,550
any light pollution to the keck
observatory.

2109
01:29:39,551 --> 01:29:43,690
Which one of the biggest telescopes in
the continental United States or in the

2110
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:44,890
continental United States,
right?

2111
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:47,380
It's not technically in the U,
s in the world.

2112
01:29:47,381 --> 01:29:49,920
I think even the clarity and,
and uh,

2113
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:52,390
and no light pollution there.
It's beautiful.

2114
01:29:52,391 --> 01:29:55,730
You go up there and you see every star
and it just seems.

2115
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:59,590
It seems like you're on a spaceship.
It's like you're on a spaceship and

2116
01:29:59,591 --> 01:30:01,150
you're looking through a portal.
Yeah,

2117
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:03,400
that's what it looks like.
That's literally what it looks like.

2118
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:04,660
Yeah.
And it,

2119
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,610
it,
it almost hurts your brain.

2120
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,650
It's like,
is this up there all the time?

2121
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:11,990
Not to open a can of worms,
but did you follow that whole a

2122
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:13,970
telescope thing last year on the Big
Island?

2123
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:15,560
Oh,
about the construction.

2124
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:16,580
Thirty meter telescope

2125
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:19,200
that they were trying to do and they
said it was sacred lands.

2126
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,530
We couldn't build it.
Yeah.

2127
01:30:20,531 --> 01:30:22,090
Well explain that.
You are up on it.

2128
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,331
That's it.
I mean,

2129
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:24,150
uh,
the,

2130
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:25,250
the,
the land,

2131
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:30,670
the land where the telescopes are built
are considered sacred land by a lot of.

2132
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,100
I mean basically like every single
Hawaiian group that there is,

2133
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:38,570
but there's a designated,
there's a designated area within that

2134
01:30:38,571 --> 01:30:42,450
sacred land that is designated for like
astronomy and you know,

2135
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,603
all that stuff.
So,

2136
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:48,860
but they have like all these giant giant
telescopes that are owned by different

2137
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:50,930
countries,
like China has theirs and the US has

2138
01:30:50,931 --> 01:30:52,820
theirs and Soviet Union,
whatever,

2139
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:53,571
whatever.
They like.

2140
01:30:53,571 --> 01:30:56,690
All these big countries span all these
billions of dollars to make their

2141
01:30:56,691 --> 01:30:59,870
telescopes and there's some of them that
are completely obsolete and they're not

2142
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:03,830
even being used anymore,
so instead of taking those four or five

2143
01:31:03,831 --> 01:31:06,260
down that they're not even using anymore
and building a new big one,

2144
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:07,730
they just wanted to build a whole
another big one.

2145
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,480
So there was people were up in arms
about it and it was going to be the

2146
01:31:11,481 --> 01:31:13,040
largest building on the big island as
well,

2147
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:15,640
so people were just up in arms about it
and,

2148
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:17,620
and there was all kinds of um,
you know,

2149
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:21,950
people got super activated and really
started protesting the whole thing and

2150
01:31:21,951 --> 01:31:25,400
blocking the road and people were
getting arrested and all my friends were

2151
01:31:25,401 --> 01:31:28,520
involved and everybody was,
was against it and protesting.

2152
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,290
It was pretty wild

2153
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:32,260
because they just didn't want the
construction to continue and make bigger

2154
01:31:32,261 --> 01:31:34,420
things.
So they felt it seems inefficient.

2155
01:31:34,421 --> 01:31:35,680
Right.
It seems like they should be able to

2156
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,560
take down the old ones and put up a more
modern one.

2157
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:39,590
Yeah.
There was,

2158
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:43,400
there was not really any Hawaiian groups
that were against the technology and

2159
01:31:43,401 --> 01:31:46,430
against the space exploration.
It wasn't anything about that.

2160
01:31:46,431 --> 01:31:49,220
It was the fact that it was,
they felt like they were being

2161
01:31:49,221 --> 01:31:52,010
disrespect because it was sacred land
that was not meant to,

2162
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,290
you know,
build giant observatories there.

2163
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,570
And,
and the fact that there was all these

2164
01:31:56,571 --> 01:31:59,780
ones that weren't being used is not in
the front.

2165
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,770
Crazy is actually my truck is in the
back,

2166
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:05,710
happens around here all the time.
Yeah.

2167
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,410
It was a wild time.
And I,

2168
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:10,300
and it was a weird because uh,
the,

2169
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:11,463
you know,
the,

2170
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:13,240
the,
the construction company that was

2171
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:16,540
building it,
they had the permit already had the

2172
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:19,510
financing already and they had the
Hawaiian government backing,

2173
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,750
backing them.
I thought it was over.

2174
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,990
I thought for sure there was no way to
stop the thing and it was amazing.

2175
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,830
Like people really got activated like
through,

2176
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:31,470
through social media and everybody just
got up in arms about it.

2177
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:33,010
Everyone around the world knew about it
and,

2178
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:35,230
and they ended up stopping it.
That's incredible.

2179
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:37,690
Is incredible.
I wonder if that's a good thing or a bad

2180
01:32:37,691 --> 01:32:41,380
thing because I'm a big fan of space
exploration and I'm a big fan of what

2181
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:44,070
they find out what these telescopes.
Yup.

2182
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:48,090
But it seems like if they have
telescopes through not using anymore,

2183
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,550
maybe it's just a financial issue or
cost a lot of money to break them down

2184
01:32:51,551 --> 01:32:56,551
and put a new one in the place and it's
not as financially efficient as starting

2185
01:32:58,001 --> 01:32:58,650
a new one.
Well,

2186
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:01,180
it's always one of those things where
it's like it's,

2187
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:02,103
you know,
in,

2188
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,800
in white everything sacred.
Unless you have enough money.

2189
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:07,990
It's like America in that way.
It's like if you,

2190
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:10,260
if you want that beach front house,
nope.

2191
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:11,320
You can't have it.
Oh,

2192
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:12,550
you got enough money.
No worries.

2193
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,230
You know,
if you're willing to pay like crazy for

2194
01:33:14,231 --> 01:33:14,650
it.
Yeah.

2195
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:18,310
So if you want to build a observatory on
the big island,

2196
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:23,970
you can't do it unless you have enough
money to put $100 million into the,

2197
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:29,440
into the education system in Hawaii and
grease all the right politicians and get

2198
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:30,840
it all through.
And Yeah,

2199
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:33,970
a lot has to happen for one of those
things to be built and then the

2200
01:33:33,971 --> 01:33:35,620
contracts,
everyone's fighting over like the

2201
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:38,590
building contracts because it's going to
cost two point $8 billion to build a

2202
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:40,810
thing.
So there's a lot going on,

2203
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:41,840
a lot of,
um,

2204
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:45,400
a lot of crazy politics happening behind
the scenes to get that space exploration

2205
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:47,380
happening.
So that's unfortunate.

2206
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,930
Yeah.
And I don't think there's more than

2207
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:51,910
100,000 people on the whole island,
right?

2208
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,073
Yeah,
there's,

2209
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:53,240
yeah.

2210
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,450
There's bar now.
How many people live?

2211
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,080
Long Island?
I think it's roughly between 150 and

2212
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:02,470
200,000 now.
And when did that change?

2213
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:05,260
That's just slowly going out.
A lot of people are moving there,

2214
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,910
especially to the Kona side where I
live,

2215
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:09,250
there's a lot more people moving there
permanently,

2216
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,730
man,
it looks like lame on dope place to

2217
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,800
live.
It's a good place to live.

2218
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:17,110
I mean it's,
it's don't move there.

2219
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:21,380
If you're listening to this,
you got nothing people down holly's are

2220
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,320
you one of those so you don't count as a
holly?

2221
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,220
No,
I'm just kidding.

2222
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,470
Are you one of those?
Do you ever get called one of those?

2223
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:28,480
Uh,
rarely,

2224
01:34:28,481 --> 01:34:30,460
but I am a holiday.
I have white skin,

2225
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:33,830
you know,
but I don't know,

2226
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:35,950
I mean I,
I feel like that's,

2227
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:37,940
I'm not from anywhere else.
Right.

2228
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:41,350
I'm not from,
I'm from New York City or from

2229
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,400
Afghanistan.

2230
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,380
But do you,
do you know how to talk pigeon?

2231
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,970
I know how to talk to Virginia,
like if you were going to say do it or

2232
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:50,490
Rogan show,
he won't do it.

2233
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:55,060
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous speaking ebonics when I,

2234
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,140
yeah,
when I,

2235
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:58,540
I don't speak pigeon,
but when I'm having beers with,

2236
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,443
with uh,
with,

2237
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:00,403
with uh,
you know,

2238
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:02,360
when I'm at home and I'm a couple of
beers deep and yeah,

2239
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:04,340
it starts slipping out every now and
then.

2240
01:35:04,341 --> 01:35:05,121
But yeah.
Oh,

2241
01:35:05,121 --> 01:35:07,700
so it's something that you did when you
were younger?

2242
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:08,563
A little bit,
yeah.

2243
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,820
Just to get along.
And it's just,

2244
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:11,900
I dunno know,
it's just,

2245
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,000
it's very typical to when people,
most local peoples speak pidgin

2246
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:16,611
wireless.
Yeah.

2247
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:18,710
Bj Penn was explaining it to me once.
Yeah.

2248
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:22,670
And he was like saying like how you
would say things and that some people

2249
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:26,300
turn it on and off,
but I just speak normal English.

2250
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:27,710
Well,
it's a cool sound.

2251
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:29,000
It sounds cool.
It's interesting.

2252
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:31,340
It's very friendly.
Sort of a fun.

2253
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:35,190
It is way to relaxed way.
My parents regal,

2254
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:36,960
my parents were,
were uh,

2255
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:40,070
would've killed me if I spoke in the
house.

2256
01:35:40,071 --> 01:35:41,120
Yeah,
there was not cool.

2257
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:42,830
Plus it's like,
yeah,

2258
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:45,950
I dunno.
I am a white guy so it's not.

2259
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,320
I am not like a,
you know,

2260
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:50,090
I didn't grow up in a Hawaiian family
where everyone spoke.

2261
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:51,500
Pigeon.
So did your parents moved there?

2262
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:53,450
Yeah.
My Dad was from La.

2263
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,740
My Dad is from my dad or some this town.
He went to Hollywood high school,

2264
01:35:57,830 --> 01:36:02,510
Surf Malibu and he,
he raced cars and he was a stunt man.

2265
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,310
He was a,
he was a stunt man for Elvis.

2266
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:06,300
Elvis couldn't swim.
What?

2267
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,510
Elvis couldn't swim.
I couldn't swim.

2268
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:12,100
Honeymaid pulmonary on pills.
I think that he would float cookies.

2269
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:13,010
All bloated.
No kidding,

2270
01:36:13,011 --> 01:36:14,820
right.
That was fat elvis.

2271
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:16,790
He was,
he was in his prime back then.

2272
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:17,810
But uh,
yeah.

2273
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:20,000
So my dad did a bunch of movies with
him.

2274
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,090
I'm like blue,
Hawaii and all that.

2275
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:25,250
He had like a series of movies that were
all filmed in Hawaii and elvis couldn't

2276
01:36:25,251 --> 01:36:26,061
swim,
so my dad was,

2277
01:36:26,061 --> 01:36:28,190
the,
was a stunt double for all those movies

2278
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:33,460
and they just decided to stay and he,
he just got sick of La and uh,

2279
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:37,480
he hated the parking guys.
No,

2280
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:40,160
I think he just,
he went to Hawaii and fell in love with

2281
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:40,994
it.
He,

2282
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:45,020
he ended up like moving on,
moving to a Wahoo and served and hung

2283
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:49,670
out and met a bunch of local people that
he liked and he liked the lifestyle and

2284
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,830
how people were there and ended up
moving into.

2285
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:57,310
My mom went to college and she was from
Ohio and right when she graduated high

2286
01:36:58,071 --> 01:36:59,990
school she moved to Hawaii and went to
uhh.

2287
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,110
Well I know a dozen.
Woody Harrelson live in Hawaii.

2288
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:05,340
Yeah.
That's where the best weed is really

2289
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,790
best.
We'd listen if there's better way than

2290
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:09,980
what I have.
Keep it the fuck away from me.

2291
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:12,500
Whoever's got better,
we'd stay away.

2292
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:16,960
You can't get any better.
There's a lot of ways that our hands are

2293
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:19,010
young people always want to say that.
Like someone said,

2294
01:37:19,011 --> 01:37:19,581
no,
I'm just kidding.

2295
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:22,760
But we're talking about Colorado weed
isn't basically legal.

2296
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:23,870
Basically illegal.
It's pretty.

2297
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,490
It's pretty casual where I live,
I'm sure,

2298
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:27,770
but it's not.
I hear if somebody wanted to fuck with

2299
01:37:27,771 --> 01:37:29,240
you,
they could technically.

2300
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,170
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2301
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:31,190
yeah.
See,

2302
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:34,220
that's the thing about like Colorado
Colorado's wide open.

2303
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,113
Yeah.
It's just,

2304
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:37,430
there's nothing you just can't,
you know,

2305
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:38,900
it's just,
it's just legal.

2306
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:40,940
Yeah.
Nobody can go to jail unless the feds

2307
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:43,280
come in and then you get like,
some you don't want to fuck with

2308
01:37:43,281 --> 01:37:44,060
Colorado people.

2309
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:47,030
There's a lot of guns in Colorado.
That'd be a weird place for the feds to

2310
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,290
kind of evade.
That.

2311
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,890
Gives a lot of people like that.
Like woody Haroldson guys like,

2312
01:37:50,891 --> 01:37:51,331
I mean,
you know,

2313
01:37:51,331 --> 01:37:52,141
I mean,
I don't know what He.

2314
01:37:52,141 --> 01:37:52,974
But uh,
I've,

2315
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,160
I've,
I have friends who've known him on Maui.

2316
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,760
They say he's just chill,
just,

2317
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:59,430
he just likes to likes to Hawaii
lifestyle,

2318
01:37:59,431 --> 01:38:00,470
you know,
relax.

2319
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:04,560
It was a very nice guy by all accounts.
I ran into this couple the other day at

2320
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:06,090
the comedy store and they,
uh,

2321
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,960
they moved from La to Hawaii.
They live in Maui now and I'm,

2322
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,900
the girl hates it.
The dude loves it.

2323
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:16,980
It was interesting talking to them
because the dude works at a resort

2324
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:17,590
there.
He's like,

2325
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:19,530
it is the fucking best place in the
world live.

2326
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,240
Everybody's relaxed.
It's super cool.

2327
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:22,620
The weather's amazing.

2328
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,240
It's beautiful.
And the girl was like,

2329
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:25,730
I gotta get the fuck out of here.
Yeah.

2330
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:31,580
So my wife is a moved from La to Kona.
She went to Ucla and then she worked for

2331
01:38:33,031 --> 01:38:34,630
Warner Brothers television.
Whoa.

2332
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:36,960
Yeah.
So she was on the grind.

2333
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,470
Is that what you met her?
I met her.

2334
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:41,250
I met her in San Diego years ago,
like before,

2335
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:43,830
like right when she graduated high
school and started going in to like a

2336
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:45,540
little college there.
And you're like,

2337
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:48,430
you come in with me.
Women will go into a rock in the middle

2338
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:50,310
of the ocean basically.
I'm moving into a volcano.

2339
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,960
So she looks like a Hawaiian.
Actually she's,

2340
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,370
she's,
she's half Japanese.

2341
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,500
Oh,
that's beautiful and convenient.

2342
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:58,440
So she looks like a local,
so everyone thinks I am the holly and

2343
01:38:58,441 --> 01:39:00,330
she's a local girl.
Uh,

2344
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:03,480
so they think you snagged up a good one.
I did,

2345
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:06,300
but they took one of their local girls.

2346
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:07,890
So,
so anyway.

2347
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:11,520
And,
but it's funny because when I asked her

2348
01:39:11,521 --> 01:39:13,470
to marry me and to move to Hawaii with
me,

2349
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:16,230
it was like look like,
like this is where I live.

2350
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,660
Like you're not from like,
you're not really.

2351
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:21,780
She's not really from anywhere.
She was like born in the east coast,

2352
01:39:21,781 --> 01:39:23,740
like live all over the Midwest.
Um,

2353
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,100
she moved a million different times,
you know,

2354
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:28,680
her dad had for,
for his work was moving all over the

2355
01:39:28,681 --> 01:39:30,630
place and I went to high school and
college in California.

2356
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:34,530
So when she moved to Hawaii she moved to
La and she was in the entertainment

2357
01:39:34,531 --> 01:39:36,690
business.
So she was,

2358
01:39:36,691 --> 01:39:40,560
she went from 10th gear to first gear,
was like crazy downshift.

2359
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:41,371
So she's like,
yeah,

2360
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:42,204
that'd be fine.
That'd be,

2361
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:43,080
it'd be awesome.
Where,

2362
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:43,741
you know,
I'm like,

2363
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:45,330
I'll,
I'll do whatever it takes.

2364
01:39:45,331 --> 01:39:46,170
You're the right one.

2365
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:48,350
You've got to move to Hawaii.
We're going to do this,

2366
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,790
do this whole deal,
the family life,

2367
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:52,280
the whole deal in Hawaii.
Um,

2368
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:56,680
but she moved there and melted down.
Yeah.

2369
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:01,140
Oh yeah.
I had these terrifying moments where I

2370
01:40:01,141 --> 01:40:02,850
thought I was going to have to move to
la.

2371
01:40:02,990 --> 01:40:04,320
Whoa.
Yeah.

2372
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,530
And I would have,
I would've done anything for her and,

2373
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,590
and I,
and I told her,

2374
01:40:07,591 --> 01:40:07,921
I'm like,
Hey,

2375
01:40:07,921 --> 01:40:09,530
the Hawaii thing doesn't work out with
him,

2376
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:11,370
you know,
I'll try and move to California.

2377
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:13,730
So what was the meltdown over,
you know,

2378
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:15,230
just like,
uh,

2379
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,910
her friends,
her job,

2380
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:19,500
her life was all in La,
right?

2381
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:21,930
Shelly?
She left everything behind,

2382
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,270
sacrificed everything and move to where
I live,

2383
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,120
where my family is,
my friends and she didn't have any of

2384
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:27,954
that.
So.

2385
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:29,280
And then,
you know,

2386
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,470
she had a hard time for awhile,
but as soon as she met a couple of

2387
01:40:31,471 --> 01:40:33,480
friends and it was all good and now
it's,

2388
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,890
you couldn't prior away from the place.

2389
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:38,430
Now she loves it where I live.
So she's a local girl now.

2390
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,780
Wow.
That's interesting.

2391
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:42,180
But it took a while until,
until she got friends there,

2392
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:45,840
she was like,
the whole Hawaii thing was on thin ice.

2393
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,970
That's how it always is though,
with people,

2394
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:49,500
you know,
when you move to a new place,

2395
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:51,960
it's fucking hard to be alone.
It's hard to be lonely.

2396
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,220
It's lonely.
It's to meet people that you actually

2397
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:55,390
liked to.
Oh yeah.

2398
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:57,580
Especially if you're from La,
moved to Hawaii.

2399
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,110
It's like,
you know,

2400
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:01,440
she's,
she's not like a whole,

2401
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:04,150
she's not like a local,
a local girl,

2402
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,010
you know,
there's like a typical local girl.

2403
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:09,610
Um,
and I don't get myself in hot water,

2404
01:41:09,611 --> 01:41:11,500
but she wasn't one of those.
She was,

2405
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:14,200
you know,
she just had a hard time finding that

2406
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:16,500
first good friend.
She was California nysed.

2407
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,940
Yes.
Yeah.

2408
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:23,020
Well I would think that like activities
like for you surfing,

2409
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,940
obviously you wouldn't meet other
surfers.

2410
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,460
A bowhunting,
you'd meet other bowhunters,

2411
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:30,130
you find common ground,
you'd make some friends if you had to

2412
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:33,970
move to a place like that.
But if you don't have like a real

2413
01:41:33,971 --> 01:41:37,690
obvious thing that you like to do that
other people like to do as well.

2414
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:39,310
I would say that would become a real
issue.

2415
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,480
It would.
It would because you know,

2416
01:41:42,230 --> 01:41:45,250
I think you feel like you lose your
identity and that's the way to live and

2417
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:47,920
no you don't.
You don't want to like move somewhere or

2418
01:41:47,921 --> 01:41:50,350
live some life where you don't really
know what's going on or don't know why

2419
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:52,990
you're doing what you're doing.
For me it would be super hard to not be

2420
01:41:52,991 --> 01:41:54,730
around comedians.
Yeah.

2421
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,210
Like I'm so used to being around fucked
up people that make jokes about

2422
01:41:58,211 --> 01:42:02,890
everything and anything and comedians
are just so unusual in the way they

2423
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:04,830
behave and you get used to them.

2424
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,490
It becomes normal.
You know,

2425
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:10,060
I'm used to being around the comedy
store and places like that and just the

2426
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:12,670
sharpness and the quickness and that is
that,

2427
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:17,690
that people's brains work in comedy or
even just even just in La,

2428
01:42:18,161 --> 01:42:22,660
just the pace of how quick people are
thinking and talking and acting and

2429
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:25,690
being in living.
Then you go to a place like Hawaii.

2430
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,710
It takes most people like three or four
or five days or a week to just chill the

2431
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:31,530
hell out and relax a little bit.
Yeah,

2432
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:35,230
just unwind.
Maybe just on vacation and that's why

2433
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:38,410
the whole like bow hunting thing,
like how good does it feel to just

2434
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:40,150
unplug your phone?
It feels good.

2435
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,400
Good.
Turn my phone off and leave it behind

2436
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,450
and I just.
Awesome.

2437
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:47,110
Doesn't it also feel weird when you're a
place that has no signals?

2438
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,200
There's nothing going on there.

2439
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:51,400
There's no phone signal,
there's no Wifi.

2440
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:53,800
It almost feels like the air feels
different.

2441
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:55,400
The ultimate,
uh,

2442
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:59,170
ultimate excuse though to why you can't
get back to people because I'm terrible.

2443
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,370
I hate the phone.
I hate it with a passion text message.

2444
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,750
Fine email.
Okay.

2445
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,620
Fallen.
No,

2446
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:07,150
don't call me.
Oh,

2447
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:12,270
actual phone calls.
Way Too into constantly interacting with

2448
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,850
all the time.
I want to communicate when I want to

2449
01:43:15,851 --> 01:43:17,200
communicate.
That's my text messages.

2450
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,990
So good.
It's like you can text someone and when

2451
01:43:19,991 --> 01:43:24,190
they feel like they're gonna answer,
no text messages is really good in that

2452
01:43:24,191 --> 01:43:24,980
way.
It's.

2453
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:28,990
I used to think text messages were
stupid and now I think like phone calls

2454
01:43:28,991 --> 01:43:31,360
are stupid for the most part,
same even email.

2455
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:35,590
It's also you don't have enough time
with people constantly being on their

2456
01:43:35,591 --> 01:43:38,570
phone and constantly like being
connected to things.

2457
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:41,920
You remember a time where there's
reflection alone time,

2458
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,990
relaxing time,
just thinking about shit.

2459
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,280
Yeah,
you know,

2460
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:48,280
and that's,
I think for me at least that's what I

2461
01:43:48,281 --> 01:43:51,740
make a lot of my life decisions,
like where I want to go or what

2462
01:43:51,741 --> 01:43:52,160
direction

2463
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,670
I want to go when I'm alone and I could
just think about what's going on,

2464
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,380
what's,
what's bugging me about my life.

2465
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:59,570
Like this is too busy,
this is too much bullshit,

2466
01:43:59,571 --> 01:44:02,180
this is too much hassle.
I need to get the fuck away from that.

2467
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:06,230
And when I'm constantly on the grind,
I don't think like that.

2468
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:08,070
My constantly on the grind,
I'm like,

2469
01:44:08,071 --> 01:44:09,470
God,
I got to juggle this and then this is

2470
01:44:09,471 --> 01:44:11,030
coming on and then that's coming up
next.

2471
01:44:11,031 --> 01:44:15,290
And that's what's appealing to me about
a place like Hawaii is like there's no

2472
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:16,410
juggling man.
Yeah,

2473
01:44:17,370 --> 01:44:18,203
yeah.
That's great.

2474
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,090
It's a lot for most people though,
you know,

2475
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:22,410
it's,
it's,

2476
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,660
it's definitely different.
It's definitely different.

2477
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:28,800
Yeah.
Have you ever done a back country solo

2478
01:44:28,801 --> 01:44:29,634
bow hunting trip?

2479
01:44:30,190 --> 01:44:31,770
I'm not solo.
No.

2480
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:32,930
You have to.
Yeah.

2481
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:35,780
You have to worry about fucking breaking
my leg out in the middle of

2482
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,860
or it's have to do it.
I have to break my leg.

2483
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:39,300
No,
no,

2484
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:40,590
bring a sat phone.
Oh,

2485
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:41,370
okay.
Yeah.

2486
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:42,660
Rent a sat phone.
Yeah,

2487
01:44:42,661 --> 01:44:44,160
the sat phone rental.
Boom.

2488
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,540
You got your,
you got your sat phone.

2489
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:47,610
You can call it.
You can bring an iep or bring whatever

2490
01:44:47,611 --> 01:44:52,611
safety stuff you want to do.
Five day back country by yourself.

2491
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:56,040
Where do you go when you do those?
I do at home.

2492
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:58,290
Doing home in Hawaii.
You know,

2493
01:44:58,410 --> 01:45:03,090
or I'll do it on Lanai or do you go?
I do it around my house where there's

2494
01:45:03,091 --> 01:45:05,220
vast open spaces where I live,
so I can do it.

2495
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:07,620
You bring a temp in a lot of other
places.

2496
01:45:07,621 --> 01:45:09,950
You kinda sorta can't do it.
I'm too,

2497
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:12,200
they're illegal or,
or it's not.

2498
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:15,450
The areas aren't large enough to like
just really get out,

2499
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,910
but yeah.
Do the tent to the Super Ultra light

2500
01:45:17,911 --> 01:45:18,090
thing.

2501
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:19,920
I bring my own water,
um,

2502
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,100
are all being.
If there's water in the area,

2503
01:45:22,101 --> 01:45:24,580
I'll bring upon whole deal ultra light
bag,

2504
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:26,770
ultralight 10 ultra light.
The whole,

2505
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:29,490
like all my sleeping gear.
A lot of times I'll do the baby thing

2506
01:45:29,491 --> 01:45:32,160
where you hunt all day and then you
sleep wherever it gets dark,

2507
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:33,180
you know,
and that's the best.

2508
01:45:33,181 --> 01:45:34,840
But just the,
uh,

2509
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,250
you know what you were saying about
like,

2510
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:38,400
you know,
being alone to think finally,

2511
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,070
it's like,
I dunno,

2512
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:44,460
like even it's like we're so used to
being entertained all the time.

2513
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:46,470
Yeah.
And that's something that like people

2514
01:45:46,471 --> 01:45:48,750
are addicted to,
like whether it's your phone or even

2515
01:45:48,751 --> 01:45:51,360
like if me and you went hunting a lot of
time,

2516
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:54,300
I'd be your entertainment or you'd be my
entertainment,

2517
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:58,650
but when no one's entertaining you and
you're by yourself and you're just out

2518
01:45:58,651 --> 01:46:01,480
there and you're making your own fires
and you're waking up and,

2519
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:04,200
and you're doing your own hunt and
you're not relying on a guide or a

2520
01:46:04,201 --> 01:46:05,630
friend or,
okay,

2521
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,300
I'm going to hunt over there.

2522
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:09,000
You Hunt over here and you're just doing
your own thing and even if you're not

2523
01:46:09,001 --> 01:46:10,500
even a hunting,
just being silent,

2524
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:13,200
you're not talking to yourself so you're
not talking to anybody.

2525
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:15,750
You're not talking to your phone,
you're not communicating with anyone.

2526
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:19,740
And after four or five days I did this
at home,

2527
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:22,200
I did a hunt where I left my house,
had my wife,

2528
01:46:22,201 --> 01:46:25,770
dropped me off and I ended this long
walk over this giant mountain,

2529
01:46:26,610 --> 01:46:31,020
bad idea,
but it was awesomely fun and I camped

2530
01:46:31,021 --> 01:46:35,340
out for like four days and I ended up
hurting my leg really bad.

2531
01:46:35,341 --> 01:46:39,630
I like pulled a muscle behind my knee
and I was planning on going back and

2532
01:46:39,631 --> 01:46:44,631
having my wife picked me up again and
I'm halfway there and normally you have

2533
01:46:45,511 --> 01:46:49,710
no service in this area.
It's like a black zone and so I hiked to

2534
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:53,940
an area where I just,
I found service and I couldn't walk

2535
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:54,774
back.

2536
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:56,130
I was,
I was too screwed up.

2537
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:57,420
My knee was screwed up.
Anyway,

2538
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,250
I called my friend who had access to
enroll to,

2539
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:02,820
to a ranch at the very top of this
ranch.

2540
01:47:02,821 --> 01:47:06,360
I could walk to it.
So it was like another day's walk and a

2541
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:07,750
whole day walking.
Yeah,

2542
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:09,690
with a fucked up leg.
Yeah.

2543
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:14,610
Slowly walking and I called him and I
said,

2544
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:15,444
hey,
you know,

2545
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,390
can you pick me up on Tuesday at the
rat?

2546
01:47:17,391 --> 01:47:17,821
And he's like,
yeah,

2547
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:19,740
I'm going to be up there anyway,
I can come pick you up at the top.

2548
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:24,330
And so he picks me up and after five
days he got out of the,

2549
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:28,410
out of the car and he was talking to me
like I'm talking to you.

2550
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,450
And it sounded like he was yelling at
me.

2551
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,250
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2552
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:37,800
So weird as,
so used to like this silence that was,

2553
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:41,160
sounded like he was yelling at me and I
was like staring at him.

2554
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:42,560
I must've been looking at them really
well,

2555
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:46,940
we're like,
but you gotta do you got to be

2556
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:49,010
by yourself?
Totally alone with no,

2557
01:47:49,011 --> 01:47:52,520
like no communication for like at least
three days.

2558
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:53,680
Do you know?
Just for,

2559
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:54,680
just for good experience.

2560
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:56,730
Do you know Adam Green Tree is from
Australia?

2561
01:47:56,731 --> 01:47:57,450
I do,
yeah.

2562
01:47:57,450 --> 01:47:59,430
I was hunting with them just maybe a
month ago.

2563
01:47:59,490 --> 01:48:00,060
Oh,
okay.

2564
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:01,250
Cool,
well he,

2565
01:48:01,251 --> 01:48:04,590
he's a good buddy of mine.
We've been bear hunting before he hung

2566
01:48:04,591 --> 01:48:06,330
out with them and cap been great.
Great Guy.

2567
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,510
Hung out with them in Australia when I
was there for the UFC to.

2568
01:48:08,570 --> 01:48:11,040
He is a killer.
It is a bad ass hunter.

2569
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:11,990
He's a bad ass on.
He's,

2570
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:16,020
he's just a bad ass dude.
But he was telling me that when he goes

2571
01:48:16,021 --> 01:48:21,021
off to these trips because he does most
of his hunt solo and that's like really,

2572
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:24,420
really weird.
He detaches and you like centers

2573
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:27,240
himself,
but he says he comes back after being

2574
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:31,770
out there for eight or nine days and he
hasn't said a word in eight or nine

2575
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,810
days.
He says it just feels weird to talk to

2576
01:48:33,811 --> 01:48:34,430
people.
Yeah,

2577
01:48:34,430 --> 01:48:36,390
yeah.
Just feels weird to say words.

2578
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:37,820
Yeah,
it does.

2579
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:40,190
And it's,
it's cool man.

2580
01:48:40,191 --> 01:48:43,370
It puts a lot of shit and perspective
about what you're planning on doing and

2581
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:45,890
you know,
the next 10 years or what's happening in

2582
01:48:45,891 --> 01:48:47,450
your life or you know,
whatever it is,

2583
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:49,850
you know,
not to get deep in here,

2584
01:48:49,851 --> 01:48:51,800
but it's,
it's a trip man.

2585
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:52,670
It really is.
I did,

2586
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:56,320
I did,
I did nine days by myself in Colorado

2587
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:58,760
back country.
Do yourself in a tent.

2588
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:01,250
It's snow for five of the days.
Where'd you go?

2589
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:03,650
Um,
one time I went and,

2590
01:49:03,651 --> 01:49:05,300
uh,
kind of in the mountains near

2591
01:49:05,301 --> 01:49:08,680
Breckenridge.
And then another time I went in a

2592
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:11,330
mountain range called the Santa Santa
Decristo mountains.

2593
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:14,900
It's in the southern part of the state
in some steep shit,

2594
01:49:14,901 --> 01:49:18,800
some really gnarly stuff and hike like
eight miles back with my ultra light

2595
01:49:18,801 --> 01:49:21,320
stuff.
And I had hunted that area with a buddy

2596
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:26,120
of mine from home the year before and we
plan on going again and then he kicked

2597
01:49:26,121 --> 01:49:27,650
out last second because he couldn't make
it.

2598
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:28,760
So I was just like,
screw it,

2599
01:49:28,761 --> 01:49:30,140
I got a ticket,
I got tagged,

2600
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:33,870
I'm going by myself.
So I rented a sat phone just in case and

2601
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:37,760
I went there and I'm like,
the second day I walked like eight miles

2602
01:49:37,761 --> 01:49:39,200
back,
like as a bird flies,

2603
01:49:39,201 --> 01:49:42,260
right?
So it's like a really long walk and uh,

2604
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:43,160
but that's where the elk were

2605
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:46,440
meaning long walk for people.
Look at what was that as the bird flies,

2606
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:48,100
if you go in a straight line,
it's eight

2607
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,770
miles,
but you're going up and down,

2608
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:51,040
up and down.
So it's way more than

2609
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:55,700
I parked at like 8,500 feet and camped
at 10,500 feet,

2610
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,680
which is the highest water I could
combat.

2611
01:49:57,681 --> 01:49:58,490
Right.
Wow.

2612
01:49:58,490 --> 01:50:02,660
And the elk were at like 11,500 feet.
So it was a lot of hiking,

2613
01:50:02,661 --> 01:50:05,450
a lot of walking and just being by
yourself.

2614
01:50:05,451 --> 01:50:07,580
And then,
and then the snow component for somebody

2615
01:50:07,581 --> 01:50:08,450
from Hawaii,
you know,

2616
01:50:08,451 --> 01:50:12,080
it's like it was snowing every day and I
was cooking in my tent and eating and

2617
01:50:12,081 --> 01:50:15,640
it's snowing and an elk were coming in
at night and screaming her guts out.

2618
01:50:15,641 --> 01:50:17,840
And um,
then there was like a crazy,

2619
01:50:17,841 --> 01:50:21,350
like lightning storm and windstorm attic
at a pack of my tent the middle of the

2620
01:50:21,351 --> 01:50:22,300
night,
if that was going to blow over,

2621
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:26,300
I thought is going to hit me out of go
into like a dense a pine forest and

2622
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:28,520
reset up my 10 mil night during a
lightning storm.

2623
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:31,340
Call my wife and I in the middle of the
night and like,

2624
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:33,440
you know,
let her know exactly where I was just in

2625
01:50:33,441 --> 01:50:36,990
case the shit hit the fan,
but that type of stuff is um,

2626
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:39,340
you know,
a lot of barriers in that area and why

2627
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:40,280
anzalone shit.
So,

2628
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:43,250
um,
those type of experience for,

2629
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:44,930
for.
I didn't never had those kinds of

2630
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:46,850
experiences before I started hunting
ever.

2631
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,980
I never saw a stat,
that kind of country.

2632
01:50:48,981 --> 01:50:51,350
I never,
I never put myself in those kinds of

2633
01:50:51,351 --> 01:50:52,350
situations.
And,

2634
01:50:52,351 --> 01:50:55,330
and until I found bowhunting,
that's,

2635
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:57,680
that's a reason I was never like,
I'm going to go hiking,

2636
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:59,870
not a hiker.
I need to have like a purpose when I'm

2637
01:50:59,871 --> 01:51:00,441
hiking.
Right?

2638
01:51:00,441 --> 01:51:05,441
So I'm basically like a hiker with a bow
these days and that's what gets me out

2639
01:51:05,511 --> 01:51:09,140
to these kinds of places and had the,
some of the best experiences of my life

2640
01:51:09,141 --> 01:51:10,850
just because I found bow hunting.

2641
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:14,840
Well those,
those woods and like where you're going

2642
01:51:14,841 --> 01:51:17,630
these places where you're not going to
run into any other people,

2643
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,210
there's,
there's a feeling that you get from

2644
01:51:20,211 --> 01:51:21,800
those,
those environments.

2645
01:51:21,801 --> 01:51:26,000
It's almost like a loneliness in a way,
like a or almost like a.

2646
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:30,680
it's all right because it's so beautiful
and so incredible,

2647
01:51:30,681 --> 01:51:33,650
but it's also,
it's humbling and a bunch of different

2648
01:51:33,651 --> 01:51:35,510
ways.
One of the ways it's humbling because

2649
01:51:35,511 --> 01:51:37,580
this woods doesn't give a fuck about
you.

2650
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:39,020
Have you died?
It's like,

2651
01:51:39,050 --> 01:51:40,160
so what?
I am.

2652
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:44,690
Grizzlies keep fucking eating elk.
Keep having sex and screaming their

2653
01:51:44,691 --> 01:51:48,880
heads off and birds keep flying and
that's just how we've always done it.

2654
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:49,431
Dude.
Sorry,

2655
01:51:49,431 --> 01:51:50,350
you didn't make it.
Yeah,

2656
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:51,530
does.
You're right.

2657
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:52,490
It doesn't care.

2658
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:54,000
And you're alone,
like alone,

2659
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:58,330
alone in the dark night seems darker.
You know,

2660
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,870
the silent seems more silent.
Oh yeah.

2661
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:01,580
Way More.
You know,

2662
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:05,400
you get back to your tent and it's dark.
What's the big perspective enhancer?

2663
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:06,720
Yeah,
it is.

2664
01:52:07,670 --> 01:52:09,920
I went to Prince of Wales last year.
We,

2665
01:52:09,921 --> 01:52:11,570
uh,
we hunted on Prince of Wales Island

2666
01:52:11,630 --> 01:52:14,420
outside of Alaska.
It's fucking rained everyday.

2667
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,900
Just miserable every day.
And Moose,

2668
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:18,080
uh,
we were hunting.

2669
01:52:18,110 --> 01:52:20,480
Deer were hunting sickle blacktail very
cool.

2670
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,880
But I'm unsuccessful.
We didn't,

2671
01:52:22,881 --> 01:52:25,180
we struck out.
But when we came back hard,

2672
01:52:25,190 --> 01:52:26,630
it's hard.
It's real hard.

2673
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:28,670
There's not,
a lot of them were we were,

2674
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,090
uh,
we,

2675
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:30,320
we,
we fucked up.

2676
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:34,130
We got to a place where they had already
moved down towards the water and we were

2677
01:52:34,131 --> 01:52:36,020
up high.
Were you with cameras at hunt?

2678
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:37,370
No,
that was with Rinella.

2679
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:41,420
That was for the mediator show.
But one of the things about it was that

2680
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:44,680
feeling of like,
almost like a sadness look,

2681
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:46,220
so,
and gorgeous,

2682
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:48,410
like it would rain every day,
but every now and then the sun would

2683
01:52:48,411 --> 01:52:53,300
come up and when the sun would come up,
the sun would hit this incredible green.

2684
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:55,520
It would just,
it was like an illuminating like this,

2685
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:59,830
like it was lit up and um,
we can,

2686
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:04,870
we got back after seven days of this or
however many days or six days and

2687
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:10,330
everything in La seems so nice.
Was so warm and beautiful and I just

2688
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:13,780
loved it.
I was so happy and uh,

2689
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:15,440
I called Rinella up and I was like,
dude,

2690
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:17,390
I don't think I've ever been happier in
my life.

2691
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:21,320
I am so happy.
And it's because I was so miserable for

2692
01:53:21,321 --> 01:53:24,500
those days.
And that that's another perspective

2693
01:53:24,501 --> 01:53:27,980
enhancer to realize like,
you're so God damn lucky I have a roof

2694
01:53:27,981 --> 01:53:31,520
overhead and that you know,
you can listen to the radio in your car

2695
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:32,750
and then you could,
you know,

2696
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:37,430
you can get around and it's easy and you
could talk to be blowing your phone when

2697
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:38,840
you're out in the woods.

2698
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,030
Woods,
no cell phone service,

2699
01:53:41,031 --> 01:53:42,740
no nothing.
There's nothing.

2700
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:46,710
We have Amazon packages come into your
house and like food delivery and

2701
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,590
nothing.
No Pizza.

2702
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:50,660
You can order pizza.
There's fucking nothing,

2703
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:52,700
man.
We brought some food with us and that is

2704
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:57,340
what we ate because we struck out and
the cold and the wet,

2705
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:02,240
the wet
until you've been head to toe soaking

2706
01:54:02,241 --> 01:54:05,330
wet and your boots and your socks and
your pants and your rain gear and

2707
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:08,810
everything is everything that's supposed
to keep you warm and safe from the

2708
01:54:08,811 --> 01:54:12,410
elements is soaked to the bone and it's
getting cold.

2709
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:13,520
That's gnarly.
Well,

2710
01:54:13,521 --> 01:54:17,360
that's also where you appreciate really
good gear to Merino wool.

2711
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,530
Right?
You know,

2712
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:23,531
a will is a weird cloth in that like if
you have cotton on and you get wet,

2713
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:28,130
you're fucked.
But if you have wool on and you get wet,

2714
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:32,360
the wool actually retains the heat so
you could be wet and still warm,

2715
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:35,930
which is really unusual and hard for
people to understand.

2716
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:39,560
If you've never worn wool,
well that's when you know what I mean.

2717
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:43,580
The the right gear,
you know as a lot of hunts that really

2718
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,670
you don't really need the right gear for
printing,

2719
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:49,550
but in that back country stuff or real
steep mountains or stuff where you have

2720
01:54:49,551 --> 01:54:52,490
to walk far,
if your shoes are wet and your socks are

2721
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:53,810
wet,
you're going to have an earliest

2722
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:55,880
blisters and you won't be able to walk
anywhere.

2723
01:54:55,990 --> 01:55:00,440
That's why I'm really fascinated by
companies like cool you that spend all

2724
01:55:00,441 --> 01:55:04,730
this time developing the most technical
gear,

2725
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,270
like the lightest weight,
the best at absorbing wind for their

2726
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:09,920
tents and,
and you know,

2727
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:13,970
they'd go through great lengths to
engineer their products to make sure

2728
01:55:13,971 --> 01:55:16,730
that it's just mean.
It's a giant company that just makes

2729
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:18,470
ultra light gear for hunting.
Yeah.

2730
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:21,050
It's kind of crazy that there's a
company like that.

2731
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,020
Yeah.
But yeah,

2732
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,800
you can see why when you go in the back
country,

2733
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:25,990
don't have the right gear,
you,

2734
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:29,030
that's the last kind of hunting you're
going to do like that and how it's like

2735
01:55:29,031 --> 01:55:31,610
a survival thing.
How'd you figure out like what stuff to

2736
01:55:31,611 --> 01:55:34,710
bring and what stuff not to bring?
Did you read up or did you do trial and

2737
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:35,563
error?
You know?

2738
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:37,490
Uh,
I,

2739
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:39,980
right when I got into bow hunting,
I got,

2740
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:43,440
I got bored of,
of feeding pigs and have want to come to

2741
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:44,160
my house

2742
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,810
and,
and having them come to my trees down.

2743
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:50,250
I got bored of that pretty quick.
It was Super Fun at first and I loved it

2744
01:55:50,251 --> 01:55:54,000
and it was a really good learning and it
was a blast.

2745
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:55,650
You know,
it's building tree stands by myself,

2746
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,290
but I what?
I super quickly got bored of that and

2747
01:55:58,291 --> 01:56:00,480
wanting to do something else.
I wanted to go walk in the mountains all

2748
01:56:00,481 --> 01:56:04,380
day long and I,
I ordered Cameron Hanes is back country

2749
01:56:04,381 --> 01:56:07,500
bowhunting book.
This is right when I started hunting,

2750
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:11,700
I had no idea who cameron hanes was and
I was geeking out on everything.

2751
01:56:11,701 --> 01:56:13,470
Hunting and I,
I did some research,

2752
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:15,690
found that book ordered,
it changed my life.

2753
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:18,630
I got like,
and it's funny because I told Cameron

2754
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:20,680
that
I,

2755
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:21,643
I told them that,
uh,

2756
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:24,210
that I got his book and it like fully
inspired me.

2757
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:25,553
I,
uh,

2758
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:28,290
I ordered like the,
the ultralight tent,

2759
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:31,780
the right one to all this research on
which one to get which one is lightest,

2760
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:34,380
which one's the driest,
which one is the best at cooking,

2761
01:56:34,381 --> 01:56:37,050
which is that the biggest vestibule.
I ordered the right,

2762
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,530
the right stove and all the right,
you know,

2763
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:44,700
ultra light plates and forks and caps,
camp cups and a sleeping bags and tout

2764
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:50,250
the,
the little talent packs up tiny on the

2765
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:53,220
pillow that packs of tiny in the right
backpack and all that stuff.

2766
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:55,920
So it's funny because that,
that,

2767
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:58,440
you know,
when you're shading ounces and it really

2768
01:56:58,441 --> 01:56:59,250
adds up,
you know,

2769
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:01,970
it's like a difference between like 80
pound pack and a 40 pound pack when you

2770
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,360
get,
if you get the right gear.

2771
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:05,340
Jason Harrison,
the owner,

2772
01:57:05,490 --> 01:57:07,300
if he makes a,
uh,

2773
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:12,270
a spreadsheet where he ways every single
thing he's,

2774
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:17,540
he's bringing and he packs it up and he
weighs like what's in each pack and what

2775
01:57:18,361 --> 01:57:23,220
he needs for each and he has this like
this excel spreadsheet of all the

2776
01:57:23,221 --> 01:57:25,650
different stuff and then that's how
seriously people take it.

2777
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:28,110
Especially like sheep hunting and things
on those lines.

2778
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:31,440
I got so geeked out on the ultralight
thing that I started like looking at all

2779
01:57:31,441 --> 01:57:32,340
of that,
like um,

2780
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:36,450
like ultra light,
ultra light hiking websites and like

2781
01:57:36,451 --> 01:57:36,840
getting all it

2782
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:37,830
tips.
Like,

2783
01:57:38,210 --> 01:57:40,460
like instead of just bringing in like a
little spark,

2784
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:41,820
you know,
one of those like little sport,

2785
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:46,440
the ultralight sports,
you'd cut your fork in half or even like

2786
01:57:46,670 --> 01:57:48,750
in just one third.
So you just had the fork,

2787
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:50,850
just a fork part.
So like you'd,

2788
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:53,610
you'd,
you'd shave off those ounces of the rest

2789
01:57:53,611 --> 01:57:55,920
of the fork.
You just be the part where you just ate,

2790
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:56,813
you know,
and,

2791
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,950
and your toothbrush,
you cut it.

2792
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:00,420
So it was just the part that goes on,
doesn't your

2793
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:01,350
teeth.
Yeah,

2794
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:03,690
that's what Adam does.
He was telling me he does that pretty

2795
01:58:03,691 --> 01:58:06,360
funny,
but plus I'm a manly man.

2796
01:58:06,361 --> 01:58:09,990
I can carry a toothbrush handle.
It's funny though because it all adds up

2797
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:11,670
when you,
when you know you don't think you need

2798
01:58:11,671 --> 01:58:13,050
that much stuff to go in the back
country hunt,

2799
01:58:13,051 --> 01:58:16,590
but a lot of times you put every single
thing you're going to put in that pack

2800
01:58:16,591 --> 01:58:17,980
and it's a lot of stuff.
Right.

2801
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:20,610
And to share those out,
this down means then you can bring like

2802
01:58:20,611 --> 01:58:22,950
a better 10 better sleeping bag.
Right.

2803
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:24,870
You add up some more ounces on the other
side.

2804
01:58:24,871 --> 01:58:27,120
I,
I'm a big eater so I'll bring a lot of

2805
01:58:27,121 --> 01:58:32,121
food and water and you know.
Now do you weigh out your food?

2806
01:58:32,191 --> 01:58:36,370
Do you make sure that you have like
intense calorie dense food?

2807
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:38,190
Yeah.
What kind of stuff do you bring with you

2808
01:58:38,191 --> 01:58:40,860
when you go on a back country hunt of.
Oh,

2809
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:42,430
stuff you get bored of quick.

2810
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:45,520
Like um,
I bring like nuts,

2811
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:50,580
like macadamia nuts and almonds and
pecans and cheese and jerky and stuff

2812
01:58:52,181 --> 01:58:53,180
like that.
And if they're,

2813
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:55,060
especially if there's water,
that's a game changer.

2814
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:56,740
If there's water where you're going to
be,

2815
01:58:56,741 --> 01:58:59,890
or even anywhere near where you going to
be that are bringing stove every time

2816
01:58:59,891 --> 01:59:02,800
with oatmeal and freeze dried meals like
mountain house meals,

2817
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,220
those are insane.
You have to try a dehydrated.

2818
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:08,020
Yeah.
Those are the same ones.

2819
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:10,580
Yeah.
But there's a freeze dried.

2820
01:59:10,581 --> 01:59:14,710
The dehydrated is apparently lighter.
That's why people are gravitating

2821
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:16,570
towards dehydrated now.
Gotcha.

2822
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:18,640
Doesn't own a house there.
So light.

2823
01:59:18,641 --> 01:59:21,280
I don't know how anyone can be lighter
than that while you're shaving the

2824
01:59:21,281 --> 01:59:22,840
handle of your toothbrush.
That's right.

2825
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,080
The best space to.
Yeah.

2826
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:26,740
I think that is what they're saying.
Yeah.

2827
01:59:26,741 --> 01:59:29,710
That takes up less space.
But there's certain certain things that

2828
01:59:29,711 --> 01:59:31,110
I can't skimp on,
like food.

2829
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,321
But uh,
you know,

2830
01:59:32,321 --> 01:59:35,380
what's really good is when you like,
before I do hunt like that,

2831
01:59:35,381 --> 01:59:40,381
I'll make like two handfuls of Bacon and
I'll make it all up and then I'll bring

2832
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:42,850
that and it's like,
that's my treat at lunch.

2833
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:45,070
I'll have a couple pieces of bacon.
Doesn't it go bad?

2834
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:46,540
No,
it Kinda doesn't.

2835
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:48,810
It doesn't.
Once,

2836
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:50,710
once you get,
once you cook it,

2837
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,240
it depends where you hunt.
Also,

2838
01:59:52,241 --> 01:59:55,170
if you're hunting and in Arizona in the
summer,

2839
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:58,600
then maybe a or somewhere by the beach
in Hawaii probably go bad,

2840
01:59:58,601 --> 02:00:02,030
but a normal hunt if you're,
if your stuff doesn't get super hot and

2841
02:00:02,031 --> 02:00:04,660
all was fine.
How long has cooked Bacon last?

2842
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:06,620
No,
I got that idea I think from Karen and

2843
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:09,280
his book because he would make peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches with Bacon

2844
02:00:09,281 --> 02:00:10,220
in it.
Oh yeah.

2845
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:12,190
And uh,
and so I would do that.

2846
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:14,500
I don't know how long it lasts,
but don't tell me if it's.

2847
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:16,300
But I,
I bring it for like a five day hunt.

2848
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:18,430
No worries.
And just thinking at least the first

2849
02:00:18,431 --> 02:00:20,380
three days,
once you start getting diarrhea then you

2850
02:00:20,381 --> 02:00:21,760
cut back.
Exactly.

2851
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:23,470
But,
but uh,

2852
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:24,820
um,
what was I going to say?

2853
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,530
Oh,
because I don't know.

2854
02:00:26,531 --> 02:00:28,870
I just craved the fats.
It's like I'm eating,

2855
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:31,220
I'm eating all these nuts,
bars,

2856
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:32,800
nuts in bars,
nuts and bars,

2857
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:35,380
not bars and all I want is fat like
Greece.

2858
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:39,070
But when you're doing heavy duty
climbing and things along those lines

2859
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:41,320
are going up and down mountains.
That is what you crave.

2860
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:43,360
Yeah.
Like you're not in the carbohydrates,

2861
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:45,970
fats your body go like we need
something.

2862
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:47,080
Coward.
Dance.

2863
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:48,220
Oh yeah.
And then when I,

2864
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,830
when I leave hunting,
when I leave the mountains,

2865
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:55,450
like say I go to Colorado and I hunt for
a week and I'm like I lose 10 pounds,

2866
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:58,360
get super skinny and like mountain man
style,

2867
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,330
I get out of there and I just want like
a bacon double cheeseburger,

2868
02:01:01,331 --> 02:01:03,670
like a big giant,
not like the kind of the fast food

2869
02:01:03,671 --> 02:01:04,570
place,
but like a big,

2870
02:01:04,571 --> 02:01:08,560
like 30 pound Burger with a ton of Bacon
on it with like blue cheese and Avocados

2871
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:08,880
on it.

2872
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,470
Yeah,
just a massive fat go giant and just

2873
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:14,560
blow my,
blow my self sky high with a giant thing

2874
02:01:14,561 --> 02:01:18,070
of fries and
that's always what I created with the

2875
02:01:18,071 --> 02:01:20,530
amount of calories that you're burning
when you're climbing up and down

2876
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:22,060
mountains all the time.
It's insane.

2877
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:26,410
And it's thousands of calories a day.
You literally have to keep stuffing your

2878
02:01:26,411 --> 02:01:28,990
face just to maintain your body mass.
Yeah,

2879
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:30,730
you do.
Well,

2880
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:35,260
if you are a person who is doing this on
a regular basis,

2881
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:38,890
I mean you would get really good at
preparing for these things,

2882
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:40,070
so you must have

2883
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:45,470
undergone a transformation where you
started off sort of kind of like trying

2884
02:01:45,471 --> 02:01:48,080
to figure it out and then as you got
better and better and better,

2885
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:51,740
you got more and more streamlined in you
in your approach.

2886
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:54,320
Like do you feel like you have it down
to a science now?

2887
02:01:54,321 --> 02:01:57,470
If you want to do something like that
with what the actual backcountry hunt or

2888
02:01:57,471 --> 02:01:59,240
the actual hunting,
it's all the old stuff.

2889
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:02,480
You're packing your plan.
Do you ever use Google maps?

2890
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:04,790
Oh yeah.
That's pretty cool that you can do a

2891
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:06,620
phone these days.
Yeah,

2892
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:09,620
it's amazing.
What would people do if you don't know

2893
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:13,060
they,
they find an area like say if you draw a

2894
02:02:13,061 --> 02:02:14,990
tag for an area,
he'd get her over.

2895
02:02:14,991 --> 02:02:16,420
This is not for you,
for people,

2896
02:02:16,421 --> 02:02:17,254
isn't it?
Obviously,

2897
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:20,690
but you get an overhead.
Google earth will give you.

2898
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:24,650
It'll show you where the peaks and
valleys are and it's amazing.

2899
02:02:24,651 --> 02:02:28,010
It shows you the canyons,
it shows you water sources and you see

2900
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:32,330
from a satellite image,
so you can literally see elk sometimes

2901
02:02:32,331 --> 02:02:34,250
on Google Earth,
which is incredible.

2902
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,030
Yeah,
and you can really like,

2903
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:37,760
you know,
you can get back to your camp much more,

2904
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:39,690
much quicker.
A lot of time,

2905
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:41,220
you know,
don't get lost in a dark,

2906
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:43,410
you know,
you can get to your water source wave

2907
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:46,140
way quicker and it's really efficient.
But then you need to bring batteries to

2908
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:48,480
for your phone or.
Yeah,

2909
02:02:48,590 --> 02:02:51,330
know some solar panel,
but I haven't really found a super

2910
02:02:51,331 --> 02:02:53,820
efficient solar panel that'll charge up
your phone in here.

2911
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:55,210
Stuff that fast.
Yeah.

2912
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:57,860
Especially when you're in the woods,
you're not getting a lot of sunlight.

2913
02:02:57,861 --> 02:03:00,230
There always seems like it doesn't work
as good as you hope.

2914
02:03:00,510 --> 02:03:02,330
Yeah.
They're getting better at those things

2915
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,790
they're getting.
I mean if you're in Arizona,

2916
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:06,420
know when you're in this,
of course,

2917
02:03:06,590 --> 02:03:10,300
mule deer hunting in the desert.
You've got a great shot at charging a

2918
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:10,941
patient.
Leave it.

2919
02:03:10,941 --> 02:03:11,100
Yeah.

2920
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:13,580
One place for like a few hours just
sitting there in the sun.

2921
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:14,414
Yeah,
for sure.

2922
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:18,470
But as far as the hunting goes,
like you have gotten better at the

2923
02:03:18,471 --> 02:03:20,450
planning and the and the back country
gear,

2924
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:23,450
but that's all I got.
I think you learn that pretty quick,

2925
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:27,290
but you found out you find out if your
shitty hunter right away because you

2926
02:03:27,291 --> 02:03:28,580
come home with no meat all the time.
Right?

2927
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:30,110
Yeah.
It's like it's very easy.

2928
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:32,210
It's like it's like finding out if
you're good at the stock market,

2929
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,160
you know right away you get that
feedback,

2930
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:36,300
you lose a bunch of money all the time.
Right.

2931
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:39,830
It's the same thing with bow hunting.
I love going hunting because I didn't

2932
02:03:39,831 --> 02:03:42,260
grow up in a hunting family.
I have no background in it when I was

2933
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:43,990
young.
So I don't have like those,

2934
02:03:43,991 --> 02:03:47,040
like the instincts like that someone
would have like that.

2935
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:50,750
I've really good friends that grew up
with a bow in their hand and their dad

2936
02:03:50,751 --> 02:03:52,070
did in.
Their GRANDPA did and they're great.

2937
02:03:52,071 --> 02:03:54,080
GRANDPA did actually one family in
particular,

2938
02:03:54,081 --> 02:03:58,860
but I'm so good at bowhunting.
I love bow hunting with those guys.

2939
02:03:58,861 --> 02:04:01,890
Like guys like Adam Green tree guys like
my,

2940
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:05,480
my buddy justin at home.
I have my friend Jason on Lanai who

2941
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:08,540
hunts axis deer.
These are like half year,

2942
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:11,510
half human,
you know how to hunt,

2943
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:14,810
how to kill wind to move,
how fast you can move,

2944
02:04:14,811 --> 02:04:16,610
how slow,
like when to slow down,

2945
02:04:16,611 --> 02:04:18,920
when to run.
It's just,

2946
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:21,380
I love it.
I as I'm absolutely obsessed with like

2947
02:04:21,381 --> 02:04:22,810
trying to learn to get better at it.

2948
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:25,450
Now.
Have you taken into the archery lessons?

2949
02:04:25,451 --> 02:04:29,050
Have you ever gone to like a,
like how did you learn how to shoot

2950
02:04:29,051 --> 02:04:29,884
correctly?

2951
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:31,980
Um,
I didn't,

2952
02:04:31,981 --> 02:04:35,370
I learned how to shoot terribly and then
I had to relearn ever since I've been

2953
02:04:35,371 --> 02:04:38,790
trying to correct it.
So still now I now I'll shoot with guys

2954
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:42,340
who are really good archers and now
they'll help me know.

2955
02:04:42,790 --> 02:04:45,000
Um,
so I've done a lot of work with that,

2956
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:48,120
but I still like,
my effective range is still like 50

2957
02:04:48,121 --> 02:04:50,610
yards.
I've tried for a long time.

2958
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,050
Thirteen years.
Yeah.

2959
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:54,300
That's tried really hard.
You when you practice,

2960
02:04:54,301 --> 02:04:57,510
how do you feel a targeted.
I can kill a target at 70.

2961
02:04:57,870 --> 02:04:59,850
No worries.
But it's so different,

2962
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:02,730
you know,
like guys I can say that they to shoot

2963
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:05,730
60,
you should be shooting 122 to be able to

2964
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:08,010
be effective at 60.
Should be shooting hundred 20 because of

2965
02:05:08,011 --> 02:05:09,930
the pressure of the nerves.
Yeah.

2966
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:13,230
There's a difference between a target
and an animal just so totally different.

2967
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:15,270
So it was also the way you shoot too,
right?

2968
02:05:15,271 --> 02:05:18,630
Do you use a,
a trigger or using these?

2969
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:21,320
A thumb release.
So you usually use a lot of attention

2970
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:24,570
and what kind of release you using?
I got target panic if you ever heard of

2971
02:05:24,571 --> 02:05:25,404
that.
Sure.

2972
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:27,260
Yeah,
that's why I asked you socks.

2973
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:30,200
You don't want to not want to get that.
But uh,

2974
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:33,660
I,
I hunted for years and then recently my

2975
02:05:33,661 --> 02:05:37,920
friend was filming and as I would shoot
I would punch a trigger like crazy and I

2976
02:05:37,921 --> 02:05:40,920
didn't even realize I was doing it.
It got worse and worse to the point

2977
02:05:40,921 --> 02:05:45,510
where I ended up giving my releases away
and stop hunting for about four months.

2978
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:48,600
And all I did was go and shoot.
I put this target right outside my front

2979
02:05:48,601 --> 02:05:50,850
door,
like a hanging bag target and I would,

2980
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:54,810
I'd walk up to it,
draw my bow like a one foot away from it

2981
02:05:54,811 --> 02:05:57,990
and just practice releasing over and
over and over with your eyes closed than

2982
02:05:57,991 --> 02:06:01,500
my eyes closed so I wouldn't focus on
any aiming or anything.

2983
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:04,620
It was like a psychology thing where you
have to break down your break it down.

2984
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:06,780
We came down into like the perfect
release.

2985
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,060
Yeah,
that's called blind bail shooting for

2986
02:06:09,061 --> 02:06:12,120
people don't know what it is is impact,
bracing your.

2987
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:16,920
Your mind gets used to the feeling of
the bomb going off and so you brace for

2988
02:06:16,921 --> 02:06:20,910
it and when you do that you start to
develop these sorts of patterns where

2989
02:06:20,911 --> 02:06:23,700
you're anticipating the shot.
It's crazy and it can really fuck your

2990
02:06:23,701 --> 02:06:27,750
head up really can and I couldn't.
It got so bad to where I couldn't put my

2991
02:06:27,751 --> 02:06:32,070
pin on the animal and my finger on the
trigger without punching it.

2992
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:34,500
I couldn't do both.
I had to put my finger,

2993
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:35,450
my,
my,

2994
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:39,320
my pin off the animal,
and then my finger on the trigger and

2995
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:43,140
then got extreme and then once the
trigger or what's the pin is near the

2996
02:06:43,141 --> 02:06:43,440
animal.

2997
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,300
Then you just hit it early.
Nervous.

2998
02:06:45,301 --> 02:06:46,950
Yeah.
It was really bizarre.

2999
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:49,920
And this is weird because you're such A.
I mean,

3000
02:06:49,921 --> 02:06:53,820
you're a bad motherfucker.
You're dealing with giant waves and

3001
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:54,801
yeah,
you're,

3002
02:06:54,801 --> 02:06:57,540
you're fucking surfing 50 foot high
waves.

3003
02:06:57,541 --> 02:06:59,220
If someone told me that was going to
happen to me,

3004
02:06:59,221 --> 02:07:01,650
I would've just,
I would've bet my life savings against

3005
02:07:01,651 --> 02:07:03,990
it.
I'm totally not that guy like freaks out

3006
02:07:03,991 --> 02:07:06,060
and gets panicked out loud.
Stuff like that.

3007
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:08,100
Especially like a pin on a boat like.
Yeah,

3008
02:07:08,101 --> 02:07:09,460
like break.
Yeah.

3009
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:12,330
And Man,
I had to work through it for a little

3010
02:07:12,331 --> 02:07:12,780
while.
There's,

3011
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:14,750
there's people who like give up archery
all together.

3012
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:16,170
Oh yeah.
It's super common.

3013
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:17,033
Yeah.
Yeah.

3014
02:07:17,110 --> 02:07:18,630
Um,
so I read a lot about it.

3015
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:20,370
I'm terrified of it.
Yeah.

3016
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:23,400
Don't even worry about it.
Just just do your thing and keep hunting

3017
02:07:23,401 --> 02:07:25,860
and what you're doing.
But I've learned how to shoot with back

3018
02:07:25,861 --> 02:07:27,620
tension.
So I get a surprise shot.

3019
02:07:27,621 --> 02:07:28,650
It's all the time.
I don't,

3020
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:31,620
I don't use a trigger,
but cam diseases triggers.

3021
02:07:31,621 --> 02:07:33,480
But he,
he worked through it to everybody works

3022
02:07:33,481 --> 02:07:34,314
through it.
Yeah.

3023
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:35,380
When you,
um,

3024
02:07:35,530 --> 02:07:36,070
when you learned

3025
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,640
how to use a thumb trigger and use back
tension,

3026
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:43,390
is something you got from youtube videos
or did you have someone show you how to

3027
02:07:43,391 --> 02:07:44,580
do it?
Yeah,

3028
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:46,320
I had a friend show me how to do it.
I've,

3029
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:48,180
I've a really good friend from Spain.
Um,

3030
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:50,080
his name is Pedro.
I don't know if you know him and he's

3031
02:07:50,081 --> 02:07:51,570
super,
Super Pedro from Spain,

3032
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:52,740
from Spain.
Okay.

3033
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:55,150
So there's a,
there's a few of them in Spanish.

3034
02:07:55,170 --> 02:07:57,040
That's what I heard a few Pedro's down
there.

3035
02:07:57,041 --> 02:07:59,620
Anybody Jose's to a bad ass bowhunter
yeah.

3036
02:07:59,690 --> 02:08:02,690
That ass and really good archer.
So He.

3037
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:05,000
So he,
he suggested,

3038
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:06,520
you know,
like a back tension release.

3039
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:09,120
And let me explain what works for people
who have no idea what we're talking

3040
02:08:09,121 --> 02:08:10,210
about.
Um,

3041
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,500
when you're,
there's a type of release that has,

3042
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:16,650
uh,
when you sort of set your stem on it,

3043
02:08:16,651 --> 02:08:18,420
but you don't squeeze it with your
thumb,

3044
02:08:18,630 --> 02:08:19,081
will,
you do,

3045
02:08:19,081 --> 02:08:21,180
is you need to know what I release it,
right?

3046
02:08:21,210 --> 02:08:23,970
It's something that connects to the
string on your bow.

3047
02:08:23,971 --> 02:08:26,040
It actually connects to what's called a
d loop,

3048
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:27,630
which connects to the string.
There you go.

3049
02:08:27,631 --> 02:08:29,580
There's a bunch of.
Well those are back tension releases

3050
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:33,930
where those are like real back tension
release where very few people ever use

3051
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:36,180
those for hunting.
But I like what,

3052
02:08:36,210 --> 02:08:38,080
what kind of release you use,
what brand is?

3053
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:40,040
I think it's a Carter release.
Yeah,

3054
02:08:40,050 --> 02:08:41,280
I do too.
I use a carter,

3055
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:43,460
but it's mainly back tension.
Like I'll like,

3056
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:46,380
I'll exactly like that.
Like I'll put my thumb around the

3057
02:08:46,381 --> 02:08:48,660
trigger and then I'll just keep pulling
until it goes off.

3058
02:08:49,050 --> 02:08:51,540
It goes off when you never know when
it's going off.

3059
02:08:51,541 --> 02:08:54,630
So because of that you're not
anticipating but in a,

3060
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:56,970
in a it.
But it keeps coming back like in a,

3061
02:08:57,110 --> 02:09:01,400
in a situation where I'm hunting when
I'm 25 yards and I'm getting full drawn

3062
02:09:01,401 --> 02:09:02,100
and deer

3063
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:05,130
and it's perfectly broadside.
I had this overwhelming feeling like it

3064
02:09:05,131 --> 02:09:08,820
wants to move and I'll then now I have
like sorta like trained myself to like

3065
02:09:08,821 --> 02:09:12,440
slowly squeeze,
squeeze and pull so that

3066
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:15,280
it makes it go quicker.
They say you should have like a mantra

3067
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:18,370
as in your head as well,
that you should have a bunch of things

3068
02:09:18,371 --> 02:09:21,670
that you say like line it up and release
the air like that.

3069
02:09:21,671 --> 02:09:25,300
You have to have like some sort of a
thing that you put in your head and you

3070
02:09:25,301 --> 02:09:27,130
probably wouldn't,
shouldn't say release the Arrow.

3071
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:28,810
What's yours?
Execute the shot.

3072
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:29,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

3073
02:09:29,741 --> 02:09:30,370
One.
Yeah.

3074
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:32,290
Line it up and execute the shot.
That's what I say.

3075
02:09:32,291 --> 02:09:33,124
Lined it up.

3076
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:34,960
Execute the shot.
Yeah.

3077
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:36,250
You know what I do

3078
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:37,480
stay calm too.
That's the other one.

3079
02:09:37,481 --> 02:09:39,880
I say stay calm.
Breathe.

3080
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:41,283
Breathe.

3081
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:45,570
Um,
I do that thing where I,

3082
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:49,700
I spell lock.
So Loc K as I'm settling,

3083
02:09:49,701 --> 02:09:50,690
you know,
you get to full draw.

3084
02:09:50,730 --> 02:09:51,710
Get my anchor.
I,

3085
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:54,710
I've,
I start settling the pin and I look at

3086
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:55,440
my,
my,

3087
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:59,720
my bubble level and once my little
checklist is online and I'm on the

3088
02:09:59,721 --> 02:10:01,780
animal,
as soon as I feel like my,

3089
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:06,880
my pin starts to relax and steady.
I spelled the word lock and squeezes the

3090
02:10:07,941 --> 02:10:08,700
same time.
Ooh,

3091
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:10,070
I liked that.
I might steal that.

3092
02:10:10,330 --> 02:10:11,690
Yeah.
You know what else you're going to like.

3093
02:10:11,691 --> 02:10:15,440
This is my,
my friend Jeff who basically taught me

3094
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,840
how to bow hunt.
I'm Jeff Lee.

3095
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:18,793
Guys,
Legend.

3096
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:20,550
He's awesome.
Uh,

3097
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:23,930
he,
he told me that when he is a full draw

3098
02:10:23,931 --> 02:10:25,850
right before he pulls the trigger,
he says,

3099
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,860
you're gonna die motherfucker.
Whoa,

3100
02:10:27,990 --> 02:10:29,140
that's deep.
Yeah.

3101
02:10:29,450 --> 02:10:30,950
I don't know if I liked that,
what he told me,

3102
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:33,080
but he's not like that.
He's not like that.

3103
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,250
Like you would never think

3104
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:35,083
that.
He's not like,

3105
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:38,570
he's totally not blood thirsty.
He's a super ethical hunter.

3106
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:39,501
He just goes,
man,

3107
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:41,060
it's,
it's a psychological thing.

3108
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:44,630
He goes,
if you are hoping you're going to hit

3109
02:10:44,631 --> 02:10:45,790
that animal,
that release,

3110
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:49,040
when that Arrow goes off,
if you're hoping you're not going to hit

3111
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:49,874
him,
you're not going to kill him.

3112
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:51,530
It's not going to be an efficient,
ethical,

3113
02:10:51,890 --> 02:10:53,360
ethical shot,
but he goes,

3114
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:57,200
if you truly believe that you're there
to kill that animal and that animal is

3115
02:10:57,201 --> 02:11:00,740
going to die,
right then that's a huge piece of the

3116
02:11:00,741 --> 02:11:04,220
puzzle.
There's a website called iron mind

3117
02:11:04,221 --> 02:11:05,560
hunting.
Have you ever heard of this?

3118
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:07,580
Scott?
Think I forget his name,

3119
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:10,400
Joel something or another,
but he,

3120
02:11:10,401 --> 02:11:12,830
um,
he suffered through target panic himself

3121
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:17,831
and he's a swat guy and a police officer
and developed a whole system

3122
02:11:18,471 --> 02:11:22,220
understanding the impact bracing and a
whole system that I haven't,

3123
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:22,970
I haven't read it.

3124
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:24,710
He's got a book on it and he's got,
there it is.

3125
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:28,250
Um,
and he's got Joel Turner and he's got a

3126
02:11:28,251 --> 02:11:31,970
whole website dedicated to controlling
target,

3127
02:11:31,971 --> 02:11:34,160
panic and develop a whole system.
Yeah,

3128
02:11:34,161 --> 02:11:36,650
I have to check it out too.
And it's one of those things where,

3129
02:11:36,870 --> 02:11:39,650
you know,
no matter how long you been doing it,

3130
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:42,230
it's possible that this shit could creep
into your brain,

3131
02:11:42,231 --> 02:11:46,010
which is weird,
like people have been successful hunting

3132
02:11:46,011 --> 02:11:48,950
for years and years and then all of a
sudden they get target panic and they're

3133
02:11:48,951 --> 02:11:52,820
fucked.
Almost everybody you meet who's bow

3134
02:11:52,821 --> 02:11:56,090
hunted for a couple of decades has had
it almost everybody.

3135
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:58,820
Everybody from randy elmer to,
to everybody.

3136
02:11:58,910 --> 02:12:00,740
Yeah,
Randy Alma has a couple of good videos

3137
02:12:00,741 --> 02:12:02,800
on how to handle it too.
And he,

3138
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:07,040
he says you should use a back tension
release to get used to it and a or a

3139
02:12:07,041 --> 02:12:07,790
hinge release.

3140
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:10,370
And what that is for the people don't
understand what we're talking about.

3141
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:13,310
There's another type of release.
It doesn't have a trigger at all.

3142
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:17,120
And what you do is you draw back and
just by moving your hand,

3143
02:12:17,121 --> 02:12:20,240
you're sort of curling your pinky down
and making a fist.

3144
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,540
It goes off,
but you never know when it's going off,

3145
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:27,880
it goes off completely unanticipated.
And that helps you deal with this,

3146
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:30,480
this tension issue,
this,

3147
02:12:30,481 --> 02:12:32,880
uh,
this fucking mind.

3148
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:36,410
Fuck yeah.
But I got over the hump and I'm back.

3149
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:38,600
You're back.
I had a good 2016 so far.

3150
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:40,010
Yes.
Feels good,

3151
02:12:40,011 --> 02:12:40,844
right?
I,

3152
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:42,660
I,
it feels good.

3153
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:47,150
As I was panicking about the panic for
awhile and this year started off good.

3154
02:12:47,151 --> 02:12:48,830
I've done it.
I've done quite a bit of hunting.

3155
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:49,701
I went,
uh,

3156
02:12:49,701 --> 02:12:51,340
I went hunting for fallow deer with,
with,

3157
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,330
with Remy and New Zealand,
and had a,

3158
02:12:53,331 --> 02:12:54,560
just an absolute ball.

3159
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,750
Killed a great,
a great book.

3160
02:12:56,990 --> 02:13:00,590
I saw some pictures of the terrain.
You're using that crazy equivalent thing

3161
02:13:00,591 --> 02:13:01,101
too,
right?

3162
02:13:01,101 --> 02:13:03,250
Where it's a stabilizer.
And I tried that for awhile,

3163
02:13:03,290 --> 02:13:05,480
but it kept getting loose on me.
Oh really?

3164
02:13:05,481 --> 02:13:07,160
Yeah.
It was wiggling around too much.

3165
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:10,370
I didn't have that problem writing it
down too much and it worked really good

3166
02:13:10,371 --> 02:13:11,810
for that hunt,
that specific hunt.

3167
02:13:11,811 --> 02:13:15,770
But we wanted in this awesome terrain
with this crazy rocks and cliffs.

3168
02:13:15,771 --> 02:13:18,130
There was not one Bush,
there was no bushes there.

3169
02:13:18,150 --> 02:13:21,650
There's no trees in this area.
It was just like you had to use the,

3170
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:23,210
you had to use the,
you know,

3171
02:13:23,211 --> 02:13:25,670
the rocky,
the rocky outcroppings,

3172
02:13:25,671 --> 02:13:29,600
and just the basic like terrain features
to get close and we ended up sneaking

3173
02:13:29,601 --> 02:13:32,040
down on this bed of group of deer that
was at the base of this

3174
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,700
cliff.
Go Get up.

3175
02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:34,481
Go to Ben.
Oh,

3176
02:13:34,481 --> 02:13:38,370
Brian's a instagram.
What is instagram?

3177
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:41,970
A steep.
It was such a steep downhill shot that I

3178
02:13:41,971 --> 02:13:42,870
had to like,
you know,

3179
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:45,360
when you're shooting down,
you got to you gotta bend at the waist,

3180
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:50,130
you can just aim down miss.
And so I had to remember all that stuff

3181
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:52,200
in the moment.
It was just a really technical shot and

3182
02:13:52,201 --> 02:13:54,060
a technical stock.
It was really a lot of fun.

3183
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:55,110
Well,
Ben took a photo.

3184
02:13:55,111 --> 02:13:58,740
The reason why I said go to Ben's
instagram because he took a Benny Aubrey

3185
02:13:58,741 --> 02:14:00,510
or something like that.
Um,

3186
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:04,240
he,
he has a photo of you doing it where it

3187
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:06,660
looks like you're shooting from the top
of a building.

3188
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:08,220
Oh yeah,
down to the first floor.

3189
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:09,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

3190
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,470
It's a crazy picture.
Yeah.

3191
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:11,850
And that's the kind of,
that's the kind of,

3192
02:14:11,851 --> 02:14:13,350
um,
practice that you'd never do.

3193
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:16,890
A lot of people don't like set their
target the bottom of a cliff and stand

3194
02:14:16,891 --> 02:14:20,310
at the top and it's really different or
shooting up either.

3195
02:14:20,330 --> 02:14:21,880
Yeah,
either one of the super different type

3196
02:14:21,881 --> 02:14:22,800
of shot.
So,

3197
02:14:23,190 --> 02:14:25,410
but that was a lot of fun and I've done
some really good hunts.

3198
02:14:25,411 --> 02:14:29,760
I did one to threatening in New Zealand.
I did one with Adam Green tree in

3199
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:31,630
eastern Australia.
Um,

3200
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,270
and what did you guys hunt and
Australia?

3201
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:35,190
We hunted in an area that had,
um,

3202
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:38,860
fallow deer mainly.
There was a couple red stags around to,

3203
02:14:38,990 --> 02:14:40,830
um,
but that was a ball.

3204
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:42,150
We had a lot,
a lot of fun.

3205
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:44,460
He's trying to get me to go hunt water
buffaloes were going.

3206
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,840
I'm like,
fuck.

3207
02:14:45,841 --> 02:14:49,200
He's been trying to get me to do that to
these things are,

3208
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:51,750
they're just giant fucking murderous
beasts.

3209
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:54,690
Yeah,
that's not the part that to me is,

3210
02:14:54,691 --> 02:14:55,501
uh,
is the,

3211
02:14:55,501 --> 02:14:58,350
uh,
I love hunting in the mountains where

3212
02:14:58,351 --> 02:15:03,351
it's cold and beautiful and I'm looking
at a big valley or over the ocean in

3213
02:15:03,631 --> 02:15:05,610
Hawaii.
Or you can see the ocean,

3214
02:15:05,630 --> 02:15:08,670
the white caps and boats going by like
just beautiful,

3215
02:15:08,671 --> 02:15:10,080
right.
Beautiful wilderness.

3216
02:15:10,081 --> 02:15:15,000
And where are those bulls live?
It's like 50 million flies on you and

3217
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:20,001
mosquitoes in a swamp and snake and
snakes and slugs and spiders.

3218
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:25,690
FOC degrees and crocs.
Yeah.

3219
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:30,330
And it's true man.
It's like I turned it a little pussy

3220
02:15:30,331 --> 02:15:31,520
when I come to those guys.
I can't.

3221
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:33,540
I turn it a little pussy when I look at
pictures of it.

3222
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:34,201
Yeah.
He's like,

3223
02:15:34,201 --> 02:15:35,450
you gotta come to the buffet thing,
right?

3224
02:15:35,451 --> 02:15:36,650
You've got to come.
And I'm like,

3225
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:39,310
sure thing.
I will for sure.

3226
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:41,610
Good luck with all that.
Now human campaigns,

3227
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:44,560
when they brought no food and they
brought no water,

3228
02:15:44,590 --> 02:15:45,310
they said,
mate,

3229
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:48,520
we're going to do it the right way.
So they go out there and they were

3230
02:15:48,521 --> 02:15:52,600
bathing in this fucking lake that they
didn't realize had crocodiles.

3231
02:15:52,601 --> 02:15:55,210
Yeah.
So they were in up to their neck cooling

3232
02:15:55,211 --> 02:15:59,350
themselves off and then later on found
out the crocodiles at slipped into this

3233
02:15:59,351 --> 02:16:01,870
lake.
So they easily could have gotten eaten.

3234
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:02,531
Yeah.
I mean,

3235
02:16:02,531 --> 02:16:06,100
these are some of the biggest fucking
crocodiles in the world that live right

3236
02:16:06,101 --> 02:16:07,720
there.
Fuck that.

3237
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:11,370
I was hunting or with another body in
Australia and we were hunting in an area

3238
02:16:11,371 --> 02:16:15,120
that crocodiles and everyday we had to,
we had to cross a couple of little areas

3239
02:16:15,121 --> 02:16:20,121
that had water and I just didn't even
think about it because I'm not like I'm

3240
02:16:20,191 --> 02:16:21,540
not around crocodiles.
Right.

3241
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:24,810
And he just,
after the first day he didn't really

3242
02:16:24,811 --> 02:16:26,910
worry about it too much because he had,
after we crossed,

3243
02:16:26,911 --> 02:16:27,271
he goes,
hey,

3244
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:29,560
if I'm not with you tomorrow and you
cross here,

3245
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:32,380
make sure you throw a bunch of rocks in
the water right there to make sure

3246
02:16:32,381 --> 02:16:34,450
there's no crocodiles.
Because if they,

3247
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:37,480
if,
if a human passes by an area where

3248
02:16:37,481 --> 02:16:39,280
there's crocodiles over and over and
over,

3249
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:43,870
they pattern them and they will sit
there and wait for that human to cross

3250
02:16:43,871 --> 02:16:45,760
again and get ya.
Oh.

3251
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:49,630
So they're super intelligent hunters.
So that's what they do.

3252
02:16:49,810 --> 02:16:52,700
They actually wait for like,
whether it's a rabbit going by everyday

3253
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:54,490
or human or whatever it is,
a dog,

3254
02:16:54,491 --> 02:16:56,590
a cat,
and they will sit there and wait just

3255
02:16:56,591 --> 02:16:59,200
underwater and when you go by,
that's when they strike.

3256
02:16:59,201 --> 02:17:03,730
So such an efficient animal to the fact
that they could just stay under water

3257
02:17:03,731 --> 02:17:06,850
for hours without breathing.
They slow their heart rate down like a

3258
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:08,470
beat,
a minute or something stupid.

3259
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:11,920
There's A.
There's a place in northwestern

3260
02:17:11,921 --> 02:17:16,360
Australia where the waves are really
good and in that area there's a ton.

3261
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:21,160
A ton of great whites.
Tiger sharks and ocean.

3262
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:25,720
Saltwater crocodiles swim in the ocean
for miles.

3263
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,640
They swim.
They fight the sharks.

3264
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:29,680
Fuck them.
Fuck everything.

3265
02:17:29,681 --> 02:17:32,230
Fuck that whole.
The whole God.

3266
02:17:32,231 --> 02:17:33,700
That's so crazy.
Yeah.

3267
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:36,460
They swim.
Imagine being in the fucking water in a

3268
02:17:36,461 --> 02:17:39,520
canoe and you look over and there's
something bigger than you can do and

3269
02:17:39,521 --> 02:17:40,360
it's a dinosaur.

3270
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:42,130
Yeah.
It's swimming in the water and it wants

3271
02:17:42,131 --> 02:17:43,150
to kill you.
It's hungry.

3272
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:47,920
Oh my on.
You'll Australia's a wild ass place,

3273
02:17:47,921 --> 02:17:51,370
but it really is beautiful and crazy and
wild.

3274
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:53,470
Seems like New Zealand's a better spot
though.

3275
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:57,790
New Zealand doesn't have any of that
stuff and I'm from a place like New

3276
02:17:57,790 --> 02:17:57,931
Zealand.
Right.

3277
02:17:57,931 --> 02:17:59,290
I'm from Hawaii.
There's no snakes.

3278
02:17:59,690 --> 02:18:01,600
We don't have deadly spiders or anything
like that.

3279
02:18:01,601 --> 02:18:06,190
And when I go to Australia
I get so freaked out about the snakes,

3280
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:09,370
so freaked out and have those brown
snakes it kill you instantly.

3281
02:18:09,430 --> 02:18:13,000
I almost stepped on one of those.
Fuck,

3282
02:18:13,150 --> 02:18:16,750
I literally fuck you in green tree
trying to get me to come to your house.

3283
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:18,550
My partner was.
My foot was up,

3284
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:19,561
my left.
What was that?

3285
02:18:19,561 --> 02:18:23,730
I remember I was walking through this,
this grass called tussock and it was in,

3286
02:18:24,210 --> 02:18:25,150
you know,
Adam was like,

3287
02:18:25,151 --> 02:18:27,850
you're never going to see a snake at
this time of year.

3288
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:28,870
It's like winter time.
Right.

3289
02:18:28,930 --> 02:18:30,870
So they're all,
they're all down,

3290
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:32,170
whatever they're doing,
they're hibernating.

3291
02:18:32,171 --> 02:18:34,360
Right.
And so I'm walking by myself,

3292
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:36,760
of course,
and I almost put my foot down and I

3293
02:18:36,761 --> 02:18:40,020
looked down as a coiled up brown snake
just.

3294
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:43,180
And he was,
he was out sunning himself and almost

3295
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:45,580
stepped right on.
I'm one of those red belly black snakes.

3296
02:18:45,630 --> 02:18:47,650
The thing was that thing called right
past me.

3297
02:18:47,651 --> 02:18:49,570
One day I was with my other buddy and he
goes,

3298
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:52,750
you're never going to see any snakes.
I never seen any snakes around here.

3299
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:55,360
First afternoon,
I swear to God,

3300
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:57,160
first after unit ever hunted on
Australia.

3301
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:01,360
This guy just told me,
you never see a snake like an hour into

3302
02:19:01,361 --> 02:19:02,230
our hunt,
maybe less.

3303
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:03,820
He goes,
don't move.

3304
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:05,560
There's a deer.
Does it dear mate.

3305
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,970
So I just stopped.
Of course.

3306
02:19:06,971 --> 02:19:07,990
Right.
I didn't even say a word.

3307
02:19:07,991 --> 02:19:10,720
I was looking around for the deer side
side,

3308
02:19:10,721 --> 02:19:11,590
eyeing it,
you know,

3309
02:19:11,890 --> 02:19:14,140
trying not to say we're trying to be
completely still.

3310
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:15,970
And he goes,
okay,

3311
02:19:15,971 --> 02:19:19,060
now look down.
I looked down and the giant snake had

3312
02:19:19,061 --> 02:19:22,900
just passed me
completely deadly.

3313
02:19:23,050 --> 02:19:25,450
So he said,
don't move just because he didn't want

3314
02:19:25,451 --> 02:19:28,490
you freaking out because I just a snake
out of flipped.

3315
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:29,990
Yeah.
But he goes,

3316
02:19:29,991 --> 02:19:30,860
there's a deer.
And he knew.

3317
02:19:30,861 --> 02:19:33,110
I said,
Billy Black snake,

3318
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:35,320
nothing looks awesome.
I'd like to make a belt out of one.

3319
02:19:35,340 --> 02:19:36,530
Those fucks.
Yeah.

3320
02:19:36,531 --> 02:19:38,210
There's plenty in Australia.
You can bow hunt.

3321
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:40,070
Can you make a belt?
Oh yeah.

3322
02:19:40,590 --> 02:19:41,930
Probably make a pair of boots that go
with it.

3323
02:19:42,380 --> 02:19:43,930
Other than that,
no,

3324
02:19:44,710 --> 02:19:48,560
because she'd had a few of them.
Like you shoot all you want.

3325
02:19:49,650 --> 02:19:51,500
I give you permission to go straight and
shoot them all.

3326
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:55,190
Well that's the thing about Australia is
like you could kinda just shoot animals

3327
02:19:55,191 --> 02:19:57,380
constantly.
They have special makes.

3328
02:19:57,650 --> 02:19:59,250
Yeah.
No one's going to be bummed out.

3329
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:00,560
You shoot a snake.
God Damn.

3330
02:20:00,561 --> 02:20:03,470
What a beautiful looking creature.
Incredibly beautiful creatures.

3331
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:06,650
They're so shiny.
I saw like a 10 foot python to hunting.

3332
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,860
Really scary.
They have python.

3333
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:13,190
I'm so freaked out about snakes.
They have giant pythons,

3334
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,340
giant,
giant pythons.

3335
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:18,770
Someone was like 10 feet long and my
buddy almost stepped right on him too.

3336
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:22,220
What is the average stocking dear?
We're stocking right next to these giant

3337
02:20:22,221 --> 02:20:25,610
bucks and there's giant 10 foot snake
right next to how fat was it?

3338
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:30,740
Like as fat as my forearm.
Jesus Christ.

3339
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:34,130
Fucking big.
I was running with my dogs once in the

3340
02:20:34,131 --> 02:20:38,460
hills and we ran over what I thought was
a log and A.

3341
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,920
I just ran right over it.
I ran over it and then as my foot is

3342
02:20:42,921 --> 02:20:44,420
passing over at Mike,
I go,

3343
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:46,610
oh fuck,
that's a giant.

3344
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:50,630
Rattlesnake was a huge rattlesnake.
Like literally,

3345
02:20:50,631 --> 02:20:53,600
I mean not quite as big as my upper
forearm but definitely as big as my

3346
02:20:53,601 --> 02:20:57,480
wrist and it was easily seven right here
by your house here,

3347
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:58,820
right over here?
Yeah,

3348
02:20:59,090 --> 02:21:00,920
they're fucking.
There's a few of them up here that are

3349
02:21:00,990 --> 02:21:01,840
biggest shit.

3350
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:05,360
It was here.
Which big ass diamond head and no big

3351
02:21:05,361 --> 02:21:06,470
ass triangle head.
I was like,

3352
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:09,730
look at the size of this fucking thing
and I'm like defenseless,

3353
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:13,040
like mentally defenseless because I
don't even know.

3354
02:21:13,370 --> 02:21:15,230
I don't know how to react to snakes.
I don't know what to do.

3355
02:21:15,231 --> 02:21:17,300
I don't know where they live.
I don't know what they hide under.

3356
02:21:17,301 --> 02:21:21,230
Usually I don't having snake background
so I'm not like looking.

3357
02:21:22,170 --> 02:21:23,003
Thank you.
Diet.

3358
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:25,070
Rattlesnake killed.
Look at the size of this one.

3359
02:21:25,071 --> 02:21:26,980
This one is like fucking 12 feet long.
Yeah.

3360
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:29,060
Where this guy killed this thing.
Mexico.

3361
02:21:29,061 --> 02:21:30,380
It looks like.
Oh my God,

3362
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:32,150
look how fat it is.
30 yard shot.

3363
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:34,400
Guaranteed.
I would definitely take it all day long

3364
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:35,720
for that day.
He was 30 yards away,

3365
02:21:35,990 --> 02:21:37,810
smoke it with expandables.
Right.

3366
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:40,250
Like a rage.
Right.

3367
02:21:40,430 --> 02:21:43,360
Do you use a fixed head broadhead or
these expandable.

3368
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:45,350
So look at the size of that one.
Jesus Christ.

3369
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:50,300
That's bigger than the one I've run
across over at least semi.

3370
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:52,730
That's a big ass snake.
That's,

3371
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:53,573
you know.
Thanks.

3372
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:55,440
Yeah,
I use fix heads mainly.

3373
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,190
Yeah.
I use like these little vpa heads,

3374
02:21:58,210 --> 02:22:01,490
a vantage point.
Archery makes these like little two

3375
02:22:01,491 --> 02:22:02,840
bladed,
um,

3376
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:05,680
same one.
Um,

3377
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:08,510
but they're all machined out of one
piece of steel.

3378
02:22:08,511 --> 02:22:10,130
So they're,
they're very strong.

3379
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:11,110
They're very like,
uh,

3380
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:12,950
there's a super reliable heads and they
fly.

3381
02:22:12,951 --> 02:22:16,190
Well yeah,
there's a big debate in the archery

3382
02:22:16,191 --> 02:22:19,430
world.
Expandable broadheads versus fixed head.

3383
02:22:19,431 --> 02:22:23,870
What we're talking about folks is like
expandables as they go in these blades

3384
02:22:23,871 --> 02:22:26,100
open up on the side,
they're like a mechanical

3385
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:29,130
blade,
but sometimes they fail and they break

3386
02:22:29,131 --> 02:22:31,140
off when they hit ribs and stuff like
that.

3387
02:22:31,190 --> 02:22:32,023
And there,
there,

3388
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:34,290
there's some animals that they're better
on I think.

3389
02:22:34,690 --> 02:22:38,580
But I've used rages a bit and I've had
really good luck with them actually.

3390
02:22:38,670 --> 02:22:40,100
I've had friends that were like,
Oh man,

3391
02:22:40,250 --> 02:22:44,010
I can't do the rage thing anymore.
But I've had super good luck with them

3392
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:48,030
where they're making hybrids now to look
as he makes a hybrid and then then

3393
02:22:48,031 --> 02:22:48,371
those,
so,

3394
02:22:48,371 --> 02:22:53,371
so grave diggers where it's a fixed head
blade and then two other blades open up

3395
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:55,410
behind it,
which is actually probably even better

3396
02:22:55,411 --> 02:22:57,960
than just a regular fixed blade.
It totally depends on what you're

3397
02:22:57,961 --> 02:23:00,930
hunting too.
Because like where I live on access to

3398
02:23:00,931 --> 02:23:04,220
your access to deer were brought from
Sri Lanka there.

3399
02:23:04,330 --> 02:23:09,030
They're from Sri Lanka
and India.

3400
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:14,090
So there's like an Asian deer and their
main Predator in like in like Borneo and

3401
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:15,360
we're.

3402
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,250
And we're,
we're there from in a,

3403
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:19,680
in all those countries there was a
bengal tiger.

3404
02:23:20,130 --> 02:23:21,720
So if you look up the history of access
deer,

3405
02:23:21,721 --> 02:23:25,080
it's mean Predator for thousands of
years of Bengal tiger.

3406
02:23:25,310 --> 02:23:26,280
Wow.
So they have,

3407
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:30,120
they have like a vertical leap,
like a crazy vertical leap and they run

3408
02:23:30,121 --> 02:23:32,790
like super fast and they always jump.
You're Arielle right?

3409
02:23:32,791 --> 02:23:34,830
They always,
they always jumped the string.

3410
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,590
Yeah,
so when they jumped the string to you,

3411
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:40,400
aim low so they ducked down.
You catch them when they're tough thing

3412
02:23:40,410 --> 02:23:41,400
down,
super low,

3413
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:44,700
and if they're alert most of the time
you came off their body.

3414
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:48,600
So if they don't see you and they don't
see you release your Arrow,

3415
02:23:48,601 --> 02:23:50,750
do you still aim low?
Aim Low.

3416
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:53,820
The sound.
It makes them react down.

3417
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:55,260
They react like super,
super,

3418
02:23:55,261 --> 02:23:56,720
hyper fast.
So what?

3419
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:57,360
What?
I don't.

3420
02:23:57,360 --> 02:24:00,060
The reason I brought it up is because
those mechanicals are really good,

3421
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:04,530
especially on access to here because
even if you make a perfect shot,

3422
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,020
like a fear,
just incredible archer,

3423
02:24:06,030 --> 02:24:08,280
like someone like Cameron Hanes,
you're 40 yards,

3424
02:24:08,550 --> 02:24:10,650
you're just rock solid,
not nervous.

3425
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:14,520
You can make the perfect shot.
That animal could be completely spin

3426
02:24:14,521 --> 02:24:17,310
around into one 80 and you hit him in
the other side.

3427
02:24:17,311 --> 02:24:19,620
He hit him in,
you know you can make a gut shot even

3428
02:24:19,621 --> 02:24:21,400
though you made a perfect shot just
because they move.

3429
02:24:21,401 --> 02:24:25,220
So in those kinds of situations I think,
you know,

3430
02:24:25,410 --> 02:24:27,780
biggest boundable is,
is really good,

3431
02:24:27,781 --> 02:24:29,220
you know,
because if you hit him badly,

3432
02:24:29,370 --> 02:24:31,350
those,
those things cut giant holes,

3433
02:24:31,351 --> 02:24:32,040
you know?
Yeah.

3434
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:35,300
They cut giant holes and cam shot a bear
with a,

3435
02:24:35,310 --> 02:24:38,070
one of those grave diggers.
It's one of those hybrid blades would,

3436
02:24:38,071 --> 02:24:41,700
has a large fixed blade,
but then as these two really big

3437
02:24:41,701 --> 02:24:45,420
expandables that go to a,
an inch and three quarters and it just

3438
02:24:45,421 --> 02:24:47,610
opened up a shot,
like a 300 win mag.

3439
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:49,180
Yeah.
It was a huge holes.

3440
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:52,410
The difference in the bear rather.
And they still get the crazy

3441
02:24:52,411 --> 02:24:53,150
penetration.

3442
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:56,190
Yeah.
Well he's shooting 80 pounds to and you

3443
02:24:56,191 --> 02:24:58,590
know,
with those really thin,

3444
02:24:58,890 --> 02:25:02,190
a Fmj deep six injection arrows.
What uh,

3445
02:25:02,191 --> 02:25:05,430
what kind of boat are you shooting with?
I should have Mathews Halon six of those

3446
02:25:05,431 --> 02:25:07,170
are great posts.
That's what Ben has.

3447
02:25:07,220 --> 02:25:11,510
St Mary quiet silent.
So the six is the one with the sixth and

3448
02:25:11,630 --> 02:25:12,510
spray site,
which is.

3449
02:25:12,511 --> 02:25:13,560
So it's a little jumpy,
right?

3450
02:25:13,561 --> 02:25:16,500
It's like the Turbo Cam.
They have a five or six and a seven.

3451
02:25:16,501 --> 02:25:18,420
I believe.
So the five is like the junk,

3452
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:19,710
you know,
the fastest one,

3453
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:25,010
but it's probably not easy to shoot.
So like with all speed beaus I think the

3454
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:27,340
shorter the brace height,
the Fascia they'd go,

3455
02:25:27,350 --> 02:25:28,620
but they're,
you know,

3456
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:31,210
my understanding is that I'm not like
the Super Archer guidance.

3457
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:35,080
Um,
but my understanding is that the longer

3458
02:25:35,081 --> 02:25:38,650
that brace height in general,
that the more forgiving the is to shoot.

3459
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:41,710
We just got into technical geek talk and
people in their cars right now.

3460
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:45,790
Fast forward to the next subject.
Yeah.

3461
02:25:45,791 --> 02:25:47,330
We,
I geek out on Bozeman.

3462
02:25:47,350 --> 02:25:49,930
I kick out on all sorts of gear.
I'm,

3463
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:52,120
I'm just,
I'm a fan of all the,

3464
02:25:52,121 --> 02:25:54,670
like the little tiny things that make a
difference.

3465
02:25:54,671 --> 02:25:58,230
Yeah.
And you should avoid and make good bows.

3466
02:25:58,550 --> 02:25:59,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

3467
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:02,260
Are Good.
Defining carbon defiant.

3468
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:04,960
Eighty pounds.
So fucking flame thrower,

3469
02:26:04,961 --> 02:26:06,010
man.
Yeah,

3470
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:07,000
no kidding.
I love it.

3471
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:09,490
They fling some arrows out fast.
Yeah.

3472
02:26:09,880 --> 02:26:12,790
I'm just so obsessed with it.
I practice almost too much.

3473
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:16,060
I really have a real issue.
We were talking about the new studio

3474
02:26:16,061 --> 02:26:18,460
that we're setting up or it has a 50
yard indoor range.

3475
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:23,000
One of the reasons why I got it coming
back over next time I bring my belt.

3476
02:26:24,830 --> 02:26:26,590
Um,
so do you have anything planned that

3477
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:28,180
you're really looking forward to and he.

3478
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:29,380
Big Hunter.
You're planning?

3479
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:31,390
Uh,
I have nothing to promote on.

3480
02:26:31,391 --> 02:26:32,730
The show has.
No,

3481
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,200
no,
no,

3482
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:33,760
no,
no.

3483
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:35,980
Come on.
I have a book coming out or a movie.

3484
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:37,060
If they do,
that's cool.

3485
02:26:37,061 --> 02:26:38,230
If they don't,
that's better.

3486
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:40,770
It's not,
it's not bad one way or another yet.

3487
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:43,030
The thing tonight and.
Well that's fine too,

3488
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:46,750
but I just wanted to talk to you things
I do.

3489
02:26:46,751 --> 02:26:49,330
I do have a lot of coming up.
I have some Rad surf trips.

3490
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,740
I served for a company called Billabong.
That's my major.

3491
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:54,580
My major sponsor.
They make clothes and tee shirt on right

3492
02:26:54,581 --> 02:26:55,150
now.
Yeah.

3493
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:57,370
So I write it.
I have written for them forever and

3494
02:26:57,371 --> 02:27:01,030
they're awesome.
But they have a really good amateur

3495
02:27:01,031 --> 02:27:01,601
team,
like their,

3496
02:27:01,601 --> 02:27:02,110
you know,
their,

3497
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:04,990
their best youngest averages from around
the world to ride for Billabong.

3498
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:08,500
They activate them and take them on a
couple trips a year.

3499
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:12,880
So they're taking them to Bali.
And so I'm going to Bali to go in and

3500
02:27:12,910 --> 02:27:14,610
help mentor them,
surf with them,

3501
02:27:14,630 --> 02:27:17,200
help train them and help get them ready
for like the next step.

3502
02:27:17,201 --> 02:27:18,430
Right.
So I'm bringing my son,

3503
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:22,850
my son is nine.
He likes to surf so I'm actually going

3504
02:27:22,851 --> 02:27:25,660
to go to Bali is a first time that's
ever happened and I'm going to go to

3505
02:27:25,661 --> 02:27:28,090
Bali for a work trip,
which I do that pretty often and go,

3506
02:27:28,290 --> 02:27:29,980
go on surf trips that are really a work
trip.

3507
02:27:30,270 --> 02:27:31,840
Um,
but now I get to bring my son because he

3508
02:27:31,841 --> 02:27:33,010
likes to surf,
which is really,

3509
02:27:33,011 --> 02:27:34,330
really cool.
Wow.

3510
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:36,400
That's bad ass.
Yeah.

3511
02:27:36,401 --> 02:27:38,170
So he might.
My son,

3512
02:27:38,171 --> 02:27:39,550
now that he,
he likes to Skateboard,

3513
02:27:39,551 --> 02:27:42,970
he's little skater rot rat.
And I tried.

3514
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:44,920
I was,
I hope that he'd be in the surfing,

3515
02:27:44,921 --> 02:27:46,960
you know,
because that's what I love to do and now

3516
02:27:46,961 --> 02:27:47,710
they'd like to surf.

3517
02:27:47,710 --> 02:27:49,750
I'm just so stoked.
And now I'm taking them to Bali.

3518
02:27:49,751 --> 02:27:51,220
So do you think he's going to try
bowhunting?

3519
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:54,000
He already balanced.
Really?

3520
02:27:54,010 --> 02:27:57,520
He's nine bow hunts.
Has He been successful?

3521
02:27:57,550 --> 02:27:58,271
Yes.
Whoa.

3522
02:27:58,271 --> 02:28:02,170
Was He shot bars,
your nine year old kid?

3523
02:28:02,171 --> 02:28:04,810
And he killed a wild boar.
Now they'll text you some pictures.

3524
02:28:04,811 --> 02:28:05,970
You'll,
you'll be savaged.

3525
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:08,170
He looks,
he got really long hair and he's in the

3526
02:28:08,171 --> 02:28:11,380
photo with the boys.
All this face paint on his face and he's

3527
02:28:11,381 --> 02:28:15,880
got his little bad ass boat right there.
His arrows all passed through y three

3528
02:28:15,881 --> 02:28:16,714
now.
And that's

3529
02:28:18,170 --> 02:28:19,900
what kind of pose you shooting.
He shoots,

3530
02:28:19,930 --> 02:28:21,890
he shoots 30 pounds right now because
he's tiny.

3531
02:28:22,110 --> 02:28:23,460
Yeah,
he's nine.

3532
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:25,190
He's nine,
but he's small.

3533
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:27,050
He's a small nine.
That's small.

3534
02:28:27,110 --> 02:28:31,370
It's a pretty fucking strong for 30
pounds is super strong.

3535
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:32,480
Do you have.
I'm lifting weights.

3536
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:33,343
He's ripped.

3537
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:34,503
No,
he's dead serious.

3538
02:28:35,210 --> 02:28:38,520
He's got a six pack.
He's never stopped moving.

3539
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:40,100
He's got a lot of energies onto those
kids.

3540
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:41,560
He's uh,
he,

3541
02:28:41,561 --> 02:28:43,760
um,
he's at skate camp right now up at

3542
02:28:43,761 --> 02:28:46,490
Woodward West.
So I dropped him off at Woodward West

3543
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:48,560
and I got some work to do in southern
California here.

3544
02:28:49,050 --> 02:28:52,310
So he's at skate camp hanging out or you
were saying there's something wrong with

3545
02:28:52,311 --> 02:28:53,660
your back?
Yeah.

3546
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:55,410
What's going on?
Ah,

3547
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:57,080
I dunno,
that's what I'm doing here.

3548
02:28:57,081 --> 02:28:57,740
I'm just,
I mean,

3549
02:28:57,740 --> 02:29:00,990
I had to get an Mri this morning.
I kinda just tweaked my back like,

3550
02:29:00,991 --> 02:29:03,590
uh,
about nine months ago and it was really

3551
02:29:03,591 --> 02:29:05,150
bad.
Um,

3552
02:29:05,630 --> 02:29:08,660
I was doing a workout and it hurt it.
What part of your back?

3553
02:29:08,990 --> 02:29:10,910
My lower back.
Yeah.

3554
02:29:11,450 --> 02:29:13,620
I've got a machine in the back.
I want to show you what's wrong.

3555
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:15,470
We're done here.
It's a reverse hyper.

3556
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,320
Yeah,
yeah,

3557
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:17,450
yeah,
yeah.

3558
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:18,980
That's good.
Have you heard of them before?

3559
02:29:19,010 --> 02:29:20,480
Yeah,
I use them a little bit.

3560
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:21,480
Oh really?
Yeah,

3561
02:29:21,530 --> 02:29:23,360
they're the shit.
They're really good if you can,

3562
02:29:23,361 --> 02:29:25,160
if you have a place for them,
you should get a.

3563
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:27,230
it's a fucking phenomenal piece of
machinery.

3564
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:29,450
So I got really into crossfit,
so I was using,

3565
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:32,840
I was using the reverse hyper a lot.
Yeah,

3566
02:29:32,850 --> 02:29:33,980
that's good.
So it,

3567
02:29:33,981 --> 02:29:38,180
was this before or after the injury?
I'm like before and after.

3568
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:39,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

3569
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:39,950
Does it help?
Reverse?

3570
02:29:39,951 --> 02:29:42,560
Hyper helps out.
Helps stretch me out and loosen it up.

3571
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:44,990
There's also some,
we have some decompression stuff in the

3572
02:29:44,991 --> 02:29:47,570
back,
some different spinal decompression and

3573
02:29:47,571 --> 02:29:49,460
things that I could show you that will
help.

3574
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:53,390
I'm kind of an expert now in healing up
a back injury.

3575
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:59,140
I had a pretty severe bulging disc issue
for Jitsu that my hand's numb.

3576
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:00,170
Wow.
Yeah.

3577
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:01,730
But now it's gone.
It's completely.

3578
02:30:01,731 --> 02:30:02,451
That's crazy.
Yeah.

3579
02:30:02,451 --> 02:30:04,490
I don't have any bolt at all.
Had an MRI.

3580
02:30:04,491 --> 02:30:06,860
It's clean.
I've never had back issues.

3581
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:09,290
And uh,
like nine months ago I was training the

3582
02:30:09,291 --> 02:30:11,690
thing with the hat.
I think the thing that happened is I was

3583
02:30:11,691 --> 02:30:15,530
training like really pretty seriously
for like got really into it,

3584
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:18,710
got really excited about it and just
love training and it was like one of

3585
02:30:18,711 --> 02:30:22,070
those things I just love to do.
So I like five days a week I got really

3586
02:30:22,071 --> 02:30:23,650
like muscular throughout my,
my,

3587
02:30:23,820 --> 02:30:28,550
my hips and my quads and my core and I
just got super,

3588
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:29,960
super developed,
you know,

3589
02:30:30,030 --> 02:30:32,930
kind of like my muscles got like cables
and um,

3590
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:38,500
and then I just had like a five month
period of time where I was just

3591
02:30:39,021 --> 02:30:42,230
traveling out of the country for like
five months and I just couldn't do the

3592
02:30:42,231 --> 02:30:43,000
same kind of workout.

3593
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,650
So I was in.
He's really mellow workouts and kind of

3594
02:30:45,651 --> 02:30:48,530
not working out too much and then I got
home and it had like a month to get

3595
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:51,620
ready for winter and so like,
you know,

3596
02:30:51,700 --> 02:30:54,890
ease back into the workout thing and the
first workout I did my body just got

3597
02:30:54,891 --> 02:30:58,760
pissed,
just locked up a tried to go just a

3598
02:30:58,761 --> 02:31:01,520
little too hard too quick or trying to
go really mellow,

3599
02:31:01,521 --> 02:31:04,910
but I was going relatively mellow
compared to what I was doing before,

3600
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:06,980
but my body just was like,
I don't know,

3601
02:31:06,981 --> 02:31:10,190
it just was pissed.
Do you ever fuck with yoga?

3602
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:12,260
I Love Yoga.
I do.

3603
02:31:12,261 --> 02:31:14,840
I really like it.
I just the yoga classes around my house

3604
02:31:14,841 --> 02:31:16,850
or never the right time and I don't do
it by myself.

3605
02:31:17,270 --> 02:31:20,200
Just get a DVD or youtube man.
I need a lot

3606
02:31:20,210 --> 02:31:22,560
of videos on youtube and you to do that.
That's man.

3607
02:31:22,561 --> 02:31:25,350
That's been a saving grace for me.
It's been a big help and like,

3608
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:30,120
and also there's a lot of yoga exercises
that I didn't even realize they before I

3609
02:31:30,121 --> 02:31:30,541
did it.
They,

3610
02:31:30,541 --> 02:31:34,170
they act as a spinal decompression.
They stretch you out,

3611
02:31:34,171 --> 02:31:35,640
you feel your back pop,
pop,

3612
02:31:35,641 --> 02:31:37,950
pop as you're.
You're doing some of the stretches.

3613
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:40,470
I actually really love Yoga.
It's fucking awesome,

3614
02:31:40,471 --> 02:31:41,730
man.
I go to yoga classes.

3615
02:31:41,731 --> 02:31:43,980
My wife's super into yoga.
It's one of those things though,

3616
02:31:43,981 --> 02:31:46,170
like for a dude,
especially a manly surfer,

3617
02:31:46,171 --> 02:31:48,180
bowhunting type dude.
Tell people,

3618
02:31:48,181 --> 02:31:49,170
yeah,
I'm really into yoga.

3619
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,460
Oh,
what are you sucking dicks over there

3620
02:31:50,461 --> 02:31:51,990
and that yoga class,
they're starting.

3621
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:57,600
It's one of those,
it seems like a good thing or a bull.

3622
02:31:57,601 --> 02:32:01,800
You're a bow hunter and you surf 50 foot
waves on paper.

3623
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:04,230
You're a pretty fucking macho dude
fella.

3624
02:32:04,380 --> 02:32:05,940
Yeah,
but if you.

3625
02:32:05,941 --> 02:32:07,290
If you talked to anybody who knew me,
well,

3626
02:32:07,291 --> 02:32:09,090
they wouldn't.
It would never describe me as macho.

3627
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:11,220
Well,
I don't mean macho like a in a dumb way

3628
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:13,410
to walk into a yoga class is what I'm
saying.

3629
02:32:13,411 --> 02:32:16,800
Of course you don't,
but saying it like saying yoga to

3630
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:19,230
people.
I'm not saying obviously I don't have a

3631
02:32:19,231 --> 02:32:20,610
problem with it.
I do it all the time,

3632
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:24,960
but I'm saying there's a sort of
preconceived notion about yoga that it's

3633
02:32:24,961 --> 02:32:27,240
like,
it's not a hard thing to do.

3634
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:29,460
It's not like a mailing,
but it's one of the most difficult

3635
02:32:29,461 --> 02:32:31,800
things to do that I have ever done that
kicks your ass.

3636
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:32,550
Fuck.
Yeah.

3637
02:32:32,550 --> 02:32:34,580
Does.
Especially hot yoga is.

3638
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:38,610
It's unbelievable how difficult it is.
My wife does this stuff called Buddhi

3639
02:32:38,610 --> 02:32:39,300
Yoga.
Have you ever heard that?

3640
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:39,990
Buddhi Yoga.

3641
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:41,220
I like it.
I read a yoga,

3642
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:43,590
like yoga.
She's going to kill me.

3643
02:32:43,650 --> 02:32:47,670
Yoga slash kind of simulate twerking,
but it's like a dance yoga.

3644
02:32:47,671 --> 02:32:50,760
It's like high energy but like crazy
yoga poses,

3645
02:32:50,761 --> 02:32:54,060
but they like gnarly cardio too.
And the girl Jen who teaches the class

3646
02:32:54,061 --> 02:32:56,760
is bad ass and it's the gnarliest
workout.

3647
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:58,230
I'd never done it.
Okay.

3648
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:00,600
Too much for that.
For Buddhi Yoga?

3649
02:33:00,601 --> 02:33:01,320
Yes.
Yes.

3650
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:02,153
See,
I knew it.

3651
02:33:02,490 --> 02:33:04,440
I knew I couldn't.
What is this?

3652
02:33:04,441 --> 02:33:06,420
This is Buddhi Yoga.
Jamie found it already.

3653
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:09,750
So this girls throwing like a back kick.
Yeah,

3654
02:33:09,751 --> 02:33:12,000
that's.
That's definitely not what I'm talking

3655
02:33:12,001 --> 02:33:13,020
about.
Yeah.

3656
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:13,883
Well,
I think every.

3657
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:17,190
I don't think Buddhi Yoga has an
official designation,

3658
02:33:17,191 --> 02:33:19,530
so I think a lot of people call their
stuff Buddhi Yoga,

3659
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:22,950
but the class and my wife does it will
kick your ass.

3660
02:33:22,951 --> 02:33:25,080
It's like really high energy.
It's really crazy.

3661
02:33:25,081 --> 02:33:26,480
Cardio and it's yoga too.

3662
02:33:26,490 --> 02:33:29,430
So.
And there's twerking is a little bit.

3663
02:33:29,550 --> 02:33:32,490
Are they,
do they play like little wayne and like

3664
02:33:32,491 --> 02:33:34,710
the gangster rap and I just,
they just go off,

3665
02:33:34,711 --> 02:33:35,141
you know,
they,

3666
02:33:35,141 --> 02:33:37,040
they get none of that.
That's probably more

3667
02:33:38,830 --> 02:33:43,260
my wife's much hotter than in her
booty.

3668
02:33:43,261 --> 02:33:45,720
Yoga with twerking plus little way
music.

3669
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:48,630
Anything that keeps,
keeps stuff.

3670
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:52,440
The Mrs. Oh sure.
Shay in shape and nice and tight.

3671
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:54,600
I'm a giant fan of them.
Yeah,

3672
02:33:55,070 --> 02:33:56,640
for them all about it.
Yeah.

3673
02:33:56,641 --> 02:33:59,250
If girls want to do this all day,
absolutely all about it.

3674
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,100
I'm a big fan of what she's doing here
in this video.

3675
02:34:01,110 --> 02:34:03,300
I don't see any downside.
Anything.

3676
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:04,800
I'm agreeing with you.
One hundred percent.

3677
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:07,470
Well listen man,
thank you very much for coming.

3678
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:10,830
I really appreciate it.
And Shane's got a twitter but he doesn't

3679
02:34:10,831 --> 02:34:12,050
use it.
So uh,

3680
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:13,920
she see him say hi.
Yeah,

3681
02:34:14,380 --> 02:34:16,090
I got an instagram that I use.
Okay,

3682
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:18,220
and what is instagram?

3683
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:22,060
Instagram is Shane Dorian s h a n e d o
r I a n.

3684
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:23,670
well thanks for coming in man.
I really appreciate it.

3685
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:24,560
I really enjoyed talking to you.
Yeah,

3686
02:34:24,561 --> 02:34:25,750
was fine.
All right folks,

3687
02:34:25,751 --> 02:34:27,460
we'll be back in a little bit with Ari
Shaffir.

3688
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:28,423
Bye.

3689
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:34,050
Mm.
