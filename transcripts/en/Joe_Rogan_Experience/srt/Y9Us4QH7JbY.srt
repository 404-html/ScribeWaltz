1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,973
I got stories,
I got that magnetic shit I did in my 

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:07,710
brain.
Now is it happening?

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,850
It's happening right now.
Crazy how it works out like that,

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,703
right?
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,900
Well we just spelled the same way.
I did some magnetic stick to my brain.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,551
Yeah.
I can go.

7
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,121
I feel like,
um,

8
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:18,810
your,
your,

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,670
your depression correspondent.
Like I go out and do crazy shit.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,010
I did that.
I'll.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,350
All right.
So it's called tr.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,980
I talked about it last time I was here.
I was going to do it.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,100
I did.
Um,

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,980
I did ketamine,
which I got to say I cannot recommend.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,180
Really?
Yeah,

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,950
I did three.
No,

17
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,470
actually I did six sessions.
Uh,

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,600
which was crazy.
Did it?

19
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:47,601
But the side effects long term where my 
eyes burned for straight up two to three

20
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:51,140
months every day.
Yeah.

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,790
Houses like burn,
like I needed drops constantly.

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,683
Like I'm like,
you stare at the Sun burnt when 

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,550
irritated.
I'm like,

24
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,080
I got something in them.
Yeah.

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,243
More like that.
And I just felt like kind of groggy and 

26
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:06,790
out of it for a couple months.
Really?

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,670
Yeah.
Then I did.

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,860
Um,
let's explain.

29
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,490
So Ketamine last.
Yeah,

30
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,383
yeah,
well I talked about the last time I was 

31
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:13,900
here,
but yeah,

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,113
uh,
because I got a lot of talk about you 

33
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:17,304
were going to do it or you don't,
it maybe I was gonna do I think you had 

34
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,731
done it?
Yeah,

35
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:23,670
I had done it and it was still too early
to tell,

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,533
but I remember running into in the hall 
at the comedy store and you were super 

37
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,400
happy.
It was amazing the first time I did it,

38
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:30,234
the first two sessions were great and 
then after that I kind of hit a plateau 

39
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,740
and,
and the,

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,510
the,
I just kind of felt like,

41
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,140
just kinda like groggy for a not 
kidding,

42
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,160
like a couple months.

43
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,023
So the first session you,
did you get this positive benefit from 

44
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:44,620
it?
Yeah,

45
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,970
they point in continuing,
uh,

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,930
because the,
the,

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,540
the treatment is six sessions,
the protocol,

48
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,000
that's the protocol.
So,

49
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,051
um,
hold on.

50
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:55,884
I think I have video of it too.
I know I have video switching and not 

51
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,140
even that if you're just in a basically 
in like a hospital room.

52
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,780
Right.
But the experience itself,

53
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,614
you said was full blown psychedelic.
Straight up fucking 100 percent 

54
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,790
tripping.
Tripping balls.

55
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,590
And this is all FDA approved.
Uh,

56
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,523
it's FDA approved as an anesthetic.
It's not FDA approved at that actually 

57
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,320
know what and getting the.
I think it is.

58
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,690
They're actually because otherwise I 
wouldn't be able to talk about it.

59
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,723
Yeah,
it is approved as an off label a 

60
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,710
depression treatment off labels.
Tricky Shit,

61
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,150
isn't it?
Yes.

62
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,090
Because there's no.
They don't know.

63
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,990
Yeah,
maybe.

64
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,440
I mean that's all of them in some ways.
Especially with antidepressants.

65
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,161
It's all like,
yeah,

66
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,900
this might,
this might,

67
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,400
could do something.
Maybe not.

68
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,293
I liked that.
There's stuff that they can do to you 

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
that is definitely beneficial,
but it's just,

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
you know,
your insurance isn't gonna cover it.

71
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,460
If you have the cash you can pay for it.
Yeah.

72
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,980
That's kind of the situation I was in 
where it's like nobody

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
was going to pay for it,
but if you want to roll the dice and I 

74
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,820
rolled the dice and I got to say,
but you,

75
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,690
do you think that if the initial 
treatments that you had the first couple

76
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,420
that you really had good responses from?
If you just stop there,

77
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,840
you'd have a different opinion of it.
I don't know.

78
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,880
That's the thing.
If I had just done it once,

79
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,250
it kind of felt like you ever do acid.
Yes.

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,460
You're not paying that.
Like super clear feeling you get.

81
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,120
That's how I felt the day I saw you.
I did ask him for the first time,

82
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,520
like I was,
I want to say four months ago.

83
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,630
Oh Wow.
A months ago.

84
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,000
That's great.
What'd you think?

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,150
Loved it.
Yeah.

86
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,800
You didn't find it too intense?
No.

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
Okay.
Because it can be speedy as fuck.

88
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,930
I'm so used to edibles and float tanks.

89
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,480
Yeah.
That I think it's,

90
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,670
uh,
it's very introspective.

91
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,800
It was very clean,
like the,

92
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,330
I,
the idea behind it,

93
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,500
like the,
uh,

94
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,060
the,
the feeling behind it,

95
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,490
the thought process behind it.
I was like,

96
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,350
Ooh,
this is like some mind clarifier.

97
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,700
It's like,
you know,

98
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,534
Bill Hicks,
he used to call it a squeegee and your 

99
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,000
third.
I like mushrooms.

100
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,410
That's,
it felt,

101
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,890
it felt very,
uh,

102
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,840
clarifying if that makes any sense.
But it makes total sense.

103
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,570
I felt great.
I felt really good.

104
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,290
Felt really friendly during.
Yeah,

105
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,314
man,
like you must have had good stuff 

106
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,273
because a lot of times it can be speedy 
and it ends up feeling like mushrooms 

107
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,600
and I think my math.
Oh,

108
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,160
combined?
Yeah.

109
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,013
And you end up with this just like 
intense fucking is not the God damn 

110
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,180
problem is that it's illegal.
Getting weird versions of it.

111
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,150
Here's your thing,
here's the doctor put in the Ibmi arm.

112
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,330
Okay.
Oh Jesus.

113
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Just can I say it?
Yeah.

114
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,553
Oh Christ.
Did you take this with the 19 eighties 

115
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:46,231
phone?
No,

116
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:48,580
that's just the way it's saved or 
whatever.

117
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,590
Why does it seem so little?
I don't know.

118
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,620
This is blue bar.
He's blown.

119
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,600
Okay.
No,

120
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,540
can't.
So this doctor is,

121
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,260
it looked like in Ob Shapiro.
Ojs Council.

122
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,320
Oh,
just lead counsel.

123
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,240
You can corner.
I don't know.

124
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,840
Um,
so we just,

125
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,340
you just go into a regular doctor's 
office and sticks this thing.

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,980
It's thing in your arm and off you go.
Now the doctor has,

127
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,730
he tried it himself?
Uh,

128
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:21,060
he would not say,
but it was said.

129
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:24,270
Well,
he said it with a wink that he had.

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,553
He was like,
I won't comment either way on whether 

131
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:30,480
I've done it myself.
So all those guys didn't want to keep it

132
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:32,000
on the sneak tip.
Yeah.

133
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,380
But clearly he had.
And so yeah.

134
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:37,890
So I would say for,
for the first session was amazing.

135
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:38,724
That's when I saw you.
And then after that it got a little 

136
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:41,694
dicey.
Now what does it feel like when you're 

137
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,450
in it?

138
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,450
I was in a,
it felt like I was in a pod,

139
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,530
a pod in like a small.
It's a small world after all,

140
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:53,364
like pod.
I'm going into the on now crossing arms 

141
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
and I would like a little boat just 
going along through rooms and the rooms 

142
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,981
I would say were designed like kind of a
bit like a,

143
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,980
what's the,
a clockwork orange,

144
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,180
but like the milk bar thing,
a bit like white walls,

145
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,380
white breathing walls and yeah,
breathing,

146
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,100
breathing.
Yeah.

147
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,953
They were inhaling and exhaling and,
but I was never freaked out and then 

148
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,010
there was like kind of digits on it,
like the Matrix.

149
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,580
It had like a green hue to it.
Um,

150
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,100
my biggest worry when I was in it was 
like,

151
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm so out of it,
if there's an earthquake I'm fucked like

152
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:42,394
I,
and then I would get like wide shots of 

153
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,744
California,
get wide shots of California and think 

154
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:49,264
about like the hospital crumbling and 
then me trying to get out and going 

155
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,110
like,
I can't go,

156
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:54,944
man,
you're not going to have to go without 

157
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:55,760
me.

158
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,950
Give me 40 minutes and I'll catch up to 
you guys.

159
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,470
Uh,
so that was my biggest worry,

160
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:02,690
but for the most part it was just like a
fairly pleasant.

161
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,710
I just couldn't get over the fact that 
this was happening in a doctor's office,

162
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,130
just like a regular ass fucking 
doctorate,

163
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,760
like literally waiting room with other 
physicians and their patients,

164
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:18,761
old Weirdos met shitty magazines and 
then you go in and you trip your fucking

165
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:23,390
head off and so you're sitting in like a
regular chair.

166
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,800
You're sitting,
it's a,

167
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:28,010
it's a recliner,
double bed type thing.

168
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:28,791
Oh yeah,
it's real nice.

169
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,624
They spared no expense.
So you're sitting in this craftmatic 

170
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,950
adjustable bed,
um,

171
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,923
you,
you get the needle in the arm and they 

172
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,600
leave it in there for how long?
Forty,

173
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,130
40 minutes.
Forty minutes.

174
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,173
Now if an earthquake happened,
could you just pull the needle out of 

175
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:42,710
your arm?

176
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,290
And I was so out of it.
I don't think I could have.

177
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,400
I think once the drip happened,
like it's in you for awhile.

178
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,330
So what's the drift happens?
You probably have however long.

179
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,480
I mean it's a 40 minute trip apparently,
but I don't know if it's based on one,

180
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,793
if it's,
I don't know how much is going in at 

181
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,230
once.
Now that stuff,

182
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,240
ketamine is weird because it's,
um,

183
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,430
it was a tranquilizer,
right?

184
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,820
For animals events also.
Exactly.

185
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,663
That's a,
it's a,

186
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,840
it's a horse tranquilizer and they use 
it as an anesthesia for humans.

187
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,160
Yeah,
I've heard of that.

188
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,620
The guy was an anesthesiologist.
He was,

189
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,840
yeah.
Don't they use that in war time?

190
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:18,674
Because it's easy to carry around.
I believe they have in war time because 

191
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,670
you can use very small amounts and it 
puts people under,

192
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,200
you know what that sounds like.

193
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,400
That sounds like a Joe Rogan fact,
you know,

194
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,610
I don't know for sure,
but it sounds like.

195
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,750
Yes.
I think,

196
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,220
uh,
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

197
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm pretty sure I was listening to a 
podcast,

198
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,714
whether you're talking about various 
forms of anesthesia and it sort of the 

199
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:46,730
evolution of using anesthesia and that 
ketamine worked really good in the field

200
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,773
because you could have a very small 
amount and you would put someone under 

201
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,570
pretty deeply.
I don't know what if it's local,

202
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,291
do you know what I mean?
Like,

203
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,750
I don't know if you could done surgery.
It wasn't like I couldn't feel myself.

204
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,470
Right,
right.

205
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,600
It was more like I had no interest in 
it.

206
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,020
When you on here following FDA approval 
in 1970,

207
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,153
what did that?
And Stesha was first given to American 

208
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,100
soldiers during the Vietnam War.
Oh,

209
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,980
there you go.
Uh,

210
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,770
yeah,
there's a lot of shit on reddit about,

211
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,250
about it as an,
as an antidepressant treatment.

212
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,920
Frantic for depression.
So for you,

213
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,440
um,
you heard about this,

214
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,660
how,
I don't know,

215
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:25,494
I want to say if you just google 
depression treatments page two or 

216
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,830
alternative depression treatment,
that's probably what I,

217
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,010
what I googled.
Now we've had these conversations before

218
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,873
you and I about it,
about depression and different 

219
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,920
treatments.
How much exercise do you do?

220
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,580
Did we talk about this before amount?
I've run probably three,

221
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,080
four days a week.
That's pretty nice.

222
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,943
Yeah.
That's supposed to be one of the best 

223
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,370
things.
Yeah,

224
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,950
depressions,
cardio.

225
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,170
But like,
I've never gotten a runner's high.

226
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,370
That makes sense.
Really.

227
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,060
I think I have a shortage of dopamine in
my brain.

228
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,193
Just naturally.
Like I just think I don't have a ton of 

229
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:00,654
dough for me.
Like I don't.

230
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,720
Joy is not a thing I think I've ever 
experienced.

231
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,020
What I repeat,
joy is the thing that I don't think I've

232
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:07,560
ever experienced.

233
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,700
I'll experience adrenaline rushes and 
like ego,

234
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,560
but I'll never be truly like Julius.
Yeah,

235
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,010
it stinks.
It fucking stinks because it's something

236
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm,
I,

237
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,330
I,
I believe in.

238
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,120
I just don't.
I've accomplished things I've done,

239
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:24,954
you know what I mean?
But I never get this sense of like this 

240
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,070
real,
you know,

241
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:32,790
in very small doses,
vic streaming like micro doses.

242
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,820
So like let me put into perspective like
career wise.

243
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,650
So yeah,
you had a nice comedy central special to

244
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,170
put a lot of hype behind it.
You did.

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,850
I watched,
he did really well.

246
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,090
Got a great response.
How'd you feel when all that was over?

247
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,400
I felt cool.
Cool.

248
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,350
Do you know what I mean?
Like,

249
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,670
yeah,
exactly.

250
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,131
Like all.
Alright,

251
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,870
good shit man.
Keep going.

252
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,883
See what else?
But it was never like during Chappelle 

253
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:56,890
show,
I never got like A.

254
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,980
I'm the king of the world,
you know what I mean?

255
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,490
Never that sort of like huge,
uh,

256
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,493
you know,
something that would make you want to 

257
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,120
scream.
You feel so good.

258
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,620
Do you get that much all day?
Twenty four slash seven.

259
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,700
I just hold it and try not to scream if 
you want to take a break.

260
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,863
If you want to go up on the roof.
I'm the worst guy to talk to this about 

261
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,950
because I don't really,
I don't really get depressed.

262
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:22,680
I've been depressed before.
But answer my question,

263
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,630
the join question.
I'm joyful all the time.

264
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,950
You.
That wasn't a joke.

265
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,160
You've really.
I'm pretty happy.

266
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:27,994
That's great.
You.

267
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,400
Here's a good enough.
You seem happy.

268
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,480
Yeah.
Like I don't.

269
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,310
I buy it.
I'm not letting his fucking Joe.

270
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,230
Joe Rogan thinks he's happy.
You seem happy.

271
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,630
I have a lot of friends.
Yeah.

272
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,940
Like that's a big part of it.
You know,

273
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,390
a lot of cool friends.

274
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,570
Love.
Uh,

275
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,290
I love having a family.
Love what I do.

276
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,513
Like my jobs.
My day is filled with stuff I enjoy 

277
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:47,704
doing.
Yeah.

278
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,670
You know what I mean?
It's just fucking.

279
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm just lucky.
Yes,

280
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,550
we provide,
but I have many of the same things.

281
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,330
I just don't feel that.
That sense of satisfaction you have now.

282
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:02,224
Has it varied?
Have you had higher and lower feelings 

283
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,300
of satisfaction?
Yeah,

284
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,370
I think when I'm working a lot I feel 
pretty satisfied.

285
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,091
Oh,
okay.

286
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:10,841
Um,
okay.

287
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:14,800
So accomplishments or task?
Task and goal oriented.

288
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,100
Like I like it's satisfying to do a 
special or direct to commercial or,

289
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,310
or,
or write a TV show or you know.

290
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,240
Well,
I'll tell you one thing,

291
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:29,500
I say I'm filled with joy and I'm happy 
all the time when I'm not working or I'm

292
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:31,630
not accomplishing anything or I'm not 
doing it.

293
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,540
Like if I get real lazy,
I can get depressed.

294
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,090
Somebody else told me that they said 
that a very,

295
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,340
very joyous guy told me when he gets 
injured,

296
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,540
he just takes it out of him.
Ken,

297
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,600
I've been injured a gang of times.
I've had a bunch of surgeries from,

298
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,710
um,
you know,

299
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,890
athletic injuries.
But um,

300
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
for me,
uh,

301
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,073
if I go into lowe's,
like if I'm not accomplishing things or 

302
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,890
in the past I don't allow myself to get 
into those anymore because it's just not

303
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,390
a good feeling.
And even,

304
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,710
it doesn't even necessarily have to be 
like a career,

305
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,693
like oriented thing.
But I have to have things that I'm 

306
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:09,480
enjoying.
Yeah.

307
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,410
It could just be like I'm really into 
doing yoga,

308
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,230
doing yoga every day,
and now it's,

309
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,343
I do it,
I get it done and now I feel great and 

310
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,160
yeah,
but if I'm not doing something I,

311
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,370
my brain for whatever reason,
needs tasks,

312
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,960
it needs stuff to do.

313
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,150
And need stuff to figure out.
It needs like puzzles.

314
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.
If I don't get that,

315
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,560
I have real issue.
Yeah,

316
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,660
agreed.
Do you like big longterm goals?

317
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,610
It's just like.
Yeah,

318
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,473
you do.
Yeah,

319
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,530
I'd like to it or micro thing.
I like.

320
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,373
I like those too.
I like things that are due in like a 

321
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,380
week as opposed to something that's 
like,

322
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:42,910
yeah,
whenever you're like,

323
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,470
I'm outlining a movie right now.
And I'm like,

324
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,640
yeah,
but I don't.

325
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,410
I wish it were more like bang,
Bang.

326
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,210
Yeah.
Like I'm meeting about it tomorrow,

327
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,720
like specifically to,
to kind of focus myself.

328
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,370
Like you write a joke and then you go up
and do it tonight and it kills like.

329
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

330
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,260
Oh that's okay.
That's something that,

331
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,800
that's joy.
That's pretty telling their joy.

332
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,760
Yeah.
Or just writing a joke.

333
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,740
Writing a joke that it.
And it kills.

334
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,650
It's like that feeling,
man.

335
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,070
Don't you wish you could give that to 
people who don't do standup?

336
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,070
I it,
I've,

337
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,530
I've had this conversation with people 
before that don't do stand up and like,

338
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,364
man,
I wish I could tell you what it's like 

339
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,310
to crush in front of people finding 
100,000

340
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,350
dollars.
Do you know what I mean?

341
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,210
That's how it feels.
It feels like,

342
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,710
oh,
I just found 100,000

343
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:31,780
dollars and you know,
what led me there,

344
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,840
my personality and my experience and 
your work ethic and your work at.

345
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,790
That's exactly right.
So it's like you feel like,

346
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,050
oh,
this is so.

347
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:42,820
It's so personal.
Yeah,

348
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,700
it feels like this could only,
if it's a good joke,

349
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,310
only you could have written it,
you know.

350
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,423
Well,
uh,

351
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,320
even if other people could have written 
it,

352
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,500
you wrote it like this,
this thing came out of which sky and out

353
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,670
of your shows you.

354
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,750
Yeah,
yeah,

355
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,710
yeah.
It shows you,

356
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,060
yeah,
whatever it is.

357
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,470
Uh,
so that I,

358
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,660
that I will say is like,
that's,

359
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,583
that's a sense of euphoria.
But I think in some ways I try to kind 

360
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,830
of contain it a little bit in that where
I'm like,

361
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,090
Whoa,
you know what I mean?

362
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:11,924
Like with this thing,
I don't know what to do with this 

363
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,144
feeling because it's the kind of thing 
where you just want to like go up and 

364
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:21,311
kiss women and smack you on the ass and 
would just fucking wrote a kid,

365
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,070
wrote a fucking closer.
What do you mean?

366
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,220
Like you just feel like,
like a,

367
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,113
like a musical.
Tony Hinchcliffe had this new joke and 

368
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:32,331
uh,
he did it.

369
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,060
He and he came off stage like right 
after he didn't.

370
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,150
And he was literally like,
like fist pumping.

371
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Like he was just so fired up because it 
killed so fired up.

372
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,550
It's like he was charged with 
electricity.

373
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,413
Yeah.
That's nice when you can allow yourself 

374
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,220
to just like,
yeah.

375
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,583
And nobody gets.
You can do it in a way that no one gets 

376
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:53,654
jealous or feels like your,
your prenatal to hang out with better 

377
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:58,030
people were hanging out with basically 
the same.

378
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,110
But I'm saying like,
if that's the problem.

379
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:00,861
Yeah.
You know,

380
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,420
and I've,
we've all been there before too,

381
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,283
like the way things are going well and 
you're hanging around with someone and 

382
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,400
they get super weird and creepy with 
you.

383
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,920
And they withdraw and you're like,
oh yeah,

384
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,810
yeah.
What do you get?

385
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,750
What?
You just kind of like,

386
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,460
what do you want me to do?
You want me to fail?

387
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,593
Well,
there's people that do definitely want 

388
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:16,694
you to fail,
but what they definitely don't want you 

389
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,760
to do is highlight the fact that they're
not succeeding.

390
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,571
Well.
Yeah.

391
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:25,400
But that's what most people consider.
A lot of people consider your success.

392
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,234
They'll their failure.
That's such a bizarre way of looking at 

393
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:28,850
it.
I know.

394
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,080
It's so common though.
Like what evolutionary benefit does that

395
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:34,610
have?
Well,

396
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,590
finite resources.
Yeah.

397
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,370
I think that's what it comes from.
I think it just comes from there.

398
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,071
You know,
when people go,

399
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,470
oh,
there's enough jobs for everyone.

400
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,060
You and I both know.
No,

401
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:44,900
there's not.
No.

402
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,963
There's enough jobs for talented people,
but if you don't feel like you're 

403
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,470
talented,
then you are fucking.

404
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,900
Yeah.
Panicked all the time.

405
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,793
And then it's a,
it's a self fulfilling prophecy because 

406
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,490
that sort of famine thinking is really 
bad for progress.

407
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,863
If you are a person who's really worried
about other people getting things and 

408
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:08,870
you start thinking in a jealous man or 
about other people's success,

409
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,050
that fucks up your own ability to 
express yourself.

410
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,153
Yeah,
and that fucks up your ability to 

411
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,550
succeed.
It depends on how it hits you.

412
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,110
It can.
It can be a motivator,

413
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:18,880
I believe.
Sure.

414
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,120
Definitely.
Where you're like,

415
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,170
fucking,
he got it.

416
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,770
You know,
I can't get whatever that is,

417
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,633
but it's hard to.
You got to kind of wrestle it into a 

418
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:32,390
positive way because if you get upset at
somebody else got something,

419
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:36,740
then usually it's a bitter motivator and
it doesn't lend itself to success,

420
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,300
but I've never,
I've,

421
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,580
I don't think I've ever had something 
where I was like,

422
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,920
this should have been mine.
Do you know what I mean?

423
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:45,080
Like one.
Have you ever had that where it was like

424
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,650
a job,
a,

425
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,920
you were like,
definitely when I was younger for sure.

426
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,130
What sorts of things were they?

427
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,240
I'm sure looking back to their absurd,
absurd things that I didn't deserve.

428
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,133
You know,
like someone else getting a television 

429
00:17:56,461 --> 00:18:01,461
show or someone else headlining a 
certain place and it's for comics.

430
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,460
There really is not,
it's not a finite situation.

431
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,190
It's not like there's a limited amount 
of resources.

432
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,233
There's so many different clubs and 
there's so many different topics and 

433
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,380
there's so many different jobs.
I mean,

434
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,214
I think that's one of the reasons why 
comics are so ruthless when it comes to 

435
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:17,904
plagiarism because like say if you have 
a really unique idea and this idea is 

436
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,094
come to you from the universe when 
you're sketching it out and putting it 

437
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:29,340
together and some fucker comes in and 
sees this and says,

438
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,203
ah,
I can,

439
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,043
I can

440
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,030
bad jokes as interventions and it's 
like,

441
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:38,080
you stole my fucking invention.
That's my invention dude.

442
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,123
Like I don't my inventions or word 
inventions or premise inventions or 

443
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:43,720
whatever.
Like,

444
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,480
so it's intellectual property,
you know,

445
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,600
like you know that that's mine.
So to steal it is,

446
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,500
is worse than plagiarism.
It's like copyright infringement.

447
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,930
It's like it's.
Yeah.

448
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,880
It's like,
it's,

449
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,540
it's,
it's unforgivable.

450
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,690
It also cuts in and creates that weird 
competitive finite resources mentality.

451
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,400
It creates,
it creates like a mind fuck because then

452
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,380
all of a sudden you start thinking like,
oh,

453
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:12,214
well this is,
this is not like a community of 

454
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,350
likeminded people.
They're supporting each other.

455
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,410
There's like some parasites in here and 
there's some,

456
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,430
some vampires

457
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,470
with different standards because we all 
more or less have,

458
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,450
I don't know if it's learned in the 
comedy community or,

459
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:30,530
or we all come into it with certain 
standards,

460
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:34,640
but there is that thing of like there's 
an acceptable,

461
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,700
you know what I mean?
Like it's almost like not closing with a

462
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:41,250
super dirty joke if the person after you
isn't a dirty comic,

463
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,340
you know what I mean?
Like there's just certain you care about

464
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:43,820
them.
Yeah,

465
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,653
yeah,
yeah.

466
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,810
There's certain unwritten rules that you
want to do.

467
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,900
Lottery.
Yes.

468
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,123
That you don't want to fuck people over 
and then when somebody else does some 

469
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:53,480
shit like that and you're like,
wait a minute.

470
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,870
Um,
but the way I've thought of it,

471
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:58,100
it's like one was right.
Another one.

472
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,590
I mean obviously it's the worst and it's
unforgivable.

473
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:02,930
But like I've had people steal shit from
me.

474
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,210
Yeah.
It's going to happen,

475
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,810
but it fucks up the best part about 
standup,

476
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,913
like last night at the store was hanging
around with a stand hope and Michael 

477
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,910
costs and all these guys and we're just 
laughing and hanging around.

478
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,530
There's a cool concept.

479
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,270
Great.
Lately,

480
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,103
Michael Cost has been like hit his 
stride that the kind of jokes he's 

481
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,730
writing are fucking great.
Very Funny Guy and really nice guy too.

482
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,490
Like such a sweet guy.
Yeah.

483
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,910
But that place is filled with that kind 
of cool comradery.

484
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,280
That's the point to me.
Yeah.

485
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,250
Do you know what I mean?
Like that's really like the fun of it.

486
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,113
Yeah.
Like,

487
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,820
like what you've done with your people 
and other comics and like your,

488
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,050
like your group of the dense whenever 
you want to call it,

489
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:44,310
but like,
but,

490
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,040
but that's the point of like that's my 
favorite part of it and it's,

491
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,680
there's no close second,
not money.

492
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:51,514
It's not.
It's literally like a vibe and it's 

493
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:55,080
connecting with somebody.
Yeah,

494
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,830
I agree.
It's all hugs.

495
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,053
You know,
you go to the store on an any given 

496
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,520
night.
It's all hugs.

497
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,490
It's a whole bunch of guys that 
appreciate each other and girls,

498
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:04,324
you know,
will really funny get together and that 

499
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:07,654
place right now is,
it's hotter than it's ever been last 

500
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,043
night.
Tuesday nights sold out and pack main 

501
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,210
original room and belly room.
Yeah.

502
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,020
Yeah.
It's crazy.

503
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,110
By the way.
It should be.

504
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,600
Yeah.
That shows are fucking bananas.

505
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,913
The shows at the comedy store,
our fundraisers anywhere else in the 

506
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:27,064
world.
Yeah.

507
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,670
But here it's just like White Joey Diaz,
Duncan Trussell,

508
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:31,391
Ari.
I mean,

509
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,770
it's fucking crazy.
The lineups.

510
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:33,311
Bang,
Bang,

511
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:34,144
Bang.
You just see killer after killer Ian 

512
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,700
Edwards.
Shit.

513
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,870
Yeah.
Jeselnik.

514
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,880
Oh my God.
All the time.

515
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,890
It's,
the lineups are amazing,

516
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:44,350
but it's also like the feel like you 
feel like,

517
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:47,320
man,
I think we're in a golden era.

518
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,820
Yeah.
Like it feels like,

519
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,290
wow,
we're really lucky to be here.

520
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,550
Right?
Yeah.

521
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,623
I mean,
yeah,

522
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,623
there are guys like you that almost 
created it in a way like by going back 

523
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,750
to the store and by validating it and 
then you,

524
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,810
your fans go and then it's like a self 
fulfilling thing.

525
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:02,770
But.
But yeah,

526
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,930
it definitely feels like,
I don't know what I feel like.

527
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,940
Although did you watch the roast?
The roast battle?

528
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,740
Yeah,
I thought it was fucking great.

529
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:10,810
I didn't watch on comedy central.
Oh No,

530
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,840
it was in part of it I think was in 
Montreal.

531
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,873
No,
I was in the part that was in the belly 

532
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,580
room or they feel they did a special 
that I didn't watch.

533
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,443
There's five.
There's five parts that they did for 

534
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:23,290
Montreal and it hurt.
It was really great.

535
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,260
It was great.
Like the relative may get Ralphie.

536
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,910
I heard he took a beating.
He got.

537
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,840
Yeah,
he saw us.

538
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,093
But again,
it's an entire career flashed in front 

539
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:37,921
of his eyes.
But what do you expect when you're doing

540
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,980
a row?
It's like,

541
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,843
I know if I do a roast,
people are going to fucking kill me on 

542
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:44,950
Chappelle repeatedly,
of course.

543
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:46,330
So on now I'm just like,
all right,

544
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,730
let's judge this level of how hard 
you're going to hit a.

545
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,470
So Ravi got hit on a weight joke,
which is weight in his divorce,

546
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,630
his family.
Oh right,

547
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,040
that's hardcore.
Yeah.

548
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,250
Family like left him.
Yeah.

549
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,200
So he's alone.
He's fat.

550
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,850
Yeah.
Depressed.

551
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,940
And then someone just kept teeing off on
him.

552
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,880
Who is he?
Roasted A.

553
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,620
wasn't Mike Lawrence.
Mike Lawrence.

554
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,870
Who one is really funny.
Yeah.

555
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,270
He's a really funny dude.
But apparently Ralph,

556
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,890
he just didn't take it so well.
Yeah.

557
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,110
Well I'm happy to take a swing at him.

558
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,810
Wasn't that close?
It was like,

559
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,733
you know,
it had that even on tv it was that 

560
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,860
feeling of like,
oh,

561
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:27,694
I would,
I could see this going to go in a 

562
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:30,740
certain way.
It's,

563
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,640
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to say that to people.

564
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,380
I don't want to say anything that's 
going to make money.

565
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,180
I definitely don't want anybody saying 
that to me.

566
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,014
That's going to make me feel like 
there's a zoom in on Ralphie's face and 

567
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,670
you as you're watching it,
you're like,

568
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:47,671
did they zoom in or designs zoom in in 
zoom in or did they do that?

569
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,110
There is a god damn brutal show.
Yeah.

570
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,110
But good for comedy man.
Really good format.

571
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,423
It's a cool format.
They figured out a new format and they 

572
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,183
joke writer format.
It's like it's fair and he's like 

573
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,660
literally just like head to head and it 
rewards good joke.

574
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,513
They laugh at the.
It's like it's like a Madison Square 

575
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,720
Garden.
They say people know basketball.

576
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,180
They're like NBA players say people know
basketball.

577
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,370
Like they.
That's how it feels at the roast battle.

578
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:23,180
Like people know comedy and they reward 
high,

579
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,760
high level of difficulty jokes.
Yes.

580
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,870
I,
I agree.

581
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,823
And also I think one of the things that 
rose pedals really good for comedy is 

582
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,220
it's pushing the boundaries of 
acceptable jokes.

583
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,123
Yeah.
And this is a weird time where people 

584
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:38,510
are fucking,
you know,

585
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,403
this whole idea about punching up and 
there's so much horseshit involved in 

586
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,850
like what is and is not acceptable and 
stand up today.

587
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,150
Yeah.
And it's,

588
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,093
it's a bunch of people that are trying 
to control behavior and thinking and 

589
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,143
that just doesn't fly in that world.
It's the pushback like what Bros battle 

590
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:59,840
is the pushback to this pc era that 
we're in right now.

591
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,170
If they could prove to me that joking 
leads to action,

592
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,170
I would pay more attention.
Do you know what I mean?

593
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,540
Like isn't right now,
but if they could say,

594
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,374
yeah,
Hitler made a lot of jokes about 

595
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,923
invading Australia before you used to do
tons of bits about Austria and then 

596
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:22,790
eventually he brought the hammer down.
Like if you could prove some sort of,

597
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,890
some sort of,
you know,

598
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,040
the A and B,
a plus b equals c,

599
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:28,821
then yeah.
Then it's like,

600
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:29,780
okay,
I agree,

601
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:34,340
but you also know that that racism and 
all that shit is like.

602
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
It ain't about joking.
It's about like a,

603
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:39,770
it's about,
a lot of times it's about poverty.

604
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,110
It's class,
it's so many other things that aren't,

605
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,630
that aren't necessarily comedy.
Yeah.

606
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:46,730
And,
and even poverty of ideas.

607
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,890
I mean it's a,
it's a thought process.

608
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,180
Poverty.
It's poor thing.

609
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,023
Yes.
Yeah.

610
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,020
I mean that's what racism really is and 
what jokes are,

611
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:55,370
is like,
you know,

612
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:59,900
that there's a certain amount of racism 
and you play on it and there's a,

613
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:00,734
there's a wink as you're doing it,
like in a joke form and there's some 

614
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,284
racist shit that people can say to each 
other and that joke battle of the roast 

615
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,690
battle.
That is fucking hilarious.

616
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,650
Yes.
Yeah.

617
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,493
There were black people can't swim to 
nine slash 11 off the fucking tons of 

618
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:19,430
nine slash 11 jokes.
George Perez and Sarah Tiana.

619
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:22,340
We're roasting and Sarah Tiana was 
roasting him about Sarah.

620
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:23,174
Tiana is insanely good at that shit.
She's like one of those things where 

621
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,550
it's like someone can talk real fast 
summary.

622
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,403
You're like,
I didn't even know you could do this 

623
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:31,064
shit.
She's like double jointed or something 

624
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:33,081
like,
wait,

625
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:35,150
what you can do there.
You can do the splits.

626
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,983
All right.
It comes off even crazier because she's 

627
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:43,300
so sweet and she's got this smiling face
and I believe yes.

628
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,630
You know what I mean?
Like there is no hatred in her.

629
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,730
In her roast.
No.

630
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,540
No,
but she knows.

631
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,360
She knows where the soft spots are and 
that's where she sticks.

632
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:55,140
The blade.
Did she came in second?

633
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:57,300
She almost,
she just kind of ran out of steam.

634
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:59,190
Like she just,
it was later.

635
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,043
Right.
A lot of jokes.

636
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,590
Oh yeah man.
It's brutal.

637
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,270
So yeah.
But she,

638
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,110
she.
Sarah,

639
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,943
congrats to Sarah.
So Hinchcliffe did it with a suit of 

640
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:09,210
armor on.
Yes.

641
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,370
And would have won but fucked up his 
last joke.

642
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,110
Maybe it was really close and his last 
job was a clunker.

643
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,760
I think his first joke in his last joke,
but hence is good at that shit too.

644
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,960
Oh,
he's really good at it.

645
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,190
He just.
Cliff is mean.

646
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,293
He knows.
He knows that a certain guy that he 

647
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,790
means what he says.
He's up there.

648
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,510
He's doing a documentary.
He's not.

649
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,950
He's doing a documentary about his 
thoughts.

650
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,540
It's not a lot of like there's art to 
it,

651
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,171
but it's like,
oh,

652
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,150
this is all based on a true story.
Yeah.

653
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,730
Well I'm just happy that comedy central 
is taken.

654
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,923
That's a big chance.
And they've taken quite a few big 

655
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:51,420
chances recently.
Like I think with Ari Shadow Arusha fear

656
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,680
show this is not happening.
Yeah.

657
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,040
That was a big chance.
Yeah.

658
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,750
That show is really racy really out 
there.

659
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:00,270
Some of the stories are fucking 
completely outrageous.

660
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,040
So they've got that and then they're 
taking chances with this as well.

661
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,941
And it's,
you know,

662
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:08,580
it's off the beaten path.
This is a new thing.

663
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,090
This is not like another guy's doing a 
talk show.

664
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,953
Oh Great.
I think they're following the sort of 

665
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,340
what's working alive.
Yes.

666
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,650
And smartly going,
how do we televise it,

667
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,443
because the truth about comedy central 
is the ratings are so bad at this point 

668
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,420
that they,
relative to what they were,

669
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,300
that I think they're like,
it's Kent Alterman just going like,

670
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,950
I like that.
Let's do that.

671
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,843
Right.
And leaving shows on that are not 

672
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:37,260
particularly highly rated because he 
likes it.

673
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,870
If they do that though,
I think that's the right way to go.

674
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,260
If they just find what people actually 
enjoy that like,

675
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,183
like la right now has a comedy scene,
a big comedy scenes and roast battle is 

676
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,430
one of the highlights of the comedy 
scene.

677
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,690
Everybody goes to see it,
man last night.

678
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,780
There's a fucking line like Rosebelle 
start at midnight.

679
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,763
Yeah.
I got there at 10 and the line was 

680
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,280
already around the fucking outside of 
the uh,

681
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,233
patio,
the store all waiting to get in because 

682
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,530
I think people didn't know about it 
until this week.

683
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,940
Literally the TV,
the show.

684
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,590
Yeah.
That definitely had an impact,

685
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,660
but it's,
it's cool to see.

686
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,830
It's cool.
It's great.

687
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,050
It's fair.
Yeah,

688
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,020
it's what it is.
It's like,

689
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:14,250
okay,
this is fucking,

690
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,350
there's a little goddamn justice right 
here.

691
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,184
Like a funny thing that people were 
doing live and I think like famous 

692
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:22,260
people,
judges helps,

693
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,960
but for the most part it's just,
it's funny to watch.

694
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:26,700
It's fun to watch these people go head 
to head.

695
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,390
I heard the Whoopi Goldberg was awful.
Uh,

696
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,270
she was just like,
why are you making that face?

697
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,160
Yeah,
I would agree.

698
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,780
A wifi was never like a comic.
Do you know what I mean?

699
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,890
Well,
will people was a comic.

700
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,050
It wasn't really real.
They're not like a club comics.

701
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,150
Yeah.
But I,

702
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,280
to me she did that one woman show which 
was in a theater was not stand up.

703
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,443
And then she did comic relief where she 
was doing a monologue with two other 

704
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:55,390
dudes.

705
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,240
I'm pretty sure she did comedy clubs to.
Okay.

706
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,460
Maybe.
Well pretty sure I saw her.

707
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,490
Sometimes Joe things pass you by and a 
certain certain shit.

708
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,163
It's like you kinda.
When she was going back and forth with 

709
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,700
Jessalyn neck and she just said,
I have Oscars.

710
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,661
Yeah.
She's like,

711
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:14,494
all the shit I got and jasmine was like 
a bunch of shit from the eighties was 

712
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:20,500
just like,
well that doesn't make you funny either.

713
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,251
Oh,
exactly.

714
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:21,911
Exactly.
It's like,

715
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:22,630
yeah,
you brought up,

716
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,690
you brought up.
You brought up an Oscar to a comedy show

717
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,850
because it not only that,
it's the opposite of being funny.

718
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:33,030
Like talking about your accomplishments 
is the opposite of like a good comeback.

719
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,440
Yeah.
Like somebody,

720
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,810
somebody said that they were an argument
with somebody and the person goes,

721
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,060
I have a million dollars.

722
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,371
Like,
okay,

723
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:44,950
buy your way out of this fucking 
conversation.

724
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,803
Well,
if someone calls you a loser fucking 

725
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,191
loser,
and you're like,

726
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,960
well,
I'm actually one.

727
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,460
Yeah,
there are no,

728
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:53,140
I'm not saying you should never bring 
up.

729
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,410
Bring up having a million dollars.
Like if someone says you broke,

730
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,760
you broke motherfucker.
Yeah.

731
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:00,180
You can't be like actually have a lot of
money.

732
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,043
I can't say that.
There are certain things in which I've 

733
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,950
succeeded.
Um,

734
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,831
so yeah,
so,

735
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,230
you know,
but the swordsman it's fucking,

736
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,880
it's cool.
It's magical again.

737
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:10,750
Yeah.
Well not even that.

738
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,593
Again,
like I've been there on and off for 20 

739
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,260
plus years.
It's never been as good as it is now.

740
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,100
No,
and it's because it's the right way.

741
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:20,680
It's Adam's book and good people.
He's not booking.

742
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,870
He's not booking like viruses.
You know what I mean?

743
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:28,090
He's not booking people that when you're
on the show with them,

744
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:28,810
you're like,
what the fuck?

745
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,643
Am I only getting two spots or how am I 
only getting four spots and this guy's 

746
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:33,574
getting whatever.
Like where you see a guy that just kind 

747
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:37,510
of is a bummer,
comedically.

748
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,300
Like that has no merit,
right?

749
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,770
That has no merit whatsoever.
Comedically.

750
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:42,604
And they used to have that because I 
think there was just a lot of people 

751
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:46,660
left over from like the eighties.
There was,

752
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,660
there was some weird.
A lot of legacy acts.

753
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:51,370
Yeah,
that's a good way to put it.

754
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

755
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,643
But now there's like,

756
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:56,644
really funny.

759
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,400

762
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,433
God Damn.
We were at the back bar less and I'm 

763
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,320
like,
how fun is this place?

764
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,530
Just makes you feel like tingling when 
you're there.

765
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:21,750
Yeah,
yeah.

766
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,310
It feels like you're in a movie about 
this time.

767
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,860
Yeah,
yeah,

768
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,210
yeah.
It's fucking awesome.

769
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,340
That's awesome.
Um,

770
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,240
yeah,
so,

771
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,170
so I did the uh,
I did that so that the ketamine,

772
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:37,930
I will say I will,
I will say I cannot recommend,

773
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,010
but you recommended for one

774
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,660
session.

775
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,860
I,
I look,

776
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,703
ketamine is a drug as interesting as 
fuck the thing that I felt the day I 

777
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:47,560
saw,
you may have just been that,

778
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,630
that lsd hangover feeling that hangover 
of like the where you're not hung over,

779
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,410
but you're not yourself.
You feel like that,

780
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,610
that like high pitched clarity that like
squeak.

781
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,910
So I can't.
But beyond that it just became.

782
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,773
Now I complained to the guy and he said,
you're the only person who's ever felt 

783
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,230
like this.
Um,

784
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,240
the.
Yeah,

785
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,620
the,
the Ad,

786
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:16,450
a little nausea as well.
I'm 100 of those balls,

787
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,370
but they're awesome.
Yeah.

788
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,283
Amazing.

789
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,660
This is a wad workout of the day.
I think the it Wad supernova.

790
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,610
This is the tiny one.
There's a little one.

791
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,090
The big one is actually better.
Yeah.

792
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,490
But you stick it on your back.

793
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,140
Oh yeah.
You can use it on your head ever.

794
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,020
Now.
Did you got shit in your head?

795
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,180
You got muscles in your head.
You don't even know,

796
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,200
bro.
You got muscles.

797
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:41,310
You don't even know my bro Bro.
My head is yoked a row.

798
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,990
You gotta everybody knows that about 
you.

799
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,190
My fucking head is really.
I bet you have like weird shit up there.

800
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,080
Um,
so.

801
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,370
So yeah,
so I did the academy,

802
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:51,450
didn't,
can't recommend it.

803
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Then I tried something called tms,
which is short for transcranial magnetic

804
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:58,650
stimulation.
Joe,

805
00:33:58,651 --> 00:34:00,750
I've got a video and it's going to be 
full frame.

806
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,850
Oh,
Jamie,

807
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,620
you'll put it up on the big screen.
Oh yeah.

808
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:06,020
How do I send it?
Uh,

809
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,020
yeah,
that's probably the best way.

810
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,310
Okay.
Hold on.

811
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,650
Um,
so,

812
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,590
uh,
I've been really interested in this idea

813
00:34:16,591 --> 00:34:17,424
of a stimulation the outside of your 
brain after listening to a radio lab 

814
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:25,410
podcast called nine volt Nirvana.
Is that the memory one?

815
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,711
No,
it's one that we're,

816
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:28,680
they talking about skill acquisition.

817
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,271
Okay.
Yeah,

818
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:31,130
that's what I meant with the sharp 
shooter.

819
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,030
Yes,
yes,

820
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,280
yes.
This is too big to send to you.

821
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh,
can we?

822
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,610
This?
If you send it through google will go to

823
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,230
google drive and I wrote to him with the
password.

824
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,420
Thank you guys.
Got muscly head

825
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,060
Yo.
My fucking head.

826
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,070
He things my head is power lifting.
I remember when I was a kid,

827
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,160
they did this cat scan on marvelous 
Marvin Hagler,

828
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,643
Marvin Hagler,
who was one of the greatest boxers of 

829
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:57,714
all time,
had very large muscles around his 

830
00:35:01,771 --> 00:35:05,190
temples,
like extraordinarily large,

831
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,340
like not just a little bit bigger than 
everybody else's,

832
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:11,730
but like two or three times larger than 
the average person.

833
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,510
Like essentially you get to see it

834
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,441
feigns.
Yeah.

835
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:16,660
He had like thick veins that I remember.

836
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,290
Yeah,
he had headgear.

837
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,710
He essentially had muscle head gear 
around his temples,

838
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,230
like in the side of his head and they 
were like,

839
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:25,064
what in the fuck?
And they didn't know if this was 

840
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:31,700
something that was developed from years 
of biting down on a mouthpiece and there

841
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,490
was a lot of guys that did a bunch of 
different exercises.

842
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:38,400
Further jaw itself.
Like I remember Gerry Cooney had a thing

843
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:40,130
that he put in his mouth.
It was like a,

844
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,710
like a thick rubber cable that had like 
electrical tape wrapped around it and he

845
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,240
would bite down on it.

846
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,483
You know what's funny about 15 weeks,
his jaw is that shit doesn't make you 

847
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:55,700
fear the guy a little bit more.
Like he'll use fucking tape bro.

848
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,260
He don't give a fuck bro.
Listen Bro.

849
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,280
All right,
let me show you guys.

850
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,270
They were actually lifting weights with 
their jaw,

851
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,870
which makes sense.
You could power lift with your jaw.

852
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:11,150
Some guys chewed gum too.
There was nothing they would do.

853
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,283
They'd get like a stack of Bazooka 
bubble gum and it turns into cement 

854
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,733
after.
Chew it for a couple minutes and they 

855
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:18,350
just take that shit.
And,

856
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,453
and um,
which totally makes sense because if 

857
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:24,824
your jaw is loose and weak and if you 
look at guys with big jaws like a guy 

858
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,203
like

859
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,290
that's another thing,
the ball on your jaw.

860
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,030
Yeah,
you're gonna fucking,

861
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:37,970
you're not going to believe how strong,
how like rough.

862
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:40,910
And like I have a knot in my journal 
right now.

863
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,890
It's just not a ton but enough to get 
by.

864
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,260
Do what you've got.
I mean,

865
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,093
you know what I mean?
Spots whenever I get a massage and then 

866
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,080
they work your head.
I get so excited.

867
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:57,350
I'm like,
my head feels so good.

868
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,270
Daughter was rubbing my head the other 
day.

869
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,530
She's like,
does this feel good?

870
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,090
I said,
actually that feels really good.

871
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,820
And you immediately become an eight year
old boy.

872
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,300
What do you do?
Feels?

873
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,940
Yeah,
it feels good.

874
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,843
It's an area like your feet,
like it feels good to get your feet 

875
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:18,750
rubbed.
It feels good to get your hands rub.

876
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,130
You ever get your hands massage?
Yeah.

877
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,650
You would think that enhanced nothing.
I'll feel good.

878
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,660
Like you shake someone's hand and 
doesn't feel anything,

879
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,170
but if someone like rubs your hand,
they start pulling your fingers and make

880
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:29,004
them pop and stuff and they massage your
palms and the tips of your fingers and 

881
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:38,400
all the little connective muscles and 
all the tissue in between the fingers.

882
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:40,110
It feels great.
Yeah.

883
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,690
I need to get a massage.
I haven't gotten a massage forever.

884
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,143
Really?
You strike me as a guy that would get a 

885
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:46,530
massage three days.
We used to get them all the time.

886
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,110
It had been too busy.
It's been a month at least.

887
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,240
Yeah.
Maybe more.

888
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,310
Maybe two months.
I just got them all the time,

889
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,910
but I get them to one.
I get.

890
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,000
I get.
I get a guy who does a lot of rolfing.

891
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,120
He just uses a metal bar and reading

892
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,280
my muscle.
My nose.

893
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,660
Yeah.
Well that's what Ralph.

894
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,710
They go up apparently they go up your 
sinuses.

895
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,060
No,
I've never seen it,

896
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,170
bro.
They fuck with your brain,

897
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,483
Bro.
They massage your fucking brain brow 

898
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,550
from saying uh.
Yeah.

899
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:14,010
You can roughing.
They're supposed to go all that shit.

900
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,690
Whoa.
Your sinuses?

901
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,220
Yeah.
Alright.

902
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,600
Coming incoming,
nervous.

903
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,290
Um,
yeah.

904
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,900
So this,
this tms thing,

905
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:25,110
transcranial magnetic stimulation 
covered by blue cross.

906
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,890
Yeah.
Uh,

907
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,320
so yeah,
that's what,

908
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,140
like it's,
it's,

909
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,770
it was really,
really good.

910
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:32,604
Like I,
for a lot of my life I felt like I had 

911
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,733
a,

912
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,100
I had like a,
I had like a,

913
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,740
a,
a thing like a,

914
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,653
it almost felt like a metal weight,
like a bit of like five pound weight on 

915
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:47,500
my upper left forehead.
My left.

916
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,670
And then so I went to this.
Whoa dude,

917
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,390
that sound is like an Mri.
Sounds.

918
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:56,350
Yeah,
that's what it is.

919
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,341
It is,
yes.

920
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:59,920
It's basically the same exact magnet as 
an MRI,

921
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,900
but it's just made your day.
Yeah,

922
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,940
they put it on your head.
It's pretty simple.

923
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,880
The first time they measure it,
they have to get to like the exact spot.

924
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,700
Here's,
there's another video where my finger is

925
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:12,400
pulsing that you'll enjoy.
And what is it doing to you?

926
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,450
Like,
what's the benefit?

927
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,343
Uh,
it's basically magnetizing and 

928
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:17,614
electrifying a.
it's waking up basically did a synopsis 

929
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,140
according to them.
Really?

930
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,280
Yeah.
So it's,

931
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,230
it's waking up dead synapses and waking 
up dead.

932
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,070
Waking them up so they're dormant.
Uh,

933
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,580
that's what they say.
You don't even look into it.

934
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,510
Good.
Shoot me on.

935
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,930
Yeah.
What is it can I do?

936
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,830
And this where I don't have kid man.
So I'm like,

937
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:45,700
yeah,
I don't give a shit.

938
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,560
Whatever,
whatever it's going to cost me.

939
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:48,394
I'm happy to do it.
If you had kids you think you wouldn't 

940
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:50,494
do it?
I think

941
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,840
kids,
I'd be like,

942
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,490
you know,
sort of more,

943
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,780
more cautious about it.
Yeah,

944
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,820
probably because I'm not like reckless,
but I'm not.

945
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,620
I'm not like A.
I do recently.

946
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:06,060
It's also vague anyway,
the research.

947
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,900
It's also like,

948
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,140
I think it does this.
Most antidepressants they know.

949
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,620
They think they know what's happening.
They don't actually know.

950
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,330
Yeah.
That's a weird one.

951
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,850
Yeah.
When you think about how many people are

952
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:22,851
prescribed these things and then there's
not really a direct understanding of how

953
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:24,870
it impacts each.
Each person.

954
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,070
Like they'll tell you,
hey,

955
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:28,890
we'll try this medication and if it 
doesn't work we'll try another one.

956
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,823
Yeah.
Does this one work will just cycle 

957
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,940
through it and now how do you know if 
it's working for you?

958
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:33,774
Or if you're having a good time in your 
life and so you're feeling better 

959
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:37,974
because maybe you started a new 
relationship and a new job and it's 

960
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:42,230
going well and hey,
it's just a.

961
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,073
everything seems pretty good.
I was on medications that made me 

962
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:47,940
nauseous for a year and a half before I 
was like,

963
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:48,774
you know what?
I literally thought I was nauseous 

964
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:54,330
because I was eating too many lifesavers
and not even fucking kidding.

965
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,231
Literally.
I was like,

966
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:56,064
I gotta take it easy on these life 
savers because every night I throw up 

967
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,610
all the way to the laugh factory and 
then I realized like,

968
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,660
you know,
Neil,

969
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,270
you're taking a pretty high dosage of 
Zoloft.

970
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,130
You might want to just take it down a 
notch.

971
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:13,200
That zoloft stuff is supposed to be 
really weird for your discerning of what

972
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,020
matters and what doesn't matter.
Like,

973
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,373
like it's hard to.
I've never done it so it's hard for me 

974
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:20,700
to describe it.
But yeah,

975
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,653
the people that I've talked to that have
done it and said one of the issues that 

976
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:28,911
they had with it is nothing had the bad 
things didn't feel bad anymore.

977
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,190
But the good things didn't feel good 
either.

978
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,040
Well that's the,
with a lot

979
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,080
of antidepressants is they,
they raised the,

980
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,120
the floor,
uh,

981
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,740
and they also lowered the ceiling so 
that it,

982
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,530
it narrows your band of experience,
basically a witch.

983
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:48,020
But if you're severely depressed it can 
be very,

984
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:48,883
like,
like ketamine apparently is a lifesaver 

985
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,750
truly for.
They may start administering it in a,

986
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,090
in emergency rooms for suicide cases.
Really?

987
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:00,200
Yeah.
Because it does,

988
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:01,790
it's dry.
I mean it's a,

989
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,430
it's a hallucinogen.
So you know,

990
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:07,700
hallucinogens will make you like see 
things differently.

991
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:10,480
So they're starting to,
uh,

992
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,460
there at least they're talking about 
administering it as a,

993
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,383
as a,
a sort of almost like a whatever that 

994
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,910
drug is that you can do almost like an 
Epi pen for,

995
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,773
for,
uh,

996
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,950
for suicide or suicide thought thinkers,
thinkers.

997
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,290
Yeah.
I'm about to do it.

998
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,720
Yeah.
Um,

999
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,963
so yeah,
so the,

1000
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,280
so the tms,
transcranial magnetic stimulation,

1001
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,560
half an hour of that,
of that debt,

1002
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:34,490
that debt,
that debt,

1003
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:37,430
the debt doesn't feel like much.

1004
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,730
Feels like a,
like a Shitty Woodpecker,

1005
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,020
like a fucking sleepy woodpecker is sort
of going at your head.

1006
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:45,920
But you're not like,
Hey,

1007
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,090
get out of here where you're just kind 
of like,

1008
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,460
okay,
how much longer?

1009
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:52,700
And you just sit there and watch TV.
Um,

1010
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,930
and how many times are you supposed to 
do it?

1011
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,420
I,
you do it 40 times four.

1012
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:58,970
Zero.
Four zero times half an hour.

1013
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,100
And how deep are you in right now?
I'm done.

1014
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,690
I finished it at 40.
Yeah,

1015
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:05,000
I did all 40 in the fall.
Wow.

1016
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,230
And uh,
and I'm telling you it lasted and um,

1017
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,060
and you could go back for,
for um,

1018
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,590
like sort of pick me ups every whenever 
you feel like you need it.

1019
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,133
Um,
so I'm telling you this is the thing 

1020
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:22,870
that has worked best for me better than 
ketamine if way but better than them.

1021
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:25,760
Zoloft.
Better than I was on a.

1022
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,150
what's an Ssri?
Sarah?

1023
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,920
This strategic Sarah Selective Serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.

1024
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,810
Um,
and uh,

1025
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,110
and went off at once.
I did this magnet shit.

1026
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,430
So you know,
you're off everything.

1027
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,550
Yeah.
Wow.

1028
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:39,710
Yeah.
And you feel great.

1029
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah.
Just no joy.

1030
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,560
Well,
no joy,

1031
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:46,190
but that's not what never had it.
You didn't lose nothing.

1032
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,310
I just look at you kids have fun.
I'll be over here.

1033
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:51,570
Yeah.
But it's not.

1034
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,100
I'm not miserable and I'm not also,
there's no physical manifestation.

1035
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,770
That's the biggest thing.
The,

1036
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,070
the,
the head thing,

1037
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,380
the feeling like there was a plate on my
head.

1038
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,320
Getting rid of that was really,
really,

1039
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,154
really great.
So when you say like a plate on your 

1040
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:07,860
head,
like there was a pressure or.

1041
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,380
Yeah,
I have a little weight,

1042
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,430
a little weight and a little pressure.
Did you ever when I want that in there?

1043
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,533
No,
because there were times where I'd go 

1044
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:16,604
off of antidepressants and I have my jaw
muscles and muscles in my temple would 

1045
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:25,750
be so tight that I need to use like a 
massager well on them.

1046
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,090
So I knew that there was all,
it was all sort of connected.

1047
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
Um,
you know,

1048
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,640
Ding on his.
That was pretty sure that my thing,

1049
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,240
unless it's me,
it might've been brown have been me bro.

1050
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,130
It was your thing fuck up there yet.
Um,

1051
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,920
so.
So that was a big one.

1052
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,430
That was really helpful.
Then I did a,

1053
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,280
it was in New York for a couple months,
did that show three mix,

1054
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,610
which I think I talked to the premise 
the you told me,

1055
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,120
but tell say it on.
So the premise is onstage,

1056
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,670
I put three Mikes equidistant apart from
each other.

1057
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,103
One is for stand up,
one is for one liners that I just 

1058
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:08,874
couldn't fit anywhere.
And then one is for true sort of 

1059
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,480
emotional confession,
any type shit,

1060
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,070
talking about depression,
talking about shit with my dad.

1061
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,233
I'm like the sort of the,
I won't spoil the surprise but pretty 

1062
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:29,400
heavy shit between me and my dad when he
died or right before he died.

1063
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,723
And then the,
and then the second monologue is about 

1064
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,660
um,
kind of about like celebrity and,

1065
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,190
and,
and dealing with,

1066
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,043
with the having a partner and then 
breaking up and become my own guy and 

1067
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,110
all that shit.
Um,

1068
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,120
so it's basically like it ends up being 
probably 40 minutes of stand up 45,

1069
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,000
stand up in a half hour of true stories 
and then five minutes of one liners.

1070
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,910
And did you do it after you had 
completed your treatment?

1071
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,040
I did,
yes.

1072
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,450
I did it after.
Yeah.

1073
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:01,284
And in the middle of it I actually 
stopped taking everything and it in the 

1074
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:05,800
middle of recording or inactive in the 
middle of nowhere,

1075
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,643
in the middle of the run.
I had had an eight week run I think in 

1076
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:09,804
New York and uh,
and I stopped everything in the middle 

1077
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:14,910
of it.
It's not like suddenly just like,

1078
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,500
I don't think I need it.
Wow.

1079
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,460
Yeah.
Now,

1080
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:18,294
what were the,
what's the difference when you get off 

1081
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,144
medication?
What was the difference in the way your 

1082
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:24,144
brain was functioning?
I can almost tell how well my brain's 

1083
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:32,520
functioning if I'm not depressed or not 
slowed down by depression.

1084
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,743
My associations are much quicker.
Like if you're just like the simplest 

1085
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,694
thing of like,
that guy looks like so and so like a 

1086
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,230
sort of a little rose,
like a little,

1087
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:45,550
like what is that shirt fucking looks 
like the kind of shirt.

1088
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,540
Like if I'm not depressed I can think of
those quickly.

1089
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,370
Uh,
if I'm depressed,

1090
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,610
there were times where I'd get 
depression would affect my memory.

1091
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,840
Right.
I couldn't remember the,

1092
00:46:55,841 --> 00:46:56,600
the,
the,

1093
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,433
the test.
I would always do my head is there's a 

1094
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,024
guy who directed,
gone with the wind and the wizard of Oz 

1095
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:05,280
back to back.
He's.

1096
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,950
Yeah,
and I would try to remember his name.

1097
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:08,963
His name is Victor Fleming,
but if I was depressed I couldn't 

1098
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,114
remember it.
Like it affects your fucking a resource 

1099
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:16,584
thing,
like your brain is so concentrating on 

1100
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:22,680
the depression and feeling like shit 
that just doesn't have the resources.

1101
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:23,760
I think it.
I,

1102
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:28,230
I tend to think it's more a dead synapse
thing and I think it's A.

1103
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,123
I think it's an energy.
I think depression is a lack of energy 

1104
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,720
in the brain,
so in maybe you're right,

1105
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,850
maybe it is.
It's all going to one place,

1106
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:38,920
but that's my own personal 
interpretation of it.

1107
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,380
Well that makes sense in that,
in that way,

1108
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,243
in that definition that a aerobic 
exercise would benefit people that have 

1109
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:45,994
depression because they say that this 
particularly running and a long form or 

1110
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:51,314
will be exercise.
It does something to stimulate brain 

1111
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:57,590
growth and brain function.
We also say like x,

1112
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,473
if you want to remember something,
there was a thing last week or two we 

1113
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:01,114
feel about memory where if you want to 
you should study then exercise and 

1114
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:09,340
you'll,
you'll have a better memory.

1115
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,320
You'll,
you'll remember this shit.

1116
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,470
You had your,
you studied for me,

1117
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:17,500
there's nothing like physically writing 
something down with a pen.

1118
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,600
Yeah,
I think there's something to that too,

1119
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,080
for sure.
Like where you see it because it is like

1120
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,900
two senses.
You're hearing it in your head.

1121
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:27,310
It's three.
You're hearing them in your head,

1122
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:31,390
you're seeing with your eyes and you're 
actually physically forming the thoughts

1123
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,373
and I actually do say the words out to 
when I write something down like a 

1124
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:38,230
slave,
say it like write it down.

1125
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,870
You've got like and then like an 
illiterate person you'll be like.

1126
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:41,723
And then we were allowed to ride a bike 
and then I went to the va that no 

1127
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,083
writing.
You're trying to keep them from getting 

1128
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:54,760
smart.
Well I had the thought yesterday.

1129
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:58,120
Black people probably didn't wear 
eyeglasses until they didn't.

1130
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,650
They weren't,
they couldn't.

1131
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,090
There was no.
Do you know what I mean?

1132
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:03,910
Like nobody intends to them.
Certainly not bifocals.

1133
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,100
Yeah.
They weren't being tested for vision.

1134
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,260
Yeah.
It's.

1135
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,870
You think about it for a second and you 
can only.

1136
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,820
All you can do is do it loud.
Exhale.

1137
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,043
Yeah.
We've been talking about perspective 

1138
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,533
recently a lot.
It's come up a few times about how 

1139
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:19,654
insane.
Like yesterday we were talking about 

1140
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:22,570
slavery.
We're talking about the confederate war,

1141
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,030
the civil war rather than the 
confederate flag.

1142
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,300
And we were just talking about how 
insane it is that slavery was 18,

1143
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:29,710
65.
It was abolished.

1144
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,790
Like that is,
that's,

1145
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:31,630
that's,
uh,

1146
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,800
a week ago.
Yeah.

1147
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,550
And you also think it ended immediately.
It didn't fucking end immediately.

1148
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,690
No.
It ended like,

1149
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,550
Hey,
see you eight guys.

1150
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:40,384
We're going to try it.
It's like at the club where they turned 

1151
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:41,914
the lights on.
There's still people that are 

1152
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:44,230
stragglers.

1153
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,470
There's people that don't want to leave.
There was also then it just shifted over

1154
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:49,120
to sharecropping,
which was like,

1155
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,740
yeah,
it's subsistence farming.

1156
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,360
You can,
you're still going to live here.

1157
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,630
A lot of people were sharecroppers.
I read a book called,

1158
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,400
uh,
some of my best friends are black.

1159
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:58,840
What seems ironic that I would read that
book,

1160
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:00,220
but,
but uh,

1161
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,960
it's about integration arrived because 
some of your best friends with black.

1162
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:04,900
Yeah,
ironic.

1163
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,200
Uh,
but it's about integration I should say,

1164
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,960
and it's written by a guy named tanner 
colby who's going to.

1165
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:15,880
It's insanely my name.
I'm literally off the charts.

1166
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,740
Like if you were going to build a white 
name,

1167
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:22,180
it would be tanner colby and always 
wearing a golf shirt.

1168
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,370
Might as well be,
uh,

1169
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:27,560
but he really went deep into 
integration.

1170
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:30,340
What was interesting was,
uh,

1171
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,610
I highly recommend the book,
but he said You,

1172
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,050
when you think about integration,
your resistance,

1173
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:36,441
you go,
yeah,

1174
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:37,274
white people didn't want it.

1175
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,400
Black people didn't want it either,
but they were like,

1176
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:41,960
we don't want to hang out with those 
motherfuckers.

1177
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:45,320
Like these black people didn't trust 
white people any more than white people.

1178
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:48,380
Trusted them.
Like it was a mutual suspicion.

1179
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,550
At least black people had a case.
White people had no case.

1180
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,720
Other than that,
I think white people,

1181
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:58,721
a lot of racism is basically a white 
people fearing karmic retribution.

1182
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,510
I think when I think fear of black 
people is like,

1183
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,713
there is a Karma coming at me,
like it's almost like too black and you 

1184
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:09,680
think like if they,
if they did something to me,

1185
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:15,070
I kind of have it coming historically.
So let me just kinda like these.

1186
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,650
Even if you don't have it coming,
they can make the argument and uh,

1187
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,340
and it's not a long argument and it's a 
good argument.

1188
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,480
Um,
so,

1189
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,940
so that was interesting.
And again,

1190
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,060
I think I've talked about and maybe I 
haven't talked about in here that one of

1191
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:29,894
the biggest proponents of integration 
and ending red line and you know about 

1192
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,133
redlining,
redlining was a thing where a banks 

1193
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:40,640
would only give loans to people who 
lived a,

1194
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:44,090
they would circle lines on maps,
they'd circle neighborhoods and go,

1195
00:51:44,091 --> 00:51:45,620
if you live in that neighborhood,
you can't get a loan.

1196
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,080
And guess who's neighborhoods?
They circled back people.

1197
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,840
Uh,
so,

1198
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:55,550
so black people couldn't move.
And the biggest,

1199
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:57,290
the guy who ended it was Mitt Romney's 
dad.

1200
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,253
Well,
how about.

1201
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:58,781
Yeah,
well,

1202
00:51:58,781 --> 00:51:59,614
how about Baltimore or Baltimore?
They had littoral areas of the town 

1203
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,020
where they would not sell it.
Black people.

1204
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,880
Yeah,
they can't.

1205
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,890
You can't unlearn what do you have?
Cash.

1206
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,530
You can't move.
They literally can't

1207
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,650
fucking move.
You could buy within that neighborhood,

1208
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,873
but you just moved for the most part.
Couldn't get loans no matter what you 

1209
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:18,650
did

1210
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,483
and isn't it ironic that in a lot of 
those neighborhoods the saving grace 

1211
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:23,803
financially is white people gentrifying 
the neighborhoods and making them like 

1212
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:29,700
super rich again?
Yeah.

1213
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:30,723
My saving grace,
that saving grace for people that were 

1214
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:35,630
lucky enough to buy Roche has happened 
more.

1215
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,730
That's happening at a fairly good amount
of,

1216
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:42,731
but in my neighborhood for the renters,
it's pushed out so it's like,

1217
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:43,724
look,
you wanted the neighborhood to be worth 

1218
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:45,191
something again.
Yeah,

1219
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:46,370
yeah,
but we can't afford it.

1220
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:47,843
People are buying up these houses and 
redoing them and then selling them for 

1221
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:51,584
shitloads of money will Benson Hurst,
which was always like this horrible 

1222
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:57,120
neighborhood.
Bensonhurst is over.

1223
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,143
That's going through this wave of 
gentrification mountains going through 

1224
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,090
like the entire burrows going through it
except for the poor.

1225
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,460
The poor Italian neighborhoods are 
pretty much the same,

1226
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,171
but,
but yeah,

1227
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:12,190
like the whole bed Stuy,
bedstuy,

1228
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,360
Fort Greene,
Bensonhurst,

1229
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:16,670
and those,
those,

1230
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,893
those,
those are the ones that we always 

1231
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:20,750
associated with like dead deep.

1232
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:21,843
The racism,
the baseball bat racism spike the wife 

1233
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:29,610
Beater Baseball Bat,
real good.

1234
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:33,400
Italian racism.
Real Italian sausage thick.

1235
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,660
Yeah.
The fucking Ragu.

1236
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,230
The real stuff.
Yeah.

1237
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,270
Uh,
with men and goat.

1238
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:42,180
Do you ever do a stand up in those 
areas?

1239
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,640
I did stand up in,
um,

1240
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,780
in Bensonhurst once,
now.

1241
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,190
Yeah.
There was a gig out there.

1242
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,800
God,
I'm trying to remember where it was,

1243
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,813
but it was.
I mean I might as well been a spike Lee 

1244
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:53,094
movie.
Yeah,

1245
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:53,611
I'm sure it.
Did.

1246
00:53:53,611 --> 00:53:55,860
They like you.
I think at the time they did.

1247
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,630
Did you start to remember,
use not like you play it up,

1248
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:03,510
but you did it feel like,
well you could pass for Italian.

1249
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:04,590
Are you a metallic.
Oh,

1250
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:05,700
there you go.
That's why you passed.

1251
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,500
I'm,
I've one quarter Irish,

1252
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,210
but most,
most of it is Italian.

1253
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,170
Yeah.
You seem Italian.

1254
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:10,920
Like you.
Look,

1255
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,753
you look Italian.

1256
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,560
I mean that in the nicest possible way,
Joe.

1257
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,533
Well,
when I went to Italy recently and I was 

1258
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:16,194
like,
oh,

1259
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,270
now I see what's going on.
Those are some talking motherfuckers.

1260
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,870
Oh yeah,
they talk up a storm.

1261
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,470
But what's interesting is my driver,
uh,

1262
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:24,961
we,
uh,

1263
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:25,794
we got a cab and the driver was fucking 
hilarious and not intentionally 

1264
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,360
hilarious and that this guy could not 
stop staring at women.

1265
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,850
He would like hit the brakes to look at 
them better.

1266
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:36,743
Oh,
look at.

1267
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:37,603
Oh,
Jesus calling was invented by Italian 

1268
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:41,460
dude.
Basically their pigs.

1269
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,070
I mean this,
I mean in the most beautiful way.

1270
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,750
Like it's kind of hilarious that this 
got me.

1271
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,633
He's,
he knew he wasn't gonna get the fuck 

1272
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:49,950
these women,
but in his mind,

1273
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:53,100
like you had to slow down and head out 
the window.

1274
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,710
Hey,
fucking era with the fucking thing.

1275
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,440
Hey,
hey mama,

1276
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:01,600
hey.

1277
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,860
But they so stair there staring at these
women.

1278
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,820
There's this a framed poster that I have
on my wall at home.

1279
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:09,983
It's an American girl in Italy and all 
the dudes are whistling in the 

1280
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:13,014
background and they're grabbing their 
dicks and it's 1954 and I remember 

1281
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:18,840
looking at that when I was a kid 
thinking,

1282
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:21,570
wow,
this lady in this photo is probably like

1283
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,800
100 years old now.
Right?

1284
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,870
Or dead.
More likely dead.

1285
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,003
But like these guys like this isn't.
This isn't like something they learned 

1286
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:31,320
from Washington Soprano's like,
here it is.

1287
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,630
This is the photo.
Oh No,

1288
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,180
I know.
Absolutely.

1289
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,583
Grabbing his Dick and look at the old 
man who's got his arms inside the 

1290
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:40,830
jacket.
The jacket just thrown over.

1291
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:45,540
Shoulders guys.
Sharing a,

1292
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,870
a nice guy.
The guy in the school?

1293
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,133
No,
not the finest broad we've ever seen 

1294
00:55:54,091 --> 00:55:54,870
either.
Well,

1295
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,790
it's hard to tell because she's got this
look on their face.

1296
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,780
Like,
oh my God.

1297
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,260
Yeah,
I guess I guess it's all relative.

1298
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,143
Yeah,
but,

1299
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,023
but it's just that it's a girl by 
herself walking past this cafe and all 

1300
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,064
these pigs.
There is this weird thing in their 

1301
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,400
harassment,
uh,

1302
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,460
which is like a maternal respect to it.
It's like you're beautiful.

1303
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,300
Like a my mama

1304
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,720
that's like built into it,

1305
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,440
whereas American harassment doesn't 
really have that.

1306
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,573
Whereas the Italian harassment,
there's a certain little fucking little 

1307
00:56:32,701 --> 00:56:34,290
maternal like,
Hey Mama,

1308
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,310
Mama,
Mama.

1309
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,680
Because those guys,
there was a big thing a few years ago on

1310
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:38,514
60 minutes were Italian guys don't move 
out so it will be in their mid thirties 

1311
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,700
and their moms don't want her to move 
out.

1312
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,440
They don't want to move out.
They're like,

1313
00:56:46,441 --> 00:56:48,420
I don't,
I may not get married.

1314
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,070
No one can compare it to Mama.
Just Italian guys in Italian.

1315
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:53,950
Guys in Italy.
Yeah.

1316
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,360
That's always been an issue with tying 
guys in the east coast too.

1317
00:56:56,361 --> 00:56:57,870
That live in America.
Yeah.

1318
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,650
Yeah.
Well they got it from,

1319
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,573
from,
uh,

1320
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,610
from.
Would you ever live in la?

1321
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,930
I think.
No.

1322
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,890
Go on.
Fuck that.

1323
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:06,900
Blake.
Go on.

1324
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,210
No,
no.

1325
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:09,811
Well,
first of all,

1326
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:12,270
I can't speak Italian and I don't have 
enough time.

1327
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,040
I mean,
I just don't learn.

1328
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,430
You're not really interested.
Second,

1329
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,460
if you liked the lifestyle though,
I guess my question,

1330
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,280
I loved being there.
I love it.

1331
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,770
I don't need to like live somewhere to 
experience it for a week or so.

1332
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:25,710
I think we're there for eight days is 
beautiful man.

1333
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,380
Like we went to the Mafia coast.
Holy Shit.

1334
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:29,460
Is that pretty?
Yeah,

1335
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,100
pretty.
And I think the Vatican,

1336
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,560
the Vatican is a life changing 
experience.

1337
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,240
Go on Hook.
Why do you say that?

1338
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:37,980
It's immense.
Oh,

1339
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:39,090
it's hilarious.
First of all,

1340
00:57:39,091 --> 00:57:39,924
they have a 4,000
year old obelisk in the center of the 

1341
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,330
town.
Yeah.

1342
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:46,164
I mean you look at some of the artifacts
and some of the stuff that they've 

1343
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,424
collected there.
There's so much shit there that it's 

1344
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:54,910
just laying around stuff that would be 
under two,

1345
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,290
two inch thick glass and America.
You could walk up and touch it.

1346
00:57:58,330 --> 00:57:59,163
They're,
they're like new shit would be our 

1347
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:01,870
oldest shit.
It's amazing.

1348
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,420
And it's amazing.
Church in Rome.

1349
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,254
I was,
I used to go there pretty often because 

1350
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:07,190
I was dating a girl that lived there 
and,

1351
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:12,210
and a long distance relationship.
It wasn't that serious joe.

1352
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,540
Um,
but no,

1353
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,230
I remember she worked

1354
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:18,610
dating in air quotes.
Thrust your girl.

1355
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:23,550
I knew I knew a girl in the Oval Office

1356
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,350
and uh,
no,

1357
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,193
she just telling me that he had,
I have a piece of Jesus's cross and it 

1358
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:31,540
was like believable.
Do you know what I mean?

1359
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,880
Like I don't even think they made a big 
deal out of it.

1360
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,130
Like there weren't a ton of signs about 
it.

1361
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:40,630
Like that would be like a,
a huge attraction that would be like the

1362
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:42,000
number one attraction in,
in,

1363
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,300
in certain states,
in America.

1364
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,223
Well there's a church in Ethiopia that 
is purported to contain the lost Ark of 

1365
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:51,694
the covenant and they know,
they know where the tree and they have 

1366
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,200
the architect.
This is what,

1367
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:59,470
it's weird.
The people that guard this church,

1368
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,500
they all have like cataracts and shit.
And it's,

1369
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,140
it's,
it's a very strange thing.

1370
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,340
This is all from Graham Hancock's book 
where a,

1371
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,373
it's one of the first things that got 
him into this idea of like lost 

1372
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:18,690
civilizations and that the idea that 
people had come up with like some pretty

1373
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:23,180
high level of sophistication in their 
societies.

1374
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,133
But then the societies would crumble 
either due to natural disasters or war 

1375
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,024
whatever.
And then they would have to sort of 

1376
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:34,961
rebuild civilization,
but he was investigating this one church

1377
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:39,170
in Ethiopia where the people that guard 
this church in Ethiopia,

1378
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,213
it's like a very specific sect and they 
won't allow anyone to get into the 

1379
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:46,130
sacred secret areas of it.

1380
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,203
And the speculation was that somewhere 
inside that church is the lost Ark of 

1381
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:51,674
the covenant and that the reason why 
these people have cataracts and the 

1382
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:56,930
reason why these people have all these 
issues like health issues,

1383
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:02,290
it could possibly be that what's in that
last arc of the covenant is some sort of

1384
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:06,350
a,
a toxic element,

1385
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,453
whether it's nuclear or whether it's 
chemical or whether it would stand to 

1386
01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:11,654
reason if you watch the raiders of the 
lost Ark that makes those guys' faces 

1387
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:15,031
melt.
Right?

1388
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:18,230
It sure does.
I don't know what could be substantiated

1389
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:19,064
if anything,
your face melt unless you close your 

1390
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:22,400
eyes,
you know,

1391
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,340
like one of those things or.
Well,

1392
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,233
look,
if someone came up with some sort of a 

1393
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,910
nuclear reactor,
you know,

1394
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:29,744
there was a kid that got arrested.
I'm going to close my eyes if there's a 

1395
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:33,170
nuclear blast.

1396
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,900
And just hope for the best.
That's a move.

1397
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:35,893
Like when bugs bunny would jump out of 
an airplane right before it hit the 

1398
01:00:37,491 --> 01:00:40,090
ground.
Exactly right.

1399
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,120
But there was a kid that they found,
um,

1400
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:48,260
I forget where he was,
but he was building a nuclear reactor in

1401
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:49,094
his fucking backyard,
I want to say he was 17 and someone 

1402
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:54,530
found it somehow or another they found 
it.

1403
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,780
They're like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1404
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,063
But if this kid can do that in 2016,
the idea is if there was some sort of 

1405
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:03,554
super highly advanced law civilization 
that had reached an incredible level of 

1406
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:09,950
sophistication when it came to,
you know,

1407
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:10,843
the ability to manipulate matter and 
possibly even come up with some sort of 

1408
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:16,544
a reactor and that,
that was what the Ark of the covenant 

1409
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:19,934
was.
That's why it was so sacred and 

1410
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:23,120
fascinating because they realized they 
had an immense power,

1411
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,283
but that,
that power was probably like some sort 

1412
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:27,380
of a small reactor.

1413
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,140
That would be cool.
I hope when.

1414
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:31,310
That'd be cool.
Be Crazy.

1415
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:32,144
It all ended up being true.
Well then they know for sure that 

1416
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:39,431
they've found batteries,
they found batteries in Baghdad and uh,

1417
01:01:39,551 --> 01:01:40,384
I believe in some of the ancient 
Egyptians sites that what it is is a 

1418
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:50,651
very ancient sort of a method of 
creating a battery like that.

1419
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,360
That's 100 percent confirmed that I 
believe.

1420
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,440
Yeah.
And that's confirmed.

1421
01:01:54,441 --> 01:01:56,690
They know that they did come up with 
something and they,

1422
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,553
you know,
they figured out a way to use that 

1423
01:01:58,731 --> 01:01:59,930
battery.
There it is right there.

1424
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,640
That's the Baghdad battery.
Yeah,

1425
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:02,420
that makes sense.
Yeah.

1426
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,280
How old?
That's old as fuck.

1427
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:05,703
I don't want to say,
I want to say it's at least three or 

1428
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:09,170
4,000
years old.

1429
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,660
Find out how old that fucker is.
How,

1430
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,020
let's guess I say it's 4,000
years old.

1431
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:20,410
Three.
I'm going to go to to 2000.

1432
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,780
No,
let's see.

1433
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,900
What does it say?
No.

1434
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,330
Well they must be able to carbon date 
it.

1435
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:34,230
Nineteen 38.
They found it in the 19 thirties.

1436
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:40,180
So to say how old it is.
That's all I want to know.

1437
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,590
Speculation,
speculation.

1438
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:47,800
Some believe that it was [inaudible] 
doesn't say age.

1439
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,220
40 elements.
Battery hypothesis,

1440
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,500
nothing.
Civic it,

1441
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,480
um,
so,

1442
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,670
but see if you can find actually before 
he can find out,

1443
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:57,504
see if he could find the thing about the
guys who guard the Ark of the Covenant 

1444
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,980
in Ethiopia because apparently these,
these monks,

1445
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,170
that guard,
they all fucked up eyes.

1446
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,273
That was one of the things that Graham 
Hancock thought was like super 

1447
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:12,120
disturbing when he started investigating
it and was like,

1448
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,460
why is he got why these guys have all 
cataracts and shit.

1449
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:16,050
Like what?
What's happening?

1450
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,360
And if somebody can come up with a 
battery,

1451
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,750
obviously there's a big step between a 
battery and some sort of a reactor,

1452
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:25,620
but if this kid in his fucking backyard 
is building a reactor,

1453
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:29,070
who knows,
they had enough,

1454
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:33,590
a high level of sophisticated should 
whole.

1455
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,703
They had a high enough level of 
sophistication with the able to 

1456
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:37,410
construct the pyramid.
Right?

1457
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:42,000
Look at the Great Pyramid.
It's an incredible piece of engineering.

1458
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,410
Two million,
300,000

1459
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:47,070
stones all cut.
So precisely.

1460
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:49,110
You can get a razor blade in between the
rocks.

1461
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,960
I mean especially if you look in

1462
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,810
tie up at the pyramid.
Do you think you needed to be to get.

1463
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,580
Do you know what I mean?
[inaudible] like in like is there.

1464
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,040
No,
but I'm saying in terms of,

1465
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,820
you know,
in terms of like what you do,

1466
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,520
what your position was.
That's another pitch.

1467
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:09,390
I got an office on the eighth floor of 
the pyramid.

1468
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,540
The point I want to hear this,
my office is up at the point.

1469
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:16,820
If you worked on the builders,
probably didn't that probably.

1470
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,590
Although I don't know how,
how what the.

1471
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,150
If if jobs were considered a big deal 
back,

1472
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:23,880
they used to think they were slaves.
They don't think their slaves anymore.

1473
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,280
They stopped thinking they were slaves 
about a decade ago.

1474
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:27,114
I think when they.
They uncovered some of the little camps 

1475
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,733
that the people used to live in and buy 
the food that they were eating and by 

1476
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:37,590
the quality of the clothes and the 
plates,

1477
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,240
they think they were skilled workers.

1478
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:42,610
They don't think they were slaves in.
Which makes sense because you're.

1479
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:46,080
You're talking about something that if 
you $2 million,

1480
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,100
300,000
stones.

1481
01:04:47,101 --> 01:04:50,460
I think the way they described it as if 
you cut and placed 10 stones a day,

1482
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,380
it would take you 664 years.
So how long did they think it took?

1483
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:58,740
They weigh between two and 80 tons.
They don't know.

1484
01:04:58,830 --> 01:04:59,663
They don't know how long it took,
but they know that it was constructed 

1485
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:06,501
somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,500
BC based on carbon dating.

1486
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,800
So they don't even know who exactly 
which pharaoh built it like this.

1487
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,040
They get real weird with like what,
what they go on in

1488
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,013
terms of like,
what's the evidence that someone made 

1489
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:23,800
this or like one of them is this finks 
the way they,

1490
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:24,634
uh,
decided to attribute the Sphinx to one 

1491
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:31,750
guy where there's a passage that it says
that he,

1492
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,960
it came to him in a dream that if he 
uncovered this,

1493
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:35,794
thinks that he would be the pharaoh.
He would become the Pharaoh of Egypt if 

1494
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:40,873
he uncovered it.
And so the speculation by the people 

1495
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:47,050
that are sort of back dating history is 
that the Sphinx could have entirely been

1496
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:47,884
covered in sand.
It could be incredibly ancient because 

1497
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:53,860
when Napoleon found it,
it was covered in sand when,

1498
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:54,694
uh,
when people found in the 18 hundreds is 

1499
01:05:56,261 --> 01:06:00,550
actually photographs of it before they 
had dug it out and excavate it.

1500
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,713
Actually

1501
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,530
shooting the nose off.
Is that a fake thing?

1502
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:06,140
Supposedly is true.
Somebody fuck the nose up.

1503
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,500
Whether it was Napoleon or one of his 
crew.

1504
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:11,930
That's.
I don't know if they know that for sure.

1505
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,553
I know.
They do know that the nose and the face 

1506
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,820
are different from the original nose and
face.

1507
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,550
The original face they think was an 
alliance.

1508
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,230
Well,
that's amazing.

1509
01:06:22,231 --> 01:06:27,231
Like just people's love of faces.
Like there's a human you've ever heard.

1510
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,850
I feel like I've talked about it weird 
that there was a,

1511
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,910
they,
they put a monkey's.

1512
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,840
It's like,
it's a,

1513
01:06:33,841 --> 01:06:36,180
it's a defensive like star power and 
charisma.

1514
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,373
They put a monkeys in a lab.
They gave them the option of unlimited 

1515
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:42,683
cherry flavored juicy juice.
Or they could watch video of the leader 

1516
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:52,290
of their pack and they chose watching 
video of the leader of the pack.

1517
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:57,030
Wow.
This thing in human beings like needing,

1518
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:02,150
needing kind of God's needing a,
some sort of pillar or needing something

1519
01:07:05,341 --> 01:07:07,980
to like it also,
it speaks to this charisma,

1520
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:08,790
isn't it

1521
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:11,130
possible?
Also though that what they really needed

1522
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:15,750
is to get the fuck out of that cage and 
that the leader of their pack on a video

1523
01:07:15,751 --> 01:07:18,400
maybe like,
let them know your message.

1524
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,890
Maybe someone's going to let me out of 
here.

1525
01:07:19,891 --> 01:07:21,270
I mean there's just pay attention.
Maybe.

1526
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,560
Yeah.
But that's also something to like.

1527
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,970
There's something about certain people 
you just like watching,

1528
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,420
like there's a certain element of 
charisma,

1529
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,680
charm,
whatever you want to say.

1530
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:35,230
Like certain people that you see them 
and you're like,

1531
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:36,064
okay,
it's the definition of charisma is you 

1532
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:38,884
want to say yes before,
you know what the question is 

1533
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,830
[inaudible] uh,
and,

1534
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,000
and,
and monkeys,

1535
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:44,170
monkeys got it.
Joe,

1536
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:47,710
they got this,
they got the effect on the Italian thing

1537
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,100
and got that thing.
They got this thing.

1538
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:51,963
Well that,
that sort of makes sense if you think 

1539
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:56,030
about kings and pharaohs and the fact 
that,

1540
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,960
that there's always been this Alpha 
character.

1541
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:02,810
There's always been this one ruler for 
pretty much every

1542
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,150
realization,
every single city,

1543
01:08:05,151 --> 01:08:09,560
every single state,
every single country always has that one

1544
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:13,220
charismatic leader that stands in front 
of the people and lifts his hands up and

1545
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:13,720
everything.

1546
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,250
That's the thing that people 
underestimate.

1547
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:18,230
I don't think we should talk about trump
for a long time,

1548
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,750
but.
But that's.

1549
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,970
He's got a lot of charisma.
Say what you want to love the guy.

1550
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:24,840
He's got a ton of charisma and that's 
weird.

1551
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,180
Kind of charisma.
Yeah.

1552
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:30,140
He's got like this mean guy charisma.
You want him to like you.

1553
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,870
So you say things like you don't even 
believe.

1554
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:33,704
Yeah,
because you want him to think that 

1555
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:37,010
you're on his side so he won't come 
after you.

1556
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,310
Yeah.
That's a bully charisma.

1557
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,580
That's absolutely right.
But it's charisma nonetheless.

1558
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:42,663
That's the.
And that's the thing about stars and 

1559
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:48,560
movie stars and stuff like that.
It's like you're watching this guy.

1560
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,610
You Watch Denzel Washington waiting for 
him to snap.

1561
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:56,150
He never does.
But your weight,

1562
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:59,000
you can tell he's gonna.
He just doesn't.

1563
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,280
It's like Robert Downey Jr.
I feel like with robert downey jr,

1564
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:03,650
you're watching a guy not do cocaine.

1565
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:08,270
Yeah.
He wants to do everythIng in him,

1566
01:09:08,271 --> 01:09:12,830
wants to do cocaine.
So you're watching a guy not actively,

1567
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:17,831
not do cocaine from second to second.
That's such a good analysis.

1568
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:21,560
Yeah.
You just watching this guy,

1569
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:22,850
this thing,
this car accident.

1570
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:24,440
That never happens.
Yeah.

1571
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:28,510
You're watching a guy struggle slightly 
with.

1572
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:31,070
Yes.
You're struck.

1573
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:33,860
You're wondering.
I almost want you to see it on him.

1574
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:34,694
It's kinetic.
He's just got a little bit and that 

1575
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:40,550
little bit allows him to be like snaRky 
and weird and get away with that.

1576
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,510
He didn't get his medicine,
but you could almost do that with,

1577
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,510
with a lot of dramatics.
There's comedy stores less so,

1578
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,720
but there's something about tom cruise,
that's that.

1579
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,680
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1580
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,840
Right.
Like you're just watching.

1581
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:55,490
I Don't know if he's.
He's not going to snap.

1582
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,440
He's almost going to like fly away or 
something.

1583
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,251
Well,
he'll snap.

1584
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:03,251
If you talk about like psych psychiatric
drugs like matt lauer,

1585
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:10,210
you're glip.
Matt was amazing.

1586
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:11,243
Yeah,
that was.

1587
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,193
That was a perfect example of why really
big time movie stars should not have 

1588
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:18,380
podcasts 100 percent.
Right.

1589
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:19,843
You're absolutely right.
But it's also a testament to his 

1590
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:25,730
charisma that he said that and we're 
still like,

1591
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,593
eh,
fuck it.

1592
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:27,843
I need to be a movie star more than I 
need him to agree with me about 

1593
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,840
religion.
Yeah.

1594
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:36,050
He bounced back.
But what's really interesting is what he

1595
01:10:36,051 --> 01:10:36,884
bounces back on,
like is most successful is these 

1596
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,933
wackadoo fucking science fiction movies.
That's where he's done the best since 

1597
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:45,260
that,
the,

1598
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:45,750
uh,
the,

1599
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,770
the day after tomorrow thing or 
whatever,

1600
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:51,350
that edge of tomorrow beginning.
What is it?

1601
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,120
There's two of them.
He did two of them.

1602
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:57,690
He did two.
They did like one the mission impossible

1603
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,610
for the ones that,
those.

1604
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,890
Or is that too?
Yeah,

1605
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,880
that's true.
But that's.

1606
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,670
Tomorrow movie was a good movie.
Fucking very good.

1607
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

1608
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,060
You don't was a really good movie and I 
don't know if deadpool,

1609
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,193
deadpool,
I couldn't fucking believe how much I 

1610
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:12,650
love deadpool.
Sought on a,

1611
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:14,020
on an and he

1612
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,080
kept cutting out and it was still 
excellent.

1613
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:17,600
Yes.
Like,

1614
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,463
I'm not going to say it was perfect,
but there were some there moment to 

1615
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:22,974
moment.
It was as good a movie as I can 

1616
01:11:23,881 --> 01:11:24,750
remember.
Yeah.

1617
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:27,840
For a superhero movie is probably as 
good as it gets.

1618
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,160
Yeah,
I totally agree.

1619
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:30,420
Yeah.
That was a really good movie.

1620
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,330
Yeah.
It was very,

1621
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:33,880
very pleased with that movie because I 
had no expectations.

1622
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,540
Yeah.
And at the end he still gets to bang the

1623
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,620
girl,
so there you go.

1624
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,650
The way they bang that banging montage 
was great.

1625
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:46,000
And then him putting up a picture of 
what's his name and his face Just like,

1626
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:47,290
oh,
that's really fun.

1627
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,160
It's like where they let writers write 
well,

1628
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:51,091
like,
yeah,

1629
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:52,230
just,
that's a funny idea.

1630
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,880
So we'll just do that.
Well,

1631
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,280
I saw ghostbusters,
I didn't see it and I liked,

1632
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:01,770
which I feel awful about.
There's some funny shit in ghostbusters.

1633
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:05,220
Like overall it's not a good movie.
This is not a good movie.

1634
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,850
But they did some funny shit.
They,

1635
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,680
they came up with some fun and I almost 
want to know like,

1636
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:11,543
man,
what could this have been if you let 

1637
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,680
whoever came up with all that.
Funny shit just make,

1638
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,200
make a movie out of it where they scenes
where they died.

1639
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,450
It was a dialogue,
scenes and dialogue.

1640
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,330
There were scenes in.
It was such a combination of things.

1641
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:25,164
That movie and it's so had the feeling 
of the hands of the producers and the 

1642
01:12:29,281 --> 01:12:31,540
executives.
It's so handled that what

1643
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,050
you you.
In some ways.

1644
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,540
the thing I liked about deadpool was I 
was watching it going.

1645
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:40,380
The producers of this movie did a good 
job where they were like,

1646
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:44,210
this moment doesn't work.
Make it work everYday.

1647
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,073
Like micromanage.
Like I worked on chris rock's going to 

1648
01:12:46,691 --> 01:12:51,000
be top five a little bit for a couple of
consulting for a couple of weeks and the

1649
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:51,834
producers is guy named scott rudin who's
like a famous producer and what I 

1650
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:59,160
couldn't believe was the level of detail
that guy was worried about.

1651
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,350
It was He busted christmas balls for a 
year,

1652
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:02,184
but the script literally made them 
rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and 

1653
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:05,334
rewrite and rewrite and then onset.
The guy was worried about shirts and 

1654
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:11,760
buttons and that's what I realized like 
okay,

1655
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:12,594
these deadpool producers.
Whereas it feels like maybe on 

1656
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,590
ghostbusters that got,
you got to get,

1657
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:19,830
you have to get lucky too with studio 
where they they,

1658
01:13:19,831 --> 01:13:24,831
you all haven't agreed to set of of 
what's good and then you build them over

1659
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,193
from.
There was also this a problem that the 

1660
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:31,600
movie had a very clear agenda to be a 
pro woman move,

1661
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,470
which gets means nothing wrong with 
being pro woman,

1662
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,140
but if that's.

1663
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,050
It's like a.
It's a goofy.

1664
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:44,220
It's not a theme for a movie.
A comedy movie.

1665
01:13:44,221 --> 01:13:44,450
Yeah.

1666
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:47,710
All the men are buffoons.
They're not just buffoons there.

1667
01:13:47,711 --> 01:13:49,800
There cartoonishly retarded.
Yeah.

1668
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:52,260
Like chris,
whatever the fuck stands for.

1669
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:55,970
thor is so retarded.
It doesn't even make sense.

1670
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:56,953
Yeah.
He's,

1671
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,820
he's so fucking stupid.
It doesn't make sense.

1672
01:13:58,821 --> 01:14:01,490
But they keep them around because he's 
beautiful and it's like the joke.

1673
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,730
Well that's a funny,
but I,

1674
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:05,030
I liked these revenge jokes where it's 
like,

1675
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:08,960
so you're just going to do what men did.
How long is this gonna last?

1676
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:12,000
Like what's the next?
It's easy a man to say like,

1677
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,240
hey,
do something else honey.

1678
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,640
But like,
but it just feels like there's got to be

1679
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:17,470
like a next,
uh,

1680
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,490
next.
Uh,

1681
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,530
there's a lot of like rep retribution 
right now.

1682
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,380
Twitter is it blood just wasn't 
believable.

1683
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:24,980
A lot of what twitter is.
Twitter is it,

1684
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:25,853
it's a lot of people.
It's like digital lynch mobs of people 

1685
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:30,453
that are rightly so.
They'll go after people for saying 

1686
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:35,950
something fucked up about race.
Like they went up to juStin timberlake a

1687
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:36,783
few weeks ago because he said some of 
them were all the same and then it's 

1688
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:39,934
like,
but you can't say that and it just 

1689
01:14:41,471 --> 01:14:45,760
becomes this mob of people.
And it's purely about racial revenge

1690
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,480
as far as I'm concerned.
well it's definitely about people having

1691
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:53,010
the opportunity to shit on

1692
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,720
people that didn't have the opportunity 
to before and now they have it via.

1693
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:58,583
They,
they have social cache and they have 

1694
01:15:00,091 --> 01:15:00,924
social power and they use it for the 
same bullshit of white people use it 

1695
01:15:05,191 --> 01:15:06,024
for.
Well it's not even just black people 

1696
01:15:07,681 --> 01:15:08,970
doing it.
It's a lot of white people,

1697
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:09,991
women,
any,

1698
01:15:09,991 --> 01:15:10,824
any,
any,

1699
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,270
any sort of marginalized group,
whether it's poor,

1700
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,700
any like literally any group.

1701
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:16,163
this movie like this is,
there's a bunch of problems with the 

1702
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:21,060
moving,
but this,

1703
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,140
the fact that all the men in the movie 
were ridiculous.

1704
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,770
All the men this mover buffoons all the 
men in the movie,

1705
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:29,663
like they,
like bill murray gets fucking killed in 

1706
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:32,820
it.
Spoiler alert.

1707
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:36,120
I mean it,
it's weird.

1708
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,283
It's weird.
It's like it's an agenda driven movie 

1709
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,550
more than they'd wrote something.
They figured,

1710
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:42,384
well,
it'll work if you do this or if it'll 

1711
01:15:43,651 --> 01:15:44,484
work if you do that.
Like they didn't even have romantic 

1712
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:51,240
interests in the movie because men were 
just so retarded.

1713
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:55,480
Like the women didn't have boyfriends.
They didn't have husbands.

1714
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:57,870
It didn't have like they had chris 
hemsworth.

1715
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,010
Yeah.
But that's it.

1716
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,630
And he was just eye candy.
Well,

1717
01:16:00,631 --> 01:16:01,280
the thing we

1718
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,000
tell people is when you're writing about
a specific gen,

1719
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,640
like for a long time,
women in comedy,

1720
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:12,010
women in comedy movies were a props or 
they were like,

1721
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,280
andie macdowell always used to be like 
the love interest in,

1722
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:18,760
uh,
and she was always just like this warm,

1723
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:19,594
sort of like vaguely disapproving.
It's either like you're disapproving of 

1724
01:16:22,901 --> 01:16:26,560
the guy or you're approving to a fault 
because that's,

1725
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:29,200
if you're,
if there's a movie about a certain,

1726
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,030
uh,
gender,

1727
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:34,600
which was usually men,
the women in their lives for the plot to

1728
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:35,434
advance.
They didn't have to be for the plot or 

1729
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:38,530
against the plot.
Right?

1730
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,423
So then women started complaining like,
will you see us as these binary goofy 

1731
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:44,314
things?
And obviously women in life are more 

1732
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:47,050
complex than that.
So,

1733
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,363
so now that women are starting to get 
their own movies and it's about groups 

1734
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:52,510
of women,
you see it's,

1735
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:54,650
it's a writing problem.
It's,

1736
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:59,670
you're in a trap where the men and 
bridesmaids were goofy as fuck.

1737
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,590
It was an irish cop in milwaukee.
Tell me more,

1738
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:05,950
because I've never seen that my whole 
life.

1739
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,010
A guy who's just like in bridesmaids is 
a fucking masterpiece for the most part.

1740
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,420
Just that part.
I was kind of like,

1741
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:14,360
wait,
so he's a cop and he's got an endless

1742
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:15,990
uh,

1743
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:20,000
appetite for wig even though she's not 
interested in was it?

1744
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,910
It was dicky to him,
but he still,

1745
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:22,990
he'll take her back,
whatever,

1746
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,620
and it becomes about.
He's basicallY the only man in the movie

1747
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,150
and it's kind of a goofy part and it's 
once because it's about a group of women

1748
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,470
and that's just the purpose that men 
have in that plot,

1749
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:36,873
you know what I mean?
But they,

1750
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:41,470
but they always say people take it as 
like this a sexism thing and I just take

1751
01:17:41,471 --> 01:17:43,090
it as like a screenwriting thing.
Well,

1752
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:46,210
it is that definitelY.
But one of the problems that people have

1753
01:17:46,211 --> 01:17:47,044
found when they're talking about this 
movie is that you can't criticize it 

1754
01:17:50,411 --> 01:17:52,390
because if you criticize that your sex.
Yeah.

1755
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:53,890
And no,
it's not.

1756
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:56,150
It's not a good piece of art.
Yeah,

1757
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,030
there you go.
It's not really well done.

1758
01:17:58,190 --> 01:17:59,023
But who did,
who did bridesmaids that I'm talking 

1759
01:18:01,931 --> 01:18:04,150
about the same guy who did it.

1760
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,070
He's done whatever.
He's done it twice now,

1761
01:18:06,071 --> 01:18:09,280
but like I think he knows he's a really 
good writer.

1762
01:18:09,281 --> 01:18:10,114
Like he knows you can use.
It's hard to write because it's never 

1763
01:18:13,811 --> 01:18:14,950
been.
I always tell people,

1764
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:17,770
listen,
I go show me a good example of a,

1765
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,880
a movie about a group of guys where the 
woman isn't just even in deadpool,

1766
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:27,180
she's a prop to the in love with them 
unconditionally.

1767
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:30,000
Even though his face turns into a 
monster,

1768
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:33,310
she still wants him to eat her pussy and
they make fun of it.

1769
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,170
Yeah.
They make fun of it in a funny way.

1770
01:18:35,171 --> 01:18:38,050
Like their meetup there,
meet cute and then they think about like

1771
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:38,884
the damage they both are.
That was like perfect to me because it 

1772
01:18:40,991 --> 01:18:41,824
was brief and it,
it's like the thing they always 

1773
01:18:43,961 --> 01:18:45,690
complained about when you're developing 
movies,

1774
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,550
like I don't buy this couple and I can't
fucking mouthing.

1775
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,850
Sorry.
I don't buy a lot of real couples.

1776
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,601
Well,
not only that,

1777
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:54,310
they have to spell it all out in two 
hours.

1778
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:55,383
Yeah.
And they have to meet and fall in love 

1779
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:57,370
with him.
Five minutes.

1780
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,493
Well,
there's a lot more to a relationship in 

1781
01:18:59,470 --> 01:18:59,791
that.
Yeah.

1782
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,360
Yeah.
We can't show you all that other shit.

1783
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,830
Yeah.
Because that takes hours,

1784
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:06,520
days and weeks and months and you fuck.
That is correct.

1785
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:07,413
The sad thing about the movie,
the ghostbusters movie is there's some 

1786
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:13,730
stuff in it that was really clever.
There was funny stuff and I,

1787
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,000
in the beginning I was enjoying it.
I was like,

1788
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:16,834
you know what?
I bet people are not given this thing a 

1789
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,730
fair shake.
And then as it got on and I was like,

1790
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:22,623
oh,
they just.

1791
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,700
This is just so clunky.
Yeah.

1792
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:25,603
There's parts of it that were just so 
clumsy and poorly because every single 

1793
01:19:30,581 --> 01:19:33,070
one of those women are fucking home run 
hitters.

1794
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,830
Yeah.
Melissa mccarthY is fucking funny,

1795
01:19:35,831 --> 01:19:36,910
man.
The dude.

1796
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:40,120
She's fucking funny wig.
Kristen wiig.

1797
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,373
Which one?
She,

1798
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:42,880
uh,

1799
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,070
she was in bridesmaids.
I don't,

1800
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,910
I don't know what.
She's the auburn haired woman.

1801
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,970
Yeah.
Leslie's a fucking monster.

1802
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,833
She's,
she's handicapped in and they give her 

1803
01:19:54,091 --> 01:19:57,090
some clunky lines.
Uh,

1804
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,790
and then,
uh,

1805
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:01,100
the girl from snl,
kate mckinnon is really,

1806
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:02,310
really.
She was really funny in it.

1807
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,720
Yeah.
She was very funny in it,

1808
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:06,690
but it's not that bad.
I mean,

1809
01:20:06,691 --> 01:20:08,370
I didn't it.
I want to see what my kids.

1810
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,470
They enjoyed it.
But um,

1811
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,320
there was,
there were some moments I laughed pretty

1812
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:14,160
hard.
Great.

1813
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,100
But most of it not.
yeah.

1814
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,600
Well,
it's hard to make funny movies,

1815
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,310
man.
At the end,

1816
01:20:20,311 --> 01:20:21,600
they way they wrap it up,
you're like,

1817
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,830
oh,
christ,

1818
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,680
get the fuck out of here.
It's like,

1819
01:20:25,681 --> 01:20:27,690
it's so clumsy.
Oh,

1820
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,533
that's just so awkward because nobody 
told me there were no stakes in the 

1821
01:20:30,901 --> 01:20:32,040
movie.
It was just like,

1822
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:32,874
yeah,
there's ghosts and we're going to fight 

1823
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:34,830
him.
Uh,

1824
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:36,840
we got them.
Yeah.

1825
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,790
Yeah.
It is weird.

1826
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:43,240
It's hot fucking mean.
It's making a funny good movies.

1827
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,320
Really hard budget budget movie.
A big budget with a legacy and a star in

1828
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:50,760
a,
in a release date.

1829
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:51,923
Yeah.
And if they just see if there was no 

1830
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:55,800
ghostbusters before it,
there'd never been a ghostbuster movie.

1831
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:57,630
And this was the first ever ghost buster
movie.

1832
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,690
There wouldn't,
we wouldn't be talking about sponsors.

1833
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,290
It would be different.
yeah.

1834
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,213
well it may be.
People would enjoy it more and maybe 

1835
01:21:04,171 --> 01:21:05,004
they wouldn't be so handicapped because 
they had to sort of connect with the 

1836
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:12,660
legacy and tie all these loose ends in 
and they could kind of do it anyway they

1837
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,770
want,
but that's really a car.

1838
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:15,803
Whenever You try to redo an old movie,
even if you do a great job like member 

1839
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,800
jason statham redid the mechanic like,
dude,

1840
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:26,460
I didn't know that was a remake of 
fucking charles bronson movie.

1841
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:28,500
You don't even know that.
Oh my god.

1842
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:33,860
Charles bronson and that handsome fella 
from those seventies who went crazy a,

1843
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,900
god damn it.
What is this?

1844
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:40,050
No,
that was another one.

1845
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:44,490
What is his name?
Charles bronson in the mechanic.

1846
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:45,743
What does the other.
He was this really handsome actor who 

1847
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:51,690
became like a crazy alcoholic.

1848
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,720
He was really huge.
And Michael Vincent,

1849
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:59,580
he would've been the next.
He was really huge back then.

1850
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,433
Like he was beautiful frame right there.
Look at that hair and this just 

1851
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,960
tombstones in the banks and protestants 
all time favorites.

1852
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,880
It was korean.
So,

1853
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:10,500
um,
we called graphic right there.

1854
01:22:10,501 --> 01:22:11,610
Jess.
Perfect.

1855
01:22:11,611 --> 01:22:13,080
And bY the way,
no video.

1856
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:14,720
That's film.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1857
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:16,170
that's,
that's where kennewick,

1858
01:22:16,171 --> 01:22:18,630
it's american.
Back then when they,

1859
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:20,940
um,
would do a movie like this too.

1860
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:21,540
I mean,
like,

1861
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,670
you didn't get that many movies every 
week.

1862
01:22:23,671 --> 01:22:27,090
It's not like today.
Jan Michael Vincent played his,

1863
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:27,924
um,
his protege and charles bronson was a 

1864
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,580
hitman.
You saw this in the theater tv.

1865
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:36,960
I think I saw it on television the first
time.

1866
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:38,003
It was 1972.
I don't think I've ever seen a charles 

1867
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:43,570
bronson movie.
So he revenge is right.

1868
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:47,490
Who the fuck are you?
Is not a revenge movie necessarily.

1869
01:22:47,491 --> 01:22:48,810
I mean,
in some ways it kind of is,

1870
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,060
but really,
which is a revenge movie,

1871
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:51,900
right?
yes.

1872
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,610
Death wish was a,
a,

1873
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:56,820
a white man's dream.
The white man,

1874
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:57,950
his daughter,
something,

1875
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,210
a bunch of,
a bunch of dark skin.

1876
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:03,750
People don't remember exactly what the,
what the premise behind it was.

1877
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,100
I don't know who that guy

1878
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,820
is,
but I like him.

1879
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,653
He's interesting.

1880
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,090
Um,
but charles bronson and jan,

1881
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:11,690
Michael Vincent,
uh,

1882
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,420
they had this movie,
you know,

1883
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,254
which was a classic movie at the time 
and then it was redone with jason 

1884
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:17,923
statham and this other guy who is a 
really good actor who foster that same 

1885
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,600
ben foster who was in that movie 30 days
of night.

1886
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:29,620
Jefferson,
that movIe.

1887
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,541
No,
I didn't see that.

1888
01:23:30,541 --> 01:23:31,374
But he was molested a in.
He was getting another movie with woody 

1889
01:23:35,431 --> 01:23:36,264
harrelson.

1890
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,190
Yeah.
About the,

1891
01:23:38,191 --> 01:23:40,050
about Iraq.
Yes.

1892
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:41,640
I know what you're talking about.
I don't remember the name.

1893
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:43,650
He's great in everything.
That fucking guy.

1894
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:45,450
He's,
he such a good actor.

1895
01:23:45,451 --> 01:23:46,800
There.
He is all creepy looking.

1896
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:49,880
Um,
so He played the jam.

1897
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:52,740
Michael vincent character,
which is an interesting sort of twist on

1898
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:55,530
things.
It wasn't a bad movie.

1899
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,573
It was a pretty good movie.
I enjoyed it like as far as like a 

1900
01:23:58,231 --> 01:23:59,064
mindless action movie,
but you're redoing a fucking charles 

1901
01:24:02,251 --> 01:24:03,810
bronson movie man.
As soon as,

1902
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:07,410
as soon as you try to redo a charles 
bronson movie,

1903
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:08,140
do you have

1904
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,030
any desire for remakes?
I'm never like,

1905
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:11,650
oh,
thank god the remake and it.

1906
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:12,484
Because I just would rather watch the 
original because it contains everything 

1907
01:24:15,141 --> 01:24:17,640
that I want,
which is the actual movie and then the,

1908
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:19,000
the memories I have of it.

1909
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:20,263
I liked when they remade the hulk 
because he kept doing it like over and 

1910
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:26,370
over and over again.
I'm like funny fucking guy trying to bit

1911
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:29,730
that never gonna work,
but

1912
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,660
did it with the eric bana.
That was shit.

1913
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:34,670
That was the.
That was the super emotional one,

1914
01:24:34,671 --> 01:24:36,770
right?
that was the only one that was like very

1915
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:37,880
emotional.
Yes.

1916
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:40,840
I got to say I didn't really like the 
last avengers,

1917
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,670
the I should say the first vendors 
because it just seemed like,

1918
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,480
like they just spent the whole movie 
just like,

1919
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:48,320
hey,
you guys want to,

1920
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,510
you got to come fight.
And they'd be like,

1921
01:24:50,511 --> 01:24:51,800
nah,
I don't want to know.

1922
01:24:51,801 --> 01:24:53,090
You got to come.
All right.

1923
01:24:53,091 --> 01:24:53,924
I'll come.
And then they had a big fight at the 

1924
01:24:54,651 --> 01:24:56,480
end,
but the hulk one was especially shitty.

1925
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:00,370
I saw the avengers right after I saw x 
mokena,

1926
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,340
which was one of my all time favorite 
movies ex back and it was very good.

1927
01:25:03,341 --> 01:25:04,174
Yeah.
Incredible.

1928
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,013
I saw,
I saw that one week and then I saw the 

1929
01:25:06,191 --> 01:25:08,620
avengers the next week and I was like,
this is shit.

1930
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,100
This clunky.
Yes,

1931
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,030
fucking movie.
But,

1932
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,970
but homeboy played away better hawk.
What's the fuck's his name?

1933
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,820
Mark refollow.
Buffalo.

1934
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:21,480
And then add an orange to was in the 
original.

1935
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:23,830
No,
he did the second one deal.

1936
01:25:23,831 --> 01:25:26,500
He just doesn't want to fight.
He's very strong,

1937
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,900
but he's not interested.
No.

1938
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:30,803
Scientists.
The scientists was doing an experiment 

1939
01:25:32,471 --> 01:25:33,304
and he was exposed to massive levels of 
gamma radiation and when he gets angry 

1940
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:39,000
he don't want green.
I want to know.

1941
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,180
I understand.
I don't want.

1942
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,520
I'm not interested in that.
yes,

1943
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,790
he's angry all the time.
That's,

1944
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,180
that's mark rufallo secret.
Oh,

1945
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:47,080
is that true?
Sacred.

1946
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,153
Oh,
got it.

1947
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,540
Yeah.
So it was a rageaholic yeah,

1948
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,513
he just keeps it together and he's been 
at any moment he could just let it go 

1949
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,800
and when he decides to let it go and he 
can't,

1950
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:56,900
can't

1951
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:57,733
control it because why isn't it just one
of these things like in the vendors it 

1952
01:26:00,411 --> 01:26:02,120
seemed like they were like,
hey,

1953
01:26:02,121 --> 01:26:03,680
come help us with this

1954
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,843
specific guy.
And He did tough to get them to pay 

1955
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:11,150
attention,
but that's the brothers,

1956
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:11,990
right?
You can't,

1957
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,030
he can't guide it because it just seems 
like,

1958
01:26:14,031 --> 01:26:15,620
hey,
how calm.

1959
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:16,454
And he's like,
but I don't.

1960
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:20,270
You guys are going to make me get angry.
It seems like a small price to pay.

1961
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:22,790
Like yeah,
fucking get a little bit angry guy.

1962
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,740
You're going to need you to save the 
world.

1963
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,590
Save the world.
You fucking selfish fucking animal.

1964
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,150
Well,
when they would go to find him the first

1965
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:31,230
time he's in Bangladesh,
like boy,

1966
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,361
he was in the.
Yeah,

1967
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:33,194
he was in like at a,
at a like an remember that save the 

1968
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:37,110
children type.
Yeah.

1969
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:42,230
I feel like I've given money to support 
whatever the hulk is working,

1970
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,700
whatever.
Dr.

1971
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,470
Bruce.
And they'd come and get him with fucking

1972
01:26:45,471 --> 01:26:49,760
rifles drawn and everything like that.
Like to realize like you can't do that.

1973
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:54,950
like that violence is getting mad.
and now read the dossier.

1974
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,190
Do you don't have anything but guns.
What are you gonna stop them.

1975
01:26:58,430 --> 01:26:59,480
Yeah,
like don't move.

1976
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,351
I'm like,
oh jesus,

1977
01:27:00,351 --> 01:27:01,101
you got me.
You know,

1978
01:27:01,101 --> 01:27:02,390
you don't have.
Don't move.

1979
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:03,263
Oh,
don't move.

1980
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,290
Don't move.
what if I fucking move?

1981
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,133
What are they going to do?
They're going to shoot him before he 

1982
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:11,060
moves.
They can do anything.

1983
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:11,933
You have bad news for the hulk.
Wait until just the right moment to 

1984
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,273
tell.
So you and also your wife fucking 

1985
01:27:18,711 --> 01:27:20,090
somebody and then you fucking run up.
Well,

1986
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:22,710
maybe that would be the way that you 
would get them to stop in the hall.

1987
01:27:22,711 --> 01:27:24,290
Just give them ecstasy.
oh,

1988
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:25,160
that's funny.
Yeah.

1989
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,083
Yeah.
Just,

1990
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,750
that's the new treatment for the hawk.
Just keep them on.

1991
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:30,980
Very micro doses of ecstasy all day 
long.

1992
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:32,600
If he knew,
I know a ketamine guy if you need.

1993
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:36,320
Um,
I also am a little mad that

1994
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,243
uh,
lou ferrigno is not involved because he 

1995
01:27:39,181 --> 01:27:40,014
to me was the ultimate hoke with a rip 
george ripped jorts the ripped jeans 

1996
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:45,090
shorts.

1997
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:45,923
That is always going to be the problem 
with the hawk is how the fuck are those 

1998
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:48,810
pants still on?

1999
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:51,370
Yeah,
it should be a dick flapping.

2000
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:52,390
Oh,
for sure.

2001
01:27:52,391 --> 01:27:53,021
Mark.
Look,

2002
01:27:53,021 --> 01:27:56,980
I can'T even wear pants from someone who
weighs 20 pounds less than me.

2003
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,960
Yeah.
Just to add to the brown corduroys,

2004
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,070
that's how we used to do it back then.
Joey brown fucking corteroids.

2005
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,760
Well,
it was supposed to be purple.

2006
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:09,130
The hulk always had purple pants.
Oh,

2007
01:28:09,131 --> 01:28:11,210
that's interesting.
For whatever reason,

2008
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,280
weird fucking seeds.
Blue jeans.

2009
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:16,130
But if you go to the hulk,
like the cartoon hawk,

2010
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:19,120
you'll see that he always had purple 
pants.

2011
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,050
Green and purple or a better man.
The hulks pants.

2012
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,570
P a n,
t.

2013
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,713
You've watched

2014
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:27,130
pumping iron,
right?

2015
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:29,180
Look at that.
See always purple.

2016
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,560
Yeah.
What the fuck is that?

2017
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:33,740
You have seen pumping.
Are you see the new one generation iron?

2018
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:35,690
No.
Good.

2019
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,220
It's on.
It's on netflix.

2020
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,260
It's a banger.
Really?

2021
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,720
It's a banger.
It's also got one of my favorite moments

2022
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:44,720
in a documentary ever.
Which if you want to bring it up,

2023
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:48,080
I and you don't laugh at this,
then you then you're not yourself.

2024
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,730
This is like an alien test,
like.

2025
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,230
No,
this is joe rogan.

2026
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,240
I believe it's joe rogan.
If you've laughed at this,

2027
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,370
well then now you're setting it up.
It's a wasted moment.

2028
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,770
There's an I know.
I it.

2029
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,750
It's that good.
What's the funniest moment?

2030
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,330
I've ever seen the documentary.
Really?

2031
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:02,213
Yes.

2032
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:03,800
Are you going to spoiler?
I'm not going.

2033
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,590
No,
I'm not going to spoil it.

2034
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,330
Should we play it a?
Yeah.

2035
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:09,150
If you bring it up on netflix,
I will show you where it is.

2036
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,720
MighT not be able to do that.
Fifty four minutes in time.

2037
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,423
ReCommend this clip a lot it.
Don't you think the clip is probably on 

2038
01:29:19,111 --> 01:29:20,340
youtube?
if it's says strong,

2039
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,720
maybe.
What is it?

2040
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:26,670
Why don't you say a generation?
Iron horse generation.

2041
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:29,820
Iron horse.
Seen separate words.

2042
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,970
Interest.
I stand by it.

2043
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,640
So is it a,
just a new film?

2044
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,870
A new film.
Alright,

2045
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:38,641
back it up.
Back it up,

2046
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:39,720
back it up.
Pause it.

2047
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:40,860
Pause it.
Okay.

2048
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:42,440
Oh fuck you.
You ain't gotta.

2049
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:43,410
Hear the guy.
set it up.

2050
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,053
Go all the way to the back of the clip.
I dOn't think it's long enough if you 

2051
01:29:48,631 --> 01:29:50,520
show.
And if you show me another one,

2052
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,610
the guy talks about.
You see what it is,

2053
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:55,470
guy riding a horse,
right?

2054
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,480
If you go back,
uh,

2055
01:29:59,140 --> 01:29:59,973
to.
And the thing is he talked about how he 

2056
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,990
never gets injured.
Oh,

2057
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:08,070
he's liteRally talking about die.
Never get injured.

2058
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:09,000
People say,
get injured.

2059
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:11,930
I wasn't even a real injury and now a 
pass.

2060
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,810
Two injuries I've had.
Well,

2061
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,220
we're in the gym.
They were outside the gym,

2062
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:19,230
so I haven't been hurt in the gym since 
2003.

2063
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:24,660
That's go.

2064
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:31,353
Oh shit.

2065
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,210
The horse just decided enough.
Yeah,

2066
01:30:43,211 --> 01:30:46,240
he was at the horse has had enough of 
him taLking about never being injured.

2067
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,333
The horse,
he's talking about not getting injured 

2068
01:30:49,061 --> 01:30:51,730
and the horse throws him off the fucking
horse.

2069
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:55,210
It's such fucking poetry to me and he 
lands hard.

2070
01:30:55,211 --> 01:30:57,160
He lands hard and says,
oh jesus.

2071
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:58,053
As he lands,

2072
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:04,970
he's so big.
You would think that guy is like,

2073
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:06,363
well,
I guess he's kind of protected a little 

2074
01:31:07,181 --> 01:31:08,680
bit.
All that muscle.

2075
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:12,040
You see that car accident sculpture?
Yes.

2076
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:13,420
Yeah,
that's right up your alley.

2077
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,700
Yeah.
Well explain what you're talking about.

2078
01:31:15,701 --> 01:31:18,660
There's a day.
There was an art installation.

2079
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:19,503
Ate so many sculpture of what the human 
body would need to look like to 

2080
01:31:24,221 --> 01:31:25,054
withstand a car accident,
to evolve in order to be able to 

2081
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:32,560
withstand car accidents and know how the
fuck they figured this out though.

2082
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,090
That's one of the weird things,
so I was like,

2083
01:31:34,091 --> 01:31:38,350
why their arms so skinny,
like damn one inch or one image of it.

2084
01:31:38,351 --> 01:31:42,200
There's some cars.
There's nothing important in the arms to

2085
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:45,640
protect your brain and your heart.
Is that what it is?

2086
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,440
Yeah.
Why does it have nipples?

2087
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,630
Like what are all those nipples over the
rib cage?

2088
01:31:50,530 --> 01:31:53,200
Um,
I think those are like panning.

2089
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,630
Maybe those are nipples,
whatever it is.

2090
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:57,130
Those are like when you first get 
nipples,

2091
01:31:57,131 --> 01:32:02,110
when you're of those,
what are those things?

2092
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:03,003
Ridges.

2093
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:08,140
Isn't it funny that what we look at 
today,

2094
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:10,840
when we see a person,
we think it's normal,

2095
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,560
but it's just what we're used to is what
happened.

2096
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,210
It's just what we are.
I mean,

2097
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,540
people are fucking weird looking by the 
way.

2098
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:22,120
They didn't do any favors with the,
with the facial hair and the haircut.

2099
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,410
Yeah.
It's a weird goatee.

2100
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:26,650
LIke why I'm like,
you look extra monkey ish.

2101
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,160
It looks very odd.
It's really disgusting.

2102
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:31,143
He has a weird choice.
And also the like the line to heaven 

2103
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:36,670
down to his pecker hairline.
Yeah.

2104
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,980
It's a weird,
weird hair trail.

2105
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:43,790
Like what is going on there?
It looks like a constellation space.

2106
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,330
Shit.
Or like a tesla coil.

2107
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:50,320
Yeah.
Radiating air.

2108
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,753
Yeah.
It's uh,

2109
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:52,840
I don't,
I guess.

2110
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,740
Do you have a tesla?
You don't know?

2111
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:55,750
I do not.
Oh,

2112
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:58,240
you made the observation or maybe it was
you or bird maybe.

2113
01:32:58,241 --> 01:32:59,980
Absolutely.
What if there's a power outage?

2114
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:01,481
Yeah.
Well tHat's,

2115
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:02,520
there's that for sure.
But all.

2116
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:06,550
I drove one for a day and I was shocked 
at how quick the battery went down.

2117
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,170
Oh really?
Yeah,

2118
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:11,200
I drove,
I drove from here to my house,

2119
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:15,730
to the improv,
a to my house to here again.

2120
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,980
And it was more than half

2121
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,040
dead.
And how many miles was it?

2122
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,770
100.
That's not even 60.

2123
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:24,743
That's too bad.

2124
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,300
Yeah.
I mean maybe maybe 70,

2125
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,830
80,
maximum.

2126
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:32,580
Maximum 80.
And it was more than half dead.

2127
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:33,743
so like when they say you can go 300 
miles without a charge or what are they 

2128
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:38,550
saying to 5,250
miles.

2129
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:41,880
That's under ideal conditions on the 
highway.

2130
01:33:41,881 --> 01:33:45,510
Sixty five miles an hour.
Drafting behind a fucking semi.

2131
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:49,950
It's not like stop and go traffic.
It's not,

2132
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:54,000
it's not a,
it's not speeding up,

2133
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:57,060
slowing down.
It's not ligHts.

2134
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,250
That's.
It's not ready.

2135
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,930
It's not ready.
I think it's ready.

2136
01:34:00,931 --> 01:34:01,764
I think it's,
I mean depending on how far you need to 

2137
01:34:02,641 --> 01:34:03,570
go,
that's half full.

2138
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:05,370
It's still pretty good.
Well sure.

2139
01:34:05,371 --> 01:34:07,830
You could use the average person only 
drives 35 miles a day.

2140
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,903
Yeah,
I mean you could for sure you could use 

2141
01:34:09,751 --> 01:34:12,210
it as a daily driver if you could plug 
it in every night,

2142
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:14,340
but it's not ready for me to adopt.

2143
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:15,593
it's just so limited that the fact that 
it takes so long to recharge like you 

2144
01:34:19,891 --> 01:34:20,724
can,
you can charge in for a certain amount 

2145
01:34:22,111 --> 01:34:22,944
of time and I'll give you like 80 
percent or the idea that maybe they 

2146
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:28,170
could swap batteries.
you pull into a place and they take your

2147
01:34:28,171 --> 01:34:29,670
batteries out and give you new 
batteries.

2148
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,070
But then you've got to trust that 
they're connecting the batteries.

2149
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:32,904
Right.
You've got to trust that the batteries 

2150
01:34:33,571 --> 01:34:36,050
are good.
You've got to trust who,

2151
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,620
who had the batteries before anybody 
dropped muckrack.

2152
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:40,140
Um,
are they going to like my fucking car on

2153
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:40,974
fire now?
Because that was one of the issues that 

2154
01:34:41,751 --> 01:34:43,860
they were having with people in the 
chevy volt.

2155
01:34:43,861 --> 01:34:44,720
I have not.

2156
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,570
There's been.
No,

2157
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:47,700
I get 300 miles a gallon.

2158
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,770
That's a hybrid though,
right?

2159
01:34:49,771 --> 01:34:50,604
Yeah.
Yeah.

2160
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:51,830
Well,
what the teslas,

2161
01:34:51,831 --> 01:34:52,664
when they first came out,
we're developing issues where the 

2162
01:34:54,651 --> 01:34:56,990
underbody would get hit by rocks and 
would start.

2163
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,030
And then,
uh,

2164
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:01,530
do you remember the fisker fiscal karma?
Yeah.

2165
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,230
Do you know how that would killed that 
thing?

2166
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,273
No.
What happened?

2167
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,860
Remember that big storm that hit the 
east coast?

2168
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,760
There was a big storm that hit the east 
coast.

2169
01:35:08,761 --> 01:35:09,800
Sandy one.
Yeah.

2170
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:12,550
I think that was a couple of years back.
Um,

2171
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:14,270
destroyed a lot of houses in long 
island.

2172
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:17,210
that was hurricane sandy.
They hit a port,

2173
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:18,343
the,
the storm hit a port where these things 

2174
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:24,941
were parked and apparently when they get
up to the door height and water,

2175
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:28,370
they explode.
Look at this.

2176
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:29,870
This is the,
uh,

2177
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:33,230
see that sales,
those fires going on over there.

2178
01:35:33,231 --> 01:35:33,560
And the,

2179
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,930
since the,
that's the trigger of former.

2180
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,820
That's not the cars.
That's the transformer.

2181
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,470
That's the transformer on the east 
village.

2182
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:44,790
Is this a different video that says con 
ed explosion?

2183
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:45,730
No,
you got the wrong.

2184
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:48,580
There's,
but there's one that's like this.

2185
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,810
It's pretty similar to find the video of
the hurricane sandy fires.

2186
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,470
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe they don't have a video of it.

2187
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,820
See if he can find it.
Anyway,

2188
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:02,800
point being those things.
When you get them wet,

2189
01:36:02,801 --> 01:36:03,550
they blow up.

2190
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:04,830
That's good.
No,

2191
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,280
it's not great and people don't like 
that.

2192
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:08,320
So that company went under.
Yeah,

2193
01:36:08,321 --> 01:36:09,730
I have a volt.
It's been great.

2194
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,430
That's a good move.
Like a hybrid is a really good move.

2195
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,273
Yeah,
because it's like gas and electricity 

2196
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:20,440
and kind of run on both 40 electricity 
every charge and I can charge it in four

2197
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,920
hours for a full chart and pickups.
Good drives.

2198
01:36:23,921 --> 01:36:25,010
Good.
I'm not like,

2199
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,100
I never really need.
I'm like,

2200
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,340
the only time I'm using pickup is when 
I'm driving like a dickhead,

2201
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:31,870
bright,
you know what I mean?

2202
01:36:31,871 --> 01:36:33,700
So it's like you're trying not to drive 
like that,

2203
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:35,710
but if I'm cutting people off and doing 
shit like that,

2204
01:36:35,711 --> 01:36:38,230
then you need the I need to pick up 
because I'm an asshole.

2205
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:39,083
right.
uh,

2206
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:42,190
but for the most part I don't need 
pickup like day to day.

2207
01:36:42,191 --> 01:36:43,960
You can only go so fast.

2208
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,153
Well one of the cool things about a 
tesla is the idea of driverless driving 

2209
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:52,660
that is fucking amazing.
Name tesla at all for that.

2210
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:57,490
For the guy dying recently.
The one that autopilot one,

2211
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,413
I think they've deterMined that 
autopiLot didn't have anything to do 

2212
01:37:00,341 --> 01:37:02,560
with that.
He was watching Harry Potter.

2213
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:03,693
He was,
yeah,

2214
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,120
it was proven.
He was,

2215
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:06,083
it was still playing.
It was like greg giraldo's joke about 

2216
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:13,330
about rappers show him watching porn and
they get into an accident and they're on

2217
01:37:13,331 --> 01:37:15,250
the side of the road and the porn is 
still playing.

2218
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:18,120
Rappers watching,
I think it was rappers want,

2219
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:18,983
it was,
it was people having everyone on cribs 

2220
01:37:21,521 --> 01:37:24,550
had a monitors.
Right.

2221
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,310
And their color suv.
And he was talking about if you got into

2222
01:37:27,311 --> 01:37:28,144
an accident and you're dying and it's 
still playing fucking dumb shit on your 

2223
01:37:30,461 --> 01:37:32,240
monitor is still playing porn.
Yeah,

2224
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,213
I think it was born.
There was a guy who got killed in 

2225
01:37:35,351 --> 01:37:37,610
Michigan.
He was jerking off while I was driving.

2226
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,240
His car flipped is jerking off to this 
man.

2227
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:41,260
Yeah.
He can't wait.

2228
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:44,980
His car flipped and he died and he died 
with his pants down.

2229
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:48,830
His phone was still playing the porn 
when they pulled his life

2230
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:51,660
body from the wreckage.
That's a long clip,

2231
01:37:51,661 --> 01:37:53,640
by the way.
More than a dozen fisker karma.

2232
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:55,290
Hybrids.
Caught fire and exploded.

2233
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:56,040
No video.

2234
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,910
Just pictures.
I guess.

2235
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:59,310
So we're wrong.
So we have false memories.

2236
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:00,170
Yeah.
God damn.

2237
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,010
That's what happened with trump on nine 
slash 11.

2238
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,110
Yes,
he was.

2239
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:05,700
there wasn't.
He didn't eat celebrators oh yeah,

2240
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,670
in New Jersey.
So I'm all the way across the.

2241
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:09,720
Yeah.
Well,

2242
01:38:09,721 --> 01:38:11,460
some people musT have celebrated.
So what?

2243
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,310
Uh,
I don't think anybody was so.

2244
01:38:14,311 --> 01:38:15,144
I mean,
I don't think to,

2245
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,070
in jersey I'm sure people were like,
yes,

2246
01:38:17,071 --> 01:38:20,160
but I don't think people were going 
outside and fucking who knows,

2247
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:23,640
because then we'll get you popped maybe 
back then they didn't know.

2248
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:24,480
Well no.
When.

2249
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,313
I mean that's a fucking chaotic moment 
to be able to predict what's gonna 

2250
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:28,280
happen.
Yeah.

2251
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,320
And how did it.
Yeah,

2252
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,140
exactly.
Who knows what was going on.

2253
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:34,200
Then they didn't know when that first 
happened.

2254
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:35,293
Yeah,
I mean they could have been instead of 

2255
01:38:36,061 --> 01:38:37,950
celebrate and they could have been just 
going,

2256
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:39,720
wow,
that's crazy

2257
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,960
funny.
As I think when I.

2258
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:42,883
I think I saw it happen,
but I was in paris and I saw like 

2259
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:48,163
someone said like,
I am very sorry what happened to your 

2260
01:38:50,001 --> 01:38:50,691
country?
And I was like,

2261
01:38:50,691 --> 01:38:51,524
what are you talking about?
Like the world trade center and I'm 

2262
01:38:52,791 --> 01:38:53,624
like,
what?

2263
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:58,220
And then I ran to a monitor and saw 
psalm and butting my head.

2264
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:01,430
I saw it live,
but I just didn't.

2265
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:02,533
Do you know what I mean?
Like that's the faulty of faultiness 

2266
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:07,310
memories,
which is creepy that you can't.

2267
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,760
It's like you say ship with absolutely 
no certainty this point

2268
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,650
memories are very bad.
Yeah.

2269
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:15,160
I'm and I have some super clear memories
that,

2270
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,153
that I can verify,
but I've also got a lot of fuzzy ones 

2271
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:20,833
and the problem is when people start 
attaching all sorts of emotions and all 

2272
01:39:25,131 --> 01:39:25,964
sorts of different things to memories 
and then they start distorting them and 

2273
01:39:29,661 --> 01:39:34,160
then repeating the distortion of the 
memory until that becomes the memory.

2274
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:35,263
And then in their mind,
like there's people that have been 

2275
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:40,290
involved in business deals and they 
think that they were so wrong.

2276
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:44,300
Then everything went so terrible and 
this piece of shit and then my wife left

2277
01:39:44,301 --> 01:39:46,310
me.
And then when you break it down to them,

2278
01:39:46,311 --> 01:39:46,590
no,
no,

2279
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,120
no,
no,

2280
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:49,250
that didn't happen at all.
This is what happened.

2281
01:39:49,251 --> 01:39:51,070
Like they don't want to hear the 
results.

2282
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,250
People I think that are a little bit 
crazy.

2283
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:56,370
I'm talking about you ever be arguing 
with your wife and you're like,

2284
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:58,170
I didn't say that.
And then you think,

2285
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,313
did I say like,
especially if you're barely paying 

2286
01:40:01,691 --> 01:40:02,524
attention,
that's the key longterm relationship 

2287
01:40:05,261 --> 01:40:06,094
case.
Just got to be able to hit the fade 

2288
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,373
button that they do.
Is that you think that's helpful to 

2289
01:40:10,881 --> 01:40:13,060
round out and do you think she realizes 
it?

2290
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:14,283
What do you think?
She knows that I don't know what you're 

2291
01:40:15,281 --> 01:40:16,200
talking about.
Would you say?

2292
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:18,270
What were you saying?
Yeah,

2293
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:19,123
you just fade out.
But that's exactly the kind of 

2294
01:40:20,561 --> 01:40:21,930
conversations you start having.
Like what?

2295
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:22,960
What'd you just say?
What?

2296
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,580
I just lost everything.
What did you say?

2297
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:27,550
Some will say so then we're going to 
light it on fire.

2298
01:40:27,551 --> 01:40:28,610
What?
Yeah.

2299
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:29,980
Okay.
Now I have to pay attention.

2300
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:33,070
What are you going to light on fire?
Who's going to light one on fire?

2301
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,063
Yeah,
but that's the thing about 

2302
01:40:34,071 --> 01:40:36,050
relationships.
It's all kind of important,

2303
01:40:36,051 --> 01:40:39,080
but none of it's that important in 
retrospect.

2304
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:42,260
Hindsight in the day.
On the second of it

2305
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,880
sometimes.
Yeah.

2306
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,790
The most nonsensical thing could be so 
important.

2307
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,890
Neil brennan,
so important.

2308
01:40:48,891 --> 01:40:50,510
You have many daughters.
Well,

2309
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:53,680
my situation is pretty comfortable and 
easy manage,

2310
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:54,514
but I have some friends that have some 
bad relationships with their wives and 

2311
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,013
the.
It's basically when they get togetheR 

2312
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:03,400
it's just who's going to win today's 
wrestling match?

2313
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,560
How many,
how many people do you know with,

2314
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:09,250
with marriages that you envy?
Let's say you weren't married.

2315
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,540
That's a good question.
Not manY because that's the thing.

2316
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:16,390
It's like not many.
It's you know,

2317
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:19,000
most of them are.
It looks especially from the outside,

2318
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:20,840
it looks like way too much work.
Yeah,

2319
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:25,240
and it looks like disastrous happenings 
once it breaks off,

2320
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,300
which is different than a a boyfriend,
girlfriend.

2321
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:29,870
If a guy and a girl,
uh,

2322
01:41:29,871 --> 01:41:32,710
dating and they just decided to call it 
off like,

2323
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:34,420
this isn't working.
That's it.

2324
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:35,230
Yeah.
It's,

2325
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:37,240
there's very little cleanup.
Yeah.

2326
01:41:37,241 --> 01:41:38,074
That.
Well that's it.

2327
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:42,580
Yeah.
but if you are some man or some woman,

2328
01:41:42,581 --> 01:41:46,840
even like a woman who makes a shitload 
of money and she has a husband's kind of

2329
01:41:46,841 --> 01:41:49,420
a lay about and then that starting to 
happen,

2330
01:41:49,421 --> 01:41:50,620
fuck yeah,
it is.

2331
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,610
Fuck.
That is.

2332
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:54,340
And then all of a sudden this dude wants
a ton of alimony.

2333
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:55,473
Yeah.
Like,

2334
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:57,483
yeah,
like jesus christ and this woman who 

2335
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:00,993
doesn't even like this guy anymore has 
to pay him 10 percent or 15 percent of 

2336
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:07,290
her salary every week.
And she's just like,

2337
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,133
I can't even Believe this.
Like that is always been the case with 

2338
01:42:11,891 --> 01:42:14,500
men and women with a man having to pay 
the woman.

2339
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:17,110
It's always been alimony has been around
forever,

2340
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:18,100
right?
Child support,

2341
01:42:18,101 --> 01:42:21,220
alimony.
But now that it's in more and more cases

2342
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:22,054
becoming the woman playing the man,
like talk to roseanne barr about how 

2343
01:42:24,431 --> 01:42:25,780
much he had to pay tom arnold.

2344
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:27,430
And you're like,
what?

2345
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:29,553
This is it's league.
It's legalized stealing mixed in with 

2346
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:35,740
prostitution.
It's long,

2347
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:36,603
it's a long con.
Prostitution in in many ways and it's 

2348
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,773
involving the legal system and the banks
and as soon as there's a system that's 

2349
01:42:44,351 --> 01:42:46,870
set up where people are profiting off 
that system,

2350
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,080
good luck buying it from their fucking 
hands.

2351
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:50,943
Yeah,
and that's the political system that we 

2352
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:54,460
have right now,
but it's also the marriage system,

2353
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:55,773
like if you've talked to someone who's 
gone through horrific divorces and had 

2354
01:42:58,781 --> 01:43:02,530
to deal with the financial implications 
are or complications,

2355
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:04,480
it gets insane.
Well,

2356
01:43:04,481 --> 01:43:09,481
that's what buddy mine was like my wife.
the sad thing is the deal she's going to

2357
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,440
get.
I offered her two years ago,

2358
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,903
but she says dragging it out.
They want to drag it out because it 

2359
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:16,240
costs you money in legal fees.
That's right.

2360
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:17,370
And it there.

2361
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:20,050
You're still connected to them and 
they're punishing you.

2362
01:43:20,051 --> 01:43:22,690
If you want to get the divorce,
even if you don't want to divorce,

2363
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,093
there's a reason why they want to get 
divorced or they're mad at you for some 

2364
01:43:26,351 --> 01:43:27,430
shit.
You fucking.

2365
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,773
My friend has to pay his ex wife for the
rest of her life and he has a new wife 

2366
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:35,080
and he has a family.
He's got kids.

2367
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:35,943
She doesn't have a new husband though.
No know if she has a new husband than 

2368
01:43:38,931 --> 01:43:39,764
the money that cuts off,
so hE has to pay her hundreds of 

2369
01:43:42,881 --> 01:43:46,510
thousands of dollars every single year 
for the rest of her life.

2370
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:50,020
It's almost like he fucked her so hard.
She can't work anymore.

2371
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:52,150
Like that's what the court says.

2372
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,820
This guy.
Well that's what it is.

2373
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:58,821
It's like how feeble were I guess.
I guess it's societaly like women had it

2374
01:44:00,021 --> 01:44:02,150
so much worse in the seventies when 
these laws were made,

2375
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:06,230
but it seems like there needs to be some
kind of correction.

2376
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:10,730
Can't have it so that if a guy is 
married to a woman,

2377
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:15,380
he has been not married to her more than
he has been married to her.

2378
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:20,000
He was married to her for like 12 years.
He's been divorced for like 14,

2379
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:24,620
but it doesn't matter.
He stIll owes all that money.

2380
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,170
[inaudible] like because he,
they broke up,

2381
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:28,513
he has to pay her because they went past
12 years being married or whatever the 

2382
01:44:31,701 --> 01:44:35,900
number was his two pair for the rest of 
her time on earth.

2383
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,620
Like he,
he might not have any relationship to or

2384
01:44:39,621 --> 01:44:44,621
he is responsible for her survival 
forever and not just survival but living

2385
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:46,940
really well.
Like that's.

2386
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,650
I guess the question is how

2387
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,450
important were the women who've got 
these laws passed?

2388
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:57,720
Meaning what do you think you're doing 
that is entitling you to this money,

2389
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,190
and this goes for men now too because 
it's like,

2390
01:45:00,191 --> 01:45:01,024
well how good of a husband are you that 
you deserve half of her income for ever 

2391
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,203
clearly your that good?
Because she dIdn't work so there should 

2392
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:11,080
be a penalty right there.
There's not,

2393
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:13,960
I don't think they easily get half 
forever or whatever,

2394
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:18,160
but they get a giant chunk chunk and 
then a stipend.

2395
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:20,150
Yeah,
they get a monthly payment.

2396
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,793
It's just strange that someone could 
like people meet each other and then it 

2397
01:45:25,641 --> 01:45:27,650
doesn't work out anymore.
They like each other.

2398
01:45:27,651 --> 01:45:28,484
They spend time.
Then they don't want to spend time and 

2399
01:45:29,751 --> 01:45:30,584
when they don't want to spend time to 
all of the sudden legally obligate them 

2400
01:45:32,901 --> 01:45:33,734
to send money like this is not.
We're not talking about someone who by 

2401
01:45:37,701 --> 01:45:41,450
virtue of their relationship could no 
longer move her body,

2402
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:42,793
you know,
like with a man and a woman gets 

2403
01:45:43,431 --> 01:45:44,264
together,
the man has to pay because once a man 

2404
01:45:44,991 --> 01:45:46,850
starts fucking a woman,
they eventually go paralyzed.

2405
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:48,350
It's just how it works.
I mean,

2406
01:45:48,351 --> 01:45:49,910
if that was the nature,
yeah,

2407
01:45:49,911 --> 01:45:51,050
that was the case.
Well,

2408
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:51,913
yeah,
you have to take responsibility for 

2409
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:54,580
having sex because the man does 
something.

2410
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,280
Well,
by the way,

2411
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,140
guys would still claim like I didn't 
even.

2412
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:58,650
That wasn't even me,
man,

2413
01:45:59,010 --> 01:45:59,843
I fuck her harder.
You think I'm the only what you think I 

2414
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:05,420
could even fuck a woman in the book and 
into a vegetable.

2415
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:08,770
It's,
it's stealing,

2416
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:09,993
but it's also like you're cornering a 
person and forcing tHem to just get 

2417
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:19,270
thrust into this weird legal system.
So this weird legal system,

2418
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,560
it's pulling as this thing is spiraling 
down.

2419
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:26,470
The legal system is pulling money out of
it.

2420
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:27,663
So there's this,
there's this guy who's earning all this 

2421
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:31,384
money,
he works 12 hours every day is 

2422
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:37,000
constantly hustling and doing deals and 
this and that,

2423
01:46:37,001 --> 01:46:40,480
and he's putting it all together and 
while he's getting divorced,

2424
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:41,314
this woman,
they're going through the court system 

2425
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:44,793
and the court system and this two year 
fight is spinning this whole thing back 

2426
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:50,484
and forth and you,
you need to get more man because you 

2427
01:46:52,291 --> 01:46:53,124
have to consider his earning potential.
Is gonna increase over the next few 

2428
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:57,960
years and it wouldn't have happened if 
he wasn't your in around.

2429
01:46:58,150 --> 01:46:58,983
I mean your stability in the 
relationship is part of the reason why 

2430
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:01,794
he had the confidence to pursue these 
business deals and you should be 

2431
01:47:03,571 --> 01:47:04,140
compensated.

2432
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:04,973
Well,
that's what I wonder who were these 

2433
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:07,470
wonderful people that this lawyer.
No,

2434
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:08,304
I know,
but who was the woman that they could 

2435
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:11,010
hold up as well?
You did this,

2436
01:47:11,011 --> 01:47:12,310
therefore blahbity blah blah.

2437
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:15,290
Is that.
Well,

2438
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:17,900
first of all lawyers,
a lot of them get a percentage.

2439
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:19,640
Yeah.
So I think there's that.

2440
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:20,700
I think there is

2441
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,880
so.
And they make the laws.

2442
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,920
Yeah.
Well they definitely argue the law.

2443
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:24,763
If there's a strong Benefit to there 
being an extreme financial consequence 

2444
01:47:29,311 --> 01:47:30,144
for getting divorced,
a strong benefit to the people that 

2445
01:47:32,581 --> 01:47:35,580
profit from taking people to divorce 
court.

2446
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:40,910
So and by the way that benefit doesn't 
exist like the other way,

2447
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:41,963
like if if your,
if your lawyer saves you a fuck load of 

2448
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:45,834
money,
he doesn't get a percentage of what he 

2449
01:47:46,891 --> 01:47:48,270
saves you.
Yeah,

2450
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:49,403
but if the lawyer on the other side,
if they can figure out a way to get the 

2451
01:47:53,221 --> 01:47:56,820
court to rob you,
but again you got to give your wife $50,

2452
01:47:56,821 --> 01:48:00,960
million dollars or something like that.
Like that lawyer gets a chunk of that.

2453
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:05,090
Like he gets paid if he successfully 
incentivized for the.

2454
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:05,933
A lot of roommates to attack the rich 
guy through attack the man or the rich 

2455
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:10,980
woman.
The sound bar situation.

2456
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,353
But that's the way they get the money.
They don't get the money if you don't 

2457
01:48:15,211 --> 01:48:16,044
get penalized.
If you go into the case scott free and 

2458
01:48:20,011 --> 01:48:22,410
you know and go,
I'm not paying that bitch shit.

2459
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:26,900
This relationship is over.
And the jury says we agree mr.

2460
01:48:26,990 --> 01:48:27,630
Mr.
Brennan,

2461
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:30,120
you could walk and so you like,
that's right bitch.

2462
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:34,170
all you're doing is going to pay your 
lawyers hourly rates and they have no.

2463
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:38,370
There's no financial benefit to getting 
this done quickly.

2464
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:39,563
The financial benefit is to drag this 
fucking thing on for two years and then 

2465
01:48:42,361 --> 01:48:43,051
let you know,
hey,

2466
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:44,030
we got out of it,
you know,

2467
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:44,880
and then you realize

2468
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:48,150
a lot.
It's like mandatory minimum sentencing.

2469
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:49,023
Exactly.
Nothing they can really do unless you 

2470
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:54,980
have a prenup or you can do a,
a good,

2471
01:48:54,981 --> 01:48:57,720
a litigator to a or like a whatever.
The,

2472
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:58,643
the,
the where they sort of a mediator I 

2473
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:05,190
think you can get paid less than normal 
with the mediator.

2474
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:06,223
This also here's another situation,
like someone was talking to me about 

2475
01:49:09,711 --> 01:49:10,544
like the donald sterling type sugar 
daddy situation like and they were 

2476
01:49:13,821 --> 01:49:18,170
saying that it's awful that these men 
get preyed upon by these vicious women.

2477
01:49:18,171 --> 01:49:22,040
I'm like,
if you don't know that,

2478
01:49:22,041 --> 01:49:25,190
that girl is fucking you because your 
rich.

2479
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:26,083
If you have a $100,
billion dollars and you're 90 years old 

2480
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:32,780
and this girl tells you she loves you 
and she's with you all the time,

2481
01:49:32,781 --> 01:49:36,590
she's acting perfect.
You don't know that she wants that money

2482
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:39,020
and by the way,
if she's fucking you,

2483
01:49:39,021 --> 01:49:42,810
she deserves a lot of money at least as 
much as you're going to at least half.

2484
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:44,293
If you're a donald sterling type 
character and you've got some tWenty 

2485
01:49:46,731 --> 01:49:48,160
five old super hot

2486
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,610
stripper that you're laying pipe too,
you got to pay her.

2487
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:55,570
I'll lot because what she's doing is 
first of all,

2488
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:56,463
very difficult to do.
She's pretending to be attracted to you 

2489
01:49:58,451 --> 01:50:03,100
and you're disgusting and it's acting 
and basically surgery.

2490
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:08,860
It's the worst parts of acting and and 
and surgery.

2491
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:13,780
It's and it's super valuable to you.
Like if you're that old rich guy and you

2492
01:50:13,781 --> 01:50:18,700
have a 25 year old can get anything on 
earth except young girls,

2493
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:21,340
you gotta pay literally.
You can get anything you want.

2494
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:24,850
Like lamborghinis costs less.
They're more accessible to use it.

2495
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:25,703
That a,
that a young girl that's actually tried 

2496
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:28,660
to do a young girl that's actually 
trying to do,

2497
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,790
doesn't exists there.
Unicorns.

2498
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:32,500
Yes.
To leprechaun.

2499
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,230
Yes.
Mythical creatures.

2500
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:40,090
They do not exist.
Only in your imagination do exist if you

2501
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:40,924
keep her like constantly like covered in
diamonds and furs and whatever the fuck 

2502
01:50:46,391 --> 01:50:47,224
she needs and crocodile skin purses and 
chinese named shoes and whatever the 

2503
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:52,240
fuck you need.

2504
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:53,223
Do you believe that is,
if it is possible to be legitimately 

2505
01:50:56,951 --> 01:50:57,784
attracted to a donald sterling time?
I think that I think there are women 

2506
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:03,550
with big enough father issues that like,
yeah,

2507
01:51:03,551 --> 01:51:06,010
I'm legitimately attracted to him.
Like I would be a 20 year old.

2508
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:06,903
I would never say that.
Any like anything when it comes to 

2509
01:51:09,791 --> 01:51:11,440
attraction is impossible.
Yes,

2510
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:13,270
exactly.
Because there's chubby chasers,

2511
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:14,493
people that are into weird shit on 
people that are in a weird shit and 

2512
01:51:17,261 --> 01:51:20,230
there's a lot of women that find like 
older men hot.

2513
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:25,260
They liked the idea of like some white 
haired old dude laying dick num.

2514
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:28,090
Whoa.
Who knows man?

2515
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:30,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

2516
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:31,960
People like weird shit.
People like furries.

2517
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:34,480
There's a lot of people that are really 
into being a furry.

2518
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,150
I also have no problem with,
with,

2519
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:39,940
uh,
with prostitution on its face.

2520
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:41,890
Like I don't have like,
why do I care?

2521
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,650
Why is it okay to get a massage?
Not okay to get a hand job.

2522
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:45,910
RighT.
Exactly.

2523
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,350
Stupid.
Too good.

2524
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:49,230
Yeah.
Well it's weird.

2525
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:51,250
We're regulating sex.
Like were puritans.

2526
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:51,731
Yeah,
it's,

2527
01:51:51,731 --> 01:51:53,560
it's preposterous,
but it's also,

2528
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:55,953
you have to think if it was legal,
would it encourage or would it 

2529
01:51:58,481 --> 01:51:59,314
discourage the sex trade?
Like in terms of like you have to worry 

2530
01:52:02,741 --> 01:52:05,480
about like sex slaves and some are,
you know,

2531
01:52:05,490 --> 01:52:06,323
that's,
those are real issues and it's an issue 

2532
01:52:08,141 --> 01:52:08,974
that's completely unresolved because 
people on both sides of it claim their 

2533
01:52:12,311 --> 01:52:14,020
right and they both seem to have a good 
argument.

2534
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:14,943
And then also the argument is like,
isn't it possible that there's a big 

2535
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:21,400
fucking difference between a sex slave 
and a woman who like,

2536
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,530
maybe she's like a young girl living in 
New York city,

2537
01:52:23,531 --> 01:52:24,364
the rents are really high.
She decides to fuck some rich guys for 

2538
01:52:25,871 --> 01:52:26,704
money.
Like why is that worse than working at 

2539
01:52:29,411 --> 01:52:30,610
denny's?
Yeah,

2540
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:31,580
exactly.
Yeah,

2541
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:34,240
why is it worse?
I would go a step further,

2542
01:52:34,241 --> 01:52:37,060
which is,
let's say it is an emotional problem.

2543
01:52:37,061 --> 01:52:39,260
She was molested.
She wants to overbid,

2544
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,990
she has.
She gets whatever.

2545
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:45,620
That's no different than the reason most
people I know are showbiz

2546
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:50,390
and I don't see anyone picketing that.
That's true.

2547
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:53,300
It's based on an emotional stunt.
Right?

2548
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:55,750
And why is it sex?
Why sex?

2549
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,190
The only thing that you can't take money
for because jesus.

2550
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:03,340
that's really why.
Because jesus.

2551
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,881
Come on,
man.

2552
01:53:03,881 --> 01:53:04,714
That's a weird thing.
That sex is the only thing that you 

2553
01:53:06,341 --> 01:53:08,710
can't take money for ever.
You can't take money for it.

2554
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:10,900
Yeah,
but you can.

2555
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:14,680
You just got to be slick about it.
If you can't yet they dress it up.

2556
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:15,600
well,
like if a girl.

2557
01:53:15,601 --> 01:53:16,840
Is it dinner?
Yeah.

2558
01:53:16,841 --> 01:53:19,810
if a girl's your a sugar baby.
Yeah.

2559
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:21,550
It was a sugar based sugar.
no sugar.

2560
01:53:21,551 --> 01:53:23,510
It would be.
They would pay sugar.

2561
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:25,860
Sugar baby is your baby.
She was.

2562
01:53:25,870 --> 01:53:26,920
That was sugar daddy.
Yeah.

2563
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:29,560
Okay,
so whatever the girl's name,

2564
01:53:29,561 --> 01:53:30,394
whatever you would call her.
If she's dating some super billionaire 

2565
01:53:33,401 --> 01:53:37,420
type richard branson type character,
and he just gives her a salary,

2566
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:39,490
like what if he's,
she's got a salary.

2567
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:40,211
It's like,
look,

2568
01:53:40,211 --> 01:53:41,860
baby,
you get $5,000

2569
01:53:41,861 --> 01:53:44,170
a week to just go crazy with and give 
you a credit card.

2570
01:53:44,171 --> 01:53:46,030
It's got $50,000
limit.

2571
01:53:46,031 --> 01:53:48,490
Here's your fucking bentley.
There's the keys.

2572
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,560
You're all set.
woo.

2573
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,330
She's on the payroll.
Is that a prostitute?

2574
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,980
Uh,
I don't.

2575
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,823
Roger ailes.
The guy had fox news had that he did on 

2576
01:53:56,781 --> 01:53:57,614
staff.
Yeah.

2577
01:53:57,870 --> 01:54:01,190
And it was an open secret.
How many of you have had one?

2578
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,930
but then he would just harass everybody 
else.

2579
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:03,771
Really?
Uh,

2580
01:54:03,771 --> 01:54:05,180
yeah,
she was on staff for years.

2581
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:07,160
She was a researcher.
Researcher.

2582
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:08,780
Yeah.
Surely you must research.

2583
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:11,390
Maybe she must've done something 
worthwhile.

2584
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,860
Yeah,
definitely.

2585
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:15,570
Um,
at least something.

2586
01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:18,470
Some of write up a memo or something 
that.

2587
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:23,710
Is that a business partner or is that 
thing of like this thing of sex?

2588
01:54:24,081 --> 01:54:26,690
If you look at sex as this holy 
sacrament,

2589
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:28,183
than it is a.
If you look at every ejaculation as the 

2590
01:54:30,590 --> 01:54:33,680
holy sacrament,
Which the church would have you believe?

2591
01:54:33,681 --> 01:54:35,300
And then they get into government,
they make laws,

2592
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:36,440
whatever,
uh,

2593
01:54:36,441 --> 01:54:37,274
then then it's not legal,
but if you look at it like a milking or 

2594
01:54:42,171 --> 01:54:47,171
even a teeth cleaning or a haircut or 
anything that you need,

2595
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:50,210
any service that you need fairly 
regularly,

2596
01:54:51,330 --> 01:54:52,670
then it's,
then all,

2597
01:54:52,671 --> 01:54:55,160
all laws are like nonsense for the most 
part

2598
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:57,750
is part of the problem too is the,
uh,

2599
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:02,860
immediately accessible nature of the sex
is troublesome to some people because if

2600
01:55:03,141 --> 01:55:03,974
you have a relationship with someone 
who's basically fucking you for your 

2601
01:55:06,261 --> 01:55:09,830
money,
like at least you have this relationship

2602
01:55:09,831 --> 01:55:11,330
with them and you hang out with them for
long,

2603
01:55:11,331 --> 01:55:12,164
you have the time with them.
There's a lot of time that's not having 

2604
01:55:14,631 --> 01:55:15,464
sex.
So you actually have to be like friends 

2605
01:55:17,241 --> 01:55:17,841
with them.
Yeah.

2606
01:55:17,841 --> 01:55:20,780
And some sort of a way.
But the sex for money thing,

2607
01:55:20,781 --> 01:55:23,180
you just show up and you go,
yeah,

2608
01:55:23,181 --> 01:55:26,000
I'd like to pay for sex.
And then you go and you have the sex and

2609
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:26,840
you're like,
here's your money.

2610
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:27,703
Thanks.
Bye.

2611
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:30,290
Like people have a problem with the 
brevity of it.

2612
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:32,230
Like bullies don't even entangled.

2613
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:33,900
Yes.
Sue transactional.

2614
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:38,990
It's not,
it's a goes against god to their mind.

2615
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:40,800
It goes against god.
It's like,

2616
01:55:40,801 --> 01:55:44,190
that's not what god.
God wants you to sit and be bored.

2617
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:45,563
Yeah.
And go on a drive and help listen to 

2618
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:50,630
them.
They listen to your stupid stories.

2619
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:52,100
You listen to their stupid stories.
Yeah.

2620
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,320
Boy the fuck out of each other and 
comfort each other.

2621
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:55,670
Those are the rules.
Yeah.

2622
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:58,710
That's how we do things.
That's the fucking rules.

2623
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:03,080
You can't just be going in there all 
willy nilly getting paid money for sex.

2624
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:04,270
Yeah,
it's too.

2625
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:06,120
It's too.
And,

2626
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:09,850
and I guess because sex can create life,
you know,

2627
01:56:09,851 --> 01:56:11,650
the other thing is the pill is pretty 
new man.

2628
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:13,060
That's true too.
You know,

2629
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:14,253
abortion in the pillar,
both pretty new and the laws haven't 

2630
01:56:16,601 --> 01:56:18,010
really caught up well.
It's just

2631
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:19,183
you shouldn't be able to tell people 
what they can or can't do with their 

2632
01:56:22,701 --> 01:56:24,140
body.
That doesn't hurt anybody.

2633
01:56:24,141 --> 01:56:25,300
Other than that.
Yeah.

2634
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:28,100
Like you can't tell someone that they 
can play rugby.

2635
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:30,620
You can't say no,
you can't play rugby because rugby,

2636
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:32,750
they run into each other and you're 
going to get hurt.

2637
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:34,220
What do you think's going to happen in 
the nfl?

2638
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:40,150
I don'T know enough about it,
but what I do know is that there's a lot

2639
01:56:40,221 --> 01:56:44,210
of people that have some serious fucking
brain damage from playing football.

2640
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:45,590
Yeah,
there's no doubt about it.

2641
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:48,890
I've met people that have played for it,
um,

2642
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,870
that,
that are pretty open about it.

2643
01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:51,883
And I met like michael irvin.
I don't know what issues he's suffered 

2644
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:56,990
from it,
but that guy is sharp as a tack.

2645
01:56:57,530 --> 01:56:59,020
He's sharp as a tack.
When you talked to

2646
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,090
said it with cocaine,
is that what it is?

2647
01:57:01,091 --> 01:57:01,924
Balanced it out now?
Super intelligent or all of them are 

2648
01:57:07,001 --> 01:57:07,834
very smart.
It's,

2649
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,673
but it's,
it's a late onset tHing for a lot of 

2650
01:57:10,001 --> 01:57:11,140
guys.
Yeah,

2651
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:12,130
no,
for sure.

2652
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:13,053
I was talking to a guy who who plays and
he was saying like I said to them about 

2653
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:18,250
he plays whatever,
and I in him,

2654
01:57:18,251 --> 01:57:18,910
he goes,
yeah.

2655
01:57:18,910 --> 01:57:20,710
He's like,
it's not that hard.

2656
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:23,830
He goes on on,
it's authentic.

2657
01:57:23,831 --> 01:57:25,840
You have to remember more shit.
He goes,

2658
01:57:25,841 --> 01:57:30,841
but there are times on defense where 
I'll black out and not know what's going

2659
01:57:31,151 --> 01:57:33,520
on.
And you just keep playing,

2660
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,090
which just like jesus.
Yeah.

2661
01:57:37,091 --> 01:57:38,590
It's like,
all right,

2662
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:43,210
so is the blackout from memory or from.
It's from penn's impact sHe had.

2663
01:57:43,211 --> 01:57:44,160
it's christ.
Yeah.

2664
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:45,240
Cranial impact.
And I,

2665
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:49,060
it sounds like that's all of them.
He didn't say it like he said it.

2666
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:51,870
It completely like conversational 
[inaudible].

2667
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:52,890
He didn't say it like

2668
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:55,330
not a problem.
Mr.

2669
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:56,433
Oh man.
well I think they're used to so much 

2670
01:57:58,511 --> 01:57:59,800
trauma.
Yeah.

2671
01:57:59,850 --> 01:58:02,110
Well They used to running at each other 
full clip.

2672
01:58:02,830 --> 01:58:03,663
We don't think of it as being the most 
violent sport because the thing of mma 

2673
01:58:06,911 --> 01:58:09,700
is being more violent because you're 
actually trying to hit the person.

2674
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:12,490
That's the goal is try to hurt them with
your hands or your feet,

2675
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:16,210
but it's not nearly as powerful.
Someone running into you,

2676
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:20,320
like someone running in us.
that's a crazy amount of force into your

2677
01:58:20,321 --> 01:58:21,154
head with that.
I think that's where the league may be 

2678
01:58:23,171 --> 01:58:24,004
headed is no helmet.
sometimes they go flying through the 

2679
01:58:26,141 --> 01:58:26,974
air,
like you see guys get clipped and spin 

2680
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:31,570
and they spin or they disguise 
gravitate.

2681
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:36,190
They like take you like somebody just 
knocked a 200 plus pound man through the

2682
01:58:36,191 --> 01:58:37,420
air.
Like a pillow?

2683
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:38,920
Yeah,
like data.

2684
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:41,740
That's a car accident.
Yet that guy just hit by a truck.

2685
01:58:41,741 --> 01:58:42,130
He got hit

2686
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:46,360
by a 300 pound truck every play.
I think someone died.

2687
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:49,030
Not even beginning.
When I watch,

2688
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:50,230
when you watch it,
you go,

2689
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:51,070
oh,
that guy's dead.

2690
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:52,413
He's definitely dead.
I know I'd be dead if that happened to 

2691
01:58:54,101 --> 01:58:54,934
me,
but it goes to that weird thing where 

2692
01:58:56,351 --> 01:58:57,184
they have powerful,
more powerful fucking mandibles and 

2693
01:59:00,551 --> 01:59:04,420
weird muscles and like I think they 
build up a tolerance.

2694
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:05,343
I don't know about all that.
I think after awhile they all just go 

2695
01:59:08,231 --> 01:59:09,310
down.
What is this?

2696
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:13,000
Oh my god.
Yeah.

2697
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:14,283
Jesus.
Currently they're running at each other 

2698
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:17,140
run.
Here comes another guy.

2699
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:18,640
Lookout,
boom,

2700
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:20,200
boom.
Oh,

2701
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:21,160
that was just.
That's nothing.

2702
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:22,120
That's what I was going.
excellent.

2703
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:23,110
Play.
Oh,

2704
01:59:23,111 --> 01:59:24,190
that was good.
But look,

2705
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:26,440
there's something dope about it,
right?

2706
01:59:26,441 --> 01:59:28,540
Like with this guy.
Oh my god.

2707
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:30,280
He took a hard hit there and he kept 
going.

2708
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:31,473
It's completely elemental.
It's the most basic instincts in the 

2709
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:38,590
world is like running from a scary 
thing.

2710
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:40,100
Yeah,
there's fruit.

2711
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:42,370
There's that,
there's that element of it that works.

2712
01:59:42,371 --> 01:59:44,080
It's so primal that you're like,
god,

2713
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:45,160
it's so exciting.
It's,

2714
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:49,840
oh yeah,
that guy got lambasted.

2715
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:51,273
Yeah.
There's something about your running 

2716
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:54,880
from someone who's trying to harm you as
well.

2717
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:59,170
Like it's the most basic primal,
the monster,

2718
01:59:59,171 --> 02:00:01,120
the lion that whatever's coming to get 
you.

2719
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:02,283
And then there's the warfare element,
like the ground warfare of like 

2720
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:08,220
capturing the,
the taking the,

2721
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:11,140
the hill or whatever.
I get why it works.

2722
02:00:11,141 --> 02:00:13,000
I think they just got to get rid of the 
helmets.

2723
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:18,330
It's amazingly difficult to move your 
body the way these guys are doing.

2724
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,800
Yeah.
Did you watch the oj documentary?

2725
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:23,070
No.
One of the,

2726
02:00:23,150 --> 02:00:23,983
the big,
big takeawaYs is how good oj was a 

2727
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:32,080
football,
because you forget I'm,

2728
02:00:32,210 --> 02:00:34,120
I'm not old enough to remember playing 
football,

2729
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:38,200
so I heard he ran for 2000 yards,
but they,

2730
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:39,930
one of the episodes,
five,

2731
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:40,780
five parts.

2732
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:43,150
One of the parts.
It's basically just about that,

2733
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:45,070
about how nice he was.
Football.

2734
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:47,940
Wow.
And he did it in 14 games and,

2735
02:00:47,941 --> 02:00:50,350
and like,
he was like,

2736
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:52,510
it's crazy.
Well,

2737
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:55,480
you know,
one of his doctor said that if he had to

2738
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:59,080
rerun the trial today,
he would bring up ct.

2739
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:00,860
Yeah.
Which is,

2740
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,593
it's,
that's weird thing to do Because then 

2741
02:01:03,761 --> 02:01:06,310
they would have to admit that he 
actually did it because the trial.

2742
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:08,590
Yeah.
But can you let.

2743
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:09,463
Yeah.
Then it would have to make a law about 

2744
02:01:10,751 --> 02:01:11,920
that.
What's weird too,

2745
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:14,260
because we all know he's in jail for 
those murders.

2746
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:15,610
Yeah.
Thanks.

2747
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:17,470
No,
no.

2748
02:01:17,470 --> 02:01:19,690
They found a loophole and they're like,
yeah.

2749
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:23,230
Um,
I don't see any reason souvenirs.

2750
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:27,400
He's in jail for really the fifth part.
If you gotta watch it by the way,

2751
02:01:27,410 --> 02:01:31,740
like I demand it.
They demand it because it's,

2752
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:33,910
it recontextualized something that you 
think you know,

2753
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:35,010
everything about.
Right.

2754
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:36,970
Uh,
and it talks to mark,

2755
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:39,980
mark furman's justification for not 
being racist

2756
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,110
is a,
I'm not racist.

2757
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:45,380
when I was out on the street,
if somebody wanted to go with me,

2758
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:49,190
I'd fight them straight up.
And that's his reasoning.

2759
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:50,333
Like,
so therefore is therefore I'm not 

2760
02:01:53,421 --> 02:01:54,440
racist.
Were you just like,

2761
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:55,670
whew.
But at the same time,

2762
02:01:55,671 --> 02:01:57,950
you actually,
I kinda like mark from it after watching

2763
02:01:57,951 --> 02:02:00,880
the movie really kind of like,
I like meaning it,

2764
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:04,850
I understood his,
he makes sense to himself,

2765
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:08,100
you know what I mean?
Like you see his lodging guard.

2766
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:11,090
I know why he thinks the way he thinks.
Um,

2767
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:13,280
but uh,
not like I'm a Fan of the guy,

2768
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:15,200
but you know what I mean?
I hear you.

2769
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:16,730
I know what you're saying.
Um,

2770
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:18,590
but uh,
but yeah,

2771
02:02:18,591 --> 02:02:21,440
like it's an amazing movie and say could
you could,

2772
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:24,500
if,
if they did say with cta then we've kind

2773
02:02:24,501 --> 02:02:26,270
of lost the book.
It's like temporary insanity,

2774
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:27,280
right?
Well,

2775
02:02:27,281 --> 02:02:29,560
not really.
You'd have to,

2776
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:33,370
you'd have to really quantify what kind 
of effects he t hat on him.

2777
02:02:33,690 --> 02:02:35,440
Like you'd have to be able to figure it 
out.

2778
02:02:35,441 --> 02:02:37,060
Like,
is it responsible for you?

2779
02:02:37,061 --> 02:02:37,691
Go on,
man.

2780
02:02:37,691 --> 02:02:41,470
I don't know.
Should I take that from math thing?

2781
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:43,540
I'm thinking about doing this too.
Or is it,

2782
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:44,823
is it completelY responsible?
Like how much of the cte is responsible 

2783
02:02:47,741 --> 02:02:48,574
for your decision making?

2784
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:49,843
Well,
there are guys that save a blackout 

2785
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:52,833
behaviorally

2786
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:55,740
blackout and you have to believe him,
you know,

2787
02:02:55,741 --> 02:02:58,760
you have to think that there's,
there's for sure are going to be some,

2788
02:02:58,761 --> 02:02:59,594
some severe neurological implications of
getting smashed in the head over and 

2789
02:03:04,351 --> 02:03:06,660
over again by the big gigantic dudes 
like that.

2790
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:10,740
You've got an cte for a bunch of 
concussions.

2791
02:03:10,741 --> 02:03:11,580
Right?
For sure.

2792
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:15,050
What were the vomiting and grogginess 
and shit?

2793
02:03:15,070 --> 02:03:15,903
Man,
man,

2794
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:16,913
I don't know.
I,

2795
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:17,853
I do remember a sparring sessions,
just sparring sessions where I got mY 

2796
02:03:21,331 --> 02:03:22,164
bell rang and I'd go home and lay in bed
and then my fucking head would be 

2797
02:03:25,261 --> 02:03:28,200
throbbing and aching.
Just ball ball.

2798
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:29,063
Yeah.
I'm just sitting with every heartbeat 

2799
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:31,163
and you think I'm.
What am I doing with my parrain if 

2800
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,940
that's what I was thinking.
Yeah.

2801
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:37,230
I come to sun even any money in this?
I'm like,

2802
02:03:37,231 --> 02:03:38,910
I'm getting punched in the head all the 
time.

2803
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:39,863
Yeah.
As I was doing a lot of sparring and 

2804
02:03:43,291 --> 02:03:44,850
wearing headgear?
No.

2805
02:03:44,910 --> 02:03:46,200
Oh god,
no.

2806
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:48,270
Why gear?
I couldn't see kicks coming.

2807
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:50,640
I didn't like headgear.
Headgears weird.

2808
02:03:50,641 --> 02:03:53,180
When you throw in kicks with other guys 
guys wearing them,

2809
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:55,800
a lot of ufc fighters were.
A lot of people don't.

2810
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:57,960
I?
I had a problem with them.

2811
02:03:57,961 --> 02:03:59,460
I tried to were the ones that were the.

2812
02:03:59,670 --> 02:04:02,370
There's a bar that goes across your face
to protect your nose.

2813
02:04:02,470 --> 02:04:04,230
That's the worst.
You can't see shit.

2814
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,270
I had to,
for me,

2815
02:04:06,271 --> 02:04:07,104
I had to go like the Mike Tyson style,
which is one that Mike Tyson used to 

2816
02:04:10,051 --> 02:04:12,810
where where he,
a lot of his face was exposed.

2817
02:04:12,811 --> 02:04:13,644
A lot of people kind of criticized it 
because they said that he was more open 

2818
02:04:15,181 --> 02:04:17,670
to cuts and there's a reason why they 
had those big cheek,

2819
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:20,640
but you can't see left and right.
Like peripherals,

2820
02:04:20,910 --> 02:04:21,743
like if you're,
if you're sparring a guy and he throws 

2821
02:04:22,801 --> 02:04:23,634
like real wide stuff on you especially 
kicks guys who sneak kicks around your 

2822
02:04:27,901 --> 02:04:28,734
shoulder.
Like you literally don't see them until 

2823
02:04:30,001 --> 02:04:32,940
they're on your neck and it's not good.
I didn't like it.

2824
02:04:32,941 --> 02:04:36,060
I was like,
I'd rather get hit with no head gear on.

2825
02:04:36,150 --> 02:04:37,370
Well then you have a chance.
Yeah.

2826
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:37,980
I feel

2827
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,620
like I can move with it better.
You can still,

2828
02:04:40,621 --> 02:04:45,300
you're still in a bad spot,
but the real Issue is cuts because a lot

2829
02:04:45,301 --> 02:04:48,270
of guys get cut and sparring.
You might collide heads,

2830
02:04:48,271 --> 02:04:50,880
you might an elbow or something like 
that and when that does happen,

2831
02:04:50,881 --> 02:04:51,714
the problem is then it could delay a 
fight and if you're an mma fighter and 

2832
02:04:55,021 --> 02:04:55,854
you're training for it,
it's probably pretty smart to wear 

2833
02:04:57,340 --> 02:04:58,173
headgear,
but it doesn't really protect your head 

2834
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:01,320
that much.
In fact,

2835
02:05:01,321 --> 02:05:02,154
there's an argument that it acts as more
of a fulcrum point because the headgear 

2836
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:08,220
makes your head larger so you can like.
Yeah,

2837
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:09,690
that's interesting.
Wait and everything.

2838
02:05:09,691 --> 02:05:11,790
It actually can make your head move 
more.

2839
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:14,130
well,
it's funny what happens to your brain,

2840
02:05:14,370 --> 02:05:17,280
which is,
it just goes flying against your skull.

2841
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:21,930
There's nothing technical about it.
It just goes like bullies.

2842
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:22,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

2843
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:26,940
And it can't maintain signal while 
that's going on.

2844
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,190
He can't maintain order and especially 
if you get hit in the base of your head,

2845
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:35,660
like one of the scariest kicks,
the can get hit with it.

2846
02:05:35,661 --> 02:05:37,770
A lot of guys get hit with his neck 
kicks,

2847
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:41,070
you get necked and uh,
when you get neck kicked,

2848
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:44,310
guys go down like they got shot.
Like a,

2849
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:46,210
there's a because it,
because of what,

2850
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:47,040
what,
what,

2851
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,620
what gets hurt?
It just shut your brain off.

2852
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:51,300
Uh oh.
It's like this thing.

2853
02:05:51,301 --> 02:05:52,680
That's the shit.
No,

2854
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:57,300
it's the shin slams basically against 
the base of your skull.

2855
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,433
It's like really?
The back of the sheet is basically a 

2856
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:00,880
switchblade.
Yeah,

2857
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:06,050
it's under here.
Google this ernesto hoost kaos.

2858
02:06:06,571 --> 02:06:07,404
Maury smith.
Maurice with smith is a good friend of 

2859
02:06:09,931 --> 02:06:12,960
mine and he's a former ufc heavyweight 
champion.

2860
02:06:12,961 --> 02:06:14,700
Former world,
more thaI fighter,

2861
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:16,260
more more time champion.

2862
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:20,370
He's a bad motherfucker,
but he fought this guy who's just one of

2863
02:06:20,371 --> 02:06:22,170
the greatest of all time.
Ernesto hoost.

2864
02:06:22,171 --> 02:06:26,040
And he got caught with a kick to his 
neck and I knew how tough more.

2865
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:27,900
He says,
I knew how good of a fighter he is.

2866
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:32,850
So when you see a guy who's at the level
that maurice's watch this boat,

2867
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:38,300
see how he threw that over the top of 
his head and it just shut maurice off.

2868
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:39,413
Look at this.
He slides on the outside and he lifts 

2869
02:06:42,361 --> 02:06:46,080
his head up,
ellipses a foot up brother and goes over

2870
02:06:46,081 --> 02:06:50,130
the shoulder or maurice doesn't even see
it coming until it's already too late.

2871
02:06:50,210 --> 02:06:53,460
It hits the back of his head.
It's crazy and that's his foot,

2872
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:55,470
which hasn't even been hard.
Well,

2873
02:06:55,471 --> 02:06:57,510
it's still hard.
It's ernesto hoost foot,

2874
02:06:57,511 --> 02:07:00,240
but it could be way worse.
You're right.

2875
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:03,950
If it was a little bit further back then
it would have been over,

2876
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,093
but a lot of guys knock guys out dead 
coal that's in a punch to the back of 

2877
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:09,360
the head and boxing.

2878
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,193
Right.
But you can kick guys and when you've 

2879
02:07:11,841 --> 02:07:12,674
landed,
oftentimes lands in the back of the 

2880
02:07:13,771 --> 02:07:14,604
head.
No one ever thinks is anything wrong 

2881
02:07:15,301 --> 02:07:16,710
with it.
It's real weird.

2882
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:19,300
It's a super gray so you can't punch In 
mma.

2883
02:07:19,301 --> 02:07:21,480
You cannot punch the back of the neck 
and head,

2884
02:07:21,481 --> 02:07:23,010
but you can't.
Exactly.

2885
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:25,110
That's very odd.
It's so odd.

2886
02:07:25,111 --> 02:07:25,561
Well,
it's a.

2887
02:07:25,561 --> 02:07:30,420
It's an issue with kickboxing as well 
because some of the best techniques land

2888
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:31,283
on the back of the head,
like here's another one that does all 

2889
02:07:32,791 --> 02:07:35,250
the time too.
We'll kicks like someone will throw,

2890
02:07:35,251 --> 02:07:36,370
we'll kick like a spinning

2891
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:40,030
heel kick and they'll catch a guy boom 
right on the back of the hat.

2892
02:07:40,031 --> 02:07:44,980
It happens all the time and that's 
technically it's an illegal place to hit

2893
02:07:44,981 --> 02:07:48,460
someone,
but because head kicks are like,

2894
02:07:49,090 --> 02:07:53,020
that's sort of like the ultimate 
striking weapon I give you knock someone

2895
02:07:53,021 --> 02:07:53,854
out,
like knocking someone out with a head 

2896
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:55,114
kick because like the ultimate striking 
mountain because it's everything we 

2897
02:07:57,821 --> 02:08:00,040
always wanted to see in karate movies,
you know,

2898
02:08:00,041 --> 02:08:00,874
so because of that is so encouraged to 
like push the guy just because it's so 

2899
02:08:07,271 --> 02:08:09,310
encouraged.
We don't think about the implications of

2900
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:10,173
kicking someone in the back of the head,
which is probably way worse than 

2901
02:08:12,371 --> 02:08:14,290
punching someone in the back of the 
head.

2902
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:17,950
But it happenS all the time and 
kickboxing and all the time in mma.

2903
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:20,770
It's one of those weird things where 
nobody wants to talk about it and,

2904
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:22,330
but everybody knows that's the case.

2905
02:08:22,510 --> 02:08:23,343
You're kicking,
you're kicking a guy on a totally 

2906
02:08:24,731 --> 02:08:25,564
illegal spot,
but you're not trying how double the 

2907
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:29,680
standard.
They all know it.

2908
02:08:29,710 --> 02:08:31,450
They all know it for sure.
Everybody knows that,

2909
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:32,313
especially everybody's been hit by one 
of those are hinton's hit somebody with 

2910
02:08:34,721 --> 02:08:36,130
one of those.
You know where you're hitting them.

2911
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:38,110
a lot of times you're hitting the back 
of the head.

2912
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:39,003
If you're aware of can you punch?
If someone you can punch the all the 

2913
02:08:41,531 --> 02:08:43,960
back all over the body.
You can punch the legs,

2914
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:47,530
you can punch the groin,
but you can punch somebody in the ass.

2915
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:50,470
You can punch in the back,
you can punch him in the back.

2916
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:53,560
You can't punch,
punch above the elbow.

2917
02:08:53,561 --> 02:08:55,780
Strike the spine.
There's some weird rules there.

2918
02:08:55,781 --> 02:08:57,730
Actually,
we were talking about this yesterday.

2919
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:58,953
Jamie and I looked up there.
Jamie said they came up with some new 

2920
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:05,140
rules and one of them involves knees to 
the head to a downed opponent.

2921
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:06,273
Now a downed opponent means you have to 
have both hands down on the mat and 

2922
02:09:10,031 --> 02:09:11,740
they're.
Your palm has to be flat.

2923
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:16,450
You can't have just one.
if you have one hand up,

2924
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:17,433
they can see you in the face,
so that's not a downed opponent because 

2925
02:09:20,741 --> 02:09:21,574
there's a lot of people that were 
criticizing this down to potent thing 

2926
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:25,053
because people were sort of what they 
would call gaming the system where you 

2927
02:09:27,761 --> 02:09:31,060
would lean down,
you just touch your hand on the ground,

2928
02:09:31,061 --> 02:09:33,190
like as if it's safe and then the guy 
can't hit you,

2929
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:35,470
so that's how you're.
You're getting out of exchanging.

2930
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:36,573
Got it.
Instead of you're totally capable of 

2931
02:09:37,961 --> 02:09:40,600
standing up or totally capable of 
covering up a.

2932
02:09:40,601 --> 02:09:41,434
You can make your choice like you got to
this position or he got you to this 

2933
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:46,300
position.
It's advantageous to feeLs like a fairly

2934
02:09:46,301 --> 02:09:47,410
standard position.

2935
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:48,730
Yeah,
It happens all the time,

2936
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:53,760
but the issue becomes if you are 
incapable of getting out of the way,

2937
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:57,070
should you be able to nea guy in the 
head because some guys like when they're

2938
02:09:57,071 --> 02:09:58,360
down like that,
it's like,

2939
02:09:58,361 --> 02:09:59,194
well that's a devastating maneuver to 
nea guy and ahead when they're in that 

2940
02:10:01,481 --> 02:10:04,210
position.
So they for for good reason,

2941
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:05,253
they wanted to decide when it should be 
legal because there's other 

2942
02:10:07,781 --> 02:10:08,614
organizations.
We could do crazy stuff like stomping 

2943
02:10:10,061 --> 02:10:10,894
people.
You can stomp people like stomped their 

2944
02:10:13,031 --> 02:10:16,120
head in certain organization.
So that was a big one in pride.

2945
02:10:16,121 --> 02:10:18,250
You could soccer kick guys and stomp 
them,

2946
02:10:19,450 --> 02:10:22,300
but oddly enough,
they didn't allow elbows on the ground.

2947
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:24,243
That doesn't.
They felt elbows on the ground were 

2948
02:10:25,001 --> 02:10:28,360
barbaric or something.
They had a line.

2949
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:33,010
That's everybody's.
People are so crazy with their lines.

2950
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,070
They draw.
Can I pee

2951
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:35,000
real quick?
Fuck yeah.

2952
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:37,120
That's the part where I have to go to 
the bathroom.

2953
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:40,340
You drinking that delicious pellgrino I 
got into bubbly water lately.

2954
02:10:40,341 --> 02:10:42,350
Jamie.
I hate to admit it.

2955
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:44,480
I like,
I like sparkling water now.

2956
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:47,120
I used to think there's no nutritional 
benefits.

2957
02:10:47,121 --> 02:10:49,730
I had it in my head that like regular 
water was better for you.

2958
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:53,790
Was that your thing?
Yeah.

2959
02:10:54,190 --> 02:10:55,200
Uh,
the uh,

2960
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:57,560
keepers of the ark of the covenant.
I found it.

2961
02:10:57,570 --> 02:10:58,403
I looked up,
I found something where it said that 

2962
02:10:59,731 --> 02:11:03,360
there was a report of one of them having
milky cataracts and a description,

2963
02:11:03,361 --> 02:11:05,880
but it's not all of them from what I'm 
reading.

2964
02:11:06,130 --> 02:11:11,130
Goddammit graham hancock christians in 
Ethiopia have long claim to have the ark

2965
02:11:13,661 --> 02:11:15,490
of the covenant.
A reporter investigated.

2966
02:11:15,850 --> 02:11:20,710
Go down to the very last chapter or the 
very last paragraph rather.

2967
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:24,700
See what the fuck they said.
Yeah.

2968
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,380
See,
that's the thing about these things.

2969
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:29,890
The final moments of any search,
I could not judge whether the ark of the

2970
02:11:29,891 --> 02:11:32,740
covenant truly rested inside the 
nondescript chapel.

2971
02:11:32,741 --> 02:11:37,741
Perhaps ma menelIk manilex traveling 
companions did take it and spirited home

2972
02:11:40,421 --> 02:11:42,720
to Ethiopia.
Perhaps its origins here.

2973
02:11:42,730 --> 02:11:44,710
Stem from the tail spun by.
So nothing.

2974
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:45,610
He's got no evidence.

2975
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:47,583
Yeah,
there's apparently also a storm and 

2976
02:11:48,910 --> 02:11:51,490
leaky roof that was going to make a move
it in 2012.

2977
02:11:51,491 --> 02:11:53,110
But I didn't find anything that said 
that,

2978
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:55,690
whether it was seen or not.
And that,

2979
02:11:55,691 --> 02:11:56,830
uh,
the battery,

2980
02:11:56,831 --> 02:12:01,660
the baghdad battery was supposedly also 
not a battery that think it was used for

2981
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:04,630
electroplating statues with gold and 
silver.

2982
02:12:04,690 --> 02:12:05,291
Oh,
that makes sense.

2983
02:12:05,291 --> 02:12:06,520
There was a little bit of a charge in 
there,

2984
02:12:06,521 --> 02:12:09,400
but not enough to be considered a 
battery thing.

2985
02:12:09,401 --> 02:12:10,031
Yeah.
Oh.

2986
02:12:10,031 --> 02:12:11,800
So it was just a way they kind of made 
paint.

2987
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:14,650
Yeah,
sorta started cover stuff,

2988
02:12:14,651 --> 02:12:15,484
so I think they had a hypothesIs that it
would spin it in there and it would 

2989
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:19,570
create a bond

2990
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:22,970
to the stone or whatever they were.
That makes sense too.

2991
02:12:23,130 --> 02:12:25,800
So that's the way they would use it on 
statues and stuff.

2992
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:30,850
That's fucking amazing.
God damn it was so cool.

2993
02:12:30,851 --> 02:12:31,684
When you think of how these people had 
to use a little monkey brains to invent 

2994
02:12:36,791 --> 02:12:41,230
the first wheel or did vent pottery,
like the people that.

2995
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:43,210
I mean,
when did theY figure out pottery?

2996
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:48,450
So if you had a guess,
let's guess,

2997
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,880
what do you think?
5,000

2998
02:12:50,881 --> 02:12:52,890
bc.
Four after a fire,

2999
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:55,410
not fire after fire.
They just figured out what he get.

3000
02:12:55,411 --> 02:12:57,420
Hardened stuff stuff.
probably just accidentally.

3001
02:12:57,450 --> 02:13:00,060
Let's google it.
I say a 5,000

3002
02:13:00,061 --> 02:13:02,330
bc.
No,

3003
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:06,740
because that doesn't make any sense 
because it's like qumran or not qumran.

3004
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:10,640
Samira samira was before that.
$6,000.

3005
02:13:10,641 --> 02:13:12,290
4,000
potter's wheel though.

3006
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:13,251
Oh,
oh,

3007
02:13:13,251 --> 02:13:14,084
okay.
This potter's wheel was invented in 

3008
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:19,610
mesopotamia sometime in between 6,000
and 4,000.

3009
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:22,280
Does that say 4,000,
4,000

3010
02:13:22,281 --> 02:13:26,510
bc period.
You guys going over ancient inventions?

3011
02:13:26,511 --> 02:13:27,344
What's going on?
We're trying to figure out when they 

3012
02:13:28,701 --> 02:13:30,620
invented pottery.
oh,

3013
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:31,473
that has to

3014
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:35,100
baghdad battery that we were looking at 
earlier.

3015
02:13:35,101 --> 02:13:35,934
Apparently jamie found out that it 
might've been used to electroplate gold 

3016
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:40,650
like that.
It created a small charge,

3017
02:13:40,651 --> 02:13:41,484
but really wasn't a battery.
It was just used to make like almost 

3018
02:13:43,741 --> 02:13:47,560
like electric paint and then we're 
trying to figure out.

3019
02:13:47,561 --> 02:13:48,001
Well,
I was like,

3020
02:13:48,001 --> 02:13:49,530
how fucking cool is that?
Like how,

3021
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:50,993
how crazy were the first people,
the first monkey people from like a 

3022
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,200
million years ago at wherever I was,
I figured out how to make a flint knife.

3023
02:13:58,650 --> 02:13:59,483
You know the first people that figured 
out pottery if figured out how to roll 

3024
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:04,830
dirt and light it on fire.

3025
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:07,820
There's a duncan brought up as last 
appearance.

3026
02:14:07,821 --> 02:14:10,100
Not as most recent one.
There's a whole Youtube channel.

3027
02:14:10,101 --> 02:14:10,934
have a guy that does this.
He makes tons of different experiments 

3028
02:14:14,450 --> 02:14:17,390
and trying out primitive technologies 
and processes.

3029
02:14:17,391 --> 02:14:18,224
He doesn't talk at all.
I'm going to look it up so I can find 

3030
02:14:19,461 --> 02:14:21,530
out what it's called,
but It just made a really cool one where

3031
02:14:21,531 --> 02:14:26,000
he pulled little pieces of metal out of 
iron ore and he had to.

3032
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:31,070
He invented this way to get his flame 
hotter using some sort of thing.

3033
02:14:31,071 --> 02:14:33,770
He and he shows you make he makes.
The whole thing was really,

3034
02:14:33,771 --> 02:14:34,604
really cool.
Shit.

3035
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:36,253
Just amazing.
When You think of how long ago was it 

3036
02:14:38,861 --> 02:14:39,281
felt?
Well,

3037
02:14:39,281 --> 02:14:42,130
we don't even know what it was.
It's someone first invented pottery.

3038
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:45,940
That potter's wheel was at least 6,000
or at least 4,000

3039
02:14:45,941 --> 02:14:46,500
bc.

3040
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:47,333
There's also the idea that people 
invented it and it just never got out 

3041
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:51,960
before that.
You know what I mean?

3042
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:53,303
Two thousand years earlier.
Maybe somebody invents it and then he 

3043
02:14:54,631 --> 02:14:57,270
just never.
No one ever leaves that village.

3044
02:14:57,370 --> 02:14:58,800
Hm.
yeah.

3045
02:14:58,801 --> 02:15:00,030
That,
that definitely could be it.

3046
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,593
So what does this gentleman doing?
Primitive technologies that youtube 

3047
02:15:03,671 --> 02:15:05,020
channels.
So it shows them make.

3048
02:15:05,021 --> 02:15:06,730
He's making a forge blower.

3049
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:11,680
What's funny is he has cave hands.
Looks like the original.

3050
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:14,060
This dude is one of,
uh,

3051
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,053
there's a bunch of people now that are 
experts in ancient ways of living like 

3052
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:24,450
ancient archery in ancient,
like house building and shit.

3053
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:26,633
It's really weird.
Will there's something cool that I was 

3054
02:15:30,031 --> 02:15:31,140
going to say.
Uh,

3055
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,510
you meditate at all.
Yeah.

3056
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:35,310
Well,
sort of in the tank.

3057
02:15:35,311 --> 02:15:36,590
I do.
Um,

3058
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:42,050
so I went on a,
a seven day silent meditation retreat.

3059
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:45,120
Whoa.
Yeah,

3060
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:46,700
no talking,
no talking.

3061
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:48,420
Well,
It ended up being like,

3062
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:53,730
we talked a for three minutes,
starting day three,

3063
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:57,010
we'd talk for three minutes a day.
Wow.

3064
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:00,810
But I got to say it was at,
on the first day.

3065
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:04,290
I'm not kidding.
I fucking cried.

3066
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:05,363
Oh my god.
Dude.

3067
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:08,580
No talking.
No television,

3068
02:16:08,581 --> 02:16:10,080
no computer,
no phone.

3069
02:16:10,650 --> 02:16:13,080
Here's the worst part.
No reading,

3070
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:14,063
no writing,
just meditating and eating and whatever 

3071
02:16:18,001 --> 02:16:19,860
and being like,
being in this village thing.

3072
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:21,210
Whoa.
Um,

3073
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:22,073
but,
uh,

3074
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:23,820
this video is fucking really cool.

3075
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:26,510
This video is dope as fuck.
This guy made these,

3076
02:16:26,511 --> 02:16:30,610
uh,
like made like a little furnace blower

3077
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:31,683
out of this pottery thing with a wheel 
inside of it that he would spin and it 

3078
02:16:35,591 --> 02:16:38,670
would blow air with fire.
And so yeah,

3079
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:39,513
it's like you got like a handmade fan 
and he does it by moving it around with 

3080
02:16:43,361 --> 02:16:44,194
his fingers and now he's making a rope 
and twine so he could pull it probably 

3081
02:16:48,161 --> 02:16:48,910
like,
whoa.

3082
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:52,240
Yeah.
And what he's been able to do with it as

3083
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:55,270
stoked as fire up in this incredible 
way.

3084
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:56,553
I mean it's just blazing and it's all 
from the wind that is blowing into it 

3085
02:17:01,241 --> 02:17:02,074
with this crazy invention.
And this is some shit that people did 

3086
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:06,170
thousands of years ago or something.
Yeah,

3087
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:09,860
they were quoted,
watson,

3088
02:17:09,870 --> 02:17:10,703
we problem solve all these things.
He just keeps happening is first early 

3089
02:17:13,341 --> 02:17:14,174
videos.
He makes us hut that's behind them and 

3090
02:17:15,291 --> 02:17:16,124
it's just out of nowhere.
He was just in the middle of the forest 

3091
02:17:17,331 --> 02:17:21,110
and he goes and he makes his little 
bricks and he hates him up in a killing.

3092
02:17:21,111 --> 02:17:25,220
He made and he started wIth no fire and 
yeah,

3093
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:26,650
he's built all this stuff.
It's pretty

3094
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:28,320
cool.
Watch his wild though.

3095
02:17:28,321 --> 02:17:31,970
He's doing all this clay and shit.
There's a bunch.

3096
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:34,630
Is that.
Don't eat that.

3097
02:17:36,030 --> 02:17:37,620
What the fuck is he making,
man?

3098
02:17:37,710 --> 02:17:40,900
Getting the carbon and putting it in 
with the iron ore and he puts it in the,

3099
02:17:40,901 --> 02:17:41,970
in the,
in the,

3100
02:17:41,971 --> 02:17:42,451
uh.
Oh,

3101
02:17:42,451 --> 02:17:43,950
that's right.
He's going to make metal.

3102
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:44,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

3103
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:49,650
This is insane.
This is insane.

3104
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:51,000
If you make a call with you,
megan.

3105
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:52,590
Yeah,
he's gonna.

3106
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:57,290
Make metal.
This is how people did it,

3107
02:17:57,291 --> 02:17:58,280
man.
It's what's,

3108
02:17:58,330 --> 02:17:59,163
what's really crazy is someone had to 
figure out how to take all the elements 

3109
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:06,290
that are involved with the cameras about
fire.

3110
02:18:06,890 --> 02:18:07,520
I know,
right?

3111
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:10,130
This is,
this is why it looks like fake fire.

3112
02:18:11,210 --> 02:18:13,220
It does.
It looks like some cgi fire.

3113
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,533
This is all cia bullshit.
This is preparing us for the zombie 

3114
02:18:18,441 --> 02:18:19,274
apocalypse.
They're teaching us when the grid goes 

3115
02:18:22,161 --> 02:18:23,540
down.
How to make our own fire.

3116
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:25,781
Uh,
yeah.

3117
02:18:25,781 --> 02:18:29,670
So silent meditation retreat.
So wake up at a.

3118
02:18:29,710 --> 02:18:31,840
So day one I cried,
cried.

3119
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:33,310
Chris straight up.
Cried.

3120
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:35,250
Wow.
From like,

3121
02:18:35,310 --> 02:18:37,120
it's,
it feels like you're dead.

3122
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:39,700
You can't talk to anyone,
you know.

3123
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,680
Whoa.
And you can't get online,

3124
02:18:41,681 --> 02:18:42,410
you can't read,
you can't,

3125
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:45,610
you literally are like an apparition 
years walking around like a ghost.

3126
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:47,943
And,
but day three and four were two of the 

3127
02:18:50,830 --> 02:18:51,960
best days of my life.
Really?

3128
02:18:51,961 --> 02:18:52,794
Yeah.
Because all you're doing is meditating 

3129
02:18:54,431 --> 02:18:56,000
and meditation,
uh,

3130
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:58,380
brings on,
like to stimulate your brain,

3131
02:18:58,400 --> 02:18:59,230
makes you happy.
Like,

3132
02:18:59,230 --> 02:19:03,240
proven like monks take mris and they 
just look like they,

3133
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:05,000
they don't stress,
they have high,

3134
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:06,173
uh,
incredibly low levels of cortisol and 

3135
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:08,710
low,
very high levels of,

3136
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:09,603
of,
uh,

3137
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:12,970
of positive chemicals.
Um,

3138
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:16,030
so you just,
I would meditate nine hours a day

3139
02:19:17,090 --> 02:19:18,360
and.
Yeah,

3140
02:19:18,361 --> 02:19:21,860
and you just end up like.
And the other thing I would do because I

3141
02:19:21,861 --> 02:19:23,790
couldn't,
uh,

3142
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:26,540
no one could talk and I didn't really 
need to talk to anybody.

3143
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:31,820
I would smile all day.
So if you smile all day,

3144
02:19:32,390 --> 02:19:33,223
it tricks your brain into thinking 
you're happy because your brain doesn't 

3145
02:19:35,631 --> 02:19:37,100
know.
Like if your muscles are just,

3146
02:19:37,220 --> 02:19:38,390
they go,
I guess we're happy.

3147
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:41,000
So everybody act happy.
Uh,

3148
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:43,760
it can work backward.
The gun and paul ekman rid of book.

3149
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:45,950
Uh,
but it was,

3150
02:19:45,951 --> 02:19:47,330
yeah,
it was an amazing experience.

3151
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:48,600
Amazing.
I didn't know.

3152
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:50,240
What I realized is I came away with 
like,

3153
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:55,520
I'm so overstimulated at home with 
podcasts,

3154
02:19:55,521 --> 02:19:57,050
television shows,
computers,

3155
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:57,913
fucking phones,
texting constantly that it's made me a 

3156
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:04,370
really cut back on everything in a way 
that's very,

3157
02:20:04,371 --> 02:20:06,200
very positive I think.
Wow.

3158
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:08,330
Yeah.
CAuse the dude I wake up,

3159
02:20:08,390 --> 02:20:09,223
I don't,
most people wake up and you immediately 

3160
02:20:10,701 --> 02:20:14,650
like mainline information or technology 
like,

3161
02:20:15,070 --> 02:20:16,490
like I used to do when I smoke 
cigarettes,

3162
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:17,324
I'd wake up and have for cigarettes and 
drink coffee and just like shocked my 

3163
02:20:20,001 --> 02:20:24,650
body and I feel like it was awful and I 
feel like that's what I do now.

3164
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:26,390
All right.
What I used to do with technology,

3165
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:29,070
just like constantly turn my phone on to
a tax,

3166
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:31,310
going New York times going this thing 
going,

3167
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:34,070
eh,
I go on reddit going all these places.

3168
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:36,650
And it wasn't make,
it was just stressing me out.

3169
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,450
Yeah.
It doesn't make you feel good.

3170
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:42,170
Yeah.
but that's hard in that weird thing that

3171
02:20:42,171 --> 02:20:44,450
we all do.
Constantly were acknowledged.

3172
02:20:44,451 --> 02:20:45,830
Like it doesn't make me feel good.

3173
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:48,320
Yeah.
We need discipline.

3174
02:20:48,530 --> 02:20:49,363
That's a big,
big factor in managing the electronic 

3175
02:20:52,581 --> 02:20:55,940
world is discipline the discipline and 
I'll watch too much television.

3176
02:20:55,970 --> 02:20:57,990
Yep.
Discipline and not fuck around you.

3177
02:20:57,991 --> 02:20:59,500
Phone two months.
It did discipline.

3178
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:02,030
Did not play games too much [inaudible] 
you can,

3179
02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:06,980
you can get lurched in the word lurched 
sure minutes.

3180
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:09,830
Yeah.
It's not really the right word.

3181
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:15,050
It's probably not ultimately beneficial,
right?

3182
02:21:15,051 --> 02:21:17,630
I mean like certain amount of balance to
it is really good,

3183
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:18,913
but it's so addicting.

3184
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:22,540
We should have like one person,
like a responsible guy.

3185
02:21:22,541 --> 02:21:26,400
Like will you look up like The world 
should have that where it's like,

3186
02:21:26,401 --> 02:21:27,550
hey,
look up when,

3187
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:28,473
when so and so was invented.
But for the most part we can just 

3188
02:21:30,551 --> 02:21:34,930
communicate because that's the thing.
That's another one of those things where

3189
02:21:34,931 --> 02:21:35,764
you talk about what,
because I look up what actually makes 

3190
02:21:38,261 --> 02:21:40,510
people happy.
Communication,

3191
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,033
a real connection.
A community volunteering makes people 

3192
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:48,900
happier.
Uh,

3193
02:21:49,150 --> 02:21:51,660
which I like in the big brothers program
and it's like,

3194
02:21:51,661 --> 02:21:52,494
man,
it's not bad.

3195
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:54,760
Um,
it hasn't given me a spike or anything.

3196
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,250
A spike of,
of,

3197
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:00,700
of uh,
adrenaline or a good feelings of like,

3198
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,940
not even adrenaline of like a serotonin,
um,

3199
02:22:05,170 --> 02:22:07,390
and,
but really connecting with people.

3200
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:10,030
Is that maybe what you like about doing 
the show?

3201
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:13,630
Because I always find that I enjoy doing
this show and people are like,

3202
02:22:13,631 --> 02:22:14,411
it's so long.
I'm like,

3203
02:22:14,411 --> 02:22:15,430
yeah,
I know it's long,

3204
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:16,893
but I don't know.
There's something About just like 

3205
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:20,990
sitting here and just like staring at 
each other and like,

3206
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:23,470
what else do you think?
Do you think that?

3207
02:22:23,471 --> 02:22:24,950
Here's what I think.
Yeah,

3208
02:22:25,030 --> 02:22:26,280
will.
And there's something

3209
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,630
about it for listeners.
probably too.

3210
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:31,050
Yeah.
Well it's so long form that you get.

3211
02:22:31,051 --> 02:22:33,780
Everybody gets real relaxed and you get 
to.

3212
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:37,490
it becomes more of a,
the way I listened to it like,

3213
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:41,070
a lot of guys do it this way,
now I'm ari does it this way.

3214
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:43,080
A lot of guys do it.
They'll just let just let it go.

3215
02:22:43,081 --> 02:22:46,080
As long as it goes in.
When you do that,

3216
02:22:46,081 --> 02:22:47,540
like conversations,
they evolve,

3217
02:22:47,541 --> 02:22:48,750
they,
they move around,

3218
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:50,280
they,
they get deeper,

3219
02:22:50,281 --> 02:22:51,720
they get lighter,
they get silly.

3220
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:55,410
There's no,
it's not organized.

3221
02:22:55,530 --> 02:22:57,980
And I liked listening to people talk.
Yeah.

3222
02:22:58,430 --> 02:22:59,720
Oh,
you like ideas?

3223
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:01,760
Yeah.
So you like to hear like,

3224
02:23:01,761 --> 02:23:06,410
what's your idea that's not a good idea 
or that is a good idea.

3225
02:23:06,411 --> 02:23:06,790
Yeah.

3226
02:23:06,790 --> 02:23:07,623
Uh,
you got to be super flexible with your 

3227
02:23:08,671 --> 02:23:09,504
ideas.
I've gotten way better at that since I 

3228
02:23:12,001 --> 02:23:12,834
started doing a podcast way better at 
trying to figure out like what is it 

3229
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:21,830
about an idea that I disagree with and 
how much of it is that I had a different

3230
02:23:22,711 --> 02:23:26,370
idea then that idea in my head,
that preconceived notion,

3231
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:31,550
how much of that is how I'm affected by 
the disagreement or the called motivated

3232
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:33,490
reasoning.
Yeah,

3233
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,760
that's,
that's a perfect way of describing it.

3234
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:36,900
That's exactly what it is,
right?

3235
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:42,120
That's super common man for all of us.
And I think that having conversations on

3236
02:23:42,121 --> 02:23:42,954
a podcast with a variety of different 
people that have a variety of different 

3237
02:23:45,571 --> 02:23:46,404
opinions,
it's been really interesting because I 

3238
02:23:47,761 --> 02:23:49,740
get to challenge my own opinions like,
well,

3239
02:23:49,741 --> 02:23:53,530
where are my opinions coming from?
They've been really vetted out yet.

3240
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:57,950
Or are they just some like convenience 
stuff that I've held held onto because.

3241
02:23:57,970 --> 02:23:58,360
Yeah.

3242
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:00,220
Well yeah,
you have the shelving built,

3243
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:01,790
you have all this shit.
You will have like,

3244
02:24:01,810 --> 02:24:02,980
hey,
I got the t shirt,

3245
02:24:02,981 --> 02:24:05,510
I got the old thing,
I've got the right adapter.

3246
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:08,020
Yeah,
yeah.

3247
02:24:08,330 --> 02:24:09,670
Uh,
but yet,

3248
02:24:09,671 --> 02:24:11,230
so it is this,
this,

3249
02:24:11,310 --> 02:24:13,410
that was what I learned.
Like the,

3250
02:24:13,690 --> 02:24:16,300
the walking around not having to talk to
people.

3251
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:18,460
Yeah.
Was cool in it.

3252
02:24:18,461 --> 02:24:19,294
There was no pressure and it was also 
like the least sexual environment I've 

3253
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:27,220
ever been on because everyone just looks
like they have the flu.

3254
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:29,080
Basically.
People are struggling.

3255
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,210
Did they have rules?
Could people hook up?

3256
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:33,490
Uh,
it was discouraged.

3257
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:35,620
It,
I also would say like everyone,

3258
02:24:35,621 --> 02:24:36,454
I didn't have a roommate,
but like you're in like olympic style 

3259
02:24:38,951 --> 02:24:39,784
dorms,
like were you have a roommate and it's 

3260
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:42,273
like eight rooms and each floor it was 
like a summer camp basically where you 

3261
02:24:46,391 --> 02:24:47,224
did nothing.

3262
02:24:47,790 --> 02:24:50,130
It's seriously would be kind of hot 
though.

3263
02:24:50,610 --> 02:24:54,120
It was having been there gal.
Both sIngle.

3264
02:24:54,330 --> 02:24:55,950
Both can't talk.
Yeah.

3265
02:24:56,220 --> 02:24:57,053
Having been there though,
it really runs counter to what you're 

3266
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:00,900
going for.
You're like,

3267
02:25:00,901 --> 02:25:02,970
really?
It's fucking interesting where you go,

3268
02:25:02,971 --> 02:25:07,260
like you really see what's inside.
Because I was trying to think of what it

3269
02:25:07,261 --> 02:25:08,190
was like,
like I was like,

3270
02:25:08,191 --> 02:25:10,110
basketball camp was like,
no basketball camp.

3271
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:13,860
We had tv,
vcrs and talk the entire time.

3272
02:25:14,470 --> 02:25:16,560
Uh,
this was like nothing.

3273
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:20,530
It's like nothing you've ever done a 
you.

3274
02:25:20,570 --> 02:25:22,920
And then we would talk and then they 
would do it talk every night,

3275
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:25,150
some theme,
some buddhist theme,

3276
02:25:25,151 --> 02:25:28,540
and then the next day you would,
you would talk in a group about that.

3277
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:30,970
And what I found was I didn't even 
really want to talk.

3278
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:33,161
It's like,
fuck it,

3279
02:25:33,161 --> 02:25:35,830
I've come this far.
Let me see how long I can.

3280
02:25:35,831 --> 02:25:38,590
Not like,
let me just see what a.

3281
02:25:39,010 --> 02:25:42,490
But you see what's in there and you see 
like what your brain does.

3282
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:45,040
You see what you're interested in.
You see what you remember.

3283
02:25:45,730 --> 02:25:46,563
Any recall?
My recall was really good because your 

3284
02:25:48,551 --> 02:25:51,670
brain's.
What I realized with the,

3285
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:56,700
with the all the technology is you.
I would create chaos in my head,

3286
02:25:57,740 --> 02:25:58,573
uh,
with somebody voices and sounds and 

3287
02:26:00,431 --> 02:26:03,430
noises and did a that I couldn't even,
I couldn't remember because it was like,

3288
02:26:03,431 --> 02:26:08,230
I can't even get back there.
I can get through all this garbage too,

3289
02:26:08,231 --> 02:26:09,064
like the file that I'm looking for.
So if I couldn't remember something I'd 

3290
02:26:12,791 --> 02:26:13,960
be like,
just hang out.

3291
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:16,840
It'll come and it would always come.
Um,

3292
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:18,940
but that was the,
the thing of like,

3293
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,100
I don't listen to the radio when I'm in 
my car now,

3294
02:26:21,101 --> 02:26:23,830
which is on,
so just drive like a fucking old man.

3295
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:24,903
Whoa.
Just literally just me and fucking me 

3296
02:26:27,331 --> 02:26:29,950
and silence.
Just to limit the amount of signals.

3297
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:32,650
Yeah.
And it's not easy,

3298
02:26:32,651 --> 02:26:33,260
but yeah,

3299
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:34,720
I got a buddy of mine lives in our law,
um,

3300
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:37,160
Australia rather want to say Alaska 
summer.

3301
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:38,293
He lives in Australia and he takes these
trips out into the bush where he goes 

3302
02:26:42,351 --> 02:26:44,990
out camping and he'll be gone for like 
eight,

3303
02:26:44,991 --> 02:26:48,110
nine days or he won't see people for 
like nine days.

3304
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:53,420
And he said that when he comes back 
oftentimes it feels really weird to talk

3305
02:26:53,421 --> 02:26:54,254
to people.
I can almost like forgot how to talk to 

3306
02:26:56,121 --> 02:27:00,080
people where that has been nothing but 
him alone with his thoughts,

3307
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:02,810
with no cell phone service for like 
eight or nine days.

3308
02:27:02,910 --> 02:27:03,743
Yeah.
it's really worthwhile because what I 

3309
02:27:05,971 --> 02:27:10,380
also realized is that I was like,
with all the signal and all the,

3310
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:14,490
all the noise and everything is,
is I was upsetting myself.

3311
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:16,590
Do you know what I mean?
Like it'S like,

3312
02:27:16,591 --> 02:27:18,180
nah,
I don't need this much,

3313
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,890
and I would just overload myself.
Like,

3314
02:27:19,891 --> 02:27:20,600
no,
this is,

3315
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:21,433
we're in the golden age of information 
and I can access any fucking video and 

3316
02:27:23,671 --> 02:27:27,540
look around the godfather and fucking 
scarface and all this shit.

3317
02:27:27,541 --> 02:27:29,820
And it's like,
no,

3318
02:27:29,940 --> 02:27:32,310
you need to slow down man.
Like that's not,

3319
02:27:32,370 --> 02:27:35,970
that's kind of my temperament.
But at the same time my,

3320
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:41,060
my nervous system was like screaming 
like you gotta chill out.

3321
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:43,740
Wow.
Yeah.

3322
02:27:44,310 --> 02:27:45,780
But I don't smoke weed or anything like 
that,

3323
02:27:45,781 --> 02:27:49,920
so I don't have any way to,
to separate.

3324
02:27:50,430 --> 02:27:53,280
Yeah.
Or to like to quiet my nervous system.

3325
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:55,300
I mean I've answered a stuff like that 
or.

3326
02:27:55,470 --> 02:27:56,303
But,
but meditation really helps and since 

3327
02:27:57,661 --> 02:27:59,940
I've been back I've meditated pretty 
much every day since,

3328
02:27:59,941 --> 02:28:02,040
which is really for like three months,
which is really.

3329
02:28:02,550 --> 02:28:03,383
I've missed a few days,
but it's definitely like an entrenched 

3330
02:28:06,031 --> 02:28:08,280
part of my life now that I miss if I 
don't do it.

3331
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:10,033
Time for reflection is very important 
and to avoid getting stuck with 

3332
02:28:13,131 --> 02:28:15,410
momentum.
Right when when you have the momentum of

3333
02:28:15,411 --> 02:28:16,244
your life like and you just cannot let 
things keep playing out and just 

3334
02:28:20,361 --> 02:28:24,800
adjusting long.
the fly that separation to step back and

3335
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:28,360
look at it so it's so critical,
so important.

3336
02:28:28,390 --> 02:28:33,020
It's so hard to do because I think once 
once things start going in your life,

3337
02:28:33,021 --> 02:28:37,730
Whether its obligations or financial 
responsibilities or whatever things that

3338
02:28:37,731 --> 02:28:40,820
you're working on that are occupying all
of your time,

3339
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:42,093
they.
They become so much a part of your 

3340
02:28:44,601 --> 02:28:45,434
thought process and you consIder them to
be like a primary importance because 

3341
02:28:49,311 --> 02:28:50,960
this is like,
I have to pay these bills.

3342
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:52,730
Hey this,
I have to deal with this shit.

3343
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:55,340
I have to.
This is what's going on that they.

3344
02:28:55,430 --> 02:28:59,330
They sort of overwhelm cognitive 
reasoning.

3345
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:00,433
they overwhelm perspective.
We don't have the opportunity to sit 

3346
02:29:03,681 --> 02:29:04,514
back and go,
hey,

3347
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:08,510
you're not here for that long amount of 
time here.

3348
02:29:08,590 --> 02:29:09,640
Yeah,
that's what it was like.

3349
02:29:09,641 --> 02:29:12,490
Oh.
So I died like,

3350
02:29:12,491 --> 02:29:15,850
what was this like?
It was a bit like the mark twain thing,

3351
02:29:15,851 --> 02:29:17,830
like of like seeing your own funeral of 
like,

3352
02:29:18,280 --> 02:29:21,430
oh wow.
I was away for a week.

3353
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:22,893
I got,
I had the automatic email thing and I 

3354
02:29:25,121 --> 02:29:27,910
knew so people knew I wasn't around,
but I only got like 50 emails.

3355
02:29:27,911 --> 02:29:31,060
It wasn't like an ungodly amount of 
emails.

3356
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:36,370
I got maybe 10 texts which all 
manageable,

3357
02:29:36,490 --> 02:29:37,960
you know,
like it's not like,

3358
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:40,150
oh I was,
I was so missed,

3359
02:29:40,151 --> 02:29:40,970
the world needs me.
It's like,

3360
02:29:40,970 --> 02:29:42,490
no,
we can all duck out.

3361
02:29:42,491 --> 02:29:46,180
Obama could duck out.
Was in martha's vineyard right now.

3362
02:29:46,181 --> 02:29:49,090
He's reachable,
but he's not like working,

3363
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:49,973
working when he does that,
like how much do you thInk he works 

3364
02:29:52,871 --> 02:29:54,940
while he's doing one of those?
Those trips?

3365
02:29:54,941 --> 02:29:58,900
like I'm going to bet three hours.
Three hours.

3366
02:29:58,960 --> 02:29:59,793
Yeah,
I bet in the morning and then again in 

3367
02:30:00,611 --> 02:30:01,444
the afternoon.
So it's just a random gift that's a 

3368
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:05,560
completely uneducated.
It's based on fucking nothing.

3369
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:08,020
I think people are gonna miss that guy 
so much.

3370
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:12,130
They're going to make it even so much.
You can't even quantify how much they're

3371
02:30:12,131 --> 02:30:12,964
going to miss him.
He kept it together in the face of 

3372
02:30:15,130 --> 02:30:17,950
overwhelming criticism,
which is really interesting.

3373
02:30:17,951 --> 02:30:22,951
Like the way he handled it without a 
hint of bitterness or anger.

3374
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:28,970
He's a fascinating guy in that way.
He's a very,

3375
02:30:28,971 --> 02:30:30,350
very measured guy.

3376
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:32,890
Yeah.
He's nothing if not measured like that's

3377
02:30:32,910 --> 02:30:34,380
the.
He's half everything.

3378
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:35,610
Yeah,
and I think the.

3379
02:30:35,611 --> 02:30:38,160
One of the good things about having a 
guy like that,

3380
02:30:38,490 --> 02:30:41,160
one of the most important thing is like 
you can criticize him,

3381
02:30:41,220 --> 02:30:42,930
you could with them,
you're not with them,

3382
02:30:42,931 --> 02:30:47,931
but having a guy like that sets the tone
for the way we think about ourselves and

3383
02:30:48,811 --> 02:30:52,590
he was a nice guy.
He's an arTiculate guy.

3384
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:55,890
he was warm and friendly.
I believed him.

3385
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:57,510
Yeah.
That's the tone.

3386
02:30:57,511 --> 02:30:59,720
Whether or not he was really like that 
24 slash seven,

3387
02:30:59,721 --> 02:31:00,840
I don't fucking know,
man.

3388
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:01,980
It seems like he was,

3389
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:06,810
but he's setting the tone with his 
behavior like,

3390
02:31:06,890 --> 02:31:07,723
yeah,
that's what what people are most 

3391
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:12,440
terrified of by something like trump 
becoming president.

3392
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:13,783
They're worried that there's a lot of 
people that are like super aggressive 

3393
02:31:17,090 --> 02:31:21,870
and that like having like an insulting 
president

3394
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:22,580
who.
Yeah,

3395
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:23,413
I'm,
I'm thinking about whether I agree with 

3396
02:31:24,831 --> 02:31:25,664
you about whether obama raised the 
discourse because it got courser and he 

3397
02:31:29,871 --> 02:31:32,150
got yelled at and you lie and all that 
stuff.

3398
02:31:32,151 --> 02:31:35,300
He made peopLe worse in some ways toward
him.

3399
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:38,600
Uh,
how much can you talk radio and internet

3400
02:31:38,601 --> 02:31:40,400
and talk radio got worse in the last 
eight years,

3401
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:43,190
which could just be natural.
It have been worse without them.

3402
02:31:45,050 --> 02:31:48,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

3403
02:31:48,110 --> 02:31:50,990
It's not a simple because it is like,
it did get worse,

3404
02:31:50,991 --> 02:31:53,210
but I think the thing that you said it's
really worthwhile.

3405
02:31:53,211 --> 02:31:56,090
It's like the level headedness event 
dude,

3406
02:31:56,750 --> 02:32:01,490
and like a really measured kind hearted 
guy.

3407
02:32:02,590 --> 02:32:03,423
See,
it's hard for me to discern how much of 

3408
02:32:05,531 --> 02:32:10,531
the hate he gets his from his policy 
from where the just the current state of

3409
02:32:12,941 --> 02:32:16,240
the United States is in the eyes of 
ourselves,

3410
02:32:16,241 --> 02:32:18,850
the world financially,
resources,

3411
02:32:18,851 --> 02:32:19,750
jobs,
all that stuff.

3412
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:24,190
And then how much of that,
how much of it is racism?

3413
02:32:24,350 --> 02:32:25,510
Yeah.
How much of it is,

3414
02:32:25,511 --> 02:32:26,344
um,
how much of it is legitimate criticism 

3415
02:32:27,671 --> 02:32:29,140
that makes sense?
How much of it is,

3416
02:32:29,590 --> 02:32:30,423
you know,
this a criticism that he's always had 

3417
02:32:32,261 --> 02:32:35,290
that by trying to be accommodating to 
everybody,

3418
02:32:35,291 --> 02:32:37,240
he really gets nothing done,
you know?

3419
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:39,010
I don't know.
I don'T understand it.

3420
02:32:39,011 --> 02:32:39,371
Um,
it's,

3421
02:32:39,371 --> 02:32:40,204
it's,
it's way too complicated for me to dive 

3422
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:42,030
in.

3423
02:32:42,030 --> 02:32:44,060
The hatred thing that I point out always
is,

3424
02:32:44,180 --> 02:32:45,013
I think it's probably half 50 percent 
racism and february percent republicans 

3425
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:52,820
fucking hate democrats.
They fucking hate them.

3426
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:53,993
It's so.
That's two presidents in a row that 

3427
02:32:56,271 --> 02:32:57,104
they've said we're not legitimate.
It's so because they did the same thing 

3428
02:32:59,091 --> 02:32:59,924
with clinton where they tried to indict 
them pretty much from day one and 

3429
02:33:02,571 --> 02:33:04,670
investigate the fuck out of him and his 
wife.

3430
02:33:04,730 --> 02:33:05,563
Well,
do you rememBer that republicans versus 

3431
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:09,380
I should say republican,
uh,

3432
02:33:09,410 --> 02:33:11,790
politicians because they can't say,
you know,

3433
02:33:12,110 --> 02:33:14,220
I can't speak for all people.
Sorry.

3434
02:33:14,660 --> 02:33:16,640
Donald Trump was a birther.
Oh,

3435
02:33:16,641 --> 02:33:19,410
right now I know he was the big.
He was the big proponent of it.

3436
02:33:19,411 --> 02:33:20,750
Yeah.
He was saying he's kenyan.

3437
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:22,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

3438
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:24,310
He's,
he's only down by three.

3439
02:33:26,420 --> 02:33:28,010
I mean,
he kept saying it too.

3440
02:33:28,011 --> 02:33:28,844
He kept going all in member.
They released the birth certificate and 

3441
02:33:31,401 --> 02:33:32,960
everything.
Like this is a forgery.

3442
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:33,520
Yeah,
too.

3443
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:34,680
God damn forgery.
Yeah.

3444
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:36,830
It all these reasons to believe it's a 
forgery.

3445
02:33:36,850 --> 02:33:38,900
Yeah.
He has people in Hawaii investigating.

3446
02:33:38,990 --> 02:33:39,823
How hilarious is it though,
that people would be worried if he 

3447
02:33:44,211 --> 02:33:45,560
wasn't born in the right spot?

3448
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:49,410
Uh,
well that speaks to people's,

3449
02:33:49,770 --> 02:33:50,603
a suspicion.
They want to believe that there's a 

3450
02:33:53,371 --> 02:33:56,880
manchurian candidate and it's really.
There's a pod and there's a sale here.

3451
02:33:58,890 --> 02:34:02,760
Neil brandon,
as jesus is my witness,

3452
02:34:02,761 --> 02:34:03,594
he hates America.
And in the second amendment to peak a 

3453
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:09,360
ball and it feels good to play the 
victim.

3454
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:10,353
Yeah.
That's the thing people also forget is 

3455
02:34:11,191 --> 02:34:11,611
like,
no,

3456
02:34:11,611 --> 02:34:15,000
it feels fucking really good to go.
Like he's out to get us.

3457
02:34:15,001 --> 02:34:16,650
And he doesn't believe what I believe.
It was like,

3458
02:34:16,651 --> 02:34:18,310
no,
he's fucking boring ass.

3459
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:20,110
He,
I believe he may be an atheist,

3460
02:34:20,111 --> 02:34:21,730
but I believe,
but he's a boy.

3461
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,860
I think that's the worst thing you say 
about him religiously.

3462
02:34:24,070 --> 02:34:27,520
Otherwise he's a piece christian at 
least.

3463
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:28,533
So the idea that if he's a muslim,
he's an awful muslim and he knows 

3464
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:34,450
another vacancy,
what happens?

3465
02:34:34,451 --> 02:34:35,081
Yeah.
Yeah.

3466
02:34:35,081 --> 02:34:35,681
I'm sure.
Yeah,

3467
02:34:35,681 --> 02:34:36,230
exactly.

3468
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:39,310
So I bring garlic to the vampire house.
That's right.

3469
02:34:39,990 --> 02:34:41,480
I don't know man.
I just,

3470
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:44,070
I don't think anybody's ever going to be
able to do that job.

3471
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:44,933
I think that job is a ridiculous job and
I think that at the very least he moved 

3472
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:50,733
some social issues in a way.
Like during his time I feel like people 

3473
02:34:55,621 --> 02:34:59,040
were more tolerant in a lot of ways.
Like it,

3474
02:34:59,041 --> 02:35:02,430
it,
it opened up a lot of social issues that

3475
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:04,380
I don't think would have been addressed 
wIth a,

3476
02:35:04,381 --> 02:35:08,970
a less measured,
more easily accessible

3477
02:35:09,460 --> 02:35:11,740
truly is like progressive where it's 
like,

3478
02:35:11,830 --> 02:35:12,663
yeah,
like I'm a progressive politician so I 

3479
02:35:14,051 --> 02:35:14,884
want things to evolve.
But then there's like the fucking ed 

3480
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:18,573
snowden shit.
Well that's the thing is he's super 

3481
02:35:20,951 --> 02:35:24,040
authoritarian and some with drones and 
snowed and shit like that leaks.

3482
02:35:24,041 --> 02:35:25,780
They were worried about leaks than bush 
was.

3483
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,070
Yeah.
But here's the thing about drones,

3484
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:31,870
right?
Was that happening anyway?

3485
02:35:31,890 --> 02:35:33,970
Was that just going to happen anyway?
And is,

3486
02:35:33,980 --> 02:35:36,080
is it because he's an office,
I mean,

3487
02:35:36,081 --> 02:35:36,914
how much of effect does he have on what 
the heads of military decided to do and 

3488
02:35:43,161 --> 02:35:46,370
not do with things like drones?
How much of an effect do you think,

3489
02:35:46,371 --> 02:35:49,910
like personally he has on that?
I feel like a lot.

3490
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,490
did you watch the,
the,

3491
02:35:51,610 --> 02:35:55,790
the cia thing on a showtime?
What?

3492
02:35:55,791 --> 02:35:58,240
That was like the last seven heads of 
the cia.

3493
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:00,820
They documentary about the.
No,

3494
02:36:00,850 --> 02:36:03,550
it's fucking good.
But it talks about.

3495
02:36:03,610 --> 02:36:05,080
Yeah,
it's like seven or eight.

3496
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:07,150
Michael hayden,
bunch of them.

3497
02:36:07,151 --> 02:36:08,590
These guys.
Uh,

3498
02:36:08,710 --> 02:36:11,500
and,
and they talk about having leon panetta,

3499
02:36:11,980 --> 02:36:12,813
they talk about having,
having a guy insight on video live and 

3500
02:36:18,671 --> 02:36:23,590
having to decide whether it's go time.

3501
02:36:23,770 --> 02:36:25,730
Jesus christ.
Oh,

3502
02:36:26,190 --> 02:36:29,740
master's years.
Wow.

3503
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:31,151
Yeah.
Good.

3504
02:36:31,151 --> 02:36:31,550
Huh?

3505
02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:32,450
Yeah.
Really good.

3506
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:34,700
Crazy john.
Super like,

3507
02:36:34,750 --> 02:36:35,570
you know,
right wing.

3508
02:36:35,570 --> 02:36:36,630
It's like it's,
it's,

3509
02:36:36,670 --> 02:36:41,670
it is very pro death and pro pro fire,
fire,

3510
02:36:43,770 --> 02:36:45,260
fire our weapons.
We got the weapons,

3511
02:36:45,261 --> 02:36:46,470
let's use him type thing.
But

3512
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:47,413
it's interesting that everybody,
pretty much that's involved at the 

3513
02:36:50,661 --> 02:36:53,530
highest level in,
in military is.

3514
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:54,373
I mean,
there's a giant percentage of them that 

3515
02:36:56,481 --> 02:36:58,100
are probably conservative.
Right?

3516
02:36:58,200 --> 02:36:59,033
Right,
right.

3517
02:36:59,160 --> 02:36:59,430
No,
I

3518
02:36:59,430 --> 02:37:00,263
think so.
I feel like it's 80 percent even though 

3519
02:37:02,881 --> 02:37:04,050
I'm making that up.
Yeah.

3520
02:37:04,051 --> 02:37:06,480
I would say I agree with your made up 
quote.

3521
02:37:06,810 --> 02:37:08,010
Thank you.
That's a good number.

3522
02:37:08,190 --> 02:37:10,110
I would agree with that.
I don't even think.

3523
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:10,973
Here's an interesting one.
What percentage of merchandise do women 

3524
02:37:14,161 --> 02:37:16,280
buy in America?
Percentage

3525
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:21,580
of mert all merchandise in America.
Forty percent.

3526
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:25,340
Eighty percent.
Oh my god.

3527
02:37:27,050 --> 02:37:29,540
Isn't that fucking insane?
It's amazing.

3528
02:37:29,870 --> 02:37:30,703
Yeah.
Wow.

3529
02:37:30,740 --> 02:37:33,140
Eighty percent oF merchandise is 
purchased by women.

3530
02:37:33,370 --> 02:37:35,570
Oh wow.
I don't even know what.

3531
02:37:35,571 --> 02:37:38,000
I've known that for months now and I 
still don't know what to make.

3532
02:37:38,001 --> 02:37:39,230
That's incredible.
yeah.

3533
02:37:39,540 --> 02:37:43,100
I juSt googled it said 85 percent can be
as high as 85.

3534
02:37:43,150 --> 02:37:44,750
They're window.
Yeah.

3535
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,580
And they market,
but the market,

3536
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:49,940
I guess they market to men to get the 
women to say,

3537
02:37:49,941 --> 02:37:50,810
hey,
buy this for me.

3538
02:37:50,811 --> 02:37:55,811
I don't know what I'm [inaudible] men 
wouldn't have been by like video games.

3539
02:37:56,121 --> 02:37:57,370
Deodorant.
Yes.

3540
02:37:57,371 --> 02:37:58,201
Shoes.
Yeah.

3541
02:37:58,201 --> 02:37:59,570
Shoes.
jamie's really into shoes.

3542
02:38:01,970 --> 02:38:03,080
um,
wow.

3543
02:38:03,081 --> 02:38:05,040
That's a big number.
that's a big fucking number.

3544
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:05,913
It was like,
almost like it's trying to in some way 

3545
02:38:08,511 --> 02:38:10,820
replicate something that exists in the 
wild.

3546
02:38:13,060 --> 02:38:16,880
This is the great joe rogan to go on.
You know what I'm saying?

3547
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:22,060
I mean classic rogan numbers so strongly
in the camp of women buying shit.

3548
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:24,830
Who,
why?

3549
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:28,520
What is god saying?
Yeah.

3550
02:38:28,521 --> 02:38:31,310
It's got to come from the gas thing.
They want to collect stuff.

3551
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:35,360
Yeah.
It's like the same leftover echoing urge

3552
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:38,370
that made them pick wild apricots.
Yeah.

3553
02:38:38,810 --> 02:38:39,643
And we want to go and hunt.
I bet percentage of men hunting is at 

3554
02:38:43,911 --> 02:38:46,310
least 80.
Yeah.

3555
02:38:46,311 --> 02:38:48,560
There's a lot of men.
Um,

3556
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:51,200
I don't know what the number of women 
would be.

3557
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:52,113
Go ahead and they do it,
but a lot of women do it in and they 

3558
02:38:54,711 --> 02:38:58,490
turned it into a career or how come?

3559
02:38:58,550 --> 02:39:03,550
Because if you can be like,
I'm a personality,

3560
02:39:03,590 --> 02:39:05,750
a hunting personality and you're a 
woman,

3561
02:39:05,751 --> 02:39:06,584
that's like a legitimate career path.
Like there's a bunch of decent looking 

3562
02:39:09,630 --> 02:39:12,250
and you can shoot for the bow.
Yeah,

3563
02:39:12,251 --> 02:39:13,130
yeah,
yeah,

3564
02:39:13,131 --> 02:39:14,360
yeah.
And um,

3565
02:39:14,810 --> 02:39:19,280
it also allows men and women to watch 
their hunt and shows together.

3566
02:39:20,010 --> 02:39:23,870
I like when the girl when's.
She's always right.

3567
02:39:24,050 --> 02:39:24,883
Yeah.
It says the same thing for motorsports 

3568
02:39:26,330 --> 02:39:30,980
says everyday agree that women racist 
bring fans out to the game.

3569
02:39:30,981 --> 02:39:31,814
Seventy four percent of males in 62 
percent of females agree that women 

3570
02:39:35,511 --> 02:39:37,910
racers bring fans out to the games.
Hmm.

3571
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:41,090
Interesting.
Well that's some underdog shit.

3572
02:39:41,091 --> 02:39:44,300
I think it's the woman among the.
I mean,

3573
02:39:44,301 --> 02:39:46,730
I think it's like the girls who race in 
nascar,

3574
02:39:47,190 --> 02:39:48,023
they go like,
danica patrick is so hot and you're 

3575
02:39:49,461 --> 02:39:50,294
like,
eh,

3576
02:39:50,690 --> 02:39:54,870
she's all right.
She was like,

3577
02:39:55,390 --> 02:39:58,310
you know,
we'll give her a six and a half,

3578
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,590
seven out of 10.
That's hilarious.

3579
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:02,690
Um,
yeah,

3580
02:40:02,691 --> 02:40:05,720
like I can't say that she is like a,
you know,

3581
02:40:05,940 --> 02:40:06,770
uh,
but,

3582
02:40:06,770 --> 02:40:10,070
but it is definitely like more.
It's the thing that you notice.

3583
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:11,690
Yeah,
iT's super odd,

3584
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:13,920
right?
It's super odd for a woman to want to do

3585
02:40:13,921 --> 02:40:14,754
that.

3586
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:16,470
But,
but normal.

3587
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,060
I mean it's nothing.
Nothing wrong with it.

3588
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:21,390
But for a woman to want to race like 
formula one or something like that.

3589
02:40:22,010 --> 02:40:23,040
Well there's a,
there's,

3590
02:40:23,150 --> 02:40:24,230
ooh,
she's created looking.

3591
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:28,820
It's primary fo allow you say that the 
right way.

3592
02:40:29,630 --> 02:40:32,150
she's misalign tropic.
Oh see,

3593
02:40:32,151 --> 02:40:34,580
these are all race car drIvers.
these women.

3594
02:40:34,581 --> 02:40:36,740
Jesus.
Wow,

3595
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:39,630
that's gangster courtney.
For us.

3596
02:40:39,631 --> 02:40:44,631
It's good name.
Hope that sounds so porn daily,

3597
02:40:47,570 --> 02:40:51,980
but you have to be like a wild person to
be a race car driver.

3598
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:55,520
Like a one new thing.
It's a characterological thing.

3599
02:40:55,610 --> 02:40:56,690
I wonder.

3600
02:40:57,020 --> 02:40:57,853
It's so risky and it's so rewarding,
I would guess in a sense of like a 

3601
02:41:02,380 --> 02:41:04,550
sensory perception sentence.
Yeah.

3602
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:06,530
Well,
yeah.

3603
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:08,310
You want to talk about upsetting your 
nervous system?

3604
02:41:08,330 --> 02:41:10,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

3605
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:13,650
And the consequences are terrible.
if you fuck up,

3606
02:41:13,710 --> 02:41:14,543
you know,
car accidents at 150 miles an hour and 

3607
02:41:16,371 --> 02:41:17,730
not cute.
Yeah.

3608
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:19,710
Instant.
Horrific too.

3609
02:41:19,711 --> 02:41:20,544
When you see people get spun around,
they could fucking crashed and firing 

3610
02:41:23,460 --> 02:41:24,560
like that.
Like The,

3611
02:41:24,650 --> 02:41:27,510
it explodes like flex and you're like,
was that a foot?

3612
02:41:27,690 --> 02:41:31,170
I just saw dude,
but having said that,

3613
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:34,800
high,
high a rate of mortality,

3614
02:41:34,801 --> 02:41:36,540
like the or I'm sorry,
low rate of mortality.

3615
02:41:36,541 --> 02:41:39,570
Like they actually survive way more than
you think where you go,

3616
02:41:39,571 --> 02:41:41,130
oh,
that's another one that was like dead,

3617
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:43,740
dead.
You're dead.

3618
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:46,710
Those people are dead and they're fine.

3619
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:47,873
Yeah.
Have you been seeing these people that 

3620
02:41:49,001 --> 02:41:51,910
put these balloons around their bodies 
and get hit by bowls?

3621
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:54,460
I haven't.
We got to show you this.

3622
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:58,630
I'm looking forward to it very much.
This is a recurring theme on this show.

3623
02:41:58,631 --> 02:41:59,464
It's almost like one of those top 40 a 
morning radio zoo shows where they have 

3624
02:42:03,851 --> 02:42:04,684
those weekly gags on.
One of our weekly gags is show one of 

3625
02:42:07,241 --> 02:42:10,720
the guests,
the people with the balloons on that get

3626
02:42:10,721 --> 02:42:15,160
hit by the bowls and this is my take on 
it.

3627
02:42:15,670 --> 02:42:17,710
I don't think people realize how 
vulnerable they are.

3628
02:42:18,460 --> 02:42:19,241
This is a.
Oh,

3629
02:42:19,241 --> 02:42:20,760
this is a different one.
Oh,

3630
02:42:20,770 --> 02:42:21,603
okay.
Cool.

3631
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:22,990
This is a different one.
And look,

3632
02:42:22,991 --> 02:42:25,780
they got a rodeo clown and everything.
They're trying to rope.

3633
02:42:25,810 --> 02:42:27,240
Oh,
this got the bull is going after it.

3634
02:42:27,300 --> 02:42:30,070
Guy get out of that suit on.
Oh,

3635
02:42:30,071 --> 02:42:31,980
he got flipped.
Oh,

3636
02:42:31,981 --> 02:42:34,800
he got jackson.
Oh my god.

3637
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:37,380
This is even more horrific.
So this was.

3638
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:42,130
This is obviously something went wrong 
because the bulls,

3639
02:42:42,131 --> 02:42:44,070
they still seem pretty happy to be in 
there.

3640
02:42:44,071 --> 02:42:47,130
They're not leaving.
Oh my god.

3641
02:42:47,150 --> 02:42:48,800
The guy was fun.
I liked.

3642
02:42:48,820 --> 02:42:52,380
It's interesting about.
It's an interesting metaphor about bowls

3643
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:56,400
and a temper tantrum.
They go after the guy,

3644
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:00,030
even though they're just mad that their 
balls are tied up,

3645
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:02,520
but they're like,
well,

3646
02:43:02,521 --> 02:43:06,000
fuck it.
I'm in a bad mood anyway.

3647
02:43:07,510 --> 02:43:08,343
This is the better one.
This is the one that we were talking 

3648
02:43:09,821 --> 02:43:12,070
about.
This one looks like

3649
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:14,560
it's first of all,
definitely taking place in Mexico,

3650
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:15,453
right?
Second of all these cushions these guys 

3651
02:43:18,401 --> 02:43:19,630
have,
they're just not big enough.

3652
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:23,410
They only go from the waist up.
Would you want to cover your dick?

3653
02:43:23,411 --> 02:43:25,720
I think.
Yeah,

3654
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:27,920
you're gonna.
You're gonna carnage.

3655
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:32,260
Watch this because the bull gets loose 
and when the bowl gets loose,

3656
02:43:32,290 --> 02:43:34,990
these fuckers in this thing,
I think they just have this,

3657
02:43:35,460 --> 02:43:37,870
this stupid plan that they're going to 
be fine.

3658
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:40,840
You've got to back it up a little 
because the guy who already got jacked.

3659
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:44,500
Yeah,
but he got jacked before that.

3660
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:47,180
Right there.
Boom.

3661
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:52,610
So they let the bull out the bowl sees 
these assholes walking around with these

3662
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:55,250
giant jelly fish.
Fish balloons.

3663
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:58,300
I'll get a boom.
I mean he goes flying,

3664
02:43:58,580 --> 02:44:00,770
he gets gored on the ground.
He gets run over.

3665
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:03,710
I mean this guy gets fucking jacked

3666
02:44:04,060 --> 02:44:06,410
and looking at the horses though,
huh?

3667
02:44:06,470 --> 02:44:07,850
No,
the horses.

3668
02:44:08,480 --> 02:44:09,920
Even the bowls know like,
man,

3669
02:44:09,921 --> 02:44:11,420
I don't want to fuck with that.
Well they don't.

3670
02:44:11,710 --> 02:44:14,570
I think they don't see.
They don't recognize him as the is doing

3671
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:16,020
anything.
People.

3672
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:18,380
Oh,
they just don't like people.

3673
02:44:18,381 --> 02:44:19,490
Right?
I think.

3674
02:44:19,550 --> 02:44:22,820
I think because of the ball stuff.
Come on cow.

3675
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:26,550
I think cows have always realized that 
people want to eat them.

3676
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:27,860
Look at that.
Boom,

3677
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:32,490
boom.
I mean if a cow sees a person,

3678
02:44:32,850 --> 02:44:35,700
what are the odds that that's going to 
be a bad thing?

3679
02:44:35,910 --> 02:44:37,260
The odds are pretty god damn strong.

3680
02:44:37,340 --> 02:44:39,110
Yeah.
Nothing good's going to happen like,

3681
02:44:39,111 --> 02:44:39,944
oh good.

3682
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:41,213
They might squeeze your tests for a 
couple of years and then shoot you in 

3683
02:44:43,411 --> 02:44:44,244
the head for sure.
One day they're going to shoot you in 

3684
02:44:46,111 --> 02:44:46,944
the head.

3685
02:44:47,870 --> 02:44:50,000
Do you think it's naturally ingrained 
though?

3686
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:55,210
I don't think [inaudible] is like an 
enemy then you can't pass that on june.

3687
02:44:55,490 --> 02:44:58,580
Genetically I don't think.
Do you know what a scrub bull as a.

3688
02:44:58,610 --> 02:44:59,240
No.
Tell me

3689
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:03,410
scrubble or animals that until like the 
last,

3690
02:45:03,430 --> 02:45:04,263
you know,
x amount of years used to be domestic 

3691
02:45:05,871 --> 02:45:09,110
cattle,
but then they get loose and they live in

3692
02:45:09,111 --> 02:45:09,944
the countryside and this,
this is something that happens often in 

3693
02:45:12,411 --> 02:45:13,244
Australia where they are not necessarily
like the same strain anymore as like a 

3694
02:45:19,341 --> 02:45:23,420
strain of cattle that you would use for 
like beef or you know,

3695
02:45:23,421 --> 02:45:26,270
like that you would bring to market.
They have dIfferent,

3696
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:27,433
they have different genetics now because
they've been wild for so long and 

3697
02:45:30,681 --> 02:45:34,250
they're not like an angus cow.
So if you have angus cows and this thing

3698
02:45:34,251 --> 02:45:36,110
shows up and starts fucking your,
uh,

3699
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:37,671
your,
uh,

3700
02:45:37,671 --> 02:45:38,930
your cattle,
you've got a problem,

3701
02:45:38,931 --> 02:45:39,764
you get some weird cross breed of a cow 
that might not be like the best for 

3702
02:45:43,671 --> 02:45:46,100
eating right.
But these things,

3703
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:50,660
they live wild in the bush,
in Australia and in Australia there's no

3704
02:45:50,661 --> 02:45:52,090
predators.
They have like,

3705
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:54,560
you know,
small things like dingoes and stuff like

3706
02:45:54,561 --> 02:45:57,250
that,
but they've never taken out a bull.

3707
02:45:57,450 --> 02:46:00,170
There's the you would need a lIon or 
something like that to kill one of these

3708
02:46:00,171 --> 02:46:03,680
things and they get cool looking like 
they look different.

3709
02:46:03,860 --> 02:46:04,693
They don't look like a cow anymore.
They start looking more and more 

3710
02:46:07,971 --> 02:46:10,010
primitive in some weird

3711
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:10,843
way.
They start looking more like like a 

3712
02:46:12,650 --> 02:46:14,930
animal that you would see in africa or 
something.

3713
02:46:14,931 --> 02:46:16,880
It's really fascinating,
man.

3714
02:46:17,620 --> 02:46:19,610
Like here's some of the photos,
like look at that.

3715
02:46:19,810 --> 02:46:22,460
It looks like a long time ago.
Yeah,

3716
02:46:22,461 --> 02:46:26,060
that was a different animal,
but if you just google scrub bull,

3717
02:46:26,510 --> 02:46:27,580
is that what it is?
Okay.

3718
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:29,930
Like that one in the upper left hand 
corner is a perfect example.

3719
02:46:30,110 --> 02:46:32,810
Like that is not really.
Obviously that's a cow,

3720
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:33,680
right?
It's a bull,

3721
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:34,693
but that looks way different than the 
average bold that you see either at the 

3722
02:46:38,421 --> 02:46:40,970
rodeo.
I'm looking at his balls back there.

3723
02:46:40,971 --> 02:46:43,330
Right.
I'm looking at john jay.

3724
02:46:43,490 --> 02:46:47,750
That's up package son for them.
Huge balls,

3725
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:48,613
giant antlers or horns rather,
and his his face and just the way his 

3726
02:46:53,511 --> 02:46:55,160
body's buIlt.
It's different.

3727
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:56,023
He's a wild animal and he's living the 
way they're supposed to be and that's 

3728
02:46:59,241 --> 02:47:02,180
why he looks like a wild animal and you 
know what else?

3729
02:47:02,181 --> 02:47:04,820
He's fine.
He's doing great.

3730
02:47:04,821 --> 02:47:05,654
They're super aggressive though.
There's some of the most dangerous 

3731
02:47:07,551 --> 02:47:11,090
things to run across if you're out in 
the bush as it were.

3732
02:47:11,210 --> 02:47:14,720
I don't see what you mean.
That's another one of the most dangerous

3733
02:47:14,721 --> 02:47:15,740
things.
What is that?

3734
02:47:16,110 --> 02:47:18,500
That's a buffalo,
I don't know.

3735
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:19,690
Well,
they rammed earth.

3736
02:47:19,750 --> 02:47:20,610
Oh,
yay.

3737
02:47:20,650 --> 02:47:24,070
Is there been like a lot of animal 
chasing?

3738
02:47:24,310 --> 02:47:26,770
You saw the tiger eats the lady last 
week in beijing.

3739
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:27,633
That was pretty wild,
but a lot of like giraffes chasing cars 

3740
02:47:31,211 --> 02:47:33,250
and shit.
Have you seen some of these videos now?

3741
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:35,110
Look,
drab lookup.

3742
02:47:35,111 --> 02:47:37,750
Draft chases,
a chases.

3743
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:39,430
Listened.
That only makes sense.

3744
02:47:40,060 --> 02:47:42,480
Hauling ass by the way only makes sense.
Yeah.

3745
02:47:42,790 --> 02:47:45,250
They're tired of like,
here you go.

3746
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:47,351
Oh,
I've seen this.

3747
02:47:47,351 --> 02:47:49,140
Yeah.
That is crazy.

3748
02:47:49,150 --> 02:47:52,390
The strides on this motherfucker.
I know this shit in their pants.

3749
02:47:52,420 --> 02:47:53,950
Look at it.
Running behind them.

3750
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:56,650
You know if they would hit you with 
their head,

3751
02:47:57,360 --> 02:47:58,193
we're right behind you.
It's like you were saying about the 

3752
02:47:59,810 --> 02:48:00,643
equip thing.

3753
02:48:09,970 --> 02:48:11,560
Oh my god,
this is terrifying.

3754
02:48:11,770 --> 02:48:16,770
I think he comes around a corner again.
I think he does.

3755
02:48:18,130 --> 02:48:20,020
I don't know if this is the right one.
Oh my god.

3756
02:48:20,200 --> 02:48:21,640
What do you think it would do to those 
people?

3757
02:48:21,641 --> 02:48:23,070
Just start smacking them with the 
tender.

3758
02:48:23,150 --> 02:48:25,450
Yeah.
Whip whip his neck at them.

3759
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:26,393
It's really dangerous.
Like you got to think of how big his 

3760
02:48:28,751 --> 02:48:29,584
head is,
man.

3761
02:48:31,150 --> 02:48:34,840
Have you ever seen them fight so cool.
Yeah.

3762
02:48:34,930 --> 02:48:37,170
It's really painful.
I mean like in,

3763
02:48:37,270 --> 02:48:38,103
in terms of animal shit,
like that's one of those things where 

3764
02:48:39,911 --> 02:48:41,590
you're like,
I don't know guys.

3765
02:48:41,860 --> 02:48:43,320
it is.
What am I fighting?

3766
02:48:43,390 --> 02:48:47,770
But that's like really fucking odd.
It's one of the weirdest.

3767
02:48:48,220 --> 02:48:50,470
It's one of the weirdest.
and you want to talk about a concussion?

3768
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:51,333
Oh yeah.
Like they must just be evolved or have 

3769
02:48:52,840 --> 02:48:54,580
really small brains are very tightly 
packed.

3770
02:48:54,581 --> 02:48:55,120
Brian's

3771
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:55,451
well,
you know,

3772
02:48:55,451 --> 02:48:58,780
sheep can slam into each other like 
super hard,

3773
02:48:59,110 --> 02:49:03,190
but their brains are literally connected
to their head different than ours are.

3774
02:49:03,220 --> 02:49:06,190
They're like,
they've evolved to absorb impact.

3775
02:49:06,340 --> 02:49:09,360
Yeah.
Rad would assume rams are too.

3776
02:49:09,450 --> 02:49:10,470
Yeah,
yeah,

3777
02:49:10,530 --> 02:49:12,420
that's,
that's insane.

3778
02:49:12,810 --> 02:49:15,000
Those wild desert bighorn sheep,
like,

3779
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:18,420
oh my god,
this is crazy.

3780
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:24,260
Like what a strange trait to develop to 
have neck fighting.

3781
02:49:24,361 --> 02:49:28,530
They're fighting like two snakes.
Oh my god.

3782
02:49:28,531 --> 02:49:30,060
I beat the fuck out of each other too.

3783
02:49:31,470 --> 02:49:32,303
See if you can find a,
a good video of a big horn sheep head 

3784
02:49:36,001 --> 02:49:36,330
button

3785
02:49:36,330 --> 02:49:37,163
each other because these fucking things.
They have these giant like battering 

3786
02:49:43,081 --> 02:49:43,914
rams that grow out of their heads and 
they like raise up and crash into each 

3787
02:49:49,771 --> 02:49:53,220
other and the sound sounds like a rifle 
going off.

3788
02:49:53,330 --> 02:49:55,140
Yeah.
And they do it in the mountains.

3789
02:49:56,390 --> 02:49:57,240
Oh,
these things,

3790
02:49:57,270 --> 02:50:02,270
these fucking things.
Living with jesus and decided to drink.

3791
02:50:15,090 --> 02:50:19,470
Oh my god.
Yeah.

3792
02:50:19,471 --> 02:50:21,060
We don't have to listen to what that guy
saying.

3793
02:50:21,061 --> 02:50:26,061
He just talking about snow on the ground
and the sheep are a going after it.

3794
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:29,430
It's crazy how hard they had head butt.
Each other.

3795
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:31,350
Boom.
Is that.

3796
02:50:31,351 --> 02:50:32,184
what was the,
the audio is from or was it from 

3797
02:50:33,331 --> 02:50:35,970
something else?
it's weird audio,

3798
02:50:36,360 --> 02:50:37,530
but they,
uh,

3799
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:40,920
they evolve to do this.
It's just such a strange trait.

3800
02:50:40,921 --> 02:50:43,260
Look at this.
Oh my god.

3801
02:50:43,261 --> 02:50:44,640
Play that back hoe.
Yeah,

3802
02:50:47,610 --> 02:50:52,530
that's a rifle.
They're getting rid of the fuck.

3803
02:50:52,531 --> 02:50:55,200
I think troy,
that's so weird.

3804
02:50:55,410 --> 02:50:57,330
These things are straight out of star 
wars.

3805
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:59,460
They really are.
Yeah.

3806
02:50:59,730 --> 02:51:01,260
I mean,
look at this fucking animal.

3807
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:04,470
Any kind of natural defense is always 
interesting.

3808
02:51:04,471 --> 02:51:07,500
A shell or a horn.
Yeah.

3809
02:51:08,030 --> 02:51:08,460
Oh,
there's,

3810
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:10,020
these things are dope as fuck man.

3811
02:51:11,030 --> 02:51:11,840
You know,
they uh,

3812
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:14,480
have brought them back to a lot of 
environments now.

3813
02:51:14,510 --> 02:51:14,980
They,
they,

3814
02:51:14,980 --> 02:51:17,630
they've transplanted them all throughout
the west.

3815
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:19,460
It's kind of interesting.
They did it.

3816
02:51:19,461 --> 02:51:21,560
They brought them to a bunch of 
different states.

3817
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:26,090
They took like a viable males and 
females and they installed them in these

3818
02:51:26,300 --> 02:51:29,480
areas and monitored their growth.
Are they indigenous to,

3819
02:51:29,990 --> 02:51:32,210
are they indigenous states?
They used to be.

3820
02:51:32,211 --> 02:51:35,090
Yes they are,
but they used to be in More areas.

3821
02:51:35,091 --> 02:51:37,910
They used to have a wider territory.
But what happened was,

3822
02:51:37,911 --> 02:51:42,320
I guess after world war or after the 
civil war,

3823
02:51:42,321 --> 02:51:44,870
rather,
there were a bunch of people that,

3824
02:51:44,871 --> 02:51:47,450
uh,
were market hunters and you know,

3825
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:48,333
the same type of people that shot all 
the buffalo for the hides and all that 

3826
02:51:50,541 --> 02:51:51,374
jazz.
They did that with a lot of animals all 

3827
02:51:53,331 --> 02:51:56,360
throughout the entire west and they,
you know,

3828
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:57,253
potentially wiped out or got close to 
having them wiped out like a bunch of 

3829
02:52:02,061 --> 02:52:02,894
different big game species like elk and 
deer and it took while to bring all 

3830
02:52:05,831 --> 02:52:06,010
those

3831
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:08,530
things back.
So what a lot of these,

3832
02:52:08,531 --> 02:52:09,364
uh,
conservation organizations are doing is 

3833
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:11,613
taking these things and dropping them 
off into the mountain someplaces then 

3834
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:17,110
monitoring them and making sure their 
population survive.

3835
02:52:17,650 --> 02:52:18,483
But it's,
it's,

3836
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:23,010
it's a fucking way to cool it vanana 
mall to not figure out how to bring it

3837
02:52:23,070 --> 02:52:25,160
back.
She got to bring it back to.

3838
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:28,380
I've seen them in the wild.
They are fucking cool.

3839
02:52:29,070 --> 02:52:29,903
They're cool.
And they seem Like they're nature's 

3840
02:52:31,261 --> 02:52:32,760
okay.
Despite the headbutting.

3841
02:52:33,210 --> 02:52:35,040
Oh no,
they're just chilling.

3842
02:52:35,190 --> 02:52:37,440
They just don't want that dude to fuck 
their girls.

3843
02:52:37,450 --> 02:52:38,840
Yeah.
Like tomorrow.

3844
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:40,450
So that we understand it.
Yeah.

3845
02:52:40,500 --> 02:52:41,333
As far as violence goes,
it's like probably like the nicest 

3846
02:52:43,441 --> 02:52:46,500
violence to us.
It would suck if they head butted us,

3847
02:52:46,830 --> 02:52:47,663
but it doesn't seem to bother them.
But I also would promise you that nfl 

3848
02:52:51,001 --> 02:52:53,010
players watch that and they're like,
yeah,

3849
02:52:53,540 --> 02:52:54,910
we get enough today.
Yeah.

3850
02:52:54,990 --> 02:52:59,190
Like before games and shIt,
maybe have nfl players have to evolve to

3851
02:52:59,191 --> 02:53:02,210
develop now a connection to their brain.
Like a ram's.

3852
02:53:02,270 --> 02:53:04,220
Yeah.
They need to heart.

3853
02:53:04,260 --> 02:53:06,780
I think it's gonna be awhile.
It's going to take a few deCades.

3854
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:08,340
You hear the helicopter,
by the way,

3855
02:53:09,300 --> 02:53:10,500
still still going on.

3856
02:53:10,980 --> 02:53:13,650
TheRe was some sort of a gas leak a few 
miles away.

3857
02:53:14,910 --> 02:53:16,860
Some shit went down.
Still going down.

3858
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:18,810
Still going down.
Um,

3859
02:53:20,190 --> 02:53:21,600
yeah.
I'm watching those things.

3860
02:53:21,601 --> 02:53:22,434
Head butt.
Each other make just makes you weirded 

3861
02:53:24,391 --> 02:53:27,030
out as to how the different ways that 
things evolve.

3862
02:53:27,031 --> 02:53:27,864
But they're all kind of life.
Like how strong the differences between 

3863
02:53:30,991 --> 02:53:31,824
an octopus that can get out of the hole,
the size of a quarter squeezes whole 

3864
02:53:35,161 --> 02:53:40,161
body through and that thing that slammed
his head into one of the other competing

3865
02:53:41,210 --> 02:53:45,540
man's raises up on his back legs and 
come crashing for it.

3866
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:47,640
And if they don't even budge,
man.

3867
02:53:47,880 --> 02:53:49,950
Yeah,
they collide with each other.

3868
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:52,470
It sounds like a gun went off and they 
just stare at each other.

3869
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:56,220
They're like such a cool animal.
They have giant nuts.

3870
02:53:56,340 --> 02:53:59,600
Huge that this is based on firsthand.
Okay.

3871
02:53:59,700 --> 02:54:00,533
Yeah.
It was pointed out to being by this guy 

3872
02:54:02,191 --> 02:54:03,024
steve rinella.

3873
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:04,250
It's amazing.
The,

3874
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:04,881
you know,
when you,

3875
02:54:04,881 --> 02:54:07,060
you think I don't see a lot of dick's 
day to day.

3876
02:54:07,570 --> 02:54:11,290
You see so many dicks like on animals 
and dogs.

3877
02:54:11,320 --> 02:54:12,610
It's crazy.
Yeah.

3878
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:15,580
And we are fine with animal dicks.
It's true.

3879
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:16,810
But human dx,
we are.

3880
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:20,740
We have laws about hm.
But we are living in a,

3881
02:54:20,830 --> 02:54:24,070
in a,
in a playground of fucking animal cock.

3882
02:54:24,330 --> 02:54:25,230
Well,
you know what I think,

3883
02:54:25,290 --> 02:54:28,860
I think people are supposed to live.
Um,

3884
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:32,190
I think like naturally like,
well we're inclined to live.

3885
02:54:32,220 --> 02:54:33,053
We're inclined to live in a place where 
you don't need to do anything as far as 

3886
02:54:34,981 --> 02:54:35,814
clothing.
If you go back to like the people that 

3887
02:54:37,501 --> 02:54:38,334
are the indigenous people in the amazon 
that are chilling and drinking iowasca 

3888
02:54:41,671 --> 02:54:44,100
and going fishing and growing their own 
vegetables,

3889
02:54:44,340 --> 02:54:46,430
they're basically naked,
right?

3890
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:48,120
Yeah.
Probably been like that forever.

3891
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:52,560
They're walking around barefoot when I 
think as soon as you put on clothes,

3892
02:54:53,340 --> 02:54:56,880
as soon as you can manipulate your 
environment and live in a spot where you

3893
02:54:56,881 --> 02:54:58,460
normally wouldn't be able to live,
but you figure

3894
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:01,040
say phoenix.
Oh yeah.

3895
02:55:01,041 --> 02:55:03,050
Perfect example.
Perfect.

3896
02:55:03,740 --> 02:55:04,160
My friend

3897
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:07,340
mike goldberg lives out there and he 
likes it.

3898
02:55:07,400 --> 02:55:09,490
He just goes from one air conditioned 
room,

3899
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:13,670
another air conditioner room workout in 
an air conditioned gym.

3900
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:17,510
Go home to an air conditioner in America
are either way too,

3901
02:55:17,540 --> 02:55:20,930
like how did you put up with this cold 
or how do you put up with this heat?

3902
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:22,273
I wonder if that could adversely affect 
your health if you're only breathing in 

3903
02:55:25,280 --> 02:55:26,230
air conditioned air.
Okay.

3904
02:55:26,330 --> 02:55:28,250
Time.
Oh yeah,

3905
02:55:28,251 --> 02:55:29,450
like mortality rates.
Yeah.

3906
02:55:29,451 --> 02:55:31,100
I wonder.
Probably not though,

3907
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:36,190
because the old people go to Florida and
they go to it.

3908
02:55:36,591 --> 02:55:37,640
Yeah.
They thrive.

3909
02:55:37,700 --> 02:55:39,380
It seems to put a couple of years on 
them.

3910
02:55:39,470 --> 02:55:40,303
Yeah.
I think struggling with your 

3911
02:55:41,721 --> 02:55:42,554
environment.
Yeah.

3912
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:44,390
Uh,
yeah.

3913
02:55:44,391 --> 02:55:48,560
People are less likely to have.
I think I can fuck with heat.

3914
02:55:48,561 --> 02:55:50,770
I could take phoenix way over.
Like Minnesota.

3915
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:52,600
Yeah.
A lot of people feel that way.

3916
02:55:52,601 --> 02:55:53,790
The like,
um,

3917
02:55:54,090 --> 02:55:56,980
the,
the negative aspects of heat is you just

3918
02:55:56,981 --> 02:55:57,814
have to turn the air conditioning.
The negative aspects of that cold is 

3919
02:56:00,451 --> 02:56:01,660
like,
nothing's happening.

3920
02:56:01,661 --> 02:56:04,410
You might get shut down the fucking 
power michael out.

3921
02:56:04,420 --> 02:56:06,270
You might have to light your couch on 
fire.

3922
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:07,660
Stay alive.
Yes.

3923
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:10,440
Whereas I feel like I could withstand.
Yeah,

3924
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:14,660
130 degrees if I had water.
Yeah.

3925
02:56:14,980 --> 02:56:16,170
Like here,
here's all the.

3926
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:17,013
You would have to have.
You'd have to have two things happen at 

3927
02:56:18,071 --> 02:56:18,904
the same time.
A pandemic epidemic as far as like a 

3928
02:56:21,071 --> 02:56:21,904
disease and power going out.
you'd have to have those two things 

3929
02:56:24,611 --> 02:56:28,330
happen in the winter and you,
the people that are supposed to turn the

3930
02:56:28,331 --> 02:56:29,980
power back on,
they're not going to go to work.

3931
02:56:30,060 --> 02:56:30,893
There's just some kind of an evil flu.
If you get near people and they Sneeze 

3932
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:35,770
on you,
you're going to be dead within 24 hours.

3933
02:56:35,771 --> 02:56:38,710
Like that's all possible.
That can happen.

3934
02:56:38,830 --> 02:56:39,663
And if that does happen and the power 
grid stays down duRing the winter in 

3935
02:56:43,301 --> 02:56:44,134
someplace and they can't figure out how 
to get people to go out there and fix 

3936
02:56:46,601 --> 02:56:47,434
it.
And

3937
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:49,930
yeah,
whereas what's the,

3938
02:56:51,110 --> 02:56:51,943
you look up the stats on heat hot when 
the air conditioning doesn't work after 

3939
02:56:55,350 --> 02:56:57,970
it's $500.
Fine.

3940
02:56:58,670 --> 02:57:00,260
Oh no,
you're 100 percent right.

3941
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:04,160
But you can take your shirt off his 
shade.

3942
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:08,000
You can lay in the pool,
sweat,

3943
02:57:08,250 --> 02:57:10,350
you sweat.
It's a natural thing.

3944
02:57:10,380 --> 02:57:13,770
There's negative known natural defenses 
against cold selling.

3945
02:57:13,830 --> 02:57:14,663
Pussy.
Jamie,

3946
02:57:15,290 --> 02:57:16,560
you know,
you sound like jamie.

3947
02:57:16,650 --> 02:57:20,700
Sound like a no good.
I went through a week with a no power in

3948
02:57:20,701 --> 02:57:23,490
the middle of an ice storm and we 
survived it.

3949
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:25,890
You got,
you can put on layers and get warm.

3950
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:27,053
You can,
you can start a fire if you want to get 

3951
02:57:28,801 --> 02:57:32,230
cold.
You can't get cold when it's 100.

3952
02:57:32,550 --> 02:57:34,380
I've seen that argument.
My buddy has an argument.

3953
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:36,060
It's a,
it makes sense,

3954
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:39,110
but I don't,
I don't mind super duper hotness though.

3955
02:57:39,390 --> 02:57:40,490
I just don't mind it.
Like I,

3956
02:57:40,530 --> 02:57:42,740
my body likes it better.
Yeah.

3957
02:57:43,340 --> 02:57:45,620
Well I think everybody's body is 
certainly different.

3958
02:57:45,980 --> 02:57:46,541
I mean,
you,

3959
02:57:46,541 --> 02:57:48,080
you'd have to wonder,
you know,

3960
02:57:48,081 --> 02:57:51,270
if they believe that there's certain 
people that have diets that um,

3961
02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:55,040
would better suit them because their 
ancestors came from certain parts of the

3962
02:57:55,041 --> 02:57:56,450
world.
Like that's the theory.

3963
02:57:56,930 --> 02:57:57,763
I think that that kind of makes sense 
that people would have a different 

3964
02:58:01,140 --> 02:58:02,970
temperature requirements as well.
You know,

3965
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,850
what makes them feel like it works?
Yeah.

3966
02:58:07,060 --> 02:58:10,050
I think it stands to reason.
It's like I don't have good circulation.

3967
02:58:10,560 --> 02:58:14,040
I just think that people in being able 
to manipulate the environment the way we

3968
02:58:14,041 --> 02:58:15,620
can.
We will.

3969
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:18,990
There's too many of us.
We couldn't stay in all the good spots.

3970
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:21,450
We can't all just live in which I live 
in san diego.

3971
02:58:21,451 --> 02:58:22,470
Yeah,
exactly.

3972
02:58:22,530 --> 02:58:24,120
In fact,
people don't even really want to live in

3973
02:58:24,121 --> 02:58:27,480
san diego and it's there now.
Sandra was here.

3974
02:58:27,750 --> 02:58:29,250
Yeah.
But san diego is amazing.

3975
02:58:29,310 --> 02:58:30,090
No,
I know that's.

3976
02:58:30,090 --> 02:58:30,923
But they still are like,
it's perfect climate and people are 

3977
02:58:32,521 --> 02:58:33,354
like,
no.

3978
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:35,610
I would even say san diego's not warm 
enough for me.

3979
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:38,040
Really.
I like la heat.

3980
02:58:38,280 --> 02:58:39,113
Wow.
Yeah.

3981
02:58:39,210 --> 02:58:40,043
You know what?
There's a lot of cool people in san 

3982
02:58:41,461 --> 02:58:42,294
diego.
I've always enjoyed hanging out with 

3983
02:58:43,711 --> 02:58:45,300
people in san diego.
I think it's a.

3984
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:50,430
It's an interesting combination between 
like military and like surfers.

3985
02:58:50,431 --> 02:58:52,710
Yeah.
They're not a very stressed out group.

3986
02:58:52,890 --> 02:58:54,090
No.
San diego.

3987
02:58:54,091 --> 02:58:55,830
Paypal.
I think it's a really good city,

3988
02:58:55,831 --> 02:58:57,450
man.
I think it's a really good city.

3989
02:58:57,960 --> 02:58:59,970
I think san diego is like probably one 
of my favorite.

3990
02:59:00,060 --> 02:59:00,893
Definitely one of my favorite cities in 
California and julia has the most 

3991
02:59:03,931 --> 02:59:04,764
ticklish audience is ticklish.
That's what I say when the crowds like 

3992
02:59:07,050 --> 02:59:07,950
so good.
You're like,

3993
02:59:07,980 --> 02:59:09,270
oh,
you guys are just ticklish.

3994
02:59:09,310 --> 02:59:10,610
That club is awesome.
Yeah.

3995
02:59:10,830 --> 02:59:12,330
The lawyer store.
Yeah.

3996
02:59:12,331 --> 02:59:14,160
I think I want to do that the next time 
I go back there.

3997
02:59:14,530 --> 02:59:15,200
You,
what?

3998
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:15,751
Do you do?
Theater?

3999
02:59:15,751 --> 02:59:16,441
Say?
Yeah,

4000
02:59:16,441 --> 02:59:18,540
I've been doing theaters there,
but uh,

4001
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:19,753
I,
I did a laughing skull in atlanta last 

4002
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:23,521
week.
Oh yeah,

4003
02:59:23,521 --> 02:59:25,830
that's really good.
It was so fun.

4004
02:59:25,850 --> 02:59:26,683
Yeah.
And it,

4005
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:29,240
it made me think like,
you know,

4006
02:59:29,670 --> 02:59:30,503
I got to do more little places as well.
How'd you end up doing the laughing 

4007
02:59:32,701 --> 02:59:33,534
skull?
because I wanted to do a small spot 

4008
02:59:34,860 --> 02:59:36,960
beCause I did the tabernacle there last 
time I was there.

4009
02:59:37,070 --> 02:59:37,903
Yeah.
And I want to fuck around and come up 

4010
02:59:38,881 --> 02:59:39,714
with some new stuff and I've got some 
stuff I'm working on and I just knew 

4011
02:59:42,331 --> 02:59:44,370
it'd be a real intimate,
real,

4012
02:59:44,371 --> 02:59:48,240
a real tight little crowd.
something like 80 people.

4013
02:59:48,470 --> 02:59:49,410
So.
Cool.

4014
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:50,700
What'd you charge?
20 bucks?

4015
02:59:51,010 --> 02:59:52,830
No,
nothing crazy.

4016
02:59:52,890 --> 02:59:54,650
Yeah.
But the um,

4017
02:59:54,660 --> 02:59:59,660
but it wasn't like a $100 gold circles.
It's comedy club prices.

4018
03:00:00,241 --> 03:00:01,074
It's a comedy club.
Comedy clubs are there are so important 

4019
03:00:04,471 --> 03:00:05,304
and a lot of people that like get to 
theaters and they get to that theater 

4020
03:00:08,971 --> 03:00:09,804
stage.
They never want to give back to the 

4021
03:00:11,881 --> 03:00:12,714
comedy clubs.
They always have this like weird 

4022
03:00:13,621 --> 03:00:15,690
adversarial relationship with club 
owners.

4023
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:17,100
But I'm always like,
look,

4024
03:00:17,610 --> 03:00:18,443
nobody's perfect here.
But if it wasn't for these people that 

4025
03:00:20,521 --> 03:00:23,350
are willing to open a comedy club,
crazy assholes,

4026
03:00:23,370 --> 03:00:25,260
like you and me wouldn't have any place 
to work,

4027
03:00:25,530 --> 03:00:27,600
we're not going to make our own club.
Right?

4028
03:00:27,870 --> 03:00:31,040
Like gods like that are awesome.
like bob fisher was the ice house.

4029
03:00:31,330 --> 03:00:34,740
like he's such a sweetheart of a guy 
that it it,

4030
03:00:34,910 --> 03:00:39,910
like it doesn't just benefit you to do 
it because it's a good thing financially

4031
03:00:40,231 --> 03:00:42,480
to help him and help that club,
but it's,

4032
03:00:42,570 --> 03:00:44,850
he's like,
you need people like that,

4033
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:46,800
like this.
The only way we ever get to work.

4034
03:00:47,370 --> 03:00:52,230
Same with comedy and magic club.
Oh my greatest.

4035
03:00:52,550 --> 03:00:54,900
Yeah.
He's the sweetest guy.

4036
03:00:54,970 --> 03:00:58,200
He's one of the nicest people that's 
ever walked the face of this planet.

4037
03:00:58,250 --> 03:00:59,260
Yeah.
Great.

4038
03:00:59,860 --> 03:01:00,040
Yeah,

4039
03:01:00,040 --> 03:01:00,873
man.
Look all the shit jamie masada takes a 

4040
03:01:03,341 --> 03:01:05,110
lot of heat,
but think about all the charitable stuff

4041
03:01:05,111 --> 03:01:06,460
that jane dishonest.
Absolutely.

4042
03:01:06,550 --> 03:01:08,590
Jamie masada has done a lot of great 
stuff.

4043
03:01:09,100 --> 03:01:09,933
He really has and he continues to work 
with a lot of underprivileged children 

4044
03:01:14,531 --> 03:01:17,840
and he does a lot of different kind of 
get to do comedy camp on saturday.

4045
03:01:17,841 --> 03:01:18,280
He,
yeah,

4046
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:19,680
he's a good dude.
Jamie.

4047
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:22,300
Jamie's good dude.
And we need all these folks,

4048
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:26,120
these folks and they need us and it's 
like it's.

4049
03:01:26,410 --> 03:01:27,243
But there's something that happens when 
people I think definitely happens when 

4050
03:01:31,241 --> 03:01:35,440
you don't get the respect,
you think that you deserve early on

4051
03:01:36,370 --> 03:01:38,090
comics club.
Yeah.

4052
03:01:38,091 --> 03:01:40,880
But that was the offers are pretty like,
yeah,

4053
03:01:40,910 --> 03:01:41,743
1500,
like really shitty sometimes and then 

4054
03:01:44,481 --> 03:01:46,490
they go like,
well you haven't done anything.

4055
03:01:46,540 --> 03:01:49,580
It's like the negotiation thing.
It's hard to forget that shit.

4056
03:01:49,730 --> 03:01:52,310
It is.
And it does become this thing of like it

4057
03:01:52,311 --> 03:01:54,980
forces you as a comic to go like,
well,

4058
03:01:54,981 --> 03:01:58,700
when I get the chance to fuck you,
you're going to get fucked.

4059
03:01:58,760 --> 03:02:00,830
Exactly the same way.
You're fucking me now.

4060
03:02:00,831 --> 03:02:03,380
And they do it too.
And they fucked pretty much everyone

4061
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:04,513
and the,
the developed this connection in their 

4062
03:02:06,711 --> 03:02:09,290
head.
The club owners that all the club owners

4063
03:02:09,291 --> 03:02:11,560
are adversarial with each other.
No.

4064
03:02:11,570 --> 03:02:12,420
With you?
Yeah.

4065
03:02:12,430 --> 03:02:14,320
Like this is,
these are all your advocacy.

4066
03:02:14,410 --> 03:02:15,880
Yeah.
This year,

4067
03:02:15,890 --> 03:02:16,830
the comic,
those,

4068
03:02:16,850 --> 03:02:18,220
the club owners,
they're trying to fuck you.

4069
03:02:18,500 --> 03:02:19,820
They're all pieces of shit.
Yeah.

4070
03:02:19,821 --> 03:02:22,270
You should give you your fucking money.
It should be happier there.

4071
03:02:22,550 --> 03:02:24,290
Yeah.
Opposite sides of the aisle.

4072
03:02:24,620 --> 03:02:25,580
Yeah,
absolutely.

4073
03:02:26,300 --> 03:02:29,160
It's like the weirdest relationship.
But if,

4074
03:02:29,230 --> 03:02:31,400
if there was no comedy clubs,
dude we do,

4075
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:35,090
we will be fucked.
We're so lucky that those goddamn things

4076
03:02:35,091 --> 03:02:37,040
exploded in the eighties.
Yeah.

4077
03:02:37,810 --> 03:02:40,400
Like when I think about like the lenny 
bruce days,

4078
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:42,720
when he first started out,
he used to have to mc.

4079
03:02:42,721 --> 03:02:43,554
He,
they're like,

4080
03:02:44,030 --> 03:02:45,830
yeah,
you still have to go on,

4081
03:02:45,831 --> 03:02:50,270
you do standup inbetween strippers or 
fucking or something along those lines.

4082
03:02:50,510 --> 03:02:52,420
Like there was no comedy clubs like 
they,

4083
03:02:52,730 --> 03:02:55,940
that's a really recent thing in terms of
like the last hundred years.

4084
03:02:56,110 --> 03:03:00,790
Well I was explaining to a buddy of mine
about the,

4085
03:03:01,150 --> 03:03:06,150
how comedy has become so necessary and I
think it's partially because of the news

4086
03:03:07,490 --> 03:03:12,490
in that when the news started,
every news division like lost money and,

4087
03:03:12,941 --> 03:03:13,774
but you,
in order to get a license you had to 

4088
03:03:15,191 --> 03:03:16,024
have a good news division.
And then in the eighties they 

4089
03:03:17,771 --> 03:03:22,771
deregulated it.
And then news became a profit center for

4090
03:03:23,141 --> 03:03:23,974
networks and,
and good journalism basically went out 

4091
03:03:26,831 --> 03:03:27,664
the window.
So guys like John Stewart and guys like 

4092
03:03:31,330 --> 03:03:32,163
Michael Moore and guys like chris rock 
and guys that were like political and 

4093
03:03:34,391 --> 03:03:39,391
had tv shows became almost like the 
function of um,

4094
03:03:40,060 --> 03:03:44,080
of news programs before this.
And I was explaining to him,

4095
03:03:44,120 --> 03:03:45,010
he was like,
oh,

4096
03:03:45,011 --> 03:03:45,844
okay.
Because I was finding someone like how 

4097
03:03:47,321 --> 03:03:48,154
john came,
how his rise to power and cole bear and 

4098
03:03:50,621 --> 03:03:52,900
all these people because there's no 
alternative.

4099
03:03:53,410 --> 03:03:54,243
You can't.
And now the internet you can get at 

4100
03:03:55,511 --> 03:03:59,210
least lIke reddit or,
or like there's a lot of shitty websites

4101
03:03:59,211 --> 03:04:02,080
with quote unquote news on them.
But,

4102
03:04:02,240 --> 03:04:04,760
but for a long time you couldn't get,
it was just,

4103
03:04:04,790 --> 03:04:09,790
there was a vacuum of like,
there's no big objective opinion or John

4104
03:04:10,010 --> 03:04:13,100
Oliver on hbo where he'll do these deep 
dives into,

4105
03:04:13,120 --> 03:04:16,580
cause no one else is going to do them 
because there's no money in them.

4106
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:19,580
Allegedly.
They'd rather do some sensational,

4107
03:04:20,150 --> 03:04:20,983
uh,
like the dumbest thing that the most 

4108
03:04:22,461 --> 03:04:24,300
recent dumping trumps that,
uh,

4109
03:04:24,470 --> 03:04:28,760
and there's no,
like there's a premium on,

4110
03:04:28,830 --> 03:04:32,420
on objective truth or at least subject 
funnily subjective truth.

4111
03:04:35,470 --> 03:04:36,460
Joe rogan,
your thoughts.

4112
03:04:36,550 --> 03:04:39,640
This is a weird time.
So weird time when it comes to,

4113
03:04:39,641 --> 03:04:44,641
uh,
trying to dis disassemble the way we've,

4114
03:04:46,390 --> 03:04:50,080
we've got this bizarre system set up the
way we've got it structured.

4115
03:04:50,740 --> 03:04:52,160
like we're getting older,
you know?

4116
03:04:52,540 --> 03:04:53,850
and as we get older,
we realized,

4117
03:04:53,851 --> 03:04:54,684
well,
we're just going to pass on this stupid 

4118
03:04:56,021 --> 03:04:58,600
system to the people that are coming 
next.

4119
03:04:58,630 --> 03:05:00,190
Yeah.
We haven't fixed anything.

4120
03:05:00,700 --> 03:05:01,440
That's the

4121
03:05:01,440 --> 03:05:04,650
one of the things I almost don't even 
know how to fix the shit.

4122
03:05:04,690 --> 03:05:07,420
Oh yeah,
it's looking real good question.

4123
03:05:07,930 --> 03:05:08,763
But there's an entanglement problem like
we were talking about earlier when we 

4124
03:05:11,881 --> 03:05:14,230
were talking about different ways that 
people are making money,

4125
03:05:14,920 --> 03:05:18,430
like there's so much money to be made.
Like we were talking about it in divorce

4126
03:05:18,431 --> 03:05:19,264
courts,
but think about how much money there is 

4127
03:05:21,161 --> 03:05:21,994
to be made in keeping this system of 
government exactly the same way it is 

4128
03:05:24,761 --> 03:05:25,594
right now.
Yeah.

4129
03:05:25,780 --> 03:05:27,820
There's so many jobs that are dependent 
upon it.

4130
03:05:28,090 --> 03:05:30,640
Like even if we think that it's a 
ridiculous idea,

4131
03:05:30,641 --> 03:05:32,770
we need to abolish the whole thing and 
start from scratch.

4132
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:35,020
What do we do with all those people that
are working for it?

4133
03:05:35,220 --> 03:05:36,053
Well,
the other thing I was thinking is 

4134
03:05:36,500 --> 03:05:37,333
there's people like the thing that I do 
like about the trump movement is people 

4135
03:05:39,971 --> 03:05:44,971
could just go and like know the system's
broken and it doesn't work for it.

4136
03:05:45,151 --> 03:05:45,984
Doesn't Work for people anymore because 
everybody is bought and paid for 

4137
03:05:48,570 --> 03:05:50,700
everybody in congress.
Lobbying is,

4138
03:05:50,760 --> 03:05:52,890
pays,
literally lobbyists,

4139
03:05:52,891 --> 03:05:54,090
right?
Laws,

4140
03:05:54,270 --> 03:05:57,180
so people and people don't like it and 
they don't know how to stop it.

4141
03:05:57,230 --> 03:05:59,310
Right.
So you've got people.

4142
03:05:59,400 --> 03:06:00,750
I've got a system.
People go,

4143
03:06:00,990 --> 03:06:01,823
well,
do you know anyone that you think would 

4144
03:06:03,571 --> 03:06:05,160
run for office?
No.

4145
03:06:05,250 --> 03:06:06,083
Do you know what I mean?
And as much as it's like because it's a 

4146
03:06:08,041 --> 03:06:10,980
weird job into,
I don't know anyone who's just like that

4147
03:06:10,981 --> 03:06:15,030
ideologically driven and could navigate 
the way it is now.

4148
03:06:15,031 --> 03:06:16,760
So as much as I'm like,
well they're going to change.

4149
03:06:16,800 --> 03:06:18,990
We're going to shake the system up to 
what?

4150
03:06:19,270 --> 03:06:22,060
but it's not just that stop and think 
about what it is.

4151
03:06:22,061 --> 03:06:27,061
It's like to elect a leader for someone 
to campaign and tell you that they would

4152
03:06:28,691 --> 03:06:31,840
make the best leader.
Like all throughout history,

4153
03:06:31,841 --> 03:06:32,674
the people that are proclaiming 
themselves to be the ones that you 

4154
03:06:35,981 --> 03:06:38,790
should follow are almost always the ones
you should never fall.

4155
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:39,633
Exactly right.
so when someone is proclaiming 

4156
03:06:41,231 --> 03:06:42,064
themselves to be capable of leading this
land and I am going to be your king and 

4157
03:06:45,671 --> 03:06:48,100
I will take you to the highest heights.

4158
03:06:49,230 --> 03:06:50,063
Right.
But I don't even think I needed to do 

4159
03:06:51,231 --> 03:06:51,900
that.
Right.

4160
03:06:51,900 --> 03:06:53,480
Well,
the chance to do that,

4161
03:06:53,481 --> 03:06:54,860
you'd have to kill the king.
You have to be the.

4162
03:06:55,640 --> 03:06:56,340
Yeah.

4163
03:06:56,340 --> 03:06:59,520
But this is essentially the same model,
right?

4164
03:06:59,550 --> 03:07:01,080
That they're doing when they're running 
for president,

4165
03:07:01,081 --> 03:07:04,890
even though we know that that's not the 
kind of personality trait that you would

4166
03:07:04,891 --> 03:07:05,724
want from a leader,
you would want someone who's who's not 

4167
03:07:10,291 --> 03:07:13,050
in any way promoting of themselves.

4168
03:07:13,650 --> 03:07:14,830
Yeah.
A selfless,

4169
03:07:15,490 --> 03:07:20,490
selfless person who does this thing 
that's incredibly a self interested

4170
03:07:20,730 --> 03:07:25,530
and they would have to figure out how to
have fairly monitor this.

4171
03:07:25,660 --> 03:07:29,250
The society that we live in had a fairly
well.

4172
03:07:29,300 --> 03:07:31,140
When do you decide when you put people 
in jail,

4173
03:07:31,320 --> 03:07:32,153
when do you do?
Do we throw all the old rules out and 

4174
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:37,350
completely look at them all with new 
facts and new ideas?

4175
03:07:37,610 --> 03:07:38,443
Did we just.
Is it like there's a lot of weird drug 

4176
03:07:40,411 --> 03:07:41,244
arguments where there's certain drugs 
that are illegal that are way more 

4177
03:07:43,471 --> 03:07:44,304
dangerous in certain drugs that are 
illegal and then you look at this money 

4178
03:07:46,891 --> 03:07:48,450
trail behind all that and you're like,
okay,

4179
03:07:48,451 --> 03:07:51,450
how can you guys still do this?
Like how can you still do this?

4180
03:07:51,570 --> 03:07:52,403
Like let's,
we should make things legal that the 

4181
03:07:55,021 --> 03:07:58,770
scientists agree should be legal and 
then everything else is dangerous.

4182
03:07:58,771 --> 03:08:03,771
we should figure out how to regulate it,
but you can't decide like why?

4183
03:08:03,840 --> 03:08:07,530
Why is everybody deciding based on like 
ancient information?

4184
03:08:07,640 --> 03:08:08,690
Right.
It doesn't make any sense.

4185
03:08:08,691 --> 03:08:11,630
Socratically elected government and.
But the p again,

4186
03:08:11,631 --> 03:08:14,370
it attracts the wrong kinds of people.
It's a,

4187
03:08:14,430 --> 03:08:16,880
it's like churchill or somebody said 
it's the,

4188
03:08:17,420 --> 03:08:21,050
it's the,
it's the best of all the bad systems.

4189
03:08:21,170 --> 03:08:22,040
Oh yeah.
For sure.

4190
03:08:22,070 --> 03:08:27,070
Obama released a or exonerated a bunch 
of drug war victims today,

4191
03:08:30,020 --> 03:08:32,930
which I thought it was fascinating thing
is a few hundred.

4192
03:08:33,020 --> 03:08:34,640
Yeah,
I think like 300,

4193
03:08:34,641 --> 03:08:35,550
something like that.
Yeah.

4194
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:40,040
Which is what I hope he said don't like 
if you fuck up,

4195
03:08:40,970 --> 03:08:41,803
you're fucking me.
Basically the poets who knows what kind 

4196
03:08:45,351 --> 03:08:49,640
of damage is done for time.
Guy can't vote,

4197
03:08:50,320 --> 03:08:52,610
can't,
can't get most jobs.

4198
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:53,760
right.
Uh,

4199
03:08:54,680 --> 03:08:55,730
yeah.
It's like a very,

4200
03:08:55,731 --> 03:08:58,550
very fucked up system.
How does that work?

4201
03:08:58,710 --> 03:08:59,543
Are you an ex felon?
If the president you have to clean out 

4202
03:09:03,710 --> 03:09:05,450
of you're exonerated?
I don't know.

4203
03:09:05,570 --> 03:09:06,520
Does that make you,
uh,

4204
03:09:06,650 --> 03:09:07,670
ever pardoned?

4205
03:09:07,700 --> 03:09:11,120
She's been touched by magic.
You've been touched by magic.

4206
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:12,133
The president has magic.
He can tell the court that they have to 

4207
03:09:15,501 --> 03:09:17,220
let people out of jail.
Yeah.

4208
03:09:17,290 --> 03:09:18,123
How old is that wacky idea?
That might be the wackiest of all the 

4209
03:09:23,130 --> 03:09:24,000
people.
Like I'm going to.

4210
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:24,873
Yeah.
You can decide that the gardendale 

4211
03:09:26,130 --> 03:09:28,930
killed people should get free.
Yeah.

4212
03:09:28,980 --> 03:09:31,220
Because you're the king.
Hinkley went free the other day.

4213
03:09:31,440 --> 03:09:32,480
See that?
What?

4214
03:09:32,570 --> 03:09:33,470
Yeah,
what?

4215
03:09:33,500 --> 03:09:34,580
He's out on the streets,
man.

4216
03:09:34,581 --> 03:09:37,340
He might be listening to us last week.
John hinckley,

4217
03:09:37,580 --> 03:09:39,460
the one who shot reagan.
Yeah.

4218
03:09:39,650 --> 03:09:41,300
Holy shit.
They let him free.

4219
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:44,480
Yeah.
They're trying to get obama killed after

4220
03:09:44,481 --> 03:09:46,030
35 years.
Who was he trying to say?

4221
03:09:46,130 --> 03:09:46,963
Wow.
He was trying to impress jodie foster's 

4222
03:09:48,431 --> 03:09:49,920
right message.
He was.

4223
03:09:49,970 --> 03:09:54,430
It turns out you were barking up the 
wrong tree for and she don't like dudes.

4224
03:09:54,520 --> 03:09:56,290
Hey bro,
you don't know about that.

4225
03:09:56,510 --> 03:09:57,550
Um,
the,

4226
03:09:58,070 --> 03:10:03,070
she's out the right guy with the right 
deck to this spot with the right dick.

4227
03:10:03,610 --> 03:10:06,340
Brought it back to back to the land of 
the heroes.

4228
03:10:06,430 --> 03:10:07,630
I gotta get outta here.
Joe.

4229
03:10:07,780 --> 03:10:08,780
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Dude.

4230
03:10:08,800 --> 03:10:10,720
I did want to tell the people that I 
will be,

4231
03:10:10,750 --> 03:10:13,030
uh,
in chicago and,

4232
03:10:13,090 --> 03:10:15,520
and uh,
and madison,

4233
03:10:15,521 --> 03:10:17,290
Wisconsin,
the 18th and 19th.

4234
03:10:17,291 --> 03:10:19,810
Go to [inaudible] dot com.
Where is it?

4235
03:10:19,811 --> 03:10:21,680
What do you do in chicago?
I'm doing three myths.

4236
03:10:21,870 --> 03:10:26,490
Three valiant theater.
follow your theater.

4237
03:10:27,370 --> 03:10:29,080
Chicago's got a lot of cool old theater.
Yeah,

4238
03:10:29,081 --> 03:10:31,120
it's cool.
And I'm the madison.

4239
03:10:31,121 --> 03:10:35,380
I'm doing The majestic and then I'm 
shooting three mics in los angeles.

4240
03:10:35,740 --> 03:10:37,840
September ninth.
Don't have a venue yet,

4241
03:10:37,841 --> 03:10:41,560
but majestic theater in madison,
Wisconsin or said that's a dope spot.

4242
03:10:41,950 --> 03:10:43,270
Yeah.
So you,

4243
03:10:43,271 --> 03:10:45,070
um,
you don't change shirts or anything?

4244
03:10:45,071 --> 03:10:46,150
Do you know?

4245
03:10:46,180 --> 03:10:49,570
Same shirt,
had wardrobe changes?

4246
03:10:49,670 --> 03:10:51,280
Yeah,
it'd be pretty great costume on.

4247
03:10:51,480 --> 03:10:52,510
Um,
so,

4248
03:10:52,511 --> 03:10:53,470
uh,
so yeah,

4249
03:10:53,471 --> 03:10:57,780
so three mikes September 9th and la go 
to [inaudible] dot com and,

4250
03:10:57,790 --> 03:10:58,623
or follow me on twitter,
I'll update it and 18th in madison of 

4251
03:11:01,571 --> 03:11:06,571
august and 19th of August in chicago.
I'd hopefully delved enough into that.

4252
03:11:07,811 --> 03:11:10,330
A magnetic treatment for depression.
Yeah,

4253
03:11:10,450 --> 03:11:12,640
look it up if you're interested because 
it's really,

4254
03:11:12,641 --> 03:11:13,810
really.
It was very,

4255
03:11:13,811 --> 03:11:18,340
it's nothing has been more helpful to me
in my entire career of depression.

4256
03:11:18,400 --> 03:11:22,210
Is it available to everybody?
I mean it's tests thing.

4257
03:11:22,240 --> 03:11:23,110
Yeah,
you can look it up.

4258
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:24,640
Like I said,
it's covered by blue cross,

4259
03:11:24,641 --> 03:11:26,500
so it's a really impressive.
Yeah,

4260
03:11:26,501 --> 03:11:29,830
it's a hugely helpful and the numbers 
are really good.

4261
03:11:30,330 --> 03:11:31,163
Uh,
there's a new one also called like I 

4262
03:11:33,181 --> 03:11:37,210
want to call like feta burst or alpha 
burst cmt,

4263
03:11:37,450 --> 03:11:39,340
but they're using the cmt shit for tons 
of,

4264
03:11:39,370 --> 03:11:40,650
like you were saying about that radio 
lab,

4265
03:11:41,170 --> 03:11:43,840
they're using it for tons of different 
brain areas and it's.

4266
03:11:43,930 --> 03:11:45,970
And it's really effective.
So I,

4267
03:11:45,971 --> 03:11:48,190
and I'd say that having experienced it 
firsthand,

4268
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:49,113
it's kind of crazy.
We're juicing our brains up with 

4269
03:11:51,130 --> 03:11:53,700
electricity and firing them up.
Who gets her?

4270
03:11:54,550 --> 03:11:55,900
Yeah.
Good.

4271
03:11:56,110 --> 03:11:58,990
We're gonna have magneto helmets one day
for sure.

4272
03:11:59,110 --> 03:11:59,943
Right,
like the x men dude to put that helmet 

4273
03:12:01,781 --> 03:12:04,270
on and all the magnets and he would 
float through the air.

4274
03:12:04,390 --> 03:12:05,223
yeah,
we're going to pull those fucking 

4275
03:12:05,830 --> 03:12:07,540
things.
We just got to make it to the,

4276
03:12:07,830 --> 03:12:10,750
to we're going to make it past or are 
failing bodies,

4277
03:12:10,780 --> 03:12:13,540
but once we get there,
I think one of these cranial helmets,

4278
03:12:13,541 --> 03:12:15,730
if they had a cranial helmet that came 
up with that,

4279
03:12:15,731 --> 03:12:16,564
how these electrodes just constantly was
zapping your brain while you're walking 

4280
03:12:18,911 --> 03:12:20,520
around with it on.
Yeah.

4281
03:12:20,590 --> 03:12:22,270
See your life clear.
Yes.

4282
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:24,820
Yes.
You know your boy joe.

4283
03:12:24,821 --> 03:12:26,380
Everybody knows that.
You're a good man as well.

4284
03:12:26,410 --> 03:12:27,430
Yeah.
Thank you.
