1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Her freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,350
What does Michael Phelps
listened to who might be down 10

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,150
he doesn't give a fuck.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,463
That is weird,

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,921
but the,

6
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:13,720
I think you just got to be that guy.

7
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:14,830
If you want to be that good,

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,840
who else is as good as him?

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,040
Nobody ever.

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,580
Right.

11
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,570
Who else has that intense?

12
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:20,404
Nobody.

13
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:20,890
Nobody.

14
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,270
He takes it all to the next level.

15
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,890
God Damn crazy people out
there winning gold medals.

16
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,980
It's pretty fucking impressive.

17
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:29,731
Smokes a lot of weed.

18
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,550
I hear.

19
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,380
Yeah.

20
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,250
[inaudible] did you hear
about the DEA this morning?

21
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,870
That really pissed me off.

22
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,400
They decided not to
reclassify marijuana weight.

23
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,830
So they're keeping it in
the same category as heroin.

24
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,801
Yeah.

25
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,420
Of stuff.

26
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,540
They decided that it
has no medical benefits.

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,590
Now how?

28
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,340
Why can't we

29
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,030
take him to one of these kids that
have seizures and just go here,

30
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:52,510
watch,

31
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,880
see seizure now see no seizure.

32
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,361
Okay.

33
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:56,200
Shut the fuck up.

34
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,981
You know,

35
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,770
common sense knows common sensor,

36
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:58,911
right?

37
00:00:58,911 --> 00:00:59,020
Yeah.

38
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,231
Yeah.

39
00:00:59,231 --> 00:00:59,741
I mean that's,

40
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:00,880
that's definitely evidence.

41
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,710
But I mean there's many,

42
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:03,670
many cases of that.

43
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,750
That is evidence that there's this test
being done on these children in the real

44
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,070
world and it's working.

45
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:09,881
I mean,

46
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:11,530
whether or not it's scientific,

47
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,250
you know,

48
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,090
double blind,

49
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:14,380
placebo controlled evidence.

50
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:14,561
No,

51
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:19,180
but there's plenty of evidence about
the medicinal benefits of cannabis.

52
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,140
There's a plenty of it.

53
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:20,561
There's plenty,

54
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:20,830
there's,

55
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,220
there's all sorts of data that seems to
indicate that it has some sort of a role

56
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,780
in reducing tumors.

57
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:26,860
It can,

58
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,110
it definitely helps people with anxiety.

59
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:29,381
There's a,

60
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,620
there's a lot of factors
that it does that.

61
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,454
Like,

62
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:33,971
you know,

63
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:34,701
when Neil Brennan was on,

64
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,550
he was talking about
antidepressants and he was like,

65
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:38,980
they don't exactly know how they work.

66
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,840
And that's a really good point.

67
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,750
But they sell fucking ton of
different kinds of antidepressants.

68
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,850
They know how cannabis works.

69
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,640
They know that there's canaveroid
receptors in the human mind,

70
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,850
meaning the human brain is designed or
grew up or developed alongside cannabis.

71
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,490
It knows what to do with it.

72
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,650
So when you take marijuana,

73
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,440
your body knows what it is.

74
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,570
Your body even produces some sort of
cannabinoid response when you run.

75
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,790
That's part of what you're
getting in the runner's high.

76
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,560
They say it's similar.

77
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,610
Is that correct?

78
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,443
I think that's correct.

79
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,110
How is this a true statement that they
add in there that they don't know the

80
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:19,830
drug's chemistry is not
known or reproducible?

81
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,160
I like that it says no current obsession
accepted medical use because the drug's

82
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:28,600
chemistry is not reproducible,

83
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,081
not known,

84
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,340
and reproducible means what?

85
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,120
What does that mean?

86
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,900
Meaning drugs.

87
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,800
Chemistry is not known in reproducing.

88
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,680
Meaning they can't create it in a lab.

89
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,390
Yeah,

90
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,220
or they can't make two of the same.

91
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Maybe they get,

92
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,100
you can't keep the same cue.

93
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,290
You can't clone the same
person over and over again.

94
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,220
Every time you it's a different

95
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,190
maybe because when you
get it as marijuana,

96
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,190
there's hundreds of different
types of cannabinoids apparently,

97
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,380
and you're not just getting THC.

98
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:58,700
You're getting all kinds of other
groovy shit in there to create a fee.

99
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,651
Yeah.

100
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:02,320
I think there's a ton of
different types of cannabinoids.

101
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,590
Let's go download a little fucking
information whole young Jamie.

102
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,730
How many things,

103
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,361
I'm going to guess.

104
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,850
There's a hundred different
types of cannabinoids.

105
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,153
What do you think?

106
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,350
I would guess over a thousand.

107
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:14,980
Ooh,

108
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,920
Jesus Christ.

109
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,730
I also think it's 12
hours to the Pentagon.

110
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,380
85 cannabis contains at least
85 types of cannabinoids.

111
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:23,651
Many,

112
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,690
which have documented medical value.

113
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,270
That was 2014 they're
probably found new ones,

114
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:28,960
bitch.

115
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,291
Okay.

116
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:34,291
Now there's only over 480
natural components found in
the cannabis sativa plant.

117
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay,

118
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,033
there you go.

119
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,450
So that's different.

120
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,390
So it's 480 natural components.

121
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,420
So 113 different cannabinoids
says one in wicken in Wikipedia.

122
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,800
So you know it's real.

123
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,503
Um,

124
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,111
scroll down.

125
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,471
One more.

126
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:50,901
The one that,

127
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:52,270
this is how many different cannabinoids?

128
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,513
That's right.

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,550
64.

130
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,031
Yeah,

131
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:55,351
see,

132
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:55,640
so it,

133
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,260
so it varies.

134
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,660
The answers vary depending
on studying year.

135
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:00,040
This is the most recent one,

136
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,440
right?

137
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,020
This is 2015 claim.

138
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,990
Going back to the marijuana
thing with the DEA,

139
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,230
they had that happen.

140
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:12,550
They had to read or do that because the
governor got so many sign petitions or

141
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,570
assigned names that it forced them
to have to reclassify the marijuana.

142
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,670
I didn't know what governor,

143
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,400
but whoever it was,

144
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,791
you know,

145
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,241
if they,

146
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:22,421
uh,

147
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,360
they acquiesce to the
demands of the Internet.

148
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:25,930
Right.

149
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,610
We definitely didn't do enough then.

150
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,001
So,

151
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,930
so if chatting more ramped up in that
and they say that they couldn't clap,

152
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:32,681
reclassified,

153
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,560
they had to keep it the same because they
couldn't find any health benefits from

154
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:35,651
it.

155
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,070
Right.

156
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,070
So what happens if that same governor
gets all the signatures to reclassify

157
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:43,210
cigarettes or alcohol,

158
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,620
what would the da has to say then
for the health benefits of those two?

159
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,020
Would they have to
reclassify it as illegal?

160
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,950
It's a very good point.

161
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,061
Let's try it.

162
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:52,710
See what happens.

163
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,620
I would love to see what happens.

164
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:54,454
It's a very good point.

165
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,743
It's a very good point.

166
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,460
And here's another really good point.

167
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,330
They,

168
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,990
they're classifying it in schedule
one cause that's where it's been.

169
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,750
And because they're,

170
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,440
they claim there's no known medical
use or it can't be reproducible,

171
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,120
whatever the fuck that means,

172
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,230
you can grow it dummy.

173
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,610
You can get clones and grill it.

174
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:13,600
Of course it's three Bruceville.

175
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,160
It's just reproducible as a plant.

176
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,650
So what they're saying is it
trying to classify it as a drug?

177
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,320
What they're almost admitting themselves.

178
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:20,771
If,

179
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,570
if what we're thinking is true.

180
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,190
If what they're saying is that you can't,

181
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,500
it's not reproducible because it's not a
chemical that you can break down into a

182
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:29,831
pill.

183
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:30,664
If that's what they're saying,

184
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,270
like you can't standardize it because
it's too wild and it's free and it's

185
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:34,750
growing.

186
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,810
That's almost a perfect example.

187
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,290
The fact that you're,

188
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,280
you're not,

189
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,151
you're,

190
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,700
it shouldn't be in a position
where you're controlling a plant.

191
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,360
You shouldn't have be in a position
where you're regulating nature,

192
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,320
but that's,

193
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,790
so you're almost admitting it yourself.

194
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,600
It's a repeat.

195
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,860
It's not reproducible.

196
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,490
Okay.

197
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,480
If that's what you're saying,

198
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,920
then you're saying it's not a drug.

199
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:54,611
Okay,

200
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:54,791
so,

201
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,260
but it has a psychoactive effect.

202
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,990
Okay.

203
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,290
Now you have to prove that
psychoactive effect is dangerous.

204
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,363
Go ahead.

205
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,490
There's nothing that's the real problem.

206
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:09,260
The real problem is classified in
the category of the most dangerous,

207
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,430
harmful drugs.

208
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,040
There's no evidence that that's should,

209
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,240
that should be correct.

210
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,103
There's no evidence.

211
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,910
So that's where the DEA is failing.

212
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,940
They're failing way more
in that than they are.

213
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:23,390
And even not admitting that
there's medical evidence.

214
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,450
Cause if you wanted to follow it
to the strictest sense of the word,

215
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,090
what studies have been done that
have absolutely been proven in,

216
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:30,860
you know,

217
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,310
a new modern form of like the,

218
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,960
the most current science.

219
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,230
What studies have been done that show
the medical benefits of cannabis?

220
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,411
Well,

221
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,730
I'm not how many studies being done,

222
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,520
but it's because it's
classified as schedule one,

223
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:48,260
it's a total catch 22 it's hard to get
studies done because it's a schedule one.

224
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,400
And so you can't prove,

225
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,740
it shouldn't be a schedule one
because there's not very many studies.

226
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,260
But there's a ton of studies that
had been done by universities.

227
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,740
There's a ton of studies that
have shown positive benefits.

228
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,270
If you want to go back into history,

229
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:01,010
even back into the Nixon administration,

230
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,160
they were running studies that they
buried the results because the results

231
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,900
showed no harm.

232
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,010
They showed nothing.

233
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,730
They can't.

234
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,860
So when you follow just straight science,

235
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,210
there's no,

236
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,220
there's no evidence whatsoever.

237
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,060
It should be illegal.

238
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,560
That's the most important thing.

239
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
It's not the evidence of
whether it should be legal.

240
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:18,950
That's like,

241
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,500
you know the whole thing about
you're innocent until proven guilty.

242
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,480
It should be the same way about marijuana.

243
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,140
It should be that you can't just make
it illegal and say it has to remain

244
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:35,351
illegal because we don't know what it can
do because you do know what we can do.

245
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:35,811
You do.

246
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:36,411
You definitely know.

247
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,240
Why do you think of the
millions of people like it?

248
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,260
Are they all crazy?

249
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,423
What's going on?

250
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,100
All these millions and millions
of adults that live in America,

251
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,120
are they fucking crazy?

252
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,403
So what are you saying?

253
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,240
You're saying you're smarter than them.

254
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,700
Why don't you talk about it with
somebody that knows what the fuck they're

255
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,080
talking about and you'll get buried.

256
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,240
Talk about it with a person who's like,

257
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,970
talk about it with like Todd
McCormick commanded Todd McCormick.

258
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,230
Having a debate with one of these DEA
guys about whether or not marijuana is

259
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,010
beneficial.

260
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,460
He survived cancer because of
it mean a lot of people have,

261
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:06,860
we have friends that have
kids that have autism.

262
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,520
They give their fucking kids this medical
cannabis and all of a sudden they can

263
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,210
talk,

264
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,991
they relaxed,

265
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,400
they stop having seizures.

266
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,270
It's a massive benefit to a lot of people.

267
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,800
It relaxes people,

268
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,210
makes people feel good,

269
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,690
and we have a government agency in 2016
that ignores all of that and wants to

270
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:30,560
keep it in a category of some of the
most harmful and dangerous drugs these

271
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,121
people have.

272
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:35,570
Like living in an episode of Hawaii
five o the limit in the past,

273
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,910
they're like 1950s people.

274
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,080
And what they think they
can do is like keep this,

275
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,350
this bureaucracy in this paperwork and
he's classifications in in movement and

276
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,990
they can head off freedom because what
they're trying to do is they're trying to

277
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,980
stop freedom.

278
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,050
And one of the reasons why the Trump's
trying to stop freedom is because they

279
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,070
benefit from it.

280
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,660
They benefit from stopping it.

281
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,980
They have more agents.

282
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,671
If those eight,

283
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,980
if all of a sudden most drugs are legal,

284
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,220
what are those fucking thousands
of Dea agents going to do?

285
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,770
They have,

286
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,610
they're protecting their own industry.

287
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,810
This is a natural thing that any organism
does when it's threatened and if you

288
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,810
start making drugs legal and
you start opening up that,

289
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,870
that conversation like who the fuck is
any one adult to tell any other adult

290
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,850
what's good or bad for you?

291
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,290
When a lot of shit we do,

292
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,490
whether it's the food we eat,

293
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,241
the alcohol,

294
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,200
we drank the cigarettes,

295
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:34,110
we smoke the fucking sugar in our diet.

296
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,310
All these things are bad for us.

297
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,150
We all know that,

298
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,660
but we were afraid it was the government
going to come in with a fucking machine

299
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,300
guns to stop you from eating a
chocolate cake and smoking a cigarette.

300
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,193
Fuck that.

301
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,650
Right?

302
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,910
I think we all agree on that.

303
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,040
If they can't do that,

304
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,050
they shouldn't be able to
stop you from smoking weed.

305
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,460
This is archaic.

306
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,670
This is like this is some ancient fucking
vampire shit and they're clinging to

307
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:56,670
civilization.

308
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,140
They are totally irrelevant,

309
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,400
totally irrelevant.

310
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,960
Your decision should be made 100% on
the facts that are available today.

311
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,093
You can go,

312
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,100
you could research all the
facts about matter marijuana.

313
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
You find a few that make correlations
between some sort of mental illnesses,

314
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,050
but those core,

315
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,070
most of the time,

316
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,430
at least according to experts that
I've listened to talk about it,

317
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,910
the correlations of
schizophrenia to marijuana use
are directly in proportionate

318
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,110
with the quote,

319
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,350
the numbers of schizophrenia for any
given population that there's always going

320
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:33,090
to be around 1% of the population that
suffers from some type of schizophrenia

321
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,340
or severe mental distraction,

322
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:35,940
illness.

323
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,080
You know a bunch of different categories,

324
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:39,090
these little various mental diseases,

325
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,560
but it's always that number.

326
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,060
So if they smoked pot,

327
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,610
it's just a thousand people,

328
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,010
you know that smoked
pot have schizophrenia.

329
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,963
Okay.

330
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,960
If there was the same amount of
people and they didn't smoke pot,

331
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,440
it might be the same
amount of schizophrenia x,

332
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,190
they might not even be connected.

333
00:10:56,191 --> 00:11:00,300
But when you're talking about 300 million
people and you say 30,000 people got

334
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,500
schizophrenia for marijuana,

335
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,000
are you fucking sure?

336
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,900
Are you really fucking sure or has it
just 30,000 people have schizophrenia and

337
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,040
they also smoke marijuana
cause this is the part,

338
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,950
this is a real problem with the way they
present the data cause it's just like

339
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:18,720
you coming up to me or to Jamie and
you saying that you've got new rules.

340
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,360
You as a 42 year old grown ass man,

341
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,800
you have new rules and we,

342
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,600
you don't want us
drinking alcohol anymore.

343
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,261
You're going to,

344
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:29,310
you're going to come in and you've hired
guards to keep us from smoking alcohol

345
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,240
or drinking alcohol.

346
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,370
It's the same thing.

347
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,260
If it's 50,000 people with
some big building with three
letters in the front of

348
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:41,910
it or whether it's one crazy fuck who
wants to stop his neighbor from smoking

349
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:42,240
pot?

350
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,200
It's the same thing.

351
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,860
You're trying to stop someone from
doing something that's not bad.

352
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,540
Like you can't do that.

353
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,640
You don't have any evidence that it's bad.

354
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,980
There should be a fuck load of
evidence that it's bad and it should

355
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
be as much or worse than all the shit
that you know is bad that you sell open

356
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,360
and make money from taxes,

357
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,170
alcohol,

358
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,780
alcohol,

359
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,970
which we both love.

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,391
I love.

361
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,130
But here's a great example of getting him.

362
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:06,964
I talk a lot.

363
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,710
They just research released a study that
I think this week showing the like they

364
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:16,711
proved scientifically that
a weed is better for sex
and they not only did it for

365
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,001
pleasures,

366
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:22,030
but they also explained
how when you have alcohol,

367
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,991
you a,

368
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,160
you cheat more,

369
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,721
you,

370
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:25,960
you do bad things,

371
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,180
you hook up with people he shouldn't do.

372
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,330
You don't use condoms.

373
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,890
Like do a lot of shit
that lot of people change.

374
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm on team boobs,

375
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,950
let's do this danger style.

376
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,320
But it's shit that is life changing.

377
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,410
Getting a girl pregnant that you hope
met at a bar that looked hot last night.

378
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:42,580
You wake up and it's a dog.

379
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:42,910
You know,

380
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,420
like all the dog you talking
about a woman and woman human.

381
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
How dare you?

382
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,381
No,

383
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:48,700
I'm fine.

384
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,530
Was that slut shaming about shits?

385
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,383
Actual dog.

386
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,040
Okay.
