1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,053
We're,
we're about as lucky as human beings 

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,190
ever get to be.
Do,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,631
do,
do,

4
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:09,180
do,
do I,

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,170
we live body wise,
we're live on podcast wise.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,273
Greg and I were just talking about Greg 
for people don't know Greg Fitzsimmons 

7
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:19,050
and I have been friends for like 28 
years,

8
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:23,430
28 years to roll his fucking God damn 
fucked.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,283
We started out as raw open.
Miker is almost exactly at the same 

10
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,940
time.
Yeah,

11
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,010
but I was dreaming about it since I was 
a kid.

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:32,844
When did you,
when did you think that it might be 

13
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:34,914
something you want to do?
Because I was grabbing microphones when 

14
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:39,360
I was fucking eight telling jokes into 
them.

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,190
No Shit.
That's awesome.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,520
Oh Man.
It wasn't until I was like 21,

17
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:45,354
like right before I did it,
like maybe 20 or 21 and one of the 

18
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:52,110
reasons for it is a,
a guy still a good friend of mine.

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,943
His name's Steve Graham.
He was an ophthalmologist and he was 

20
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:59,850
this guy who was just this.
He's such a fucking wild man.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,560
Like I've met some people that purport,
they look sort of pretend to be wildman.

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,170
This guy is the wildest dude I've ever 
met my life.

23
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,210
Put a super smart,
super nice guy.

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,050
And he was on the US ski team.
Okay.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,630
And when he described his key run that 
he did to make the team,

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,750
he said like at any moment in time I 
would have crashed at any single,

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,593
just like I barely hung on the whole way
and had this ridiculous time that I 

28
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,240
could never do again.
And he was like laughing about it.

29
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,540
But dude had like,
I'm gonna fuck this up Steve,

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,403
you hear this?
I think he had 25 knee surgeries on his 

31
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,140
knees.
His knees were insane.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,633
Yeah.
His knees got to the point where they 

33
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,870
had to resurface them.

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,110
So the top of his knees,
he doesn't have any cartilage anymore.

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,063
So there's a steel cap that they put on 
the top of his knees and then there's 

36
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:50,700
like this artificial meniscus in there 
and it rolls up and down and he has like

37
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,070
a very limited range of motion with his 
knees.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,320
He's in his man.
I want to say he probably has 60.

39
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,640
He's still spars all the time.
He's almost legally blind,

40
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,503
like he has to have,
like he's been hitting the head so many 

41
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,260
times.
He has to have these,

42
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,990
uh,
these things that go over his glasses so

43
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,824
he could see better because he said a 
bunch of ice surgeries hitting the head 

44
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,520
from skiing,
from sparring.

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,390
He's still spars all the time.
He's super fucking smart,

46
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,830
but he doesn't care.
Like he's like,

47
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,370
he goes on my hair for a long time.
Just here for a good time.

48
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,380
He'll laugh at you.
Like he used to be a flight surgeon.

49
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,214
He's a fucking amnesty from a,
I think he was originally from upstate 

50
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,134
New York.
He's one of the very few people that 

51
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,600
told me a Ufo story and I had to go,
whoa,

52
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,240
because this dude just doesn't make shit
up.

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,630
And he's done everything maniac.
When I met him,

54
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,540
he was a learning taekwondo.
Immediately became obsessed,

55
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,240
want to start fighting immediately while
he was a resident.

56
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,323
Okay.
It was going through his residency for 

57
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,290
ophthalmology,
be sitting on the toilet.

58
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,480
He told me sitting on the toilet,
eating lunch,

59
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,780
and as he fell asleep while I was taking
a shit and his pager went off,

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,850
will come up.

61
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,590
That's the guy you want to head to the 
operating room when you're laying on the

62
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,940
table.
He's a student guys.

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,410
GotTa fucking Dukie and his cheeks.
He has enough time to wipe it out.

64
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,410
You were always on call.
You're always working,

65
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,263
man.
I had two friends that went through the 

66
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,550
residency.
My other friend was a Korean friend.

67
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,500
His name was junk and junk.
Sick.

68
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,423
He actually won the nationals.
He won the US national championship 

69
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,410
while he was in medical school.
Taekwondo,

70
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,610
yeah.
Wow.

71
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,510
He was a beast and he was never like a 
really physically talented guy.

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,840
He was just unbelievably determined and 
super smart and not.

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,233
It's not that he was physically inept,
but he didn't have any amazing 

74
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:43,330
attributes like sign.
Some fighters just have amazing physical

75
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,100
attributes.
Plus he could always.

76
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,370
He could already count to 10 in Korean,
so he was like ahead of the class.

77
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,570
He was also like super humble.
It was really weird.

78
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:53,404
I mean,
you were talking about a dude who won 

79
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,640
the national championship and when you 
would ask him about it,

80
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,840
he would always say,
oh my God,

81
00:03:58,841 --> 00:03:59,674
I Suck a fucking terrible.
I can't even believe that I win these 

82
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,154
fights.
Like who would just joke around about 

83
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,830
it?
How do people,

84
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,800
I mean you're,
I put you in this category is I'm amazed

85
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,830
by some people's energy because I've 
always had,

86
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,410
I think as I have depression,
I have mild depression,

87
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,363
medicated for it and my whole life I've 
struggled to manage my energy and to 

88
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,373
focus it and pick what I,
what it is I need to accomplish and put 

89
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:26,470
my energy on that and let go of the 
things that keep it simple.

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,360
Just keep it simple and I look at 
somebody like,

91
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,194
you are talking about this guy and I 
mean you already did a three hour 

92
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,250
fucking podcast today.

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,680
You're sitting down with me.
We're,

94
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,150
we're seven minutes into another three 
hour podcasts.

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,490
You probably already worked out today.
No,

96
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,070
I didn't.
I think I had a food poisoning.

97
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,920
Oh,
right,

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
right.
I was telling you before,

99
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,430
but it's just amazing to me how we're 
all built differently and when you gain,

100
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,340
when you gauge success,
it's like,

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,890
you know,
we all are dealing with a different tool

102
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:54,724
belts.
Some of us have this unlimited energy 

103
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,004
and focus.
Some have adhd and somehow those things 

104
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:04,891
that fuck you up can make you stronger.
Like I'm sure this things about you that

105
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,824
are did maybe you didn't do well in 
school because of that made you 

106
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,780
successful in life.
Yeah.

107
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,920
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

108
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,410
Yeah.
I'm,

109
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,433
I'm not,
I've never been a very disciplined 

110
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,480
person,
believe it or not,

111
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,700
but you've always had the energy.
But I've always been driven,

112
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,240
like I find things that obsess on and 
then it's not a discipline thing.

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,073
It's a matter of like almost like 
limiting my amount of time that I'm 

114
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,770
doing them.
Like when I,

115
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,990
like when I was doing taekwondo,
when I was competing,

116
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,620
who was never an issue of I got to be 
disciplined and show up to train.

117
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,320
It was the opposite.
It was like I was training all day.

118
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,720
I was constantly training.
I was obsessed,

119
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,280
you know,
so,

120
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,770
but the problem is like if you say,
hey,

121
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,650
you have to go do your taxes,
I'm like,

122
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,220
oh my God,
I can't do it.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,980
It's like if you told me that I had to 
be an accountant,

124
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,551
I'm like,
Oh my God,

125
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:49,850
I'm too stupid.
I can't do it.

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,933
I just don't.
I can't focus on anything I don't want 

127
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:53,674
to focus on.
Getting a business manager was like the 

128
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,950
greatest thing that ever happened.
That's huge.

129
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,003
It's also like

130
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,190
picking something for a living that you 
actually enjoy doing.

131
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,083
I think there's a lot of people that are
tortured out there that really are 

132
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,054
supposed to be like a bike maker.
They're supposed to make fucking 

133
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
motorcycles or something,
but instead they got sucked into some 

134
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,430
insurance job and they don't give a fuck
about it and they're just trying to sell

135
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:17,640
policies and it's just a grind on your 
soul every day.

136
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,763
You and I,
that's what we talking about before the 

137
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,190
podcast,
how lucky we are at all,

138
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:25,320
all these years that we've known each 
other like we were fucking common.

139
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,550
Yeah,
this is what we always wanted,

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,940
but we didn't even know we wanted this

141
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,230
and it's and when I go,
like people say to me,

142
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,450
I'll be out to dinner.
It'll be like 10,

143
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,284
15 at night.
I'm in Venice beach and with good 

144
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:40,110
friends and my wife having a nice meal,
finishing up some Tiramisu,

145
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,960
pay the bill.
Oh my God.

146
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,661
I'm tired.
All right,

147
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:43,590
we're going to go to bed.
I'm like,

148
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,933
yeah,
I'm heading in Hollywood and do a spot 

149
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:48,550
and about 45 minutes they look at me 
like I'm fucking crazy.

150
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,160
And they go,
is it for the money?

151
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:50,701
I go,
no,

152
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,940
I think I'm getting $15.
Well,

153
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,300
is it to get seen?
I'm like,

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,880
there hasn't been industry at the comedy
store in about three decades doing it.

155
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,690
Why you doing it?
And I go,

156
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,890
I got no fucking idea.
I just need to do because I just,

157
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,950
I fucking love it.
And it's not.

158
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:07,784
And it's like,
and I've never too tired to go do a 

159
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:12,900
spot.
I'll be too tired to write a SPEC script

160
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,420
I was supposed to be working on or 
whatever.

161
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,510
But when it comes time to fucking,
I look at my,

162
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,400
my,
my phone and I go,

163
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:21,234
oh fuck,
I gotta I gotTa Ten 30 at the laugh 

164
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,340
factory.
I'm like,

165
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,280
I'm in the car.
I got fucking classic rock plan.

166
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,420
I'm ready to go.

167
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,690
Right?
Yeah.

168
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,970
That makes sense,
man.

169
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,640
You know,
after 28 years,

170
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,770
how lucky are we?
Stupid.

171
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,880
Lucky.
But that energy that you get out of like

172
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,310
laughter people laughing at your ideas 
and,

173
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,180
and orchestrating those ideas and 
getting them done and you know,

174
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,160
dismounting strong.
Thank you.

175
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,480
Goodnight.
Bring up the next guy.

176
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,680
Especially the way we do it at the store
when you're doing this 15 minute sets,

177
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,130
it's fun.
Math 15 is such a perfect amount of time

178
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,110
working on some new shit.
You do some shit,

179
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:02,060
you know was going to work.
Work at some new shit.

180
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,063
Yeah.
Taking a little hand or gay hand 

181
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,020
grenade.
You know you got.

182
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,890
Yeah.
I,

183
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,810
I a bought a joke.
Just bombed.

184
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,793
Here's a little fucking little thing 
called winter jacket from 1987 back in 

185
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:15,214
the game.

186
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,750
And also you get to see all these other 
people.

187
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,560
You know.
I think it's super important in this,

188
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,633
in this climate right now.
I'm sure you've been aware of all the 

189
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,910
Amy Schumer.
Controversial al.

190
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,230
Please look,
jesus,

191
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,200
we are,
we are all influenced by each other,

192
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,060
all of us.
But it's a good thing.

193
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,060
What's imPortant is just originality.
It's very important.

194
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,390
so what,
like there's comics,

195
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:40,640
like I know norton doesn't even like to 
watch people.

196
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,140
I can't watch people.
Yeah,

197
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:43,130
he does,
but I do,

198
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,690
I do all the time.
You don't watch people.

199
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,550
Like if luke shows up,
you don't watch them.

200
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,500
I'll watch a little bit and then I'll 
walk out.

201
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,960
I tell I can't be anywhere near.
Oh,

202
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:55,640
he gets you with that cadence.
My balls smell like a fart.

203
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,140
So yeah.
And that's how,

204
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,220
that's how she ended up anyway,
a couple of nuggets later.

205
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,310
You know,
it's like where do I don't say that,

206
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,860
what the fuck.
He's Just too and too strong.

207
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,560
But um,
if I'm working on the road,

208
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:14,670
I'll watch both comics that the opener 
and the m and the feature act.

209
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,170
I'll watch them,
number one.

210
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:20,220
so I don't do any of the same premises.
And number two,

211
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:23,190
I feel like I owe it to them because a 
lot of them will say,

212
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,203
you know,
I asked to work with you three months 

213
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:26,371
ago,
it's like,

214
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:30,180
it's a really big deal to them to work 
with headliners that they like,

215
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,343
you know,
and I think part of that is I have 

216
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,860
responsibility to watch their act and 
say,

217
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,020
hey,
great job or you know,

218
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,690
hey,
here you go.

219
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,940
You know what I mean?
But like give them,

220
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,750
give them some feedback and fuck man,
I take numbers all the time.

221
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,280
I'll get a guy's number if he's good.
And then when I'm in,

222
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,180
went in his neck of the woods and I'll 
call them up and I'll have a feature for

223
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:55,710
me and in a club that's huge.
That's giant when you're a young guy and

224
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,670
somebody gives you that nod,
like that.

225
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,613
Yeah.
First person I ever worked for was 

226
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,210
warren mcdonald.
Yeah.

227
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,660
Bill mcdonald's brother.
Yeah.

228
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,040
He played guitar.
Great guy.

229
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,920
George mcdonald's,
mcdonald's bill,

230
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,210
my brother bill to know george.
It was,

231
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,660
I think they had a bunch of kids in the 
family,

232
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,850
but those were the two comedian george 
was the one.

233
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,630
I'm sorry,
George George was the one who used a.

234
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,770
George is the one that used to host open
mic night.

235
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,200
First guy to ever Bring me on stage and 
an open mike night.

236
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
Super great guy.
Greg.

237
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,770
He was my roommate for a while.
Is he really in New York?

238
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:28,110
We lived on mulberry street together.
Oh dude.

239
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,700
I remember when you lived in little 
Italy.

240
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,553
Yeah.
I went to visit you up there once you 

241
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,410
have this cool fucking apartment,
like right over an italian restaurant or

242
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,400
something,
and it was.

243
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,650
It was above the raven night social 
club,

244
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,940
which was john god,
he's social club.

245
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:40,774
Do you were in the hood when I went to 
visit you when I went up to your 

246
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:44,101
apartment.
I'm like,

247
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,420
dude,
you're in the hood.

248
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,313
Yeah,
it was mulberry between prince and 

249
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,330
spring and it was like a,
you know,

250
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,790
wednesdays was,
uh,

251
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,690
was the night when the family would get 
together and god,

252
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:59,100
his son was out front and all these 
limos would pull up and they double park

253
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,293
and these guys in overcoats would go out
and they'd go onto this little fucking 

254
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:02,790
club.

255
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,623
Oh my god.
They'd Walk up and down the street 

256
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:05,814
because they,
uh,

257
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,900
the place was wiretapped the raven night
social club was,

258
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:13,860
um,
where all the deals went down for the,

259
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,440
there's the gambinos right,
got it.

260
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,180
Yeah.
And so they started walking.

261
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,043
They knew the place was wire tapped so 
they would walk down the street down 

262
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:26,781
mulberry street in groups and they talk.
So the fbi started inserting,

263
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:27,834
they would park cars on the street and 
they'd put wire taps in the hubcaps of 

264
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:32,570
the cars.
Whoa.

265
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,580
And they would pick up the conversation 
as they walked up and down the street.

266
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:36,963
Yeah.
And so we moved into this place and it 

267
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:44,910
was a tony and gladys.
It was a six floor walk up.

268
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,820
No fucking joke.
And so if you're on the sixth floor,

269
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:48,654
you have to carry your couch six while 
we didn't have to because we moved in 

270
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,010
and we took,
they gave us what their part is,

271
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,310
all italian couple and we move in and 
they uh,

272
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,680
they had uh,
it was an illegal sublet.

273
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,950
So we move in and they've got the 
fucking couches with the plastic on them

274
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,970
and the little end tables.
There's craIg's barrett is,

275
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,310
that's my fucking apartment.
What floor were you on?

276
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,500
Sixth floor.
Oh shit.

277
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,850
Oh no,
I guess it's five.

278
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,820
Five floors.
So you didn't have an elevator.

279
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,180
You had to walk all the way out so fast 
and there was no buzzer.

280
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:22,060
So you'd go out on the fire escape and 
throw the keys down below.

281
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,450
That's hilarious.
So someone would ring your doorbell.

282
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:25,950
Yo.
Hey,

283
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,730
here's the key.
You don't have to drop it on their head.

284
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,583
Right?
But how many times did the key like hit 

285
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,270
the ground?
I think after a while it wouldn't be.

286
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,640
You put it in a Sock dude be rolling up 
is the move.

287
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,060
I love it.
Yeah.

288
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,100
And it's,
we want to live there for like a day,

289
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,740
let me tell you,
it was,

290
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,160
we move in and so we got all this 
plastic furniture and then uh,

291
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,920
and it had a,
the,

292
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,300
the,
the end table.

293
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,760
I open it up and there's um,
shell casings,

294
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,030
shell casings from a gun ho.
And then there was a wire to do was uh,

295
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,063
uh,
a device to listen to record your phone 

296
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,334
conversations they'd left behind,
like they were all somewhat in the 

297
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,470
mafia.
They weren't necessarily getting paid,

298
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:09,640
but like everybody was like running 
numbers with their friends and involved.

299
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,800
And he goes,
anybody ever bothers you?

300
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,260
You let this guy is like 80 years old.
You let me know,

301
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,910
I'll take care of it.
I know people,

302
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,190
you know who I'm talking,
I'm not going to say I'm talking about,

303
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,024
but you know who I'm talking about.
And so they got a condo around the 

304
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:22,354
corner because their son gregory was in 
construction and he bought them a condo 

305
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,180
cash.
That was nice.

306
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,110
And then we paid.
We paid $700 a month in rent.

307
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,750
Me and george together first of the 
month,

308
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,030
walk around the corner to prince street,
sit down with them,

309
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:43,810
they'd make cappuccIno,
give us ken ali's and I'd give them $500

310
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:44,644
cash and then tony would go iN the other
room and I'd give gladys and other 200 

311
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,623
because that was her bingo money because
saint saint st anthony's on sullivan 

312
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:58,150
street had been on tuesday nights and 
then st patrick's on mulberry street had

313
00:13:58,151 --> 00:13:59,530
bingo on thursday nights.

314
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,393
Was that a deal that you all worked out 
together or do you just let us made the 

315
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:04,930
deal the deal,
so to glass,

316
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,760
tell you to keep it on the dl that she's
getting the to.

317
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,623
Tony had no idea.
He told me don't need to know about my 

318
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:14,011
bingo money.
I was so behind me to keep that secret.

319
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,371
What?
Gladys.

320
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:17,060
I'll go to the grave with the secret 
yet.

321
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,830
So they'd all play bingo and then they 
bet the numbers.

322
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,880
There was a,
there was a woman,

323
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,714
gina,
and she had these two little schnauzer 

324
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,264
dogs and she'd walk up and down mulberry
street and people would stop and say hi 

325
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:29,224
to her.
Like every half a block because she ran 

326
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,104
the numbers and you gave her 10 bucks 
and I don't know if you know how the 

327
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:35,554
numbers work,
but they basically take the purse 

328
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,230
aqueduct every day you'd look in the New
York post and it's,

329
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,960
there's a purse that's like however much
money was bet.

330
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,943
Say It's,
you know,

331
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,250
300,000 5:51 and the last three digits 
of the purse is

332
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,020
what the number is that one the day 
before.

333
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,760
So you play three numbers for $10 and it
pays w,

334
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,380
w,
w what would the odds be?

335
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,820
Tend to 100 to one.
I don't know what the odds are,

336
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,520
but at this fucking old lady walking 
around,

337
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,830
she'd go to the shark bar.
People make bets with her.

338
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,740
My grandmother went to jail for that.
No shit.

339
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,100
Yeah.
Really?

340
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:14,781
Yeah.
Yeah.

341
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,440
When we would go visit her in jersey,
newark.

342
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,170
Wow.
We'd go visit her for six months.

343
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,490
We'd be like,
where's grandma?

344
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,990
Oh,
grandma's grandma's with your aunt.

345
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,790
Your aunt in there too?
No,

346
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,091
no,
no,

347
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:29,690
no,
no.

348
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,920
She wasn't.
And it was just,

349
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:32,870
they were telling me that she was 
visiting my ai,

350
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,110
so the,
like on the street corner,

351
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,670
running numbers,
I don't know,

352
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:41,570
the full extent the store would out 
shoot when she said um,

353
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,610
and the,
the,

354
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,110
she wouldn't rat out the mob.

355
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,170
Right.
And that's why they put her in the.

356
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,180
Gave her the option to tell on whoever 
her boss was.

357
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:50,951
Yeah.
She was like,

358
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,970
I'm fuck you.
I'll do time.

359
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,000
So she was in the pokey for six months I
think,

360
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,120
and she was knitting sweaters for the 
guards and shit.

361
00:15:59,121 --> 00:15:59,954
And she was my grandma.
I mean she was a full on grandma at the 

362
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,760
time.
She would make spaghetti.

363
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,360
She'd make homemade pasta.
Oh my god.

364
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,540
It was incredible to this chapter.
One of your memoir,

365
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,550
right?
They're homemade pasta was incredible.

366
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,050
It was incredible.
Oh,

367
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:12,884
so good.
Like you would never have anythIng like 

368
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,753
he goes,
so like old country hardy mean she 

369
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,870
always made her own pasta.
She first generation,

370
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,850
fIrst generation.
What's her last name?

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,833
digerlando.
Well that was my grandfather's last 

372
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:28,370
name.
Her last name was spumoni,

373
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,080
I believe it was damn bemoan bangalore.
They were straight off the boat.

374
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:34,430
They both came here as children.

375
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,040
Fuck that name up.
Come on.

376
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,923
That side of mY family,
I don't really have that much contact 

377
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,190
with them.
But um,

378
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,480
my grandmother,
she had an aneurysm.

379
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,703
They gave her 72 hours to live and she 
lived for 12 years and my grandfather 

380
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,210
never,
never ever.

381
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,540
She was a mess.
She got dementia from it.

382
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,460
She was just gone.
She was paralyzed.

383
00:16:58,461 --> 00:16:59,294
How jesus really,
my grandfather had a totally take care 

384
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:02,730
of her 12 years.
She was like,

385
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,680
my grandfather had to take care of every
single thing she did.

386
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,510
He had a wiper.
He had a clean her.

387
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,190
He had to take care of her bedsores.
Could she move?

388
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,580
Barely make noises and stuff and 
sometimes.

389
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,300
Oh dude,
you don't know.

390
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,283
So I,
I lived with them for awhile when I 

391
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:23,720
moved from boston to New York,
when I got signed by sussman and I got a

392
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:24,560
manager,
I was like,

393
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,820
oh my god,
I've got to move to New York.

394
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,653
I couldn't afford anything.
I definitely couldn't afford to live 

395
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,714
anywhere.
And so my grandfather said that I could 

396
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:32,294
stay with them for awhile.
So newark in newark on north ninth 

397
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:38,360
street.
It's the fucking the like.

398
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,793
It's a bad neighborhood.
Like my grandparents live in a bad 

399
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:42,734
neighborhood.
Yeah,

400
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,953
it was a good neighborhood at one point 
in time was an all italian neighborhood 

401
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:46,484
and you know,
did a thing called blockbusting when 

402
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:48,740
they move in and say,
hey,

403
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm black people moving into your 
neighborhood.

404
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:52,980
You have to seLl now.
Are you going to lose all your money?

405
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,990
Right.
Some people would just sell their houses

406
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,760
left and right.
And everybody moved down and it became a

407
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,530
black neighborhood.
But my grandfather was like,

408
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,570
I like black people who gives a fuck get
off my lawn.

409
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,970
It's like it was his house.
He was never getting rid of that house.

410
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,520
And my grandmother had this aneurysm and
she lived and she lived in agony.

411
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,260
And so when I was staying with them when
I was,

412
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,080
when I moved to New York and I didn't 
have an apartment for three months,

413
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:15,540
I stayed with them and she would just 
moan,

414
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,600
make these horrible bones and be like,
god damn it.

415
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,960
She realized what it's like when your 
body fails.

416
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:26,961
You still alive for years and years.
It was all my threshold for pull.

417
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,450
The plug is really,
really high.

418
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,210
Low.
It's low.

419
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,440
Yeah.
If I get anywhere near that state,

420
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,130
take me out.
You know,

421
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,610
just died.
The angel of death.

422
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,473
Remember that guy?
He worked in a nursing home and he 

423
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:44,580
killed 37 people over like three decades
do.

424
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,503
And he would,
people that like your grandmother that 

425
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,630
we're suffering,
he would just fucking take them out.

426
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,160
If people knew and they started bringing
them into that place,

427
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:53,760
I would.

428
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,850
Well,
the question is like,

429
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,300
did he do it to people that weren't 
going to die?

430
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,710
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

431
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,543
For a goof.
I think in his mind he was doing it for 

432
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,970
a good reason.
The angel in,

433
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,110
you know,
he was an angel,

434
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,520
which I could see.
I have my friend johnny come visit me.

435
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,830
He came to visit me in New Jersey and 
we're hanging out.

436
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:17,850
My grandfather just sitting around 
talking to them and old linoleum floor,

437
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,713
you know,
the whole house smells like boiled 

438
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,624
potatoes.
Fuck fucking salami hanging around all 

439
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:24,870
over the place,
like the whole deal.

440
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,750
Always bought fresh bread every day.
Walked down to the bakery,

441
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,890
got the bread,
came back,

442
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,733
was lIke as a talent as occurrence and 
while we're hanging out there and my 

443
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:35,700
grandmother was just moaning in the 
other room and my grandpa,

444
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,050
my friend john,
he was like,

445
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,430
holy shit.
I was like,

446
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:39,330
I told you.
He was like,

447
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,710
dude,
that's negative.

448
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,140
That's what he say to me.
It was like,

449
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,340
dude,
he goes negative.

450
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,413
It is.
It's like the opposite of a sound 

451
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:51,090
machine that cheers you up.
Well,

452
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:52,050
that's what he was.
He was,

453
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,120
he was my frIend.
Johnny was brilliant,

454
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,060
brilliant guy and just in a weird,
crazy way.

455
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,560
But um,
he,

456
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,880
he was like,
dude,

457
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,530
you don't want to be around that.
Like this is negative for you.

458
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,110
You can't fix it.
Can't fix it.

459
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,430
You gotta get outta here.
Right?

460
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,330
And I was like,
you're right,

461
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,223
your grandfather must have been fucking 
psyched that you're staying there for a 

462
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,990
little while.
He was fOr awhile.

463
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,330
You know,
he liked it.

464
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:14,400
He's.
He was a great guy.

465
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,423
He was just such a.
The big thing around the family was 

466
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:19,914
always like,
there was pride that he worked in a 

467
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:26,811
machine shop that made a part for the 
nuclear bomb and everybody would say,

468
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,380
hey,
you know what grandpa does,

469
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,670
right?
What grandpa did,

470
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,480
he made something.
He worked inside.

471
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,250
He was like a form and after awhile 
worked in some sort of machine shop.

472
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,740
You know what he does?
He kills jabs.

473
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,040
That's what he does.
Fucking three times.

474
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,510
They used his part.
Boom,

475
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,344
boom,
boom.

476
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,010
Yeah.
There was like thing people would talk

477
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,580
about maybe three times to two pumps to 
two bumps too.

478
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,310
Yeah.
There was like a big source of pride.

479
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,410
I reMember when I was a kid,
I was like,

480
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,090
wow,
that's awesome.

481
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,103
Pretty cool.

482
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,640
No,
that I was in st louis,

483
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,060
st louis.
Now we're have.

484
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,630
Forget we're in Missouri.
Truman is buried,

485
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:08,830
but they've got a,
his,

486
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,693
his library like his museum and there's 
a fucking monument to the bomb outfront 

487
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,190
jesus christ.
like this fucking guy had the balls.

488
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,333
We played,
um,

489
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,390
oppenheimer in the last podcast with sam
harris for dan harris from abc news.

490
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,493
He had never heard that oppenheimer 
quote when he quotes the bhagavad gita 

491
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,410
after the bomb went off.
Now what did he say?

492
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,320
He says,
behold,

493
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:38,300
I am become death destroyer of worlds.
It's so creepy when you hear oppenheimer

494
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:39,134
say I play it,
but we played it in the last podcast 

495
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,570
when people be like,
what the fuck?

496
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:42,404
Rogan,
I'll play for you after it's over 

497
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,143
though.
It'S creepy because you see his face 

498
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:46,364
like,
this is the guy that made the fucking 

499
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:47,834
bomb.
Yeah.

500
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,723
ThAt's his reaction to read some 
sanskrit bhagavad gita quote about 

501
00:21:53,691 --> 00:21:54,524
vishnu.

502
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,020
So where did that come from?
Because usually it's like the christian,

503
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,300
the christians that believe in the,
uh,

504
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,550
the second coming or into that kind of 
shit.

505
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:03,800
But that eastern,

506
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,250
either I don't think of eastern religion
is being like that.

507
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,570
well,
he was.

508
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,920
Oppenheimer was a fucking phenomenally 
intelligent guy.

509
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,830
he was really looking at sam microscopes
or something.

510
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,560
He created the nuclear bomb.
I don't know what he did before that,

511
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:19,780
but he was one of the main people.
There's a team of people,

512
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:22,320
obviously the manhattan project,
but um,

513
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,520
he,
he was,

514
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,510
uh,
just a,

515
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,910
a super genius guy that sam harris was 
saying,

516
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:28,744
we need to double check if that's true.
But sam harris was st last podcast that 

517
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:33,400
he taught himself sanskrit in three 
months,

518
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,110
or was it dan harrison said that?
I don't remember who said it is,

519
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,980
but that's how,
that's how,

520
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,000
like what you were talking about earlier
about energy,

521
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,053
an energy.
Think about how fucking stupid we are 

522
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:44,200
compared to that.
Dude.

523
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,510
There's levels to this thing.
you know,

524
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,170
like chrom alone is always going to be 
better at basketball than you and me.

525
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,750
There's just no,
there's no matter what we did.

526
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:55,650
You got to want it more fitzsimmons.
Yeah.

527
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,340
There's,
this is not fair.

528
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,630
It's not fair to seven foot super 
athletes.

529
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,910
It's just,
it's not fair.

530
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,443
I know.
It's like when I'm around people that 

531
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:05,630
have perfect memories,
I feel so less than.

532
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:06,464
And I have to remind myself,
that's just the fucking machine that 

533
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:10,270
this dude was given.
You know,

534
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,920
some hot rod like patton oswald.
There's somebody,

535
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:13,754
he'll be on stage riffing.
F goes from a fucking tom waits lyric 

536
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:19,370
into like a movie reference of judy 
garland,

537
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:20,204
quote from the 19 four and you just sit 
in a gun like I have to look at a list 

538
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,610
to remember my act every night.
Yeah.

539
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,980
Mother fucker.
He's a fucking genius.

540
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,990
Verily that's amazing is not only does 
he have this photographic memory,

541
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,250
but he distills thoughts in a very 
unique way.

542
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:41,000
Like when he puts up,
I don't read many people's twitters,

543
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,863
but I read his and it's like,
it's always on point and it's always 

544
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:47,390
different than what anybody else is 
thinking.

545
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,560
Did you see the tweet that he made?
He made like the best tweet.

546
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,690
Um,
fuck.

547
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,220
What was,
what was it about?

548
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,140
I got to remember this.
And he's also got lImitless energy.

549
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,423
Yeah.
It was about someone showing up at 

550
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,840
someone's doorstep to.
Oh,

551
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:06,674
it was about jamie kilstein was about 
jamie kilstein showing up at milo 

552
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:13,250
yiannopoulos his house and cue the theme
music to the odd couple,

553
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,140
like he got kicked out of his,
uh,

554
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,750
his podcast.
It's just his sense of humor,

555
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,460
man.
He,

556
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,500
his,
his premises,

557
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,393
he'll take premises that I would have 
abandoned long ago and turned them into 

558
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:32,330
genius bits and stretch them out.
Like I hear some of his stuff on go,

559
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,710
wow.
I just need to like,

560
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,873
focus on topics more sometimes.
Maybe instead of just looking for a 

561
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:37,994
strong topic,
like any topic can be strong if you do 

562
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,950
it the right way.
And he figured out,

563
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:43,400
yeah.
Have you ever heard his fucking bit?

564
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,323
He does about taking his daughter to 
starbucks after she had seen the lion 

565
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:52,460
king and there's a black guy,
an old old black guy with white hair and

566
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:53,990
the daughter yells out,
daddy,

567
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,010
it's a monkey

568
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,270
and this is the way he describes the 
place.

569
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:03,330
It's a coffee shop in silver lake.
And he said,

570
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,193
he said you could barely hear the nora 
jones album over the sound of people's 

571
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:09,160
eyes roll.

572
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,160
I think it's such a good,

573
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,500
it's written,
it's a really funny bit about him,

574
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,610
like just running out of there with his 
daughter and hashtag racist.

575
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:26,330
It's really fucking funny.
But tHat's,

576
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,080
you know,
he just

577
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,670
no writing jokes.
I've been,

578
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,820
I've been in a little bit of a slump 
lately.

579
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,743
I think mostly because I'm putting 
another hour together so I've just been 

580
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,890
focused on taking the last two or three 
years material,

581
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,083
transitioning it,
tightening it up and so I haven't been 

582
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:44,370
writing new stuff and then when I go 
back to writing new stuff,

583
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:47,520
I'm like,
how does comedy work again?

584
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,683
Yeah,
I think it's okay.

585
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,610
Cop out that we do when we're working on
stuff that we don't do new stuff.

586
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:53,930
New stuff.
Yeah.

587
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,800
You lose that muscle,
whatever the fuck that weird muscle is.

588
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,713
I just forget like when you really.
I mean if you really want to get into 

589
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:02,220
joke writing,
Breaking it down.

590
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,280
It's like what you said,
do you take the low hanging fruit?

591
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,473
You know,
that there's always that thing that 

592
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:08,070
happens.
You know,

593
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,200
there's that moment where you go,
oh,

594
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,090
that's a fucking joke.
You know?

595
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,980
Like I,
I just bid about my,

596
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,420
I'm driving home,
my wife,

597
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,800
uh,
my wIfe texts me what time I going to be

598
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:21,240
home,
so I write 6:00 and she says,

599
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:23,540
will you bring home some eggs?
So I wrote,

600
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,310
sure.
And then I wrote what are you wearing?

601
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,833
And then I got a text back,
my cleats in my soccer uniform and I 

602
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:31,104
realized my wife is driving,
son has her phone and then I got a text 

603
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:36,750
right after that,
why,

604
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:39,540
what are you wearing?
And I was just like,

605
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,260
alrIght,
I don't have to write anything there.

606
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,070
There's a fucking perfect is a funny 
bit.

607
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,070
And then I realized like I didn't take 
that,

608
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,790
I've been doing that bit for a year and 
I haven't pushed it.

609
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,120
And like bill burr saw me do a bit one 
night and he's like,

610
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,320
dude,
what are you doing?

611
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,180
You got fucking,
you gotta fucking unbelievable premise.

612
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,650
Say you gotta fuck it.
And he,

613
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,543
he,
he like riffs like five other beats to 

614
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,390
the bit that I do now.
And you just realized like,

615
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,253
yeah,
I'm not,

616
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,410
I'm not fucking pushing it as far as I 
can push it.

617
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,260
Do you think that's an energy thing?
Like what you were talking about before?

618
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,243
I think it's a confidence thing.
I think it's having the confidence to 

619
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:18,894
say there's more to this,
I'm capable of getting more out of this 

620
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,030
instead of just going like,
okay,

621
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,923
now let me quick get something else 
that's going to get an immediate laugh 

622
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,070
and jumped topics.
Right,

623
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,671
right,
right.

624
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:30,504
Which is a hallmark of someone who's 
inexperienced or working on completely 

625
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,420
new stuff.
Right?

626
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,490
Yeah.
When someone's inexperienced,

627
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,110
like when you watch open microbes,
it's like one of the biggest things that

628
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:39,944
they do.
And also conversely that the right way 

629
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:43,781
to use it.
Uh,

630
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:44,614
richard jenny,
who's one of my all time favorites and 

631
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,070
stretching out stuff.
Do you ever tell people about this?

632
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:54,071
I've been telling them as comics,
go download a big steaming pile of me.

633
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:55,763
Yeah.
The steamIng pile of me or a big 

634
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,280
steaming pile of me,
whatever,

635
00:27:58,281 --> 00:27:59,570
whatever the name of it is.
It's richard,

636
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:00,404
jenny,
one of richard jenny's last specials 

637
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,750
before he,
um,

638
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,010
unfortunately killed himself.
But god damn.

639
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:08,130
Is it good?
Yeah.

640
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,113
So good dude.
I was on the highway coming home from 

641
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:14,930
the store on the highway.
How ling laughing at this special.

642
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,510
Yeah.
And the only reason why I listened to it

643
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,030
is,
you know,

644
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,610
that weird thing your phone does if you 
bluetooth your phone,

645
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,463
your car.
Sometimes on my car I'll just start 

646
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,770
playing random songs.
Oh really?

647
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,830
Just randomly.
Yeah.

648
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,300
I completely randomly like it just,
it just starts playing like I don't even

649
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,410
press play.
I get the car,

650
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,990
start the car and when I did it,
there was a song,

651
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,973
the song went off and then the next 
thing was a richard jeni bit and I was 

652
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,580
fucking house and it was so funny.
Yeah,

653
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,730
it was so fun.

654
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,220
And not only that you are losing a lot 
of it because seeing that guy live,

655
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:46,054
he fucking glided around the stage.
He physic because he was a little guy 

656
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,923
and so he appeared.
You'd see him after a show and you'd be 

657
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:54,610
like,
you're not the guy that the guy on stage

658
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:56,390
was six foot one.
You're,

659
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,780
you're five foot Seven.
And what happened to that other guy?

660
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,120
Yeah,
well he dId.

661
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,190
That's special with one of those mc 
hammer earpieces holidays.

662
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,470
I'm a motivational speaker.
Things right.

663
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,540
He had one of those on or something.
He had either that or a lav mic,

664
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,730
but he didn't have a mic in his hand,
which I'm always like,

665
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,863
what are you,
what are you transitioning away from 

666
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,710
being a stand up and now you're like,
what is that?

667
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,660
He really uses his hands for most people
you don't need that.

668
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:23,730
But for him it was like,
you know,

669
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,770
he explored physically space.
He accentuated punchlines with movement.

670
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,920
Yeah.
And,

671
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,760
and I would watch him night after night 
sometimes,

672
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:36,510
and if you,
if he was saying the word glo his,

673
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,400
he would,
his weight would be on his left foot.

674
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,383
His right finger would be in the Air and
it'd be the same fucking way the next 

675
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:42,190
night.

676
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,120
It was like a ballet.

677
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,003
It was exact.
He was my opinion the best at taking a 

678
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:49,134
premise and just ringing all the funny 
out of it and I remember watching him 

679
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,473
and one of the first things that I 
realized when I was watching it because 

680
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,733
I went to see him,
I paid to see him before ever did stand 

681
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:02,640
up.
And um,

682
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,720
I remember thinking I actually sat in 
the front row.

683
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,000
It's pretty bad ass at catch a rising 
star in cambridge.

684
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,720
And I remember I saw also saw many 
killed there.

685
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,840
I saw kevin,
we were together that night.

686
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
I saw him crushed there a couple of 
times,

687
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,603
but I saw me and he crushed so hard.
I went with my friend diane from high 

688
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:21,564
school.
We were buddies and we went and it was 

689
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,654
like one of the few girlfriends that I 
had back then we were just buddies and 

690
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,973
she was like a really funny chick and we
went to see kevin meaney and he fucking 

691
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,870
killed so hard that I walked out of 
there and pain,

692
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,883
like my sides were her.
Like people don't know how hard kevin 

693
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:42,010
meeney used to kill.

694
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,923
I would,
I would put him against in terms of 

695
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,140
being in the right room on the right 
night.

696
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,200
Nobody killed his heart as kevin media.
He would fucking.

697
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,710
You couldn't kill harder.
You couldn't kill harder because he went

698
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:56,070
up in this character that was a complete
departure.

699
00:30:56,071 --> 00:31:01,071
It was a silly guy who was joyous and 
who didn't give a fuck what you thought.

700
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:03,810
If a joke started bombing,
he'd start saying,

701
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,050
I don't care.
I don't care.

702
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,840
my jokes don't go over.
I don't care.

703
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,670
And then he start doing it like a dog.
woof,

704
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,533
woof,
woof.

705
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,463
He'd be bombing.
The fucking crowd would not be laughing 

706
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:19,710
and he would string that out for like 
three minutes until all of a sudden they

707
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,544
just started laughing at this insane man
who was sweating and flopping around on 

708
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:24,960
stage.

709
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,441
Yeah.
Well,

710
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:27,540
when I saw him,
there was no bombing at all.

711
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,423
It was just destruction.
It was when he had just done hbo and he 

712
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:34,740
was in that group.
He was on fire.

713
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:37,500
Dude,
it's hard to describe because so much is

714
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:41,640
lost when you see a guy like that on a 
big stage or on television.

715
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:42,474
Yeah,
you lose like being in the room with 

716
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:44,730
them.
Absolutely.

717
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,190
There was a hypnosis going on when he 
would crush.

718
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,990
Yeah,
so It was like him.

719
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:49,824
I,
I remember seeing him crush like that 

720
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,144
and going like god,
like he was like so silly and it was so 

721
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:56,034
fun to get caught up in his silly.
That was one thing that I saw closing 

722
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:01,410
with.
We are the world,

723
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:02,244
but you took it to another level because
they had some fucking music and a funny 

724
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:08,460
song.
Impressions within the song.

725
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,290
He kept that bit too long.

726
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,840
Way too long now.
That was his downfall.

727
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,220
That was his downfall.
Was he crushed for a decade?

728
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,141
Five years?
Yeah.

729
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:22,650
Maybe it was only five years and then he
just wouldn't take the material off.

730
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,543
Yeah,
well he went national and he had the 

731
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,550
ethic that the guys in boston had.
That was the problem.

732
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,840
The boston guys did didn't go national,
but they all came up together and he was

733
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:36,960
one of the top guys and they all came up
doing the same act.

734
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,853
They would tighten that fucking act.
They would hammer down like a samurai 

735
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,724
sword and then they would,
they would go all around town with that 

736
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:45,560
same act and they just did that.
There was no social media.

737
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,960
There was no one to complain,
but I did a friends who would complain.

738
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,290
They're like,
jesus christ went to see fucking sweeney

739
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,310
did the same goddamn act I saw last 
year.

740
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,800
Yeah,
that's gonna.

741
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,820
You know you're going to get a few of 
those this week.

742
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,780
Yeah,
probably.

743
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,823
But meaning that he fucked up.
But you were Steven Wright didn't fuck 

744
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:02,450
up.
steven right left from that spot.

745
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,480
Jay leno left from that spot and they 
did new stuff all a route.

746
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,650
yeah.
Yeah.

747
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,933
He just got stuck,
was crazy because I remember watching 

748
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:11,194
him not do well and one time he had to 
go on in miami after joey diaz and it 

749
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:16,664
was a disaster.
Joey was yelling out punchlines and 

750
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,363
spanish and it was talking about sucking
his dick and all the sudden he was 

751
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,530
sweating and people going crazy and it 
was just.

752
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,970
They were just going fucking crazy 
because joey diaz in miami,

753
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,330
in the cocaine days,
he would kill like you,

754
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,520
you never,
you never seen anything like it before.

755
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,340
There was no fucks left in his brain.
And he was saying,

756
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:38,710
shit,
that was so ridiculous.

757
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:40,700
We get all the fucks out.
They were gone.

758
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,620
He didn't give a fuck.
He get,

759
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,940
he had no fucks to give and he's onstage
talking about slinging dick.

760
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,000
And it just,
it was,

761
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,883
it was.
So he was such a caricature and kevin 

762
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:56,870
had a really hard time and kevin had to 
go on after him and it was a disaster.

763
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,180
A disaster.
Kevin want to believing and

764
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,380
yeah,
well he,

765
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:02,660
you know,
he had a lot of chapters to his life,

766
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,670
you know,
and then he,

767
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,020
he had a really hard time for a long 
time and then he,

768
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:06,854
then he ended up on broadway doing great
with john pinette in hairspray and then 

769
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:11,444
that ended and uh,
and he came out of the closet while he 

770
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:17,600
was on broadway,
changed his life and he became a happier

771
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:19,040
person.
Lost weight.

772
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,900
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.

773
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,690
Yeah.
Fascinating man.

774
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,710
Yeah.
Fascinating.

775
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:29,711
Different chapters of people's lives,
but like who he was like when um,

776
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,600
you know,
when he went on after joey diaz in miami

777
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,070
should never be confused wIth who

778
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,880
it was when I saw him in boston,
a kia just,

779
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,430
he hit a stride and he wasn't able to 
maintain it,

780
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:42,280
but you can never forget how fucking 
good he was.

781
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,373
Is youtube is a tonight show.
Appearance is because carson fucking 

782
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,190
loved him.
Carson,

783
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,230
they would cut away to carson.
He didn't have his head on his desk,

784
00:34:49,231 --> 00:34:52,680
pounding it with his fist wiping tears.
I mean he,

785
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,450
he,
and nile and it was just,

786
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:58,680
it was so bIg you couldn't follow it.
And so he got his break with that show,

787
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,560
which was,
I blame his representation.

788
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:02,394
He should have never done uncle buck.
It was the wrong fucking show for him 

789
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,430
and it.
And it was so high profile and he was so

790
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:12,930
big that when it failed,
it really crushed him for a long time.

791
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,900
Comics would just extend up.
Yeah.

792
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,840
Whenever we do other shifts,
ones up kid in the way.

793
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,510
Right,
right.

794
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,143
Louis,
he had a great fucking statement the 

795
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,830
other night.
He and I were talking backstage is about

796
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,530
gone.
He said it doesn't do anything but stand

797
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:29,364
up anymore.

798
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,200
He said,
to be your best you have to do.

799
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,280
Just stand up.
He goes,

800
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,710
you can be really good and do other 
stuff,

801
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,470
but like you know when you're doing this
tv show and all jazz,

802
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,280
he's like to be your best,
you have to just do stand up so he's not

803
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:43,560
going to do tv for awhile.
I don't know man.

804
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,870
I mean he could do whatever the fuck you
want,

805
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,340
but one of the things he said,
he's like,

806
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,320
I can be happy doing this forever.
God,

807
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,960
it's inspiring.
You mean getting on a private jet and go

808
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,900
into that because you sent out one tweet
tweet anymore.

809
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,360
He deleted his twitter.
I think the cla,

810
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,223
all the theater just tweet,
like ticketmaster sends out a tweet and 

811
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,780
it fucking sells out,
but how smart is that that he recognizes

812
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:09,360
he's at that stage.
Just steps away from.

813
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,463
But it also takes.
I mean you have to have like I think 

814
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,950
some people need to spend a lot of 
plates.

815
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:17,784
Like I,
I can't just do standup because I start 

816
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:20,730
to,
it's not so much bored,

817
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:24,420
but I just feel like I got to do with 
the shit I get claustrophobic.

818
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,543
yeah.
And I just,

819
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,790
I need to go.
Like I,

820
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,850
like right now I'm writing on a show and
I'm fucking loving it.

821
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,460
And I'm taking you run on a pizza right 
on pete holmes show.

822
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:35,940
Chris was talking about before.
Pete holmes is such a good guy.

823
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,170
He's a good dude.
He is.

824
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:39,330
And he's um,
he's a nice guy.

825
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,223
He's good in the room too.
I mean we're coming up with show ideas 

826
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:42,721
and like,
you know,

827
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:43,554
there's like seven or eight writers 
pitch and shit and they're all talented 

828
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:46,870
writers.
Um,

829
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,870
and then he'll just go like,
um,

830
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,490
he is the best way of saying no.

831
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,803
It's very hard to write a room to run a 
room and not make people feel like 

832
00:36:56,341 --> 00:37:00,030
they're not heard or they're being 
rejected and he's got this energy that's

833
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,020
just like,
yeah,

834
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:03,750
that's funny.
And what if we did this?

835
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,970
And you sorta like,
he moves on in a way that,

836
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,953
you know,
the idea is not getting used but it 

837
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:09,054
might have triggered something else in 
him and we ended up with these episodes 

838
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:17,400
that are just fucking linear and they're
there things that he signed off on and a

839
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,340
lot of times you get somebody running a 
writer's room and they,

840
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,383
they get codependent so they'll put shit
the script that they don't even believe 

841
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:25,434
in and between him and judge,
judge in the room a lot between the two 

842
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:29,340
of them in the room.
We got fucking,

843
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:32,010
we got episodes locked down alreadY.
That's awesome.

844
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,203
Yeah,
there is that weird dynamic between 

845
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:37,320
showrunners and and comics and actors.

846
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,260
And it's such a struggle that everyone 
gets,

847
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,123
wants to get their greasy fingers on it,
especially in the beginning or at the 

848
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:44,784
beginning of the shows create like once 
you get to like some simpsons level or 

849
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,480
it's just like it's just a smooth 
machine.

850
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,700
Just they know what the fuck to do.
Leave hIm alone.

851
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:55,180
Leave most,
stay away from the south park guys.

852
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,060
Just get the fuck out of the way.
You know,

853
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:58,680
don't,
don't get your greasy fingers in it.

854
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,520
Now if it's a brand new show and also 
being an hbo show,

855
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,740
they just give you the keys to go.
All right,

856
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,020
do it lock up when you're done.
There's no,

857
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,150
there's no.
I mean I wasn't there the first season,

858
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:11,190
but I heard there was very little notes 
from hbo.

859
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,550
That's what netflix is kind of doing to 
netflix.

860
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,830
Doesn't have any notes why the fucking 
shows are good.

861
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,910
No,
I mean,

862
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:19,810
look,
look at these network multi cameras,

863
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:20,940
sitcoms.
It's like,

864
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,620
do you ever see the clip where they take
the laugh track out of big bang theory?

865
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,660
I have seen that.
Terrific.

866
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,910
But you know what that is?
That's pickups.

867
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,230
A lot of it.
What do you mean?

868
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,273
You know what pickups are like?
You shoot a scene and then they have to 

869
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,423
change a line or they want to do 
something different and they do pick up 

870
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,170
some episode of big bang theory that 
aired and then they sucked out the laugh

871
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:46,570
track.
So you're seeing these negative.

872
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,980
Definitely.
Oh,

873
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:48,963
you're seeing silence where normally you
would be laughing in theory if it was 

874
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,274
funny,
but they just insert laughs and so I 

875
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:59,380
guess people at home laugh at the same 
time because they're triggered to.

876
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,030
Well,
it's might be very.

877
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,410
Yeah,
that's a soundtrack.

878
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:03,760
Probably a laugh track rather.

879
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,440
The laugh track is.
Yeah,

880
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:07,780
it's like some kind of uh,
we did shows,

881
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,820
I think there were,
they do,

882
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,420
we didn't even know what audience and 
they just,

883
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,390
they did a laugh track on news radio.
Oh yeah,

884
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:14,224
you guys did it.
We did a couple shows that were like 

885
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:16,614
completely ridiculous.
I can't remember if they used to laugh 

886
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:21,340
track or if they showed it to people.
I think it's some of them they showed it

887
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:22,174
to people.
I feel like in at least one or two 

888
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:27,010
scenes or mother had a laugh track,
but we did a few episodes that were like

889
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,380
super bizarre.
Like one of them was in space,

890
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,540
so the whole episode took place in 
space,

891
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,240
like just news radio in space.
No explanation whatsoever.

892
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,150
A space suit on like the whole thing.
It's fucking ridiculous.

893
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,570
And that deep into season six,
I think,

894
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,400
I don't remember what season,
we only dId five seasons,

895
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,140
but another one we did a titanic 
episode.

896
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,230
We will do one ridiculous episode every 
now and again.

897
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,293
The titanic episode.
We literally had a fill the setup with 

898
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:50,974
water.
So in the titanic episode mark sloshing 

899
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:57,850
through water up to my waist.
It's freezing or it's fucking cold man,

900
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,923
because like you think of water that you
climb into like unless you're outside 

901
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:02,824
and this is a summer,
it's 100 degrees out there was going to 

902
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,164
be fucking cold and you can only stand 
it for so long before you start 

903
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,290
shivering.
So you're walking through the.

904
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,300
They,
they,

905
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,480
they turned a set.
He'll fucking swimming pool.

906
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:16,150
So ridiculous.
That's hilarious.

907
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,340
Just paul simms as a genius.
Yeah,

908
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,040
It was just a mad man.
You know,

909
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,903
we should do one night just as an 
experiment is set ups a couple speakers 

910
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,413
in the back of the room at the comedy 
store and do a laugh track during our 

911
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:32,350
set and see if it makes the audience 
just fucking go into a frenzy.

912
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,800
Would you think that it wouldn't know 
something's amiss?

913
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,993
That would really be funny.
You write a bunch of shit that's 

914
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:42,700
purposely not funny and have some 
ridiculous soundtrack.

915
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,523
See how people reacted that way.
There'll be a fascinating experience 

916
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,333
experiment.
Rather if you did something super 

917
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,400
offensive,
you know,

918
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:53,920
you talked about something like super 
super offensive.

919
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,863
Yeah,
and you did it all under hidden cameras 

920
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,843
and you just see if people laughed at 
something that's like really fucked up 

921
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,820
and then interview them after the show.
Why were you laughing at that?

922
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,410
You know,
like isn't that like the always supposed

923
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:06,244
to be the knock on shit?
Like when people talk about rape 

924
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:09,184
culture,
they're always supposed to say that you 

925
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:10,684
know,
some guys on stage and he's talking 

926
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:12,994
about rape and everybody's cheering and 
laughing like that fucking never 

927
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:17,110
happens.
That never happens.

928
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,020
Like if you go on stage and you have a 
joke about rape,

929
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:22,170
god damn that joke better be funny.
Yeah,

930
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,170
it better be so god damn funny if you're
going to pull off a rape joke.

931
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,923
Oh,
you saying people clapping on the wrong 

932
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:29,854
side of it.
WhAt I'm saying is do a joke that is 

933
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,310
purposely offensive,
really

934
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,390
bad,
but do it on purpose.

935
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,280
Let everybody know,
don't let the audience know,

936
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,833
do It in front of the audience and have 
a ridiculous soundtrack in the back of 

937
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,020
the room,
which is roars,

938
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:46,040
laughter,
and have people around going,

939
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:46,874
what the fuck she's talking about raping
kids and have cameras set up to capture 

940
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,960
the audience's reaction and then put it 
on.

941
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,010
Put it on youtube and interview them 
afterwards.

942
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,510
Ask them like if they sign a release,
I have to sound fucking releasing.

943
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,170
what were you thinking?
How would you go?

944
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:01,004
Like,
are you freaking out that people were 

945
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:02,630
laughing?
Like,

946
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,070
I don't know.
I just started laughing.

947
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:04,850
Yeah,
couldn't.

948
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,190
I was compelled.
What else is laughing?

949
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,390
That's what happens,
right?

950
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:10,190
People are laughing.
He around you.

951
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:11,450
You start laughing more.
Uh,

952
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:12,470
yeah.
I mean that is,

953
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,413
that's part of the reason why club is so
good because they're all like jammed in 

954
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:17,174
together like that.

955
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,550
Yeah.
No,

956
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,250
it's a weird.
It's a very weird phenomenon when.

957
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,580
Because there's always the guy that 
goes,

958
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:25,414
I should be a comedian because at my 
office everybody tells me I'm like the 

959
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:29,170
funniest guy,
and it's like,

960
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,033
well then you know what?
You'd probably be a good comedian 

961
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:32,524
because it's easier on stage in a way.
If it's a good crowd and you go up 

962
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:37,444
there,
you've got 100 people facIng you 

963
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,280
drinking that has the here's the,
here's the drill.

964
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,740
You pay,
you pay money and you laugh.

965
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,560
Not you might cry,
you might,

966
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:48,281
whatever.
No,

967
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:50,050
there's an agenda.
You're going to laugh,

968
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:55,000
so if you get up there and you do things
that are in the realm of funny,

969
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,103
you're going to get the benefit of the 
doubt more so than if you walked onto a 

970
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,350
subway platform and started tellIng a 
bunch of rush hour commuters.

971
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:03,640
The same fucking material.

972
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,903
Yeah.
Or your friends that don't want to hear 

973
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:08,544
you talk over them.
The worst thing is watching one guy go 

974
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:15,944
on a rant that might be funny and the 
other guy starts talking over it and 

975
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,020
you're like,
oh no.

976
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,100
Yeah,
no.

977
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,933
That that guy's going through right now.
The ranter when he's like in the groove 

978
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:27,070
and the other guys were.
I go to a furniture designer too,

979
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,850
and just shits on his rent.
When you see guys at a bar and what they

980
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,803
want,
guys just starts talking over the other 

981
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:34,664
guy,
the lift on their toes and get louder 

982
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:38,290
and louder.

983
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,123
Yeah,
because there's a chick there and 

984
00:43:40,391 --> 00:43:42,100
they're trying to score.
That's the worst.

985
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,410
Did you ever have a friend that would 
insult you and girls were around?

986
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,333
Oh yeah.
I had a friend fucking knock me down 

987
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:49,870
once we punch.
Well,

988
00:43:49,871 --> 00:43:50,704
there was an ice,
there was a lake near my house growing 

989
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:54,580
up and we used to skate there.
it was fucking unbelievable.

990
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,080
I grew up in tarrytown,
New York,

991
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:58,960
and we had this reservoir that actually 
feeds New York city.

992
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:02,020
It's like the main reservoir for the 
water drinking water in New York city.

993
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,620
And so,
um,

994
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,610
it would freeze in the winter and then 
they had this shack,

995
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:11,590
this big fucking wooden shack twice the 
size of this room and it had benches and

996
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:14,980
it had a little snack bar,
hot chocolate and hot dogs.

997
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,323
Then you go outside and there's like a 
wooden wooden steps going down into the 

998
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:21,100
lake with telephone poles.

999
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:21,933
They put it,
and this is a big fucking leg telephone 

1000
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:25,750
poles around half the circumference of 
the,

1001
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,531
the,
uh,

1002
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:30,760
the perimeter of the lake with 
spotlights and radio,

1003
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,203
and they would crank fucking pop music 
and you'd go out there until 11:00 at 

1004
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,244
night.
We'd hide six packs in The snow on the 

1005
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:42,000
banks of the lake.
We go out there,

1006
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:44,610
we're in seventh and eighth grade 
drinking a couple beers,

1007
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:45,444
hitting on chicks.
And so I'm out there one night and then 

1008
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,950
during the day we play hockey all 
fucking day.

1009
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:50,784
They had metal nets they would put out 
and they would use a plow to plow the 

1010
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:57,810
snow to make rinks out of the fucking 
snow on the ice.

1011
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,610
Whoa.
It was insane.

1012
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:03,570
And this was before global warming.
That shit froze by christmas and we were

1013
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:07,150
skating in march every fucking year.
March,

1014
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,050
early march.
How do you know when to stop?

1015
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,470
Well,
it's three feet thick plate.

1016
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:14,250
How do you know when it's not three 
days?

1017
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,420
They tell you the town tests it.
There's a big visit,

1018
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,500
another shack on top of the hill where 
they have spotters.

1019
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,980
There's guys that are ringing,
you know,

1020
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,760
guys skating with jackets that are the 
rink guys.

1021
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,100
And um,
so,

1022
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,113
so anyway,
I'm there and I'm talking to this chick 

1023
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,970
from the next town over.
So olin was her name.

1024
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:36,804
I remember this deep voice.
Brown eyes were real fucking italian 

1025
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,404
girl.
That was my type little plump italian 

1026
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,870
and I'm talking to her and all the 
sudden I get fucking knocked down.

1027
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,823
This kid,
chris spencer had skated towards me and 

1028
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:55,320
just checked me just fucking.
And I fell down,

1029
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:57,270
hit my head,
couldn't get up for a little bit.

1030
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:58,740
And I was like,
what?

1031
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:00,210
The.
And my friends were laughing.

1032
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,040
It's like,
what the fuck was that?

1033
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:05,670
Chris was like trying to break into our 
little circle of friends and he was this

1034
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:06,504
big dude and he lifted weights and that 
was his way of like getting into the 

1035
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:11,214
group was too fucking knock me down.
When I was talking to colin and I tried 

1036
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:15,744
to fight him later after when I had my 
sneakers on and thankfully somebody 

1037
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:20,370
broke it up,
he would've fucking killed me,

1038
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,380
but I'm cut to.
Oh,

1039
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,100
insulin liked me at the time.
Cut to a.

1040
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,293
What was it,
a halloween the following year we're 

1041
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:39,850
running around and somebody sprayed 
shaving cream in my eyes and so I chased

1042
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:41,470
him down and it was somebody dressed as 
a bum,

1043
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,750
knock them down,
sitting on top of him,

1044
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:46,510
punching him in the face.
People start grabbing me screaming,

1045
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,070
dude,
it's a girl.

1046
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,430
So I fucking runaway.
Turns out.

1047
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,820
Oh no.
Guess what?

1048
00:46:56,821 --> 00:47:00,690
Guess we had a big crush on me.
Now her after you beat her ass,

1049
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,570
tell me about her fucking childhood.
Whoa.

1050
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,613
Really?
Yeah.

1051
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,210
So what happened?
Did you have to apologize now?

1052
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:09,044
I.
She was in the next town so I didn't 

1053
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:11,790
really.
I just ducked out of center.

1054
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,380
how many times you hit her?
I think a few times.

1055
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,280
She's a girl.
WhY did she spray you in the face?

1056
00:47:21,281 --> 00:47:21,811
Does she know?
It was,

1057
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:23,370
you know,
he used to run around with.

1058
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,233
We would take shaving cream and we put 
aerosol tops on a shave down barbasol 

1059
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,530
can and we'd spray each other.
You know,

1060
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:29,980
when you came

1061
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,813
home you were covered.
You were a snowman when you came home 

1062
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,513
and we'd have eggs and we slap each 
other in the Forehead with an egg and 

1063
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,633
we'd run around.
There's always one asshole had nair and 

1064
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:41,020
then you'd have to go home early because
he sPrayed fucking nair on your head.

1065
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,380
so she,
she sprayed shaving cream In my eyes.

1066
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,500
Couldn't see that.
Well wow.

1067
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,423
And I,
uh,

1068
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,873
knocked around a little bit.
My first domestic abuse charge her go 

1069
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:03,010
punch me on the bus once really was like
weird thing,

1070
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:08,011
man.
When I was 14 I got on the bus for a,

1071
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,170
for 13 year olds,
like the junior high school bus.

1072
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,440
And there was this guy who actually 
became a buddy of mine later.

1073
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:18,990
He was young back then,
mugsy malone and shut the fuck up.

1074
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,090
Just a tiny little dude at the time he 
was,

1075
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,470
I think he's two years younger than me.
And anyway,

1076
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,970
some girl was mad at me for something.
I don't remember what happened,

1077
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,760
but she started throwing punches at me 
and I'm like,

1078
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:34,370
what the fuck?
And I block her punches and then I,

1079
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,430
I looked down and the dude was right 
behind her and then he said something to

1080
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:40,264
someone else,
said something to him and he looked at 

1081
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:41,921
me and goes,
yeah,

1082
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:43,030
I ain't afraid of you either.

1083
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,410
And I was like,
all right.

1084
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,250
I'm just,
what the fuck ever,

1085
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,030
man.
It's like,

1086
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,630
can I fight this girl before I fight you
mosey wills?

1087
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,573
It's just fucked up.
I was new to the town and I don't know 

1088
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:56,170
what happened when she was mad at me 
for,

1089
00:48:56,171 --> 00:48:58,990
but I remember blocking punches by some 
girls trying to beat my ass.

1090
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,920
The fuck are you doing?
And this little dude mad at me too.

1091
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,670
But bugsy malone,
who is he wearing?

1092
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:07,810
A little newsy cap from the 19 forties.
I'm super lucky.

1093
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,860
I never hit that girl back because it 
turned out she wound up dating my friend

1094
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:15,070
mark who a captain of the wrestling team
like afterWards,

1095
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,860
like after this and he would have killed
me.

1096
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,580
He was an aniMal and he was a couple 
years old and I was like,

1097
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,230
I was 14,
he was 17,

1098
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:27,700
he was a senior and he was like one of 
the best wrestlers in the state.

1099
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,550
He was an animal.
He smoke cigarettes in between wrestling

1100
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,384
practice.
He would be in wrestling practice and 

1101
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:35,320
that girl that tried to beat my ass,
she would.

1102
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,070
She would open up the door and he would 
go outside and it was wintertime out and

1103
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,990
he would take a couple of drags of a 
cigarette.

1104
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,600
ReallY?
Yeah.

1105
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:43,523
Yeah.
While he was wrestling like at a really 

1106
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:47,890
high level,
he was smoking cigarettes.

1107
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,910
Yeah.
He was like a,

1108
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:52,780
a thug slash athlete.
Interesting.

1109
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,590
Like legitimate Bad motherfucker like 
animal.

1110
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,790
It was an animal wrestler Made me 
realize like real early on,

1111
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:04,240
like wrestling practice maDe me realize 
like how hard some people work out.

1112
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,420
I had no idea how hard some people work 
out.

1113
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,373
Yeah,
because I had taken like karate classes 

1114
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:09,394
before and I had played baseball,
but I never did anything like wrestling 

1115
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,980
in my first days of rest in class.
I remember thinking,

1116
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:15,814
what the fuck you guys worked this hard.
We have to go upstairs with to carry 

1117
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:22,300
someone on our back and climb up stadium
stairs.

1118
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,130
What the fuck are you talking about?
Like why?

1119
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,973
What we're doing what we're doing.
Endless drills were fireman carrying 

1120
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,340
each other back and forth across the 
fucking gym,

1121
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:34,820
racing each other and constant live 
drills with wrestling.

1122
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,280
I would leave there.
I could barelY walk.

1123
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,470
I was so tired.
I didn't.

1124
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,613
I didn't do any homework while I was 
wrestling and I just want up doing no 

1125
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:42,824
homework ever.

1126
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,580
THat's true.
With wrestling you.

1127
00:50:44,581 --> 00:50:46,680
It really fucks up your grades.
You come home,

1128
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,330
annihilate,
violated your hungry.

1129
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,833
But I just want to sleep.
And then did you have to try to lose 

1130
00:50:53,611 --> 00:50:54,444
weight from her?

1131
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,990
I did,
but I wound up stopping doing it because

1132
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,890
my friend steven was wrestling at 128 
pounds and he was a better wrestler than

1133
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:02,724
me so I went up to 1:34,
which is basically like what I weighed 

1134
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,500
when I was 14 or 15,
whatever it was.

1135
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,110
So it was pretty easy.
I didn't have to cut any weiGht at all,

1136
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:10,944
but then I cut weight for taekwondo when
I stopped wrestling and then I started 

1137
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:14,843
fiGhting and taekwondo.
I cut a lot of weight up until I was 17 

1138
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:20,670
and then when I was 17 I was still 
trying to make 140 pounds,

1139
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,720
but I'd be walking around at like 1:50 
something and I would just starve myself

1140
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:25,554
and dehydrate myself was terrible,
really fucked with my performance and 

1141
00:51:28,891 --> 00:51:29,724
then I stopped doing it.
I went up to 1:54 and when I went up to 

1142
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:33,900
1:54,
I became way better.

1143
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,980
That was when I Got better.
I was holding myself back by the dieting

1144
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:40,080
and I think that that's a big factor 
with wrestlers,

1145
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:44,460
but one thing we wrestlers is that their
Mental toughness,

1146
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:48,360
because of that weight cutting,
it's almost worth it because the mental.

1147
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:50,430
It's super bad for your health to cut a 
lot of weight,

1148
00:51:50,431 --> 00:51:52,290
but those guys who could do it and still
compete,

1149
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:57,150
they have the ability to push through 
discomfort and just have a drive to win.

1150
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,123
At.
Very few sports can match because very 

1151
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:00,294
few sports,
where will the athlete compete in a 

1152
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:06,330
state of like uncomfort as much as 
wrestlers?

1153
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,600
They're just dieting,
starving theMselves,

1154
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:13,650
dehydrating themselves and still going 
out there like fucking savages.

1155
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:18,210
So it's just a different kind of sport 
man.

1156
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:19,470
Different sport.
But anyway,

1157
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,560
that girl basically beat my ass.
I mean she didn't really beat my ass,

1158
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:25,230
but she was younger than you.
I think she was my age.

1159
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,990
She was on the bus too.
She was taking the bus back,

1160
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,840
but I was thinking I'd better not 
punched this girl.

1161
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,490
Oh my god.
I'm so glad I didn't.

1162
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,710
I got smacked by a gay kid in eighth 
grade.

1163
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,450
Oh shit.
You got pimp slapped.

1164
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,990
Pinch this,
this black kid,

1165
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:38,824
keith.
He was really a feminist and so he used 

1166
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:41,810
to tease him.
yeah.

1167
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,580
I'm not proud of it.
but like at that age he just kinda did.

1168
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:47,260
It was like,
you know,

1169
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,690
I'm embarrassed by it.
Like we,

1170
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:50,740
you know,
I used to whatever,

1171
00:52:50,741 --> 00:52:53,020
you know,
cock your wrist and say shit.

1172
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,730
And he turned around a fucking,
smacked me across the face and I,

1173
00:52:57,731 --> 00:52:58,990
and he,
and he stunned me.

1174
00:52:58,991 --> 00:53:00,340
I was like,
holy shit.

1175
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,670
And uh,
I didn't know what to do because he was,

1176
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:04,923
he was part of a family that was,
there was projects and tarrytown and 

1177
00:53:07,991 --> 00:53:08,824
there were cousins and there were 
families that had a lot of cousins and 

1178
00:53:11,831 --> 00:53:12,664
his,
his cousins were some bad ass 

1179
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:15,070
motherfuckers.
The davis's.

1180
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,270
Oh no.
And so,

1181
00:53:16,271 --> 00:53:17,104
uh,
this isn't to say I necessarily would 

1182
00:53:18,941 --> 00:53:22,270
have hit him after that for a number of 
reasons,

1183
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:23,770
one of which I was not that touGh.

1184
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,030
I was pretty tough with girls,
but,

1185
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:29,340
um,
but I think I was just so shocked.

1186
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,870
Did you know that you deserved it?
Do,

1187
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:31,704
do you have a feeling I deserved.
I got hit a lot as a kid and I deserved 

1188
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:37,650
it most of the time.
I got punched in the face in time square

1189
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:40,290
when I was about 14 drinking southern 
comfort.

1190
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,273
I walked past some guy who was like some
fucking homeless drug addict who was 

1191
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:47,550
like coughing up a louis.
And so I started coughing really hard to

1192
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,650
making fun of him.
He came back and punched me right in the

1193
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:50,484
face.
You don't want to get beat up by a 

1194
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:55,140
junkie.
We know you're not in the days of aids.

1195
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,940
Oh,
that's rIght.

1196
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,740
It was.
Could have been an aids he punched now.

1197
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,090
I used to get smacked around.
I was.

1198
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,343
I was such a fucking asshole.
I was such a wise ass cause I was the 

1199
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:08,160
smallest kid.
So that was how I fit in.

1200
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,860
I was the funny guy who made fun of 
everybody.

1201
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,140
I would pick fights because then my 
friends would,

1202
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,370
would fight the fights.
I was that guy.

1203
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,573
Well certain things that kids like when 
they're growing up and one of the big 

1204
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:23,640
ones,

1205
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,770
just things happening.
We like action.

1206
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,640
Like something happened.
If fitz,

1207
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,523
he's going to go fuck with that guy,
but I'm going to kick his ass because 

1208
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,040
we're bored.
We had no fucking internet phones.

1209
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,200
We stood on a street corner for five 
hours.

1210
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:39,000
That was saturday night.
My friend kenny.

1211
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,863
We'll just start fights with people who 
would just go find someone like a bus 

1212
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,080
stop and just start beating him.

1213
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:45,300
No shit.
Come on.

1214
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:46,070
We're fighting.
Yeah,

1215
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,040
it was crazy.

1216
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,380
Yeah,
watch them fight.

1217
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,200
I watched him get his ass kicked.
He did it once with this guy and the guy

1218
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:54,420
knew how to fight.
Guy was beating his ass.

1219
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,920
Good.
What's the kids name?

1220
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,610
Kenny.
What was his deal?

1221
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,350
He was just nuts.
He was older than us.

1222
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,670
He was like one,
one or two years older than him.

1223
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:05,830
They guy?
Nope.

1224
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:07,360
Nope,
not particularly big.

1225
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,870
Just fucking tough as nails.
He had a boxing tattoo on his arm.

1226
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,120
Like I think he had a tasmanian devil 
with boxing gloves on.

1227
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,860
They didn't really box.
Yeah,

1228
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:15,743
it was just one of those things like 
never made it to an actual gym like 

1229
00:55:18,011 --> 00:55:18,844
maybe a couple of times,
but we just start fights and wasn't 

1230
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,390
really that good at it.
Yeah,

1231
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,740
it was.
It was just crazy.

1232
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,633
He just,
he was crazy and he wanted to fight and 

1233
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:30,460
he realized that with his limited 
mentality and view of the world that the

1234
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:32,650
most fun that he had was when he was 
fiGhting.

1235
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:33,484
So it was like,
well that means we fight until he just 

1236
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,540
would want to fight all the time.

1237
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,330
Like one time my dog got hit by a car.
It was really sad,

1238
00:55:40,331 --> 00:55:41,164
man.
I lived on a busy street and my dog 

1239
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:44,963
opened the door and she gets super 
excited to go for a walk and she didn't 

1240
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,450
ever on a leash and she ran out into the
street.

1241
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:51,940
I just didn't anticipate or running.
She's usually pretty good about it.

1242
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,800
And she ran out and she got nailed by a 
car.

1243
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,731
Geez.
Oh,

1244
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:56,320
so sad.
She died right in front of me.

1245
00:55:56,321 --> 00:56:00,160
I carried her back into the house and 
she shit herself.

1246
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,290
Like that's when I knew something I 
didn't,

1247
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:03,124
I still didn't know something was wrong,
but looking back I would've known she 

1248
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,900
just shit all over the kitchen and I was
like,

1249
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,820
I can't believe she shit herself.
Like what?

1250
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,010
Like why she never sits in the house.
And um,

1251
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,073
then she just slowly slipped away,
just lie down and I'm just stopped 

1252
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:20,494
breathinG.
Man just bled blood from the inside 

1253
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,010
bleeding.
She Got

1254
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,510
hit by a volkswagen bug kind of dog.
She was a mix.

1255
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:32,960
She was boxer and I think she had some 
german shepherd in her too.

1256
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,740
Sweet dog.
Sad shit man.

1257
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,150
Who's sad?
Shit.

1258
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:40,600
It was a real bummer man.
It was a real bummer.

1259
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,930
But anyway,
uh,

1260
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:46,690
I told kenny I'd never had it.
I mean I'd had dogs die.

1261
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:47,973
we had a dog that we adopted.
It had distemper when one up having to 

1262
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:51,790
put it to sleep,
start going crazy.

1263
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:54,730
It was an adult dog,
not Adult,

1264
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:55,564
but it was over a year old and a,
it was a doberman and it just started 

1265
00:56:58,571 --> 00:56:59,404
barking at us and smiling.
It's its teeth and it just started 

1266
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,600
losinG its mind and we got it calmed 
down enough.

1267
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:05,443
We'd get a leash on it and brought it to
a vet and the vet said it had to stamp 

1268
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:09,400
her.
We had to put it down.

1269
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,320
So I had had that happen before,
but I've never,

1270
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,400
never seen a dog die in front of me.
Sad shit.

1271
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,820
So I tell kenny,
he's like,

1272
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,240
we're fighting.
That's it.

1273
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,710
Come on out with fighting rogan.
You'll fucking fight no excuses tonight.

1274
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,170
And we drove around and he like wanted 
me to pick fights with people.

1275
00:57:27,171 --> 00:57:27,510
I'm like,
dude,

1276
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,343
am not fucking fighting anybody.
That's the way he would deal with his 

1277
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:31,960
emotions.
Yeah,

1278
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,430
pretty sure.
Sadness,

1279
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,510
fight,
anger,

1280
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:36,010
fight.
Looking for excitement,

1281
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:37,020
fight.
It's an end.

1282
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:39,220
It's also,
there's a thing about,

1283
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,163
um,
young guys were young guys always want 

1284
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,000
to be the crazy one.
Like,

1285
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,590
oh,
mike's the fucking craziest.

1286
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:45,790
Mike's fucking crazy,
michael,

1287
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,653
and give a fuck.
And it becomes like a social status 

1288
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,930
among young.
Especially.

1289
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,820
We were talking about this beFore the 
podcast.

1290
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,940
Everybody,
our age was like a latchkey kid.

1291
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,073
Everybody our age had a mom and a dad 
that worked and they open the fucking 

1292
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:01,030
door in the morning and you were off to 
the races.

1293
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,600
You went school afterschool.
They weren't home for hours,

1294
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,370
right?
You did a bunch of shit by yourself.

1295
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,090
Most of the time we're around other 
fucking savages our age.

1296
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,930
So it's the abstract influence of the 
parents on the children.

1297
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,123
That is really like giving you your 
experience for who you are as a young 

1298
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:20,110
person.
Yeah.

1299
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:20,741
You're,
you're,

1300
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:21,574
you're experiencing how these people 
taught their kids and what the result 

1301
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:27,870
was because you're around the kids all 
the time and not around your parents.

1302
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,660
they say that you're raised by your 
peers after the age of 12 year.

1303
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:33,460
Basically your parents are out.
Yeah.

1304
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:34,930
You're raised by your peers.
Yeah.

1305
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:36,730
You're constantly with your friends in 
school.

1306
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:39,130
You're constantly with your friends in 
any activities you have.

1307
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,180
You're looking for their validation 
instead of your parents validate.

1308
00:58:42,181 --> 00:58:44,440
Exactly,
and with My friends it was always,

1309
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,760
who's the sickest fuck?

1310
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,030
Mike's a sick fuck,
you know,

1311
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,110
steve's just sick as fuck.
He doesn't give a fuck.

1312
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:54,100
he's crazy and there was a value in that
because everybody was scared.

1313
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,390
That waS really at the bottom line of 
it.

1314
00:58:55,391 --> 00:59:00,100
We're all young men and we're on our way
to becoming adults and no one knows what

1315
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:00,934
the fuck they're going to do and we have
a few friends that have graduated 

1316
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:04,190
highschool and they're losers now and 
like,

1317
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,560
shit,
that might be me.

1318
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,890
Like that was the big cloud that was 
always hanging over everybody's head.

1319
00:59:08,891 --> 00:59:11,020
What are you doing after high school?
What are you doing after high school?

1320
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:15,040
And it was like this impending date of 
doom that was coming up.

1321
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:17,890
So everybody was scared all the time and
everybody wanted to be.

1322
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:18,724
They wanted to be a man.
Everybody they wanted to prove 

1323
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:20,734
themselves.
They wanted it to be somethinG special 

1324
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:23,090
and no one felt special.

1325
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,910
You know,
everybody felt like fucking loser,

1326
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,650
you know,
we're all like waitinG,

1327
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:28,783
waiting to become an adult so you could 
get a job like all these other people 

1328
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:35,960
you knew that were around you or escape 
or figuring out a way to escape he had.

1329
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:37,940
Then there's always the community 
colleGe,

1330
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:38,571
like people go,
well,

1331
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:39,404
you know,
I'll probably end up when you hear I'll 

1332
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:42,440
probably end up at the community 
college.

1333
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,960
THat's going to be one semester and out.
I did that.

1334
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,750
I went to massbay massbay community 
college.

1335
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,230
I did it after a whole year.
I took a whole year off and I just,

1336
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:52,423
I only went back to school because I 
didn't want people thinking I was a 

1337
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:58,250
loser,
so I did like maybe one semester at mass

1338
00:59:58,251 --> 00:59:59,084
bay.
I don't even think I finished the 

1339
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:01,430
semester and then I left and went to 
umass.

1340
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,550
Umass boston had this like adult 
education program.

1341
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,383
we didn't have to have a ged or a not 
gad sat because I never took my sats 

1342
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,430
because when I graduated from high 
school I'm like,

1343
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:11,720
I am never going to school again,
like,

1344
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:12,554
fuck this.
But I got so tired of feeling like a 

1345
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:16,230
fucking loser.
Like wHen I tell people is take,

1346
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,780
I would always say I was taking a year 
off,

1347
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,700
took a year off,
but it really,

1348
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:20,534
I just had no directioN I was doing was 
doing martial arts and competing and I 

1349
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:27,560
just was so terrified of what the fuck 
the future lead.

1350
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,800
And so I went to umass for like three 
Years but not like three full years.

1351
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:37,820
It was like there was still a lot of 
credits to be acquired if I was going to

1352
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:42,110
graduate and I just was wasting my time.
I was barely paying attention.

1353
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,944
I wasn't doing.
I was completely half asking whatever 

1354
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:45,200
project we had.

1355
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,400
And then I was realizing like,
what am I,

1356
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:47,490
why am I wasting my time?
Yeah.

1357
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,620
And then,
uh,

1358
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:49,463
I got some letter saying that I couldn't
come back With the grades that I had 

1359
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:58,130
unless I came up with some very 
compelling reason.

1360
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,173
So they wanted me to make an arguMent 
for why they should include me back in 

1361
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:03,014
the class.
And I wrote out in handwritten because 

1362
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:06,950
back then no one had a fuckin 
typewriter,

1363
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,360
thiS total bullshit letter,
this ridiculous,

1364
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:16,660
like a persuasive bullshitty letter 
about how important education is to me.

1365
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:19,184
And I'm like how important it means.
And then I realized like the amount of 

1366
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:27,791
effort that I put writing this bullshit 
letter to keep these people from kicking

1367
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:28,814
me out of their school,
which I wasn't paying attention to far 

1368
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:34,850
exceeds any effort that I ever put on 
any project ever in class.

1369
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,390
Yeah.

1370
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,260
And then I realized,
Okay,

1371
01:01:36,261 --> 01:01:39,590
whatever I'm going to Do with my life,
it's not going to involve doing.

1372
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:40,424
This is not going to involve someone 
else dictating my schedule for whatever 

1373
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:45,140
reason.
And you're like,

1374
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:48,830
clearly I can write clearly.
I can really think maybe common.

1375
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:49,221
Yeah.
Well,

1376
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:50,810
I had a conversation with,
um,

1377
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,880
a science teacher,
the science teacher,

1378
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,440
and it was the same kind of thing.
I,

1379
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,520
I'm mocked him in class,
not necessarily mocked him,

1380
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,270
but I brought up something that was 
contrary to what he was teaching.

1381
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:05,300
He was talking about a lake erie being a
dead lake.

1382
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:06,021
And I said,
listen man,

1383
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:06,854
they had a documentary on pbs last night
about lake erie making a resurgence and 

1384
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:14,270
these scientists have figured out these 
new ways to minimize water pollution and

1385
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,250
all this shit.
And like other kIds looking at me like,

1386
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:17,084
what the fuck?

1387
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,610
And he got pissed at me.
He got really pissed at me and he said,

1388
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,630
you're undermining my class and this is 
not a go,

1389
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:24,540
hey man,
you're teaching old shit.

1390
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:27,240
This is on tv man.
This on tv.

1391
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:28,900
Like Yesterday.
Yeah.

1392
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,873
And I had a conversation with them 
afterwards and because I had to talk to 

1393
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:35,454
him in order to get back in the class,
he kicked me out of class and he said 

1394
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:38,641
two things.
He said,

1395
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:39,870
one,
he said,

1396
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:44,400
first of all,
I don't know whether or not that was the

1397
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:45,234
case.
Whether or not it's true and if I allow 

1398
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:49,230
you to just interrupt my class and chime
in,

1399
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:52,980
something like that and it's not true.
I haven't fact checked it.

1400
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,833
You're telling the whole class and I 
don't know if you're right or you're 

1401
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,440
wrong or you're making things up,
but you're interrupting my class.

1402
01:02:58,530 --> 01:02:59,363
That's the point.
If you have something to tell me about 

1403
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:01,104
it,
maybe you could tell me about it after 

1404
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:02,844
the class and then I can go and look it 
up and then maybe I can correct the 

1405
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,114
class he was,
but to in interrupting the class you 

1406
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,230
showed yourself to be more articulate 
and more intelligent the you ever showed

1407
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:17,090
ever in the entire semester.
So you're totally half housing.

1408
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,950
Everything you do,
you're writing everything in paper.

1409
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:20,784
You turn in every test you do,
every time I call upon you for a 

1410
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:25,380
question totally half that have asked 
that,

1411
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,510
but when you wanted to correct me on 
something,

1412
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:28,344
all of a sudden you knew all the words.
You knew how to form the sentence 

1413
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:32,640
correctly.
You've got to say with the right impact.

1414
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,930
He's like,
you just.

1415
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,580
Your focus is off.
I was like,

1416
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,200
god damn,
that dude's on the money,

1417
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,670
and I realized.
I'm like,

1418
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,410
yeah,
so I'm not stupid,

1419
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,653
right?
I just can't.

1420
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,820
I can't listen.
I can't do it.

1421
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,330
They're way I got to do it my way

1422
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,990
could.
I just didn't.

1423
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:47,913
I grew up not having any direction.
So someone doesn't tell you what to do 

1424
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,890
all your life,
like essentially you just out free.

1425
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:54,724
I would go fishing,
I'd hang out with my friends in the 

1426
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:56,884
fucking woods.
We just go find shit to do and then all 

1427
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,044
of a sudden you're in school and they're
telling you everything you have to do 

1428
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:02,231
all day.
Like,

1429
01:04:02,231 --> 01:04:03,250
I'm not ready for that.

1430
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,990
I'm not really that like you're sitting 
in.

1431
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,550
I'm fucking shocked.
When my kid tells me about it,

1432
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:10,050
I go,
what was your scheduled today?

1433
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,131
Well,
you know,

1434
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:11,970
at eight,
15,

1435
01:04:11,971 --> 01:04:16,920
we sat down for 15 minutes for homeroom.
then at 8:30 I go to my first class,

1436
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:17,754
which is an hour and 15 minutes.
Then we get five minutes off and we go 

1437
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:25,170
to another class that's two hours.
They got these long fucking class and it

1438
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:26,004
goes like that till 3:00,
thinking like 25 minutes for lunch and 

1439
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:30,744
they're sitting be boys with fucking 
chemicals racing through their bodies 

1440
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,383
and girls at the next desk with fucking 
short shorts and cleavage and little 

1441
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:40,194
brown titties sticking him.
You know when the breeze hits them and 

1442
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:42,684
they get a little bit of goosebumps on 
the inside of the cleavage and that 

1443
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,660
cross jesus is just wedge right in 
between those two.

1444
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:51,220
Brown for the italian horn,
the italian,

1445
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:57,520
and it's got glitter on it or the 
italian.

1446
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:01,830
How about charm bracelets?
Charm bracelets.

1447
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,890
The fuckIng flip flops.
Her toes.

1448
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:07,800
She just painted them with toes.
Very important.

1449
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:10,460
The girl doesn't take care of her toes 
now.

1450
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,390
Can't trust her with a pussy.
Oh fuck.

1451
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:14,010
Yeah.
Show me your face.

1452
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,360
I hate to do this on equal pay day.

1453
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:19,820
Oh yeah.
No.

1454
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,070
You go into the salon.
You're going to get you're gonna.

1455
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,640
Get your fucking nails done after you 
get your coach done.

1456
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,640
Wow.
Very important for greg fitzsimmons.

1457
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

1458
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:30,004
What'd you the idea of letting those 
kids get trapped in that system where 

1459
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:35,224
all day you're just doing that and then 
you get sitting passively and then you 

1460
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:40,660
get out and you have more work to do at 
home.

1461
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,630
That just sort of eliminated any social 
life you might have,

1462
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:44,563
right?
You would think that that would be 

1463
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:49,220
enough that going to school from seven 
to three eveRy fucking day or whatever.

1464
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,063
They made our job.
It's almost like an eight hour job and 

1465
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:52,380
then

1466
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,310
where you're really working,
the average eight hour job,

1467
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,670
you're checking your email half that 
time.

1468
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,520
The average person that's working,
is that a cubicle?

1469
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,400
I talked to people at shows.
I listen to your podcast all the time.

1470
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:07,550
When at work,
what do you do?

1471
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,530
You know,
I work in an office insurance,

1472
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,590
shouldn't you be selling shirts?
Ah,

1473
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,510
you know,
I listen to rogan's podcast everyday.

1474
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,680
That's three hours now.
You know,

1475
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,300
they're barely working.
Nobody fucking works.

1476
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,220
Nobody's working.
Especially if you have any,

1477
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:26,630
any sort of gig with any flexibility,
like it would just be on your own.

1478
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,340
You're on your own.

1479
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,480
You can get it done in a couple of 
hours.

1480
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,750
Most you go to europe and a lot of 
business models are.

1481
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:37,420
It's a shorter work day.
It's a longer lunch,

1482
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,880
more vacations.
They get the same shit done.

1483
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,270
You shouldn't have for five days a week 
either to be four.

1484
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,770
Yeah,
four is good.

1485
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:47,040
Three days off is good.
When Jamie and I do podcasts,

1486
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,360
we do more than four days.
I'm like,

1487
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:49,950
what are we doinG?
Working like,

1488
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:51,180
we'll come in on the fifth day.
I'm like,

1489
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:51,871
jesus,
jamie,

1490
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:53,010
what are we working?
Yeah.

1491
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:54,930
Even if it's like a fight companion,
I'm like,

1492
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,070
look at us.
We're here again,

1493
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,640
back in the fucking office and this is 
the greatest job of all time.

1494
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,920
Imagine if you're selling insurance,
you know,

1495
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,560
or hyundai's.
We're really coming down on an insurance

1496
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:05,430
salesman.
I don't know why.

1497
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,280
Attack premise.
It's easy to ship on.

1498
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,173
Well,

1499
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,113
insurance is an interesting gig because 
if you're on the side where you're 

1500
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:17,780
writing policies and you're coming up at
the fucking numbers on like.

1501
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,910
Because I remember when I was at boston 
university,

1502
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,163
there was a guy at the entity in the 
aDministration that had figured out the 

1503
01:07:23,901 --> 01:07:24,734
insurance policies,
you can take out insurance policies on 

1504
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,440
every student in the university,

1505
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,143
pay for them,

1506
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,780
and then the policies would pay back to 
boston university if you die.

1507
01:07:36,781 --> 01:07:37,614
There were life insurance policies 
because this guy looked at the numbers 

1508
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:41,360
and crunch them and he goes,
you know what?

1509
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,380
This is a fucking great deal.
You know what?

1510
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,500
These kids fucking dIe more often than 
the insurance company thinks.

1511
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:51,210
So they literally took out insurance 
policies on 30,000 kids.

1512
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,073
That's unsaleable back to the university
and it was a big blow up in the 

1513
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,240
newspaper about it.
I was making jokes when I was like,

1514
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:58,103
yeah,
I was wondering why they took all the 

1515
01:07:58,351 --> 01:07:59,580
traffic lights and on commonwealth.

1516
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,870
Oh,
crazy.

1517
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,360
They.
They celebrate money when you die.

1518
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,880
What?
A bunch of fucking assholes.

1519
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,860
That's what people used to do when there
was no internet.

1520
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,800
Get away with doing shit like that.
No one knew about it for.

1521
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,213
That's right.

1522
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,203
Yeah.
They probably didn't know about it 

1523
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,254
forever.
Somebody had to probably blow the 

1524
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:23,300
whistle while they was a good student 
newspaper in boston at bu,

1525
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,163
but you had a great paper.
It was one of the best ones In the 

1526
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:30,290
country and they cracked the case and 
they also were very political.

1527
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:35,291
We protested against apartheid and then 
they wouldn't allow.

1528
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:36,763
They wouldn't allow opposite sex 
students to sleep in the in somebody's 

1529
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,493
room,
but they had no overnight policy at bu 

1530
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:49,160
like in fucking 1989.
Really?

1531
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,083
So there was protests about that,
which is also really fucking weird 

1532
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:56,210
because what about gay people?
Woo.

1533
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,500
Right.
They can just bang it up.

1534
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,363
They can pay.
The guys can literally fuck each other 

1535
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:02,870
in the ass.
No problem.

1536
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:04,280
No problem.
Hang it up.

1537
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,263
You know,
probably a few problems wIth a few 

1538
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:07,820
problems.
Hemorrhoids.

1539
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:10,440
And remember when you used to get the 
girl that had a,

1540
01:09:10,441 --> 01:09:15,310
a dorm used to find the time where her 
roommate agreed to be out of the room so

1541
01:09:15,311 --> 01:09:16,144
you fuck right,
or you would come back into the room 

1542
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,930
after the roommate fucked and it just 
smelled like a fucking wall

1543
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,910
asshole.
Like cheeses.

1544
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,520
No ventilation window done in this room.

1545
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,420
That that's true.
All the other smells.

1546
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:39,640
The smell with first.
Well,

1547
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:40,510
yeah,
because nobody.

1548
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,250
Look,
if you're not using a bid day,

1549
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,353
people were wiping their ass and back 
then no one even shaved girls had 

1550
01:09:46,571 --> 01:09:48,940
asshole hair standard.
It was standard.

1551
01:09:48,941 --> 01:09:51,400
You'd find dingleberry's on girls all 
the time.

1552
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,160
Right?
People just smudge that shit after.

1553
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,780
After they poop,
they smudge.

1554
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:57,280
That shit smudge it around.
Yeah.

1555
01:09:57,281 --> 01:09:58,114
And then when you're fucking,
you're sweating and pounding and the 

1556
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,193
grease from your sweat gets in her ass.
Crack and shit goes down through the 

1557
01:10:05,741 --> 01:10:09,040
taint into her asshole swishes around 
with the,

1558
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:09,874
uh,
with the shit stain and what each pump 

1559
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:15,070
of your hips,
your wafting smells through the air.

1560
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:15,904
And it permeates the atmosphere.
It sticks to the curtains and think 

1561
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:21,910
about it.
It's like a fireplace.

1562
01:10:21,911 --> 01:10:26,911
Bellows furnace is a furnace and You're 
fucking pumping air onto shit and pussy.

1563
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,063
Boy,

1564
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:45,270
there's

1565
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:47,630
no windows.
the room is like a jail cell.

1566
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:50,640
It's like eight by 10 and the dude 
probably smells like shit too.

1567
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:51,960
They probably both small.
Terrible.

1568
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,570
So he's sweating his ass.
Hold dirty too.

1569
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,010
He's probably even dirtier is 
absolutely,

1570
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:00,930
probably a more of a disaster area.
It's probably hammer here.

1571
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:01,883
Right.
So as he sweat and his sweats going on 

1572
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:07,230
the crack of his ass and yeah,
that's all wafting in the room as well,

1573
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:09,570
right?
Air fucking arm pits.

1574
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,720
Yeah,
that was intense.

1575
01:11:12,721 --> 01:11:14,430
Man.
Was some intense smells

1576
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,263
back then.
And then you didn't clean your sheets 

1577
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:17,990
suppressing in january?
No.

1578
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,320
May.
There was no mother you.

1579
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:19,981
I cleaned.
Right.

1580
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:21,360
Here's what,
here's my laundry cycle.

1581
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:24,600
In college I had 30 pairs of underwear,
30 t shirts,

1582
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:25,434
30 pairs of socks,
one pair of sheets and once a month I 

1583
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:28,884
went downstairs and I shoved all that 
shit into the fucking oversize washing 

1584
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:35,160
machine and I was done and if those 
sheets got come on him,

1585
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,790
which they did joe rogan on a regular 
basis,

1586
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,460
they stayed that way.
They stayed cake.

1587
01:11:41,461 --> 01:11:46,461
The that was like the sheet at a fucking
jack shack at seven Pm full of dna.

1588
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,950
Ari shaffir didn't change his sheets

1589
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:50,943
for six months as an adult,
aS an adult when he was working at the 

1590
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:57,090
store.
Why did want to lazy?

1591
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,020
Never cleaned his room,
his,

1592
01:11:59,050 --> 01:11:59,883
his,
his apartment was a disaster and then 

1593
01:12:02,171 --> 01:12:04,450
one day he smartened up and just cleaned
the whole place out.

1594
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:05,710
Wow.
Yeah.

1595
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:07,690
Now he's a neat freak.
Yeah.

1596
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,940
I realized I stayed in his apartment in 
New York.

1597
01:12:09,941 --> 01:12:11,410
It was fucking nice.
Yeah.

1598
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,640
He realized,
look,

1599
01:12:12,641 --> 01:12:15,580
arusha fears of smart dude.
He's a smart dude.

1600
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,380
He bounces back,
figure shit out,

1601
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,060
figures shit out.
He bounces back.

1602
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,073
You know,
he's been off the grid for three months 

1603
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:22,210
now.
Nobody knows where he is.

1604
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,561
Are you serious?
Yeah.

1605
01:12:23,561 --> 01:12:27,230
there's pictures of him in Vietnam.
Some people have found them in Vietnam.

1606
01:12:27,231 --> 01:12:28,750
They took pictures with them and they 
put it online.

1607
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:30,460
No shit.
Yup.

1608
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,860
He shut off his phone.
Doesn't accept incoming calls.

1609
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,780
He is not answering emails.

1610
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,640
He told comedy central,
fuck you.

1611
01:12:36,641 --> 01:12:38,520
I'm disappearing for three months to 
laws.

1612
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,680
Friends told us,
hey,

1613
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:42,280
see you guys in a few months.
I don't know how long it's going to go.

1614
01:12:42,281 --> 01:12:43,340
Have fun.
He goes,

1615
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:46,120
I just Want to disconnect.
So it just completely disconnected.

1616
01:12:46,121 --> 01:12:48,010
He's been traveling.
How long ago was this?

1617
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,170
Three months ago.
He did a podcast with Henry Rollins.

1618
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,550
This is where he fucked up.
I did a podcast with Henry Rollins.

1619
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:58,360
Henry rollins is a fascinating guy.
Fascinating guy.

1620
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,730
Angry motherfucker.
He's very angry.

1621
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,623
Yeah.
But when you talked to him and you get 

1622
01:13:04,691 --> 01:13:07,120
to know his story,
all the pieces sort of fall into place.

1623
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,470
He was one of the earliest,
um,

1624
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:13,450
children that they put on prozac or 
ritalin,

1625
01:13:13,451 --> 01:13:14,980
excuse me,
ritalin.

1626
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,580
They put him on ritalin,
which is speed when he was really young,

1627
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:19,503
like five.
And so he would talk about how he'd go 

1628
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:22,534
to school,
just white knuckling until the ritalin 

1629
01:13:24,941 --> 01:13:25,630
were off.

1630
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,880
The ritalin would wear off,
like at the end of the day,

1631
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,193
we finally calmed down.
So his whole life he was just like 

1632
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,703
jacked up on speed.
Like his development cycle was kinda 

1633
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:39,460
like impaired,
but jacked up on speed in my opinion.

1634
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,080
The way he describes it,
I understand how.

1635
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:42,243
I don't know.
There's not a rational argument to me 

1636
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,003
that they wouldn't have any significant 
impact on his life being on speed all 

1637
01:13:48,911 --> 01:13:51,760
throughout his childhood years until he 
discovered exercise,

1638
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:52,853
start to exercise in high school.
Then he slowly got off the ritalin and 

1639
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:55,434
all that stuff,
but so he's developmentally like that 

1640
01:13:58,451 --> 01:14:01,330
was challenGed in a lot of ways,
but he's a fascinating guy,

1641
01:14:01,331 --> 01:14:04,000
man.
He just picks a spot on a map like bali.

1642
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,230
Okay,
let's go see boli.

1643
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:06,300
Henry rollins.
Yeah,

1644
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:08,010
by himself.
He just goes there,

1645
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,170
brings a laptop so you can write,
brings cameras.

1646
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,100
We can take pictures and writes now

1647
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,350
and just does that.
Travels all over the world.

1648
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,213
Just goes to all these different places.
He goes and hangs out with bedouins in 

1649
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:19,150
the desert.
He goes,

1650
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,100
listens to weird,
crazy music.

1651
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:21,943
These people are making and sweared 
culture so just shows up and africa 

1652
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,560
shows up in all these different places.
Just goes there,

1653
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:27,394
flies in.
So ari has them on his podcast and I 

1654
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:29,944
think our.
I was so compelled by the idea of just 

1655
01:14:31,691 --> 01:14:34,940
completely this picking a spot and going
that are.

1656
01:14:34,941 --> 01:14:36,970
He decided for his.
Because you.

1657
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,590
He's like super cognizant about africa 
does a special.

1658
01:14:39,591 --> 01:14:43,300
Like he needs more material.
So what he does is he filmed a special,

1659
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,560
filmed it,
edited it,

1660
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:45,663
and then disappeared and then just 
vanished for like three months as of 

1661
01:14:48,431 --> 01:14:49,300
right now,
three months.

1662
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,870
And what's your theory on where he is?
I don't have one.

1663
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,003
I'm gonna wait,
I'm gonna wait until he comes back and 

1664
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:56,770
then I'm going to talk to them,
see what's up.

1665
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,030
And he might not even want to talk about
it.

1666
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,010
You know what I mean?
He's such a,

1667
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:04,480
he's such an interesting guy.
He might just decide how a good time you

1668
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:06,060
don't want to talk about it.
And that'd be like,

1669
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,480
right.
You know,

1670
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,373
and maybe he'll decide that the great 
experiences would best be reserved for 

1671
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:13,180
the stage.
Like he met.

1672
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:16,030
He might have like cultivated some 
really good experiences.

1673
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:18,730
He wants to only get about on stage.
He's a weird guy,

1674
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:19,680
but in the best

1675
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,600
way,
in the best way.

1676
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:22,434
I mean,
there's a sense of fairness about him 

1677
01:15:23,611 --> 01:15:24,444
also,
like I remember because I did his show 

1678
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:27,024
last season and we did rehearsal for it 
at the comedy store in the belly room 

1679
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,520
and all of a sudden you get this fucking
nice check

1680
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,390
and it's like,
oh no,

1681
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:35,224
our,
he wanted all you guys to split this 

1682
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:40,810
money and then I did another show from 
somewhere else and it was like,

1683
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:41,501
I'm just like,
yeah,

1684
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:42,334
you do the same thing.
but he does it to a point where it's 

1685
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:49,300
like he's very aware of being as fair as
possible.

1686
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:53,530
So like when we did his tv show,
he gave us all a gift.

1687
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:56,170
I won't say what it was,
but uh,

1688
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,093
it was illegal and every single person 
and it was expensive and every single 

1689
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:02,074
person got this gift.
Like he's very thoughtful about that 

1690
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:05,044
kind of shit.

1691
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,470
Yeah.
He's just an awesome guy.

1692
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:11,820
When I met him,
he was an open miker raw open miker just

1693
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:12,770
started,
right?

1694
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,330
Young guy just got the store working as 
a doorman.

1695
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,273
And then one day I was supposed to take 
Mike Young with me and Mike Young was 

1696
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:23,760
doing the road with me a little bit and 
michael and couldn't make it.

1697
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,133
So uh,
I took ari and he had never really been 

1698
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:29,700
paid before.
You know,

1699
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,750
it never really done.
Like,

1700
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,780
I think he'd gone out with paulie,
done some shows,

1701
01:16:33,781 --> 01:16:34,980
have poly,
but I dunno,

1702
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,080
I could never.
He,

1703
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,300
I think I brought her to the comedy 
works in denver.

1704
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:41,340
You crushed while I was on stage 
crushing.

1705
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,190
I hold the phone up for Mike Young.
I go,

1706
01:16:44,191 --> 01:16:45,930
you fucked up mike.
I go,

1707
01:16:45,931 --> 01:16:48,030
listen.
And aria was onstage kill.

1708
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:48,781
And he's like,
no,

1709
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:49,141
no,
no.

1710
01:16:49,141 --> 01:16:54,141
And I hung up on him because you fucked 
up red.

1711
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:58,290
Red is my new guy.
So he's just,

1712
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,693
it was just cool knowing him to,
as an open mic or like knowing him as a 

1713
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:06,240
guy who just started out and now seeing 
him as a guy with a television show,

1714
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:08,660
a successful podcast,
but even more important,

1715
01:17:08,661 --> 01:17:10,610
a truly independent

1716
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,443
thinker.
yeah.

1717
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:13,420
Like he really is independent.
Like he's,

1718
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:15,800
he thinks his own way.
He's not,

1719
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,040
he doesn't let anybody influence.
I mean he,

1720
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,870
he'll take suggestions so talk to 
people.

1721
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:23,150
He's reasonable,
but he has an idea like what he wants to

1722
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:27,080
do with his life and he's just doing it.
Just a fucking super smart dude.

1723
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,740
Yeah.
How?

1724
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,740
I thought it was in New York has bumped 
because I'm going to be in the,

1725
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,680
in New York for this might be.
He might be by now.

1726
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,573
Yeah.
I mean when he reemerged as he may end 

1727
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:37,370
up in New York.
I get this feeling.

1728
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,990
I'm sure one day I'll just get her 
what's up?

1729
01:17:38,991 --> 01:17:41,930
faggot text out of nowhere and I'm like,
oh,

1730
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,823
he's back.
Yeah.

1731
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:44,420
God,
that's weird.

1732
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:46,310
I had no idea it was that long.
I heard he was away,

1733
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:48,190
but I know it's three months.
Yeah.

1734
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,370
He's freaking everybody out.

1735
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:50,570
Dunkin's like,
dude,

1736
01:17:50,571 --> 01:17:52,220
what do I do?
I don't know where he is.

1737
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,470
Like dunkin stay in his apartment in New
York.

1738
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,550
How he is.
He's like,

1739
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:57,050
man,
I was supposed to be back a month ago.

1740
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:58,670
What do I do?
like,

1741
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,310
I don't know man.
I'm just going to accept it.

1742
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:02,803
Hopefully he's not dead.
So is dunkin going to stay in New York 

1743
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:06,560
when he gets back?
I believe so.

1744
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:09,740
I believe dunkin likes it there.
He's been dOing a lot of standup there.

1745
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,753
He's been traveling,
doing all this crashing show from may 

1746
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:17,720
until auGust in New York.
So I got a,

1747
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:20,780
I got to be in brooklyn the first month 
because it's a um,

1748
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,170
it's a writing month.
We get officers out there and then three

1749
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:27,350
months we'll be shooting all around the 
city and wherever.

1750
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:29,420
So if anybody has an aparTment for me in
New York,

1751
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:30,470
june,
july and august,

1752
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,110
I'll fucking take it.
Can I announce a couple of dates?

1753
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,080
Yeah.
Alright.

1754
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,220
Do you like old school radio guy coming 
up?

1755
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:38,930
Does that make sense?
And plugs.

1756
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:39,764
We're going to be fed

1757
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,420
philadelphia,
helium,

1758
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,060
april 27 slash 29.
That's a good club,

1759
01:18:46,061 --> 01:18:47,260
right?
The best clubs ever.

1760
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:48,183
Twenty seven through 29.
And then here's one I think you liked 

1761
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:51,850
just as much,
if not more.

1762
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,880
Denver comedy works May 4th through the 
sixth.

1763
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,490
My number one,
not number one.

1764
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:58,840
It's the right up there with the ice 
house.

1765
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,560
Have fucking happy.
Am I right now?

1766
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:01,270
That's good.
Good.

1767
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,103
You got two good fucking bangers and our
other fellow and then mohegan sun in 

1768
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:05,790
Connecticut.
May 11,

1769
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:06,990
2013.
Do that.

1770
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,940
Don't turn your thumb down either.
Just don't do it.

1771
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:15,380
Connecticut gets so mad.
Brooklyn the bauhaus.

1772
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,040
June third.
You ever play the bell house in brooklyn

1773
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:18,581
spot?
Yeah,

1774
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:20,020
it's supposed to be great.
That's it.

1775
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,490
I haven't played club.
Ever should get there.

1776
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,280
I used to do.
There was a comedy club in brooklyn back

1777
01:19:27,281 --> 01:19:30,100
in the day.
There was a comedy club in bensonhurst.

1778
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,840
Oh,
right.

1779
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,550
Yeah.
What the fuck was that?

1780
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:37,240
Was it it next to a gym?
Like a big meathead?

1781
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,033
probably.
I think it was the member of the one in 

1782
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,413
the one that dice started out pips.
Mr. Pip sip system or I think it was 

1783
01:19:46,811 --> 01:19:49,000
just pips.
Mr pepper is the drink,

1784
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:49,834
right?
Yeah.

1785
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,970
Pips in brooklyn.
Yeah,

1786
01:19:51,971 --> 01:19:55,780
that's joey cola told me he was on stage
there and a guy showed him his gun,

1787
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,373
said he's onstage.
That guy's heckling him and he's like a 

1788
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:01,540
mob guy and these guys will just look 
at.

1789
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:02,530
I'm going,
fuck you.

1790
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,600
Fuck you.
And joe.

1791
01:20:04,601 --> 01:20:05,081
He's like,
hey,

1792
01:20:05,081 --> 01:20:08,040
what's your fucking problem?
And the guy pulls his jag inside and

1793
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,500
shows him a gun like god,
jesus and the club wouldn't do nothing.

1794
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:13,950
Just had to tell,
tell your jokes.

1795
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:18,980
And I had a damn.
That's a.

1796
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,890
That's a distracted second half you're 
set.

1797
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,230
You're not thinking about much else 
except that gun.

1798
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,090
You're getting through it.
So you're doing.

1799
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,530
You ain't getting any laughs.
Alright.

1800
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,423
Okay.
I just started to fuck your life up and 

1801
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:34,470
he might kill you.
Yeah,

1802
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:36,990
there's a lot of those guys.
did you ever read murder machine?

1803
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,200
Now?
Murder machine is about roy de mayo,

1804
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:44,520
who is a famous hitman murdeRer,
capo.

1805
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:47,950
Fucking character in the mob.
People were like mob store.

1806
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:48,853
Probably mad at me right now,
but it's a book that joey diaz gave me 

1807
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,100
and it's.
You can't put it down.

1808
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,630
You start reading it.
You can't put it down.

1809
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:55,763
It's all about how horrific this fucking
guy was and how many people he killed 

1810
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,230
his man come with something like that,
but he worked.

1811
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,123
He was a mob guy himself.
He had a bar that was downstairs and 

1812
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:07,080
above the bar,
that apartment,

1813
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:07,914
and they killed people in the apartment 
and caught him up in the tub and they 

1814
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:13,320
killed hundreds of people.
No shit just killed.

1815
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:16,350
He killed people for fun telling people 
left and right.

1816
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:18,040
It started out.
It was killing people like,

1817
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,913
you know,
mob things and someone owed money or 

1818
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:23,550
something and they just was killing 
people just on the weekends.

1819
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,673
Wind didn't trust people.
Start killing them and I don't like the 

1820
01:21:26,851 --> 01:21:29,070
way you're looking at me dead.
Just killing people.

1821
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,470
It's a crazy book,
man.

1822
01:21:30,471 --> 01:21:35,010
So can you go to jail?
I don't.

1823
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,990
I don't remember.
That's a good question.

1824
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:42,180
See what happened with roy de mayo.
Murder machine was the name of the book.

1825
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,750
Joey d is like dog.
You gotta fucking read this.

1826
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:47,490
You've got to read this.
I couldn't put it down.

1827
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,653
I couldn't put it down.
Unfucking believable and it's just some 

1828
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,280
fucking complete psychopath and a group 
of other sites.

1829
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,010
Why is it we can't stop.
Like,

1830
01:21:58,011 --> 01:21:58,710
you know,
karen killed.

1831
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:02,800
Gareth has that podcast.
I'm a my favorite murder.

1832
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:03,843
Is that all about murders?
Every week they talk about a different 

1833
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,760
gruesome murder to class.
Yeah,

1834
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,540
it's really good.
But um,

1835
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:15,970
but what is it about us that like I love
the iceman cometh and uh,

1836
01:22:15,971 --> 01:22:16,804
there was,
there was another one that was about a 

1837
01:22:17,531 --> 01:22:19,410
serial killer.
I mean just earlier talking about the,

1838
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:20,244
the angel of death guy.
Like what is it about us that is so 

1839
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:25,900
interested in people that take human 
life?

1840
01:22:25,901 --> 01:22:30,070
Do you think that it's like a part of us
that it's an unexpressed thing?

1841
01:22:30,071 --> 01:22:32,410
Like if we were cavemen we would kill,

1842
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,570
you know,
I think there's a lot of energy attached

1843
01:22:36,571 --> 01:22:38,100
to it,
meaning negative,

1844
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,660
negative energy,
but still energy,

1845
01:22:39,661 --> 01:22:40,494
like you can't look away.
It's the same reason why you watch like 

1846
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:43,674
car accidents or you watch youtube 
videos about someone doing a stunt that 

1847
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:49,020
goes wrong and they accidentally drive 
off a bridge.

1848
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:50,760
Like,
I don't know if you've ever seen the one

1849
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,930
with the guy in the wing suit,
tries to buzz a bridge and he calculates

1850
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:56,960
it wrongly,
slams into the bridge.

1851
01:22:56,990 --> 01:23:00,390
It sounds like a fucking car accident.
He slammed in the bridge going like,

1852
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:01,224
who knows,
150 miles an hour or something crazy 

1853
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,200
like that.
It's horrific.

1854
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,070
Just fall straight down in the water.
Yeah,

1855
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:10,090
I mean he hit the bridge so hard.
He might've just.

1856
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,740
I mean he,
if he didn't have a suit on,

1857
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:15,570
he might have just exploded into like a 
ball of jello or something,

1858
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,413
you know?
But because he had the suit on and kind 

1859
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:20,140
of kept all the blood and body parts in 
place.

1860
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,580
Yeah,
he hit it so hard.

1861
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:23,730
Dude.
I mean it literally sounds like a,

1862
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:27,490
like a car accident because he's 
slamming into the metal of the bridge at

1863
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,000
100 fucking whatever miles an hour with 
nothing on but a helmet.

1864
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:33,820
Do you regret having seen that?
Like does that in your mind?

1865
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,290
Well,
no.

1866
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,330
No.
It's not pleasant,

1867
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,490
but there's something about those 
things.

1868
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,620
It's like there's an energy attached.
Oh jesus.

1869
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:43,483
Oh jesus.
Oh jesus,

1870
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,000
boom.
Fuck right.

1871
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:47,623
There's a great.
I'm in a twitter page called hold mY 

1872
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:52,384
beer and it's all like,
hold my beer while I lied this firework 

1873
01:23:56,321 --> 01:23:57,154
off in my mouth.
Hold my beer while I go And pet this 

1874
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:00,634
tiger.
one fucking her rafik disaster after 

1875
01:24:06,401 --> 01:24:07,840
another.
We just like,

1876
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:10,870
what the fuck man.
I like this one.

1877
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:14,503
Okay.

1878
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:18,630
Yeah.
Well it's this one.

1879
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:21,090
Hold my beer while become a rocket 
turret.

1880
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:24,370
Watch this guy.
He's got a firebomb and it's facebook.

1881
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:29,570
Just fucking hooks hooks his face.
This one is ridiculous.

1882
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:32,910
why am I being white crowd that glass 
musical chair.

1883
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:51,070
It looked like a girl to girl.
Took that dude.

1884
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:53,170
That's fucking great.
WaTch this one.

1885
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,420
Hold our beers while we go skateboarding
down this hill.

1886
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:56,343
This one's fucking horrific.
These guys come down the hill and they 

1887
01:24:58,601 --> 01:25:00,500
just have no way to stop your 
skateboard.

1888
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,890
It's a little thin lane.
You can't even.

1889
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:05,620
You can't even cut back.
watch this dude.

1890
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:11,700
Ooh son.
Not good.

1891
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:12,653
Okay.
I've seen it's like america's funniest 

1892
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:16,440
home videos for grownups.
Exactly,

1893
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,620
but I never got into watching the faces 
of death and shit like that.

1894
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:21,210
Although a lot of those I think were 
fake,

1895
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,400
but there are obviously beheadings I've 
never.

1896
01:25:23,401 --> 01:25:25,750
Have you ever watched a beheading?
You have good.

1897
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,590
Yeah.
Don't regret it.

1898
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,220
Yeah,
but why do people watch them again?

1899
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:31,500
It's because there's energy attached to 
it.

1900
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,480
You know there's a consequence of what's
happening.

1901
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,220
you're watching something you're gonna 
have.

1902
01:25:35,221 --> 01:25:37,350
The consequence doesn't really manifest 
itself.

1903
01:25:37,351 --> 01:25:40,500
Like watching people do balancing acts 
on the top of skyscrapers.

1904
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:41,683
Even if you know they survived,
which is how you got the footage in the 

1905
01:25:43,111 --> 01:25:45,180
first place,
it still freaks you the fuck out.

1906
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:48,780
I can't stop.
You know Kelly Slater,

1907
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:51,300
the surfer,
he sends me those.

1908
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,283
He knows like they freaked me out.
So we send each other back and forth 

1909
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:58,740
fucked up videos about dudes doing 
balancing acts on the side of buildings.

1910
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,290
Like what the.
I can't watch those man.

1911
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,850
My hands start sweating.
My asshole starts squeezing.

1912
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:07,190
I just go,
what the fuck are you doing?

1913
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:10,430
There's a lot of that shit and Russia 
dudes hanging off the sides of buildings

1914
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,560
by their fingertips.
You ever see those?

1915
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,230
Yes.
Do they do like hanging with one arM?

1916
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:16,064
You know how hard it is to fucking hang 
from one arm and to hang from one arm 

1917
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:21,560
when you're 700 feet in the air or 
something crazy.

1918
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,590
It just makes you think how little human
life means in Russia.

1919
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:26,990
Those dudes look,
kill at the drop of a hat.

1920
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,740
Alex,
alex honnold.

1921
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,740
He's been on the podcast before.
He's insane.

1922
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,160
He is so crazy.
He free Solos,

1923
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,860
which mean look,
my hands are full.

1924
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:39,560
My hands.
Yeah.

1925
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,950
So remind.
Oh yeah.

1926
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,500
Sweat to go back to alex.
So,

1927
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:46,730
because these guys are fucking crazy.

1928
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:47,863
Alex is like the number one free solo 
guy in the world or at least one of the 

1929
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:52,784
number one guys.
And what that means is he doesn't use 

1930
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:55,500
ropes.
Yeah.

1931
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,290
So he'll map out a,
um,

1932
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:00,560
a climb.
Sometimes we'll map it out and sometimes

1933
01:27:00,561 --> 01:27:03,920
it was just a path that you can take and
sometimes we'll map it out with ropes.

1934
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:05,330
But he's like,
you know,

1935
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:07,060
honestly,
even while I'm doing it with the ropes,

1936
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,420
I don't really need the ropes.
I'm like,

1937
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:12,230
what the fuck?
And so he does this and he freaks people

1938
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:15,610
out and he freaks out even experienced 
climbers.

1939
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:16,444
And there waS a documentary they did 
about them where this guy was like an 

1940
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:20,110
experienced climber.
It was like,

1941
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,920
it's not.
IF he's going to die,

1942
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,740
it's a matter of when he's going to die.
Right.

1943
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:28,010
But that's probably a helIcopter taking 
his picture or a drone.

1944
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,830
Right.
Fucking a man.

1945
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,710
If it's a helicopter would probably be 
too dangerous.

1946
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:35,960
The breeze from the helicopter would be 
super dangerous.

1947
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:37,300
I used to do shit like that.
I got,

1948
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,050
I got a picture of me hanging out with 
my friends.

1949
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:42,680
Fourth floor balcony badlands.
Nice to do that shit all the time.

1950
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,720
Yeah,
to my book.

1951
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:46,910
I got the picture of my book.
Jesus christ.

1952
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:47,451
Dude.
Yeah.

1953
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:50,270
I used to like to freak people out.
Oh my god.

1954
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,990
This alex honnold dude.
Sometimes he.

1955
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:56,690
He climbed things that aren't even 
straight up and down.

1956
01:27:56,930 --> 01:28:01,390
They bend backwards to a certain degree 
facing forward hoses.

1957
01:28:01,391 --> 01:28:02,230
This girl,
well,

1958
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:04,220
I've seen this.
She's hot as fuck.

1959
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:06,150
The whole video where they went up to 
him,

1960
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:07,463
this was,
this girl grabbed the guy's hand and he 

1961
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:11,030
held her over the edge.
Yeah.

1962
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:15,530
That girl is so crazy to trust that guy.
He can fuck her forever by the way.

1963
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,770
Forever.
Forever for like he owns it.

1964
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:27,050
That's so insane.
Freaks me the fuck out,

1965
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,120
but I don't stop.
I can't watch this.

1966
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,100
Stop what you're doing.
Freaking me out.

1967
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,200
I can't do this and still talk because I
can't.

1968
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:34,063
I can't talk and then do that.
I watched those things have a massive 

1969
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:38,660
physical effect on me.
Yeah,

1970
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,340
but alex.
Anyway,

1971
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:41,390
he,
he climbed stuff.

1972
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:44,990
It's facing forward so he's literally 
hanging straight up and down,

1973
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,033
wedging his hands into these cracks and 
like moving along and then he's got to 

1974
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:51,470
reach in for the powder and powder.
the thing.

1975
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,633
He was on the podcast,
he told me the story about how he was 

1976
01:28:54,261 --> 01:28:55,094
climbing once and he realized when he 
was halfway up this mountain and he 

1977
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:59,960
forgot his powder.
Oh.

1978
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:02,243
So he gets to these fucking people.
They're also climate and they're on 

1979
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,730
ropes and he goes,
hey man,

1980
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:08,040
can I borrow your powder?
And the guy's like,

1981
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:10,710
okay,
I think god gives him his powder bag and

1982
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:12,870
then when it got to the top,
he left the powder bag for the dude.

1983
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,880
It's insane.
He's insane.

1984
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:19,290
He's climbing.
He does.

1985
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:20,370
He is like,
what did I forget?

1986
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:21,690
I got my fingers.
That's all I need.

1987
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:22,400
Ah,
look.

1988
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,570
powder shit.
Well,

1989
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:24,710
those,
what do you call that thing?

1990
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,573
the,
that the guy died under the bridge at 

1991
01:29:26,481 --> 01:29:30,360
bat bat suit or a wingsuit wing suit.
It was a whole thing on,

1992
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:33,980
I don't know if it's hbo sports or 60 
minutes about the people that do that.

1993
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:35,810
A friend andy does it.
Oh really?

1994
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,250
Our friend and he's a world record 
holder,

1995
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,640
but the mortality rate is extremely 
high.

1996
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:41,870
He took it.
Are

1997
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:43,023
he?
He took two guys off the mountain last 

1998
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:44,920
year that died.
Doing it?

1999
01:29:45,070 --> 01:29:45,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

2000
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,050
He,
he's a maniac.

2001
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,510
But he's the.
He's got the longest distance ever.

2002
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,400
Someone's ever done one of those fucking
wingsuit?

2003
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,660
Yeah.
How far do you go?

2004
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,730
Something saying like 30 miles or 
something.

2005
01:29:56,620 --> 01:30:00,190
Yeah.
And they glide along the sides of cliffs

2006
01:30:00,191 --> 01:30:01,300
and shit.
Eighteen miles.

2007
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:06,330
Eighteen miles miles dab with no break.
All you can do is catch you catch a gust

2008
01:30:07,751 --> 01:30:09,170
of wind and your fucking toe.

2009
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2010
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,680
Or you're toast.
Go full screen on this bitch.

2011
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,790
This is so insane.
Look a fucking high.

2012
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,900
He jumped out of a helicopter.
I don't think that's a helicopter.

2013
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,660
I think that's a plane now,
isn't it?

2014
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:22,950
Yeah.
That's a plane.

2015
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,280
I think a helicopter be a harder thing 
to jump out of.

2016
01:30:26,281 --> 01:30:29,820
I'm just guessing because the way the 
wind is pressing downward.

2017
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,160
Does that make sense?
I don't know.

2018
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,810
I don't know shit about what would 
happen.

2019
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:35,010
Yeah,
there is a plane.

2020
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:38,580
Yeah,
so he gets up there and he does this all

2021
01:30:38,581 --> 01:30:39,414
the fucking time.
He'll like send me pictures because he 

2022
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:41,364
knows it freaks me out.
He'll send me pictures of him jumping 

2023
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:44,484
off some fucking mountain in Guatemala 
or something like look at that is so 

2024
01:30:47,611 --> 01:30:51,210
insane.
Going 163 miles an hour.

2025
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:52,044
Like Why?
What is this is how we're going to be 

2026
01:30:57,451 --> 01:30:58,284
dropping our troops into the next step.
Not too many people would be willing to 

2027
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:02,371
do it.
Well,

2028
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:03,210
not,
not willing,

2029
01:31:03,211 --> 01:31:05,730
rAther capable.
I think you would.

2030
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,833
You got to be a special person to be 
able to pull off a fucking flying 

2031
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:10,630
squirrel suit.
Yeah.

2032
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:11,580
I mean

2033
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,040
he ever jumped out of a plane.
No,

2034
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,960
you don't want to do it.
Fuck that.

2035
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,640
I'd do it.
You should do it.

2036
01:31:17,641 --> 01:31:18,474
Then just don't tease me.
Jumping off the mountain is way crazier 

2037
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:22,194
when they're just skimming it and 
jumping out of a plane where you know 

2038
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:27,300
this guy's parachute.
That's cool.

2039
01:31:27,301 --> 01:31:29,190
But that's not like these guys on 60 
minutes.

2040
01:31:29,191 --> 01:31:30,340
They were.
He's the same guy.

2041
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,490
The sides of cliffs.
He does it too.

2042
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:33,660
He does that same to.
Oh,

2043
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:35,040
he does that too.
He does the whole thing.

2044
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,330
This is just a world record.

2045
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,120
This is the furthest distance ever 
fucking call that man.

2046
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:45,150
Hey tina,
my friend cam up cam when a skydive,

2047
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,970
but yeah,
yeah,

2048
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,660
yeah.
Fuck that.

2049
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:52,083
Now

2050
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:54,320
I don't like free falling.
I know.

2051
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,840
I don't like that feeling like I've been
on bungee cords and it's,

2052
01:31:56,860 --> 01:32:00,010
it's pure fucking torture.
You and your drops out on

2053
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,660
you.
That doesn't feel good,

2054
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,330
but I think it equalizes when you jump 
out of a plane,

2055
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:05,000
doesn't it?

2056
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,920
I don't know,
but I know that brian,

2057
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:07,783
brian redman,
whose dad used to work with this lady 

2058
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:12,410
and the girls always like,
hey,

2059
01:32:12,411 --> 01:32:14,690
why don't you go skydiving with us?
He's like,

2060
01:32:14,691 --> 01:32:16,010
yeah,
will one day,

2061
01:32:16,011 --> 01:32:18,170
one day.
Then one day he gets there on monday.

2062
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:20,810
No,
we're so and so.

2063
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,280
You didn't hear her.
She died.

2064
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:29,330
It's really chute.
Didn't open up backup chute.

2065
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,180
Didn't open up.
Here comes the ground.

2066
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:34,790
100 60 miles an hour.
Boom.

2067
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:39,110
He does bounce off that fucking ground 
and become jello.

2068
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:40,281
Jello,
Oregon.

2069
01:32:40,281 --> 01:32:43,560
Six crush to the bottom of your body.
Everything is destroyed.

2070
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,890
Yeah.
Might go through a barn or something.

2071
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:50,090
Slammed through a barn,
slamming into some fence posts.

2072
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,670
Hundred 60 miles an hour.
Just tears you and a half.

2073
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,470
Yeah.
Fuck man.

2074
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,110
Fuck yeah.

2075
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,320
I don't even like roller coasters 
anymore.

2076
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:01,154
we did.
I did a roller coaster two years ago in 

2077
01:33:03,021 --> 01:33:06,510
Florida at busch gardens if you want to.
If you're into rollercoasters,

2078
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,970
disney and universal,
they've got a couple that are good,

2079
01:33:10,971 --> 01:33:13,730
but busch gardens is like the red neck 
paradise.

2080
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:16,790
It's like,
it's like the guY's the fucking carnies.

2081
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:20,870
They've run these ancient rollercoasters
that are insane,

2082
01:33:20,871 --> 01:33:21,704
like the twisting corkscrews,
but there's like 10 of them and they're 

2083
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:26,090
fucking.
You go.

2084
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,390
You cAn ride every one of them three 
times in a day.

2085
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:31,820
It's fuck fucker atlanta.
Drive down to tampa,

2086
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:35,730
go to busch gardens.
But I went and it fucked up my neck too.

2087
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:36,673
To this day I have a bad neck from 
spinning around on those fucking 

2088
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:42,650
rollercoaster.
I already had a bad neck,

2089
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,140
but it tweaked it in a way that I've 
never.

2090
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,220
I've never come back from.

2091
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:47,171
Well,
the inertia,

2092
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:48,004
when you run those things you've ever 
done the what is the one that was a 

2093
01:33:50,051 --> 01:33:54,040
crazy one at six flags like the x 
something or another.

2094
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:57,070
While you go upside down and back and 
forth,

2095
01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:58,870
you're in,
you're in a harness,

2096
01:33:59,040 --> 01:33:59,873
you,
they strap you into this thing and you 

2097
01:34:01,211 --> 01:34:02,044
flip up and down.
You spin around and you're going on a 

2098
01:34:04,121 --> 01:34:04,881
rollercoaster.
Yeah,

2099
01:34:04,881 --> 01:34:07,000
so you're on a rollercoaster and you're 
spinning around.

2100
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,960
You get off that thing.
Like what the fuck is wrong with me?

2101
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:12,160
Yeah.
Like I'm getting nauseous.

2102
01:34:12,161 --> 01:34:12,994
Just thinking about.
I know my son is friends are into that 

2103
01:34:15,581 --> 01:34:17,760
shit when you're 16.
It's fucking perfect.

2104
01:34:17,761 --> 01:34:19,150
Yeah.
They want to make something happen.

2105
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,460
When you're 16,
you want something to take place.

2106
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,323
Yeah.
Like come on,

2107
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:24,410
let's go.
Let's go.

2108
01:34:24,411 --> 01:34:25,750
I want something to happen here.

2109
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,673
That's why I had sex so much when I was 
young is I just wanted to do something 

2110
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:35,650
that was a goal that you could achieve 
and then you could go back and tell your

2111
01:34:35,681 --> 01:34:37,540
friends about it.
Yet a story.

2112
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,313
I didn't care about the girls.
I hate say that I really didn't care 

2113
01:34:41,531 --> 01:34:43,390
about the girls.
I didn't have a girlfriend till I was in

2114
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:45,630
college.
I didn't even think about having

2115
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:48,450
friend.
When you first started having sex,

2116
01:34:48,451 --> 01:34:49,284
did you not want to do anything else?
All I wanted to do was masturbate and 

2117
01:34:52,711 --> 01:34:54,300
have sex.
I used to have a joke about it.

2118
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:55,920
Well,
my dad was like,

2119
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,130
what happened at baseball?
Oh,

2120
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:00,380
I found this new thing.
I like it.

2121
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:01,403
I'll get better the fuck outta here.
Hitting that stupid ball with a stick 

2122
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,590
ball.
What do you just.

2123
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,433
No chicks out there.
There's no girls that come to baseball 

2124
01:35:09,261 --> 01:35:11,300
games.
when I got off school,

2125
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,990
I'll sit and you're dressed in fucking 
dea.

2126
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,350
Jordache jeans and you're flaring 
airbag.

2127
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:17,720
What happened to baseball?
I found pussy.

2128
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,380
Yeah,
like the first,

2129
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:22,880
like slow,
steady,

2130
01:35:22,881 --> 01:35:24,770
like all the time,
sex that I got,

2131
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:29,771
I think it was either 16 or 17 and I had
a girlfriend who was a year younger than

2132
01:35:29,931 --> 01:35:30,764
me.
And you know why I was nervous about it 

2133
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,593
because when I turned 18,
people were telling me that I could get 

2134
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:37,100
arrested.
It's right because she was oNly 17,

2135
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,980
like you get arrested for statutory rape
and I was like,

2136
01:35:39,981 --> 01:35:41,960
what?
But a blank.

2137
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:45,170
But we dated before when it was okay,
but it doesn't matter.

2138
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,690
You have to stop.
Oh my god.

2139
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,730
I was terrified.
I thought I was going to go to jail.

2140
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,730
That's crazy.
That means you're 18.

2141
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:54,860
You have to only bang someone your age 
or older.

2142
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:56,690
Who.
I'll take it a step further.

2143
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,583
I've been talking about this in my act 
of like how I still jerk off to like 

2144
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:03,980
I'll think about girls from high school 
that I went to high school with and I'll

2145
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:05,420
jerk off to them.
I don't know.

2146
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,343
And then uh,
I got the yearbook and I looked up this 

2147
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:08,720
one girl,
jill,

2148
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:09,554
I won't say her last name and I was 
jerking off to her picture and then I 

2149
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:12,260
was like,
I was like,

2150
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:13,094
I think this is wrong,
but then I thought no because I used to 

2151
01:36:14,961 --> 01:36:19,580
jerk off to her before I was an adult,
so maybe I'm grandfathered in.

2152
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:21,193
I would say you are.

2153
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:22,430
I'm grandfathered in,
right?

2154
01:36:22,431 --> 01:36:23,264
Yeah.
If you start jerking off to one of your 

2155
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:26,480
kids,
17 year old friends.

2156
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:28,370
Yeah.
That's fucked up.

2157
01:36:28,371 --> 01:36:30,110
That's fucked.
That's a felony.

2158
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:32,480
No.
if you get pictures,

2159
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:33,493
if I look at a yearbook to like say I 
find it 2016 yearbook right from 

2160
01:36:38,481 --> 01:36:39,770
hollywood high school.
Okay.

2161
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,993
I find it at a flea market and I take it
home and I'm jerking off to girls that 

2162
01:36:43,491 --> 01:36:44,780
are 14,
15,

2163
01:36:44,781 --> 01:36:46,850
16 years old.
Is that not kiddie porn?

2164
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:47,803
No,
because there's no pornography and so 

2165
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:52,590
100 percent up to your imagination.
It's like if you seen a girl scene,

2166
01:36:52,591 --> 01:36:54,250
those varsity field hockey skirts.
No,

2167
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:55,283
I'm not into that.
But if you see a girl walking down the 

2168
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:58,184
street and you know,
you think she's on the edge like 17 or 

2169
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:02,030
18 and you don't know,
like,

2170
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:04,550
I don't even know.
I'm just going to say she's 19 and she's

2171
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:05,853
just,
you know,

2172
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:06,973
I'm just guessing and then you go beat 
off and are you any worse than if you 

2173
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:11,630
knew she was 17?

2174
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:12,703
Have you see her?
She's got a big fat ass and big juicy 

2175
01:37:15,171 --> 01:37:17,480
young titties and she's walking on the 
street like,

2176
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:19,160
oh my god,
I can't believe she's only 17.

2177
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:21,410
And then you go home and jerk off tour.
That's different,

2178
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,440
right?
Knowing knowing makes it creepy.

2179
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:26,110
yes.
Yes.

2180
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,270
Because you're jerking off to the age as
well as the image.

2181
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,910
If you're going up to the image,
you're fine.

2182
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:32,803
Yeah.
If you just see the girl walking down 

2183
01:37:33,471 --> 01:37:34,690
the street and she's like,
god,

2184
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,040
what do you think?
Illegal.

2185
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,190
It's like if you're gonna shoot a moose,
they have to be 52 inches in Alaska,

2186
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,430
which means,
which means the,

2187
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:44,264
uh,
the antlers have to have either a 

2188
01:37:45,681 --> 01:37:48,890
certain amount of brow tines or they'd 
have to be a certain distance apart from

2189
01:37:48,891 --> 01:37:49,724
each other.
They want the hunters only to hunt 

2190
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:52,933
mature animals that have already bred,
like just the idea of the conservation 

2191
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:56,340
aspect

2192
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,320
of it to keep the breeding population 
strong.

2193
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:00,900
Yeah.
So when you're ready to shoot an animal,

2194
01:38:00,901 --> 01:38:03,660
especially if using a rifle,
you have to be really sure.

2195
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:04,883
You have to like,
boy,

2196
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:06,390
I don't know.
I don't know he's coming,

2197
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:07,350
he's coming.
I don't know if he's,

2198
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,360
I don't know if he's legal,
but let's back up,

2199
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:10,980
let's back up.
And it happens all the time.

2200
01:38:10,981 --> 01:38:13,400
Or guys like fuck.
And then you know,

2201
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:14,263
it turns out it was leak or if it wasn't
legal that's a good thing to shoot it 

2202
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:20,280
because even though it's an arbitrary 
thing like decide or weird thing,

2203
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:21,114
like trying to decipher whether or not 
something is 50 plus inches from 200 

2204
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:27,150
yards away.
Like you're just kind of guessing.

2205
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,050
And a lot of ways,
yeah,

2206
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,153
they,
it's a really important because if you 

2207
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:33,230
fuck up and you shoot one that's young,
you're in deep shit it.

2208
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:33,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

2209
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:37,440
So you could just make a mistake and 
shoot a bull that's 45 inches.

2210
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:39,510
You're fucked.
He'll lose your license.

2211
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:39,821
Yeah,
yeah,

2212
01:38:39,821 --> 01:38:41,430
yeah.
You're going to have to pay a fine.

2213
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:42,293
You lose the animal.
You won't be able to take the animal 

2214
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:45,000
home.
And they check.

2215
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:45,960
Yeah,
they'll check.

2216
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,823
Yeah.
And all the meat that you got from that 

2217
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:51,270
animal you fucked unless you poach it.
Unless you decided to not tell anybody.

2218
01:38:51,271 --> 01:38:53,280
Which people do.
Do they especially do.

2219
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:54,114
If they realize they fucked up,
they fucked up on purpose or they got 

2220
01:38:56,461 --> 01:38:57,294
delusion with themselves and they shoot 
something that's smaller than it should 

2221
01:38:59,221 --> 01:39:00,054
be.
Like you're in big trouble though when 

2222
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:02,340
you do,
depending on the state.

2223
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:03,563
Every state has different regulations.
But that's kinda the same thing with 

2224
01:39:05,611 --> 01:39:08,550
this 18 year old girl because like some 
girls are 19.

2225
01:39:08,551 --> 01:39:11,670
They lived with their 15,
like some girls are in their 2015.

2226
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:13,680
Well,
it is weird when you see girls with porn

2227
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:14,514
with pigtails and they pretend to be 
just coming home from school and some 

2228
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:20,460
guy pulls their pants,
his son and fucks him and comes in their

2229
01:39:20,461 --> 01:39:22,190
mouth and it's like,
what am I watching?

2230
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:24,550
And they act like children act like 
kids.

2231
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:26,220
They act like young girls.
Yeah.

2232
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,570
Yeah.
It's like,

2233
01:39:28,571 --> 01:39:29,020
but that's,

2234
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:31,780
you know,
that's a woman playing a role.

2235
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,130
You know,
she's over 18,

2236
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:37,080
she's a fully committed adult,
but there's a,

2237
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:40,170
there's some girls that are like 14 and 
he was like,

2238
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:43,210
they're 18 that especially when you're 
across the street,

2239
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:44,373
you're not close to them.
You don't like catch subtle cues that 

2240
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:48,190
you're dealing with a child.
Right.

2241
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:49,330
You know,
there's like weird,

2242
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:53,650
like a lot of girls in particular are 
full grown by the time you're like 15,

2243
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,170
you know,
like there,

2244
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,380
that's as tall as they're ever going to 
get.

2245
01:39:56,770 --> 01:39:58,480
Whereas boys keep growing a little bit 
longer.

2246
01:39:58,630 --> 01:39:59,920
I grew in college.
Yeah.

2247
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:02,980
They say girls after they have their 
periods stop growing or that makes sense

2248
01:40:02,981 --> 01:40:03,970
and stopping pleasant.

2249
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:09,360
You know,
if I,

2250
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:11,360
if I'm at the beach,
if I,

2251
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,393
if I'm at the beach and I see a girl and
she's with a girl that I can tell is 

2252
01:40:17,951 --> 01:40:21,250
under 18,
but she doesn't look under 18,

2253
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,833
I won't look at her just out of fear 
that she must be under 18 because you 

2254
01:40:26,651 --> 01:40:30,010
don't want to put her in this bank bank.
She's got to stay out of the spank bank.

2255
01:40:30,011 --> 01:40:30,844
She's.
Yeah,

2256
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,820
I put aI.
put a yellow tag on her.

2257
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,510
Very ethical.
Well,

2258
01:40:34,511 --> 01:40:36,820
it's hard because once you have kids 
that are teenagers,

2259
01:40:36,821 --> 01:40:38,460
it's fucking scary.
It's like,

2260
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:41,780
you know,
my fucking son is 16 years old,

2261
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:44,920
but let's admit that that is a gray 
area.

2262
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,590
Yeah.
who knows?

2263
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:49,970
That could be the older sister,
you know,

2264
01:40:49,971 --> 01:40:51,620
it could be one girl and her older 
sister,

2265
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:53,980
like she might be 19 friend,
might

2266
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,350
be 17.
She could be a 51 point buck.

2267
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:58,810
She could be bull bull,
bull moose,

2268
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,000
51 inch block.
Jesus christ.

2269
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:02,383
You've got to kill that thing.
what's the youngest girl you ever had 

2270
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:09,541
sex with when you were a teenager?
I was,

2271
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:11,823
I think I was 16.
My girlfriend was 15 and she was the 

2272
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:17,080
first girl I ever had sex with,
so that was the youngest.

2273
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,090
Who's 15 years.
She's 15 now.

2274
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:20,510
16.
Yeah.

2275
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:25,510
I came instantly.
As soon as it touched it,

2276
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,120
I was like,
what?

2277
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:31,270
What happened?
The first time I ever came was blow job.

2278
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:36,400
I never beat off and there were serious.
For real.

2279
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,533
That must have been the greatest blue.
Jay paul ties dab and chasing that 

2280
01:41:39,701 --> 01:41:41,010
dragon.
Yes.

2281
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,120
My ears rang.
I'll never forget.

2282
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:44,103
It was on the porch,
the front porch of my girlfriend's 

2283
01:41:46,661 --> 01:41:48,280
house.
Her mom was upstairs,

2284
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:49,600
so she blew me on the porch.

2285
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:50,540
No shit.
Yeah.

2286
01:41:50,590 --> 01:41:54,570
Had she blown a guy before,
I'm sure seems like it.

2287
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:57,850
If she's on the front porch.
She has been around a couple of cox.

2288
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:58,743
She actually had sex with one of my 
friends before she had sex with me and 

2289
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:03,940
my friend was like a,
a real weird.

2290
01:42:03,941 --> 01:42:07,810
He was like a city guy where I was like,
we were living in the suburbs.

2291
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:08,843
My friend was my friend actually before 
I knew her from back when I lived in 

2292
01:42:11,561 --> 01:42:14,080
Jamaica plain and he was always a really
weird guy.

2293
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:15,173
He was like one of those guys that would
wear those black reebok's with the 

2294
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:18,244
velcro.
Yeah,

2295
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:20,080
like the,
like the aerobic shoes.

2296
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:25,180
And then he had cavalry cheese,
like you dressed well back then that was

2297
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,970
dressing well and I always felt like 
super insecure.

2298
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:28,511
I'm like,
wow.

2299
01:42:28,511 --> 01:42:29,344
She dated that guy.
That guy was like street smart and you 

2300
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:33,190
know,
like he kinda like,

2301
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,160
he was like,
he was hip smokes cigarettes.

2302
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:37,113
He knew how to dance.
He could dance like music speakers are 

2303
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:41,650
speakers.
Who was just a weird guy.

2304
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,500
He was a really weird guy.
Was he a guido?

2305
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:45,760
No,
no,

2306
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,040
I don't think he was italian.
He was,

2307
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:52,000
I don't remember what he was,
some non distinct european lineage.

2308
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:55,240
But uh,
she banked him and then that didn't work

2309
01:42:55,241 --> 01:42:56,074
out.
She actually made out with him once at 

2310
01:42:57,281 --> 01:42:59,420
my house the first time.
But was like,

2311
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,273
when your kids,
we played spin the bottle I'll make out 

2312
01:43:01,781 --> 01:43:03,100
with each other and we didn't know what 
the fuck we're doing.

2313
01:43:03,101 --> 01:43:05,080
We couldn't even believe that we make,
we can make out with each other.

2314
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:05,590
Like,
wow,

2315
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,330
this is amazing,
you know.

2316
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:09,730
So wait.
So you get the blow job.

2317
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:11,920
You've never had a hand job,
you've never jerked off?

2318
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:14,290
Nope.
Why did you never took off?

2319
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:16,240
Um,
I didn't.

2320
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:20,920
I didn't know that it would be like that
worth doing.

2321
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,170
Like I didn't jerk off until after I was
having sex,

2322
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:24,730
believe it or not.
And this was when you were,

2323
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:25,900
what?
15 at this point?

2324
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:26,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

2325
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:27,761
Wow.
Yeah,

2326
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:28,400
maybe.
Yeah.

2327
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,630
15 or 16 maybe.
Maybe 16 because I had sex.

2328
01:43:31,631 --> 01:43:32,860
I,
I'm pretty sure I had sex.

2329
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,090
I think it was like,
right when I was 16.

2330
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:39,280
She was 15.
That's when we actually had sex.

2331
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:43,630
She mIght have blown me before I was 16.
But anyway,

2332
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:45,970
um,
my ears rang.

2333
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:51,010
I couldn't believe it.
I was like,

2334
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,250
what the fuck?

2335
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:53,163
Like I came so hard.
It was this reward system that like the 

2336
01:43:57,921 --> 01:43:58,754
universe and biology,
it's set up this crazy reward system to 

2337
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:02,774
try to get you to breed.
It's really interesting because when 

2338
01:44:04,191 --> 01:44:07,490
you're at your least responsible,
your least developed.

2339
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:08,324
Your brain is mush.
Brain was useless when I was 15 years 

2340
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:12,254
old.
I had a monkey's brain and it was this 

2341
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,570
just ridiculous,
silly brain.

2342
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:18,823
No way did I have any like sense of 
responsibility or how to take care of a 

2343
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:24,710
kid.
Like impossible.

2344
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:25,593
Yeah.
I didn't even have my own shit even 

2345
01:44:26,211 --> 01:44:29,720
remotely together and my body wanted me 
to have a baby.

2346
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,470
You wanted to trick me.
I was horny all the time,

2347
01:44:33,471 --> 01:44:35,740
like ruthlessly horny,
you know,

2348
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:36,643
and after that girl gave me a blow job,
then we want to be in boyfriend and 

2349
01:44:40,761 --> 01:44:44,510
girlfriend having sex all the time.
We just fucked constantly.

2350
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:46,240
Kind of just.
Oh,

2351
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,670
maybe twice.
that's crazy.

2352
01:44:49,671 --> 01:44:50,504
Yeah,
definitely not smart because back then 

2353
01:44:51,621 --> 01:44:52,454
you're not dribbling out of load.
You are fucking rock it deep into the 

2354
01:44:57,921 --> 01:45:01,130
cervix and rethread you're trying to 
pull out.

2355
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,153
So guests,
I guess somehow or another pulled it 

2356
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:04,310
off.
Wow.

2357
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:07,190
You got lucky or she had a couple of 
abortions.

2358
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:09,170
She didn't tell him about the possible a
new,

2359
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:11,810
a lot of girls in an abortion,
so not even with me,

2360
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:14,840
which is like girls in town,
one girl at three of them.

2361
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:15,861
And we're like,
jesus,

2362
01:45:15,861 --> 01:45:16,970
honey,
get on the fucking pill.

2363
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,110
Yeah,
get on the pill.

2364
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:19,070
Right?
Um,

2365
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:23,570
but my girlfriend in high school got on 
the pill and then it was just like,

2366
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,070
just rockets right in there.

2367
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:30,380
It'S ridiculous because when you're a 
young kid,

2368
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:32,750
like the idea of the pill is a strange 
thing,

2369
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:35,360
right?
You're circumventing biology.

2370
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:39,260
You're saying that's not good for the 
nature's I know what you're fucking plan

2371
01:45:39,261 --> 01:45:40,790
was.
I know what you're trying to do,

2372
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:41,773
but guess what?
No one's ready for this when you were 

2373
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:44,000
16.
Okay,

2374
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:47,060
so we're going to give someone the pill.
But for girls it's a terrible deal.

2375
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:48,063
They got to take these fucking wacky 
hormones going to take estrogen when 

2376
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:52,850
you're 16.
Like what does that do to them?

2377
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,050
yeah.
You know,

2378
01:45:54,051 --> 01:45:55,400
they say it does.
One of the big things,

2379
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,773
it fucks up a woman's ability to 
differentiate whether or not cheese 

2380
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:02,540
compatible with a guy.
Oh really?

2381
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:03,583
Yeah.
They've done these things where they 

2382
01:46:04,701 --> 01:46:08,830
take women and they'll have them smell a
guy's clothes,

2383
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:09,683
clothes that a guy wore and they can 
decide and they can just pick from the 

2384
01:46:13,761 --> 01:46:16,790
smell whether or not they would be 
compatible with that guy.

2385
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:17,823
It turns out they're really good at 
picking whether or not they're 

2386
01:46:19,221 --> 01:46:21,570
genetically compatible with that guy.
Wow.

2387
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:22,573
But that gets totally monkey wrench into
the gears as soon as they get on the 

2388
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:27,344
pill,
when they get on the pill that their 

2389
01:46:28,311 --> 01:46:30,470
sense of smell doesn't work anymore like
that.

2390
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:32,503
That sort of weird primate instinct.
The animal instincts of being able to 

2391
01:46:37,911 --> 01:46:39,970
smell whether or not the guys compatible
with you.

2392
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,600
It doesn't work anymore.
Dude,

2393
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:46,601
I knows rape this girl at the gym.
Yesterday I was on the treadmill and she

2394
01:46:47,181 --> 01:46:49,890
was next to me and she had long black 
hair

2395
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:54,300
and she tussled it up and put it into a 
bun and whatever conditioner she had was

2396
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:56,190
floating over.
Then she started running.

2397
01:46:56,191 --> 01:46:59,010
She was this persian girl in the armpits
were fucking emitting.

2398
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,280
I was running with my head at a 45 
degree angle.

2399
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:05,310
Inhaling through my nose exhaling to my 
mouth.

2400
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,580
Just knows raping her.
Did you have a plan?

2401
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,260
If she said,
why are you leaning towards me?

2402
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:15,360
tell her about the rollercoaster.
You can Tell her about.

2403
01:47:15,410 --> 01:47:16,340
Listen,
I got.

2404
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,720
I gotta to tell you.
I will tell you the story.

2405
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:18,541
It's Crazy.
Long story.

2406
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:20,490
Do you have time?
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

2407
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,910
Can we just stand a little closer to 
this position?

2408
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:23,843
gardens.
Tampa fucked my neck up on a 

2409
01:47:25,141 --> 01:47:27,410
rollercoaster.
It's the craziest roller coaster.

2410
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:29,520
She forgets her sweatshirt.
I'm down to the men's room.

2411
01:47:29,730 --> 01:47:30,563
Just fucking.

2412
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,470
I mean she had.
She was hot.

2413
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:38,543
She was running.
I usually run with the Iran at a six 

2414
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:43,980
point two miles an hour,
which is pretty slow,

2415
01:47:43,981 --> 01:47:44,814
But it keeps my heart rate at 1:35,
which I need to do for like 40 minutes 

2416
01:47:48,841 --> 01:47:49,674
straight.
She was running at fucking eight point 

2417
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:56,310
five miles an hour,
which is pretty goddamn fast because she

2418
01:47:56,311 --> 01:47:59,820
was small and a nice,
nice tan,

2419
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:03,130
little persian legs,
but the smell of fucking unibrow,

2420
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:06,920
she was a little gland.
She was a gland.

2421
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:08,513
It was coming out.
It was coming up from the undercarriage 

2422
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,690
everywhere and I'm just running and I'm 
trying to.

2423
01:48:12,691 --> 01:48:13,524
It was like a.
It was like a powdery flowery thing 

2424
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:21,440
mixed with a pit stink.
Those are the girls,

2425
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:22,313
like a really sexy persian girls are,
I guess you would say iranian if you 

2426
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:27,750
weren't being politically correct.
Hilarious.

2427
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:29,130
They call them till persian.
Yeah.

2428
01:48:29,131 --> 01:48:32,530
That's what a purchase since like 1930.
Right.

2429
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:34,650
Mike,
let's just call ourselves africans.

2430
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:36,950
Yeah.
Because we all have to go like,

2431
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:38,280
oh,
you're persian.

2432
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:39,140
Oh,
elaborate.

2433
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:39,983
Introduced my friend.
He's from the ottoman empire and I'm a 

2434
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,903
hittite.

2435
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:51,950
That's hilarious.
Yeah,

2436
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:52,793
but the,
uh,

2437
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:58,310
I Was sitting on a bench one day.
this couple walk past me.

2438
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,730
Curl was pretty hot.
Little nose rape.

2439
01:49:02,731 --> 01:49:06,720
Take it in nice and small.
I got a very strong,

2440
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:08,370
um,
uh,

2441
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:11,100
what do you call your nose?
Sense of smell?

2442
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,253
A factory loan factory.
I got a very strong olfactory sense and 

2443
01:49:15,781 --> 01:49:18,180
so I was like really enjoying it.
And then,

2444
01:49:18,181 --> 01:49:19,014
uh,
about 10 minutes later the guy walks 

2445
01:49:21,271 --> 01:49:25,140
past me and he smells good too.
That was the smell.

2446
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,730
Oh no,
no,

2447
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:28,080
no.
What was he wearing?

2448
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:29,680
Like petroleum or Something?
It was,

2449
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,790
it was spicy.
That's one of those things.

2450
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:35,970
It was so off that a girl could pull off
to like both hippie species,

2451
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,833
male and female.
Both genders can wear but truly merits 

2452
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:41,730
mark marin.
Whereas virtually I don't believe you.

2453
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,130
Yes he does.
I might have to find that out.

2454
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:46,220
Grateful dead music and purely oil.
Really?

2455
01:49:46,221 --> 01:49:47,520
Where's petula?
Oh,

2456
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,363
dairy.

2457
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:49,340
Really?
You sure?

2458
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:52,310
He just fucking with me.
You know,

2459
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:53,363
I,
I'm,

2460
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:56,640
I'm almost 100 percent sure.
Not all the time to start.

2461
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:58,450
He has in the past.
Warren pachulia.

2462
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:01,780
Do you think some girl fucked him at one
point in his life because he was wearing

2463
01:50:01,781 --> 01:50:02,720
petrolia and he's like,
look,

2464
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:05,050
just roll the dice.
If a really cancels out,

2465
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:05,943
I don't want that kind of pressure.
Like if a girl doesn't fuck me because 

2466
01:50:07,631 --> 01:50:08,464
I'm wearing,
but truly I don't want that kind of 

2467
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:09,970
pressure.
That's true.

2468
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:10,900
It's a lot of pressure.
Yeah.

2469
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:12,850
Yeah.
That's my argument for the fanny pack.

2470
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:15,243
Well guys like,
oh jeez,

2471
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:16,420
if you murdered,
I'm like,

2472
01:50:16,421 --> 01:50:18,980
listen to me,
if I wasn't married I'd be more inclined

2473
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:21,490
to wear it because if a girl won't fuck 
you because you wear a fanny pack,

2474
01:50:21,491 --> 01:50:23,290
you don't want her to fuck you.
It's too much work.

2475
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:24,243
Yeah.

2476
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:26,940
I love seeing single guys who have that 
attitude.

2477
01:50:26,941 --> 01:50:28,950
That is the attitude.
You kind of have that attitude.

2478
01:50:28,951 --> 01:50:31,260
Otherwise you get distracted and that's 
what I learned from beating off.

2479
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:34,110
It's one the things I learned from 
beating off when I first started beating

2480
01:50:34,111 --> 01:50:35,520
off,
which I told you after I had sex.

2481
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:36,330
Yeah.
I realized like,

2482
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:38,070
oh,
this is what's going on.

2483
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:41,070
I got my little addict,
like I came and I was like,

2484
01:50:41,071 --> 01:50:44,070
I don't really need to go out with her.
I think this is not necessary.

2485
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,490
Like before I was like,
I got to see here what am I going to see

2486
01:50:46,491 --> 01:50:47,324
her when I'm going to use here.
But I wOuld beat off and it would give 

2487
01:50:48,841 --> 01:50:51,960
me a few hourS of relief and where I 
could think clearly.

2488
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:52,880
Right,
Okay.

2489
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:56,010
Just have a bit way back iN the day 
about jerk off first.

2490
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:56,933
Then think about it that it should be 
like an ethic that men approached their 

2491
01:50:58,921 --> 01:50:59,754
entire life with some fucking terrible 
mistakes you make when you're under the 

2492
01:51:02,731 --> 01:51:03,900
influence of your own dick.

2493
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:06,900
Because your own dick will talk in all 
sorts of stupid situations.

2494
01:51:06,901 --> 01:51:07,734
But if you jerk off first,
you know you're not goIng to go into a 

2495
01:51:09,931 --> 01:51:13,050
barn at 4:00 in the morning with some 
crazy girls doing coke.

2496
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,050
Like I gotta go like,
yeah,

2497
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,770
if you jerked off.
And she's like,

2498
01:51:16,771 --> 01:51:18,600
come on,
you're fucking scared.

2499
01:51:18,601 --> 01:51:20,310
Like I'm scared.
I'm scared.

2500
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,560
Got to go see a your horn.
And you're like,

2501
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:25,140
alright,
let's do this.

2502
01:51:25,170 --> 01:51:26,690
Right?
You want me to suck your dick?

2503
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:28,200
Yeah,
you want me to suck your dick?

2504
01:51:28,201 --> 01:51:29,034
You got to do some coke with a kid just 
doing coke and they can't even get it 

2505
01:51:37,261 --> 01:51:38,094
up.
You Faggot.

2506
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,470
How can we can't get it up?
Faggot doing fucking coke.

2507
01:51:41,471 --> 01:51:43,770
I'm supposed to suck your dick.
He not even getting it up.

2508
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:45,360
Sorry.

2509
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:48,940
And it's 4:30 in the morning.
You should never be up at 4:30.

2510
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:51,210
Still trying to get laid.
That's what happens.

2511
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:54,720
You start doing the coke and all sudden 
you went to a bar that close,

2512
01:51:54,721 --> 01:51:56,610
you went to another book,
you're fucking thrown down.

2513
01:51:56,611 --> 01:51:57,444
KaShi.
You haven't even gotten laid yet and 

2514
01:51:59,101 --> 01:52:02,070
you're still che.
Then she wants to go to denny's and then

2515
01:52:02,071 --> 01:52:02,904
you got to go hang out at her house and 
she wants to do more coke and then also 

2516
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,400
at 4:30 in the morning,
it's not.

2517
01:52:08,401 --> 01:52:10,700
You don't even give a fuck anymore.
It's like

2518
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:16,450
it's got to happen in the first two 
hours and he knows a horrible one for me

2519
01:52:16,451 --> 01:52:17,284
in the summer when this would happen and
I had jobs so it'd be like 4:30 in the 

2520
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:24,280
morning and I'd be still trying to get 
laid and then I had to be up at seven to

2521
01:52:24,281 --> 01:52:29,281
go to my construction job.
a oh cb carrying wood all day exhausted.

2522
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:33,220
He didn't shower.
So you get that oil,

2523
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:35,560
he fucking stank and your under 
carriage.

2524
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,900
Your ball sack is sticking to your 
thigh.

2525
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:40,840
I'd come home and fall asleep before he 
even got my clothes off.

2526
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:45,560
I just hit the fucking bed sideways.
Out cold.

2527
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:46,453
Yeah.
Wake up in the morning and do it all 

2528
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:47,100
over

2529
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,180
again.
Oh Yeah.

2530
01:52:48,630 --> 01:52:49,463
I used to park cars at a country club 
and we would go out all we would get 

2531
01:52:53,161 --> 01:52:55,200
paid in cash tips.
We'd make a good one,

2532
01:52:55,201 --> 01:52:57,540
hundred and 50 bucks in cash.
I was 16,

2533
01:52:57,550 --> 01:52:59,880
17 years old.
we go out to the bars,

2534
01:52:59,881 --> 01:53:02,550
do shots all night,
get laid.

2535
01:53:02,551 --> 01:53:03,384
We go skinny dipping.
There was a pool that we'd break into 

2536
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:06,803
and it was a bunch of teenagers that 
would all skinny dip on any given night 

2537
01:53:09,901 --> 01:53:10,734
in the summer if it was hot out,
you go to that pool that was naked 

2538
01:53:13,351 --> 01:53:14,184
teenagers swimming and you could get 
laid pretty easily and then we would go 

2539
01:53:19,591 --> 01:53:20,424
and then we'd have to be there at 6:00 
in the morning to park cars because the 

2540
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,553
golfers and we get there and we had this
little wooden shack and we'd run up and 

2541
01:53:27,331 --> 01:53:29,490
down the stairs,
parking these cars because it was down a

2542
01:53:29,491 --> 01:53:31,230
hill,
so you'd have to drive it down the hill,

2543
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,620
run up,
drive it down the hill for hours,

2544
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:39,240
and then finally they'd all be out on 
the golf course kickback in that shack

2545
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,280
and just fucking lay on the wooden floor
and sleep for a couple of hours.

2546
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:46,780
Working when you're tired and your kid 
is so important,

2547
01:53:47,410 --> 01:53:50,320
so important to realize how to power 
through things.

2548
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,690
You don't power through shit when you're
a little kid.

2549
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:56,440
Maybe they make you take naps.
Quite the opposite of power and through.

2550
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,640
Yeah,
like are you tired?

2551
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:58,270
Look,
greg,

2552
01:53:58,270 --> 01:53:59,103
just take a nap.
You need to take in that we don't want 

2553
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:01,810
to do.
Go take a nap.

2554
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:03,340
Take a nap at school.
Remember that?

2555
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,233
These have nap time in school.
Then you'd take a nap when you got home 

2556
01:54:06,361 --> 01:54:09,140
and then all of a sudden no more naps.
All of a sudden you have to work again.

2557
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,930
It happens over the course of like a 
couple of years.

2558
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,760
Yeah.
Now I got to get up at six.

2559
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:16,750
Those summer jobs.
Those were the big eyeopener for me.

2560
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:17,733
That's when I knew.
That's when I fucking really knew I 

2561
01:54:20,321 --> 01:54:21,154
could never work instruction.
That's when I really knew like summer 

2562
01:54:24,701 --> 01:54:27,320
jobs when I was in high school and right
out of high school,

2563
01:54:27,321 --> 01:54:28,270
so like,
fuck

2564
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:30,770
yeah,
because I had just true.

2565
01:54:30,771 --> 01:54:33,260
You should bust,
you should make your kid bust his ass in

2566
01:54:33,261 --> 01:54:34,094
high school so he can realize he needs 
an education or you need to pick 

2567
01:54:36,721 --> 01:54:37,610
something to do young.
I

2568
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,040
got to pick Something.
Do different [inaudible].

2569
01:54:39,041 --> 01:54:41,830
I had other jobs that weren't as hard.
Like I worked at newport creamery.

2570
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:44,020
I was a dishwasher and then I was a 
cook.

2571
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:45,760
Wasn't that hard?
I mean,

2572
01:54:45,761 --> 01:54:47,410
it sucked.
It wasn't fun.

2573
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,273
Be cooked burgers,
make ice cream sundaes and shit and 

2574
01:54:51,221 --> 01:54:52,054
milkshakes.
And before that it was the guy wash the 

2575
01:54:53,681 --> 01:54:54,910
dishes.
I moved up,

2576
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:56,173
gone up bro.
I didn't want to take the waitress job 

2577
01:54:57,851 --> 01:55:00,800
though too much responsibility to be a 
waiter or waitress.

2578
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:07,300
Lipstick a perfectly good good.
And those tights.

2579
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:08,523
But um,
that was my only job that I'd had until 

2580
01:55:11,291 --> 01:55:13,010
I started doing construction jobs.
Yeah.

2581
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:16,630
My dad's an architect.
My stepdad got me gigs,

2582
01:55:16,631 --> 01:55:19,090
he's an architect and he got me gigs in 
the summer,

2583
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:20,740
like,
like real jobs.

2584
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:23,200
I was like,
holy shit.

2585
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:24,283
Like when you're a labor,
you're a 16 year old labor on a 

2586
01:55:26,981 --> 01:55:29,620
construction site.
fuck your life.

2587
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:33,730
Fuck my life every day.
Fuck your life.

2588
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,950
And plus I didn't know how to hydrate 
back down.

2589
01:55:35,951 --> 01:55:39,880
I never drank any water and drank a coke
in the morning and then all day,

2590
01:55:39,881 --> 01:55:40,930
no drinking,
whatnot.

2591
01:55:40,931 --> 01:55:43,210
No awareness present already.
Sunblock.

2592
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:44,120
Oh,
it was

2593
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,520
bronze,
like copper.

2594
01:55:46,570 --> 01:55:50,680
and I would just fucking carry shit all 
day and be so tired.

2595
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,570
But I remember thinking,
okay,

2596
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:54,670
you got,
there's gotta be a fucking plan.

2597
01:55:54,671 --> 01:55:55,504
we got to make a plan to avoid this.
Can't be doing this because you guys 

2598
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:00,850
that would do this.
My friend leroy got me a job once.

2599
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:02,800
This was a really important turning 
point.

2600
01:56:02,801 --> 01:56:03,634
He and his friend hank,
they would renovate buildings in 

2601
01:56:05,501 --> 01:56:08,110
dorchester.
It's real shit neighborhood real bad and

2602
01:56:08,111 --> 01:56:08,944
these buildings were like basically like
completely wrecked and they would redo 

2603
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:13,030
them.
And this one guy,

2604
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:14,853
he was like semi homeless.
He lived in this place while they were 

2605
01:56:19,181 --> 01:56:21,370
redoing it and he had a mountain dew 
jug,

2606
01:56:21,371 --> 01:56:22,204
like a two liter thing of mountain dew 
that he filled with malt liquor and he 

2607
01:56:24,771 --> 01:56:28,180
would just drink this mountain dew jug 
of malt liquor all day.

2608
01:56:28,181 --> 01:56:29,014
He'd be just blasted all day on the 
construction site and we're walking 

2609
01:56:32,261 --> 01:56:32,530
around.

2610
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:36,220
IT's like exposed beams.
There's a to the left and the right,

2611
01:56:36,221 --> 01:56:38,490
there's fiberglass,
you know,

2612
01:56:38,491 --> 01:56:41,170
that's an overlap.
Thus you could step through and you just

2613
01:56:41,171 --> 01:56:42,004
drop right through the floor below.
and this fucking guy walked like a 

2614
01:56:44,321 --> 01:56:47,290
ballerina drunk as fuck.
His name is jeff.

2615
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:49,640
Never forget.
Jeff walked around this,

2616
01:56:49,641 --> 01:56:54,010
this construction site and just barely 
not stepping on nails,

2617
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:57,580
just barely and drunk and hammered and 
everybody knew it.

2618
01:56:57,581 --> 01:57:01,540
Shakes his hands would shake,
just hold the mountain leader,

2619
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:02,433
the two liter mountain dew thing and you
fucking shake and while he's trying to 

2620
01:57:05,561 --> 01:57:09,370
drink a full on alkie and you were like,
that's my future.

2621
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:10,863
I didn't think it was my future,
but I knew it could be a future if you 

2622
01:57:12,521 --> 01:57:14,470
did what that guy's like,
whoa.

2623
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,393
Yep,
yep.

2624
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:16,960
Yeah.
You realize that.

2625
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:18,570
Uh,
w with.

2626
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:20,590
I had a job,
I was actually in college,

2627
01:57:20,591 --> 01:57:23,110
but one summer I went out to the 
hamptons,

2628
01:57:23,470 --> 01:57:26,020
me and my brother and this other guy 
from northern Ireland,

2629
01:57:26,021 --> 01:57:26,854
sean,
he was fucking drunk and we shared a 

2630
01:57:29,230 --> 01:57:32,710
studio apartment fully written.
First two guYs in,

2631
01:57:32,711 --> 01:57:34,780
got the foldout caps.
THird guy was on the floor.

2632
01:57:34,781 --> 01:57:38,380
So you'd try to fucking get home before 
the other guys with fleas.

2633
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:41,710
Fleas all summer.
Did you guys have a dog?

2634
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:42,783
Did someone have a dog now?
Somebody must have had a dog before the 

2635
01:57:44,831 --> 01:57:45,664
place was infested and I would go down.
My job was I would ride my bike and I 

2636
01:57:49,811 --> 01:57:50,644
remember it was six miles.
I would ride my bike to the beach and I 

2637
01:57:53,951 --> 01:57:54,784
had to get there at like 7:00 in the 
morning and it was an outdoor beach 

2638
01:57:59,801 --> 01:58:01,060
club.
It was a bar.

2639
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:01,923
Basically.
Brooklyn would unload and show up at 

2640
01:58:04,031 --> 01:58:04,864
this place.
It was called summers on dune road in 

2641
01:58:07,331 --> 01:58:12,331
the hamptons and they had to outdoor 
bars that each had six bartenders in it.

2642
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:13,720
Power,
you know,

2643
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:14,553
power pouring,
like fucking tom cruise and cocktail 

2644
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:20,200
chicks in bikinis,
bartending and then inside two more bars

2645
01:58:20,201 --> 01:58:21,034
with six more bartenders,
speakers the size of a fucking 

2646
01:58:24,131 --> 01:58:26,230
volkswagen.
So I'd get there at 7:00 AM.

2647
01:58:26,231 --> 01:58:27,064
My job was get the fucking dolly and get
10 speakers outside that were all the 

2648
01:58:31,661 --> 01:58:33,730
size of volkswagens,
plug them in.

2649
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:35,403
First thing was do that.
And then I put on 2001 space odyssey at 

2650
01:58:38,561 --> 01:58:39,394
nine to clear off all the drunks that 
were on the sand from the night before 

2651
01:58:42,581 --> 01:58:43,414
because you had to pay to get in.
So theY wanted to clear the fucking 

2652
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:46,384
beach.
All these people get up screen with 

2653
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:49,850
their hands on.
Um,

2654
01:58:50,850 --> 01:58:55,040
a shot

2655
01:58:58,470 --> 01:59:01,440
and then I would carry up me and the 
other guy would carry up racks,

2656
01:59:01,441 --> 01:59:04,350
you know,
booze racks with like fucking 15 bottles

2657
01:59:04,351 --> 01:59:05,490
in them,
carry them up,

2658
01:59:05,491 --> 01:59:06,324
stock each bar for six bartenders,
start bringing up fucking garbage cans 

2659
01:59:10,531 --> 01:59:13,320
full of ice,
filling up the trust with ice,

2660
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:15,060
bring it up.
Cases of beer,

2661
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:17,400
stuff in the beers into the ice.
I mean.

2662
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:18,353
And then.
And then all of a sudden people started 

2663
01:59:19,111 --> 01:59:24,111
trickling in around 9:30,
10 cracked the fucking bad disco music,

2664
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,230
power pouring in the bikinis.
Guido's showing up.

2665
01:59:28,530 --> 01:59:31,350
Chicks that would,
I would have to clean out the bathroom,

2666
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:33,780
the women's bathroom at least three 
times a day.

2667
01:59:33,781 --> 01:59:34,614
It'd be clogged up with tampons.
These nasty fucking guido chicks from 

2668
01:59:38,581 --> 01:59:41,280
brooklyn,
which stick their bloody tampons.

2669
01:59:41,281 --> 01:59:42,114
And there would be.
And then the men would throw fucking 

2670
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:48,980
broken bottles into the urinals.
I'd have to clean those out all day long

2671
01:59:48,990 --> 01:59:49,320
up and down.

2672
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:53,940
And the ice was down a flight of stairs 
with a broken down shitty ice machine.

2673
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:55,013
And all day long I weighed a hundred and
25 pounds up and down the stairs with 

2674
01:59:59,101 --> 01:59:59,934
buckets of ice on my shoulder cases.
A coRe is light and just fry and it was 

2675
02:00:03,991 --> 02:00:06,450
all outside.
So I was getting fried from the sun.

2676
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:08,610
And I'm thinking,
this is great.

2677
02:00:08,611 --> 02:00:13,020
I'm going to get laid.
I didn't get a fucking conversation with

2678
02:00:13,021 --> 02:00:13,854
one of those chicks all summer long.
All I did was drink miller lites and 

2679
02:00:18,241 --> 02:00:20,190
then a few times a day I'd run down to 
the beach,

2680
02:00:20,490 --> 02:00:22,830
dive in the ocean and fucking cool off 
come back.

2681
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,200
But I made bank.
These bartenders,

2682
02:00:25,201 --> 02:00:27,460
they knew I was taking care of them and 
they were day.

2683
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:32,470
We're making thousand dollars a day.
Really?

2684
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:33,413
Yeah.
They were making crazy money and they 

2685
02:00:35,401 --> 02:00:38,960
would all tip me as fucking 15 
Bartenders.

2686
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:42,420
All tip and who is three of us,
me and two other guys.

2687
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:44,243
And then I get on my bike at around 6:00
and I pedaled back to our little flea 

2688
02:00:48,211 --> 02:00:50,970
infested studio apartment and then take 
a shower.

2689
02:00:50,971 --> 02:00:51,804
And then we go to this place to kill a 
murphy's up the street and we'd dance 

2690
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:59,880
fucking dance to like,
you know,

2691
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:05,570
rob base and dj eez rock the art of 
noise and we and I would break dance and

2692
02:01:08,761 --> 02:01:13,560
we'd stay there till two in the morning 
and I'd come home and get some more flea

2693
02:01:13,561 --> 02:01:14,394
bites,
get up and do it all over again every 

2694
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:16,110
day.

2695
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:19,210
I had fleas in my carpet when I was in 
high school because of that same dog got

2696
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:22,720
hit by a car and we didn't have fleas 
anymore after just died.

2697
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:25,690
I put carpet shit down,
vacuumed it.

2698
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:26,793
But one time I brought this chick home 
when I was still living with my parents 

2699
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:32,020
and she's one of the chicks that I ever 
brought on.

2700
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:32,854
But like I think I was 18 at the time 
was still living at home and she was 18 

2701
02:01:37,301 --> 02:01:40,190
to.
And she knew how to fuck.

2702
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:41,323
Like not just allie,
she was the first girl I ever had sex 

2703
02:01:43,221 --> 02:01:44,054
with that put her foot on the wall.
It was like pushing off with their foot 

2704
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:49,700
on the wall.
Like I lived on the second floor.

2705
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:50,700
And you know,
uh,

2706
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:54,310
some bedrooms have an angled wall where 
my bed was,

2707
02:01:54,311 --> 02:01:56,420
it was propped up against the side of 
the wall,

2708
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:58,790
so it was like a flat wall up to like,
you know,

2709
02:01:58,791 --> 02:01:59,624
three feet high.
And then above that there was like this 

2710
02:02:01,281 --> 02:02:04,340
angle and this chick put our foot on the
top of that.

2711
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:07,730
And she was like,
fucking up and pushed back.

2712
02:02:07,731 --> 02:02:09,430
Yeah.
I remember thinking jesus,

2713
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:13,790
like respect.
Like she wasn't just taking it.

2714
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:16,410
She was,
she was given it back from the bottom.

2715
02:02:16,411 --> 02:02:17,244
And I was like,
I've never dated a girl did that before 

2716
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:20,263
because you know,
when you're 16 you're dating 16 year 

2717
02:02:22,881 --> 02:02:25,210
olds,
17 year by the time you're 18 girls been

2718
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:27,170
fucking for awhile.
They know what they're doing,

2719
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:28,183
you know?
Yeah.

2720
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,000
I remember he had been around that age.
I remember this girl,

2721
02:02:32,001 --> 02:02:33,260
linda,
I won't say her last name,

2722
02:02:33,261 --> 02:02:35,030
she reached down.
I'm fucking her.

2723
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:38,060
and she reaches down and starts rubbing 
her clit.

2724
02:02:38,061 --> 02:02:40,520
And I was like,
whoa.

2725
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:41,421
I was like,
wow,

2726
02:02:41,421 --> 02:02:43,240
this is about your orgasm,
isn't it?

2727
02:02:43,241 --> 02:02:45,560
Huh?
That's a girls ready to party.

2728
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:48,350
Because when you.
There's a certain age where it goes from

2729
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:51,110
becoming about your orgasm to being 
about hers,

2730
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:52,540
you know,
and that's,

2731
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:53,800
that's a big,
big,

2732
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:57,770
big primordial change.
There's also like this thing where girls

2733
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:59,780
doing that in front of you,
there's something really hot

2734
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:00,643
about it.
Like she wants you to fuck her while 

2735
02:03:02,151 --> 02:03:02,984
she's masturbating and looking at you 
and like letting you know that she's 

2736
02:03:05,121 --> 02:03:07,940
masturbating like whoa,
it's full surrender.

2737
02:03:07,941 --> 02:03:08,774
Yeah.
But this girl that pushed off against 

2738
02:03:09,771 --> 02:03:10,670
the wall,
she got flea bites,

2739
02:03:10,671 --> 02:03:14,150
overlooked my fucking my carpet and 
fucking fleas on it.

2740
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:15,890
And she was like,
what the fuck?

2741
02:03:15,891 --> 02:03:16,401
I was like,
ah.

2742
02:03:16,401 --> 02:03:21,050
I gotta do something about it.
some mattamy.

2743
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:25,700
I used to have like little bites all 
over my fucking ankles all the time.

2744
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:27,710
Yeah,
just thing you had,

2745
02:03:27,711 --> 02:03:31,640
if you had a dog back then you know,
like we take some powder,

2746
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:32,613
a spray or sprinkle some fucking powder 
and then vacuum is supposed to kill the 

2747
02:03:36,561 --> 02:03:40,290
fleas never killed most of them.
There's a few gangster fleas.

2748
02:03:40,291 --> 02:03:42,410
It would survive.
And your dog would always get them.

2749
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,760
They go outside,
they're just get fleas.

2750
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:47,500
Did he have you had those bugs right now
because it was so rainy this winter.

2751
02:03:47,501 --> 02:03:50,740
We got these.
They look like giant mosquitoes,

2752
02:03:50,741 --> 02:03:53,020
but they're like five times as big as 
mosquitoes.

2753
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:54,370
Mosquito eaters.
Yeah.

2754
02:03:54,371 --> 02:03:56,170
They're all over the mosquito ears,
right?

2755
02:03:56,620 --> 02:03:58,930
They always seem to sting you.
They don't seem to sting,

2756
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:00,610
but you open your front door,
man.

2757
02:04:00,611 --> 02:04:04,690
They come right in there every night I 
got to kill a couple of in the house.

2758
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:08,720
Do they really eat mosquitoes?
I don't know how you would get days.

2759
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:09,603
They're so slow.
I don't know how they would get to a 

2760
02:04:11,561 --> 02:04:12,394
mosquito.
Maybe the mosquito would be stupid and 

2761
02:04:13,571 --> 02:04:14,300
be like,
dad,

2762
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:14,910
like,
yeah,

2763
02:04:14,910 --> 02:04:17,200
I can give you a hug.
Yeah.

2764
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:19,630
I mean I heard them called that,
but I was thinking the same thing,

2765
02:04:19,631 --> 02:04:21,340
like how the fuck are.
They don't.

2766
02:04:21,341 --> 02:04:24,670
Crane flies are actually physically 
incapable of killing mosquitoes.

2767
02:04:24,671 --> 02:04:25,930
The main sustenance

2768
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,033
of crane flies is flower nectar.
The nickname mosquito eaters probably 

2769
02:04:30,321 --> 02:04:34,400
comes to the fact that some larval cream
fleas feed on mosquito larva,

2770
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,560
but it also is only occasionally

2771
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:40,770
and those things.
I mean it's the size of Your hand.

2772
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,900
They're big.
Yeah,

2773
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,510
it's a weird bug.
YeAh,

2774
02:04:45,511 --> 02:04:48,450
there's a lot of uh,
and mosquitoes too.

2775
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:51,090
There's a ton of mosquitoes right now.
We got a wet winter.

2776
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:52,463
It's fascinating.
You know what's funny though is people 

2777
02:04:53,881 --> 02:04:56,430
are so glass half empty.
I've been here so many people go,

2778
02:04:56,431 --> 02:04:57,264
wow,
there's going to be a real problem in 

2779
02:04:58,161 --> 02:05:00,990
the summer when fire season starts.
Got all this bitch.

2780
02:05:00,991 --> 02:05:04,380
Can you just enjoy the green hills?
The hills are green.

2781
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:05,760
It looks beautiful.
Yeah.

2782
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:06,833
I hope it keeps.
I hope this place become seattle and 

2783
02:05:08,581 --> 02:05:11,250
people move.
I hope it rains constantly and they move

2784
02:05:11,251 --> 02:05:14,220
la to like the desert move into like 
where area 51 is.

2785
02:05:14,221 --> 02:05:15,360
This is where we're going to film from 
now on.

2786
02:05:15,361 --> 02:05:17,700
Guys start filming out there because it 
never rains.

2787
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:18,653
Yeah.
I just read this book about the making 

2788
02:05:22,110 --> 02:05:25,710
of the Panama canal and they talk about,
you know,

2789
02:05:25,711 --> 02:05:27,840
when the french,
the french first tried to do it.

2790
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:31,740
They went in in the late 19th century 
and they,

2791
02:05:31,741 --> 02:05:32,574
you know,
you gotta think technology in the late 

2792
02:05:33,811 --> 02:05:37,140
19th century.
They didn't have fucking electricity.

2793
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,033
They didn't have shit.
They had giant machines and they were 

2794
02:05:40,711 --> 02:05:41,544
trying to bulldoze a canal through the 
most dense tropical jungle that you 

2795
02:05:49,081 --> 02:05:50,640
could get through and,
and they,

2796
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:54,840
and they lost something like 20 percent 
of the people that went down there,

2797
02:05:55,020 --> 02:06:00,020
died of malaria and yellow fever,
which are both mosquito borne diseases.

2798
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:03,780
So they go down there and they fight it 
out for like 10 years.

2799
02:06:03,781 --> 02:06:05,970
They keep sending people down to keep 
dying,

2800
02:06:05,971 --> 02:06:08,810
keep sending people down to keep dying.
And uh,

2801
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:09,683
and even if you don't die,
you're working 14 hour days in jungle 

2802
02:06:13,681 --> 02:06:17,310
heat with a fucking,
with a little spade.

2803
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:19,193
And then all of a sudden they'd get a 
monster rain and everything you'd 

2804
02:06:22,321 --> 02:06:23,870
excavated,
there'd be a mudslide.

2805
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:26,910
It would fill it right up again.
They'd start all over.

2806
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:28,223
There were snakes,
there was fucking mountain lions and 

2807
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:33,300
they just finally gave up.
Finally,

2808
02:06:33,301 --> 02:06:35,520
France just went,
fuck this.

2809
02:06:35,521 --> 02:06:38,250
They had bled hundreds of millions of 
dollars.

2810
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:40,480
And so and so.
Then the us stepped in.

2811
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:41,970
I go,
we can do it.

2812
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:43,763
So we came in and some guy had realized 
that mosquitoes were the problem like 

2813
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:50,520
that.
Nobody knew that.

2814
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:51,354
Malaria and yellow fever.
We're mosquito where mosquito born for 

2815
02:06:53,761 --> 02:06:56,160
whatever reason,
they just thought it was fucking popping

2816
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:56,994
out out of the dirt.
They thought it was like fumes coming 

2817
02:06:58,711 --> 02:07:00,300
out of the dirt and this guy's like,
no,

2818
02:07:00,301 --> 02:07:01,134
it's fucking mosquitoes.
So he came in with a team of like 10 

2819
02:07:05,671 --> 02:07:09,600
people and they just started in 
educating people about how to get rid of

2820
02:07:09,601 --> 02:07:10,434
mosquitoes,
which is basically get rid of standing 

2821
02:07:12,361 --> 02:07:15,060
water.
And so instead of having mud roads,

2822
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:16,103
they poured concrete and uh,
and instead of having open barrels that 

2823
02:07:19,531 --> 02:07:24,531
people will collect rainwater and they 
would put sheets over them and a fucking

2824
02:07:25,111 --> 02:07:26,190
god.
That's it.

2825
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:31,370
That's all he had to do to stop.
No deaths from malaria and yellow fever.

2826
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:33,960
After the first couple of years they 
started construction.

2827
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:35,010
That's incredible.
Yeah.

2828
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:35,980
They just figured out a

2829
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,740
way to stop the mosquitoes from breeding
without poison,

2830
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:41,470
without poison.
That's incredible.

2831
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:44,770
I would have thought they would just 
agent orange the fuck out of that place.

2832
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:47,230
Just standing water.
Wow.

2833
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:49,960
Do you know malaria has killed half the 
people that have ever died ever?

2834
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:54,100
No shit.
Wow.

2835
02:07:54,850 --> 02:07:57,340
Wow.
Half the people that have ever done ever

2836
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:01,180
in the history of the human race of 
dying from malaria and still unabated,

2837
02:08:01,181 --> 02:08:02,710
no fucking cure.
My friend.

2838
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:04,630
Justin's got it at three times.
Really?

2839
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:05,770
Where's he live?
Well,

2840
02:08:05,771 --> 02:08:08,170
he goes to the Congo,
makes wells for the pygmies,

2841
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:10,773
justin wren.
But if you catch it and you take the 

2842
02:08:13,091 --> 02:08:14,290
pill right away,
you're fine.

2843
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:18,160
If you get the proper medication,
you will be okay.

2844
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,053
But there's a bunch of different strains
of malaria and some of them last a long 

2845
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:25,300
time and he's had one strain where he 
got it.

2846
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:28,690
He recovered from It and then he got 
sick and because he got sick,

2847
02:08:28,691 --> 02:08:29,524
the malaria came back,
so he got an unrelated illness without 

2848
02:08:32,261 --> 02:08:33,094
being around the mosquitoes and malaria 
came back and he had to figure it out 

2849
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:38,380
that the malaria had made a relapse.
So he's had it three times,

2850
02:08:38,381 --> 02:08:40,900
two times from being bitten one time 
from a relapse.

2851
02:08:41,290 --> 02:08:44,180
So is malaria something that just stays 
with you for life?

2852
02:08:44,181 --> 02:08:46,210
I think with some cases,
and not just.

2853
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:47,073
Not necessarily for live,
but it can recur over the course of a 

2854
02:08:49,781 --> 02:08:50,614
certain amount of years.
And then your body eventually gets over 

2855
02:08:52,331 --> 02:08:53,164
it,
but he was saying that one case of 

2856
02:08:54,161 --> 02:08:57,190
malaria,
you can have it for as much as 30 years.

2857
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,443
Wow.
And dying of it is about as painful as 

2858
02:09:01,361 --> 02:09:04,390
it gets.
Your brain starts to fucking fry.

2859
02:09:04,391 --> 02:09:08,020
You just go crazy.
Your entire body feels like it's made of

2860
02:09:08,021 --> 02:09:09,340
acid.
It's brutal.

2861
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:12,070
Fuck yeah.
Fuck.

2862
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:14,080
You know.
And you think about how,

2863
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:15,700
you know,
third world,

2864
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:18,580
you know,
we're trying to do good in the world.

2865
02:09:18,581 --> 02:09:22,600
Malaria is just number one,
two and three that we should be focusing

2866
02:09:22,601 --> 02:09:23,010
on.

2867
02:09:23,010 --> 02:09:23,843
Yeah.
There was some work that they were 

2868
02:09:24,871 --> 02:09:26,490
doing,
um,

2869
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,320
kind of want to say somewhere around 
California,

2870
02:09:28,321 --> 02:09:33,180
someone was doing it where they were 
trying to figure out a way to engineer a

2871
02:09:33,181 --> 02:09:34,014
mosquito that does not get malaria.
And they were going to release that 

2872
02:09:37,621 --> 02:09:38,890
mosquito.
Oh yeah.

2873
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:39,940
Yeah.
I heard about this.

2874
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:41,400
Is that what it was?
Well,

2875
02:09:41,401 --> 02:09:46,140
I think it happened with zika virus.
Malaria really kill half the people that

2876
02:09:46,141 --> 02:09:48,300
ever lived get the facts.
Did it?

2877
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:50,910
Oh,
it doesn't matter.

2878
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:53,760
It's definitely probably one of the 
biggest throughout human history.

2879
02:09:53,761 --> 02:09:57,750
But to actually know the actual fact if 
it has killed that many people,

2880
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,490
it's probably not because it would have 
had to kill it at an average of five and

2881
02:10:00,491 --> 02:10:04,320
a half million per year.
And for like the last 30 or 40 years,

2882
02:10:04,321 --> 02:10:06,570
it's only about two to $3 million.
So that number,

2883
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,750
30 or 40 years?
At least 20 percent.

2884
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:10,580
Yeah.

2885
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:11,420
so,
but they don't know.

2886
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:12,770
So where does it come from?
Does any.

2887
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:15,380
There's any site support that this site 
tries to debunk it.

2888
02:10:15,381 --> 02:10:17,540
We have to be sure that they're not 
right.

2889
02:10:17,541 --> 02:10:20,780
Because I feel like I read it from a 
science paper,

2890
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:22,760
which might not necessarily look.
Look,

2891
02:10:22,761 --> 02:10:25,400
we had rob wolf the other day and he 
thought that the vomitorium was really.

2892
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:29,770
Some people make mistakes,
but it's a,

2893
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:30,613
it's killed fuck loads of people.
it's just there's a lot of those god 

2894
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:34,610
disease.
It scared the shit out of you.

2895
02:10:34,611 --> 02:10:35,444
Like remember when the ebola crisis 
happened and everybody was panicking 

2896
02:10:37,761 --> 02:10:39,680
that a bullet made its way to the United
States.

2897
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:41,540
Remember that one lady,
she was a nurse.

2898
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:44,930
She was in quarantine and they,
they tried to keep from quarantine.

2899
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:45,561
She's like,
fuck you.

2900
02:10:45,561 --> 02:10:47,300
I'm going shopping.
That's right.

2901
02:10:47,770 --> 02:10:48,850
Yeah.
So like,

2902
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:49,710
bitch,
you're quarantined.

2903
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:50,543
I don't Have it.

2904
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:51,453
Well,
this zika thing is not under under 

2905
02:10:52,611 --> 02:10:53,870
wraps.
They've got it here.

2906
02:10:53,871 --> 02:10:55,530
It's down in floridA.
And uh,

2907
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:56,383
I think that they,
I know they were trying to genetically 

2908
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:01,220
modify mosquitoes for zika.
Yeah.

2909
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:03,050
Yeah.
I'm a friend of mine.

2910
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,150
His wife got pregnant.
It wouldn't,

2911
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:08,900
wouldn't let her go anywhere.
so like we were supposed to go to Hawaii

2912
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:10,810
or maybe Mexico or something like that,
that they were like,

2913
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:12,000
fuck that.
Yeah.

2914
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:12,883
We're not taking any chances.
I'm gonna stay right here while this 

2915
02:11:14,061 --> 02:11:15,320
kid's born.
Fuck yeah.

2916
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:16,213
Because it,
it's incurable and your kid develops a 

2917
02:11:18,711 --> 02:11:19,544
tiny head and it's a really creepy.
They don't even know what else happens 

2918
02:11:22,521 --> 02:11:23,510
because they're,
you know,

2919
02:11:23,511 --> 02:11:26,420
the kids that are born from it are only 
a few years old at this point.

2920
02:11:26,450 --> 02:11:29,390
Fucking crazy disease.
That's so cruel.

2921
02:11:29,630 --> 02:11:32,990
So horrible.
There's a guy named Peter Cortez that I,

2922
02:11:32,991 --> 02:11:33,824
uh,
interviewed once and he was talking to 

2923
02:11:35,301 --> 02:11:36,430
me about,
um,

2924
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:38,990
it was for my saifai,
sheila did years back and he was talking

2925
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:39,850
to me about,
um,

2926
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:42,380
jungle diseases like people that have,
um,

2927
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:43,933
you know,
any sort of infestations of parasites 

2928
02:11:46,671 --> 02:11:47,630
and things like that in the jungle.

2929
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:51,020
And he said it is 100 percent of the 
people that lived there.

2930
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:54,950
They have the 100 percent of the people 
that live there have something.

2931
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:56,260
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

2932
02:11:56,261 --> 02:11:58,760
I went 100 percent.
Does that mean they're living with it or

2933
02:11:58,761 --> 02:12:00,410
they're suffering from it?
They're living with it.

2934
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:02,000
I mean,
they might be suffering from it,

2935
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:04,280
but one of them was,
um,

2936
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:08,630
this cat parasite toxoplasma.
Have you ever heard of that?

2937
02:12:08,631 --> 02:12:09,590
Oh yeah.
I'm pregnant.

2938
02:12:09,591 --> 02:12:12,050
Women are super dangerous for women to 
like,

2939
02:12:12,051 --> 02:12:12,884
handle cat shit because of it.
You shouldn't touch a litter box or eat 

2940
02:12:15,261 --> 02:12:17,320
any vegetables in France because they 
don't.

2941
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:18,700
Uh,
my friend,

2942
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:21,380
my wife went to France when she was 
pregnant and they said that she couldn't

2943
02:12:21,381 --> 02:12:24,320
eat cheese because they don't pass her 
eyes it out correctly.

2944
02:12:24,321 --> 02:12:25,600
And France.
Well,

2945
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:26,443
it makes sense.
They like that raw stinky cheese down 

2946
02:12:28,251 --> 02:12:29,390
there.
They love that stuff,

2947
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,980
they love it,
but it,

2948
02:12:30,981 --> 02:12:31,814
um,
it's a weird one because it makes the 

2949
02:12:33,950 --> 02:12:34,783
rat,
when a rat eats it or rat gets it into 

2950
02:12:37,471 --> 02:12:38,304
its body,
a rap become sexually attracted to the 

2951
02:12:39,921 --> 02:12:40,754
smell cat urine to the point where their
dick gets hard and their ball swell up 

2952
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:46,940
and they go find the cat and the cat 
kills him.

2953
02:12:47,150 --> 02:12:47,983
And then the cat relays it to people.
And one of the things it does with 

2954
02:12:51,141 --> 02:12:52,790
people,
it makes him reckless.

2955
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:54,013
So there's a direct.
There's a guy named Dr. Roberts polsky 

2956
02:12:56,180 --> 02:12:56,360
at,
uh,

2957
02:12:56,360 --> 02:13:00,710
stanford who's done extensive research 
on toxoplasma is fucking fascinating.

2958
02:13:00,711 --> 02:13:03,860
Guys get some awesome speeches where he 
talks about it online,

2959
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:04,993
but one of the things they found when he
was working in the er is a direct 

2960
02:13:07,131 --> 02:13:10,880
correlation between toxo plasma and 
motorcycle accidents.

2961
02:13:11,570 --> 02:13:14,930
Like a lot of these people,
they're really people that would come in

2962
02:13:14,931 --> 02:13:16,640
and they would have motorcycle 
accidents.

2963
02:13:16,641 --> 02:13:19,820
They would test them and they would find
out they tested positive for toxo.

2964
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:21,223
$50.
Million people in America tested 

2965
02:13:23,241 --> 02:13:26,290
positive for toxo plasma brielle yep.
And it,

2966
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:27,124
it affects the way you think,
it affects your judgment and makes you 

2967
02:13:29,961 --> 02:13:32,220
more impulsive,
makes you more aggressive.

2968
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,050
And it might even affect women.

2969
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:37,910
It might make women more promiscuous or 
at least make them more um,

2970
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,110
sexually submissive.
They don't know.

2971
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:40,973
I mean,
this is just a complete total 

2972
02:13:41,911 --> 02:13:42,744
speculation,
but they think it might be one of the 

2973
02:13:43,921 --> 02:13:44,754
reasons why some south american 
countries are very macho and the women 

2974
02:13:47,641 --> 02:13:49,830
are like very sexy.
So why did we win with cats?

2975
02:13:49,831 --> 02:13:51,780
Always live alone.
I don't think it's the same,

2976
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,090
but those cats never leave the house.
So.

2977
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:56,840
So if you don't have a cat,
you can't catch this.

2978
02:13:56,970 --> 02:13:57,810
No,
you can catch it.

2979
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:58,673
You can catch it from the meat of a cow 
that eats the cat shit and it's in its 

2980
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:05,040
grass.
Like there's a bunch of different ways.

2981
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:05,874
A lot of people currently,
there's probably 50 Million people in 

2982
02:14:07,501 --> 02:14:09,690
the country that have this currently in 
America.

2983
02:14:09,691 --> 02:14:10,524
There's 50 million people plus that are 
infected with this parasite called 

2984
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:17,330
toxoplasmosis.
Should you geT tested for it then?

2985
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:18,690
I probably have it for sure.
I'm scared.

2986
02:14:18,691 --> 02:14:20,610
I don't want to get tested because you 
have cats,

2987
02:14:20,611 --> 02:14:21,444
right?
Yeah.

2988
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:22,460
Yeah.
I'm definitely.

2989
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:26,910
I'm joey diaz has 150,000 fucking cats.
He's for sure.

2990
02:14:26,911 --> 02:14:29,090
Got it.
All those crazy cat ladies are guarantee

2991
02:14:29,091 --> 02:14:29,930
you they have.
Yeah.

2992
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,700
Yeah.
It's a really common thing.

2993
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:33,563
I think in France at one point there was
something like 30 percent of the 

2994
02:14:35,761 --> 02:14:37,120
population had talked,
so.

2995
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:38,160
Yeah.
Yeah,

2996
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:40,650
yeah.
It's real.

2997
02:14:40,650 --> 02:14:42,360
Well,
we have feral cats.

2998
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:45,180
Is that a bacteria then?
It's a parasite.

2999
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:46,373
It's so sort of a parasite that actually
gets its way into your brain because 

3000
02:14:49,051 --> 02:14:49,884
that's the crazy thing is what I forget 
what percentage of your body weight is 

3001
02:14:53,011 --> 02:14:55,760
bacteria,
but it's staggering nuts.

3002
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,410
Charge 15 percent of your body weight is
bacteria.

3003
02:14:58,530 --> 02:14:59,171
Yeah.
We're.

3004
02:14:59,171 --> 02:15:01,370
We're all you need to the steps.
See how full of shit.

3005
02:15:01,371 --> 02:15:02,100
I mean,
first of all,

3006
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:02,933
find out how many people in America have
toxoplasma before we find that 

3007
02:15:04,771 --> 02:15:05,690
approximately $30.

3008
02:15:05,690 --> 02:15:06,630
Million.
Thirty dollars million.

3009
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:08,820
Wow.
It says it's the number.

3010
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:11,510
See bright $50 million.
See if I.

3011
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:14,730
I don't remember that wrong,
right?

3012
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:17,400
50 million people in America have talks 
with one of them died.

3013
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:18,623
Oh my god,
I don't think it kills you on a 

3014
02:15:19,621 --> 02:15:21,570
motorcycle wreck.
Motorcycles.

3015
02:15:22,070 --> 02:15:23,820
But [inaudible] was,
um,

3016
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,140
he was,
uh,

3017
02:15:25,170 --> 02:15:26,003
studying it's effects on people and 
trying to figure out like they don't 

3018
02:15:29,251 --> 02:15:30,084
really know what it does to people.
There's just this correlation between 

3019
02:15:31,891 --> 02:15:35,070
motorcycle accident.
Another thing that says up to 60 million

3020
02:15:35,071 --> 02:15:39,510
people could have it so makes that a 
million people just in America,

3021
02:15:39,710 --> 02:15:41,310
just in America,
in other countries,

3022
02:15:41,311 --> 02:15:43,350
like in some south american countries,
it's very high.

3023
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:44,820
And uh,
you know,

3024
02:15:44,821 --> 02:15:46,920
it might've been just something that 
people been living with forever.

3025
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:47,863
It's just,
there's some sort of a weird connection 

3026
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:50,724
that we have to these organisms.
And in this one it rewires the sexual 

3027
02:15:54,961 --> 02:15:58,600
reward system of rodin's changes the 
reward system.

3028
02:15:58,601 --> 02:16:02,120
It makes their dick hard for cat piss so
that they go near the cat.

3029
02:16:02,121 --> 02:16:02,954
So they get killed.
So they can transmit it to people 

3030
02:16:04,021 --> 02:16:05,770
because cats hanging around with people.
I mean,

3031
02:16:05,771 --> 02:16:08,370
assuming that that's the,
the chain of events.

3032
02:16:08,430 --> 02:16:09,990
Yeah,
fucking a man.

3033
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:13,560
Jesus,
look at that one to three percent of the

3034
02:16:13,561 --> 02:16:16,890
body's mass in a 200 pound adults is two
to six pounds of bacteria,

3035
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,110
but also play a vital role in human 
health.

3036
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:20,513
Wow.
Human body contains trillions of 

3037
02:16:23,101 --> 02:16:26,820
microorganisms.
Outnumbering human cells by 10 to one,

3038
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:33,573
so three percent of the body's mass,
but they outnumber human cells just 

3039
02:16:37,001 --> 02:16:39,250
because of the size,
because they're small size.

3040
02:16:39,251 --> 02:16:40,084
However,
the micro organisms make up only one to 

3041
02:16:41,171 --> 02:16:44,770
three percent of the body's mass.
it doesn't make as much of the mass,

3042
02:16:44,771 --> 02:16:49,720
but you are outnumbered.
Human cells are outnumbered 10 to one.

3043
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:50,663
That's like if there's every one rap for
every person on a ship and there's 10 

3044
02:16:55,061 --> 02:16:57,730
people,
think of that.

3045
02:16:58,890 --> 02:16:59,723
I mean,
that's a fucking infested rat filled 

3046
02:17:01,301 --> 02:17:03,610
ship.
Some of the bacteria is good.

3047
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:05,000
Some of it is.
Yeah,

3048
02:17:05,001 --> 02:17:07,140
but I'm just saying you're mostly rats.
He feels like.

3049
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:08,710
What does that a ship of people?
Well,

3050
02:17:08,711 --> 02:17:12,700
there's some people on it.
It's mostly rats.

3051
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:14,940
I mean,
it's mostly fucking ratchet.

3052
02:17:15,150 --> 02:17:16,660
So we are.
I mean,

3053
02:17:16,661 --> 02:17:19,540
if you had a 100 people,
a thousand rats on a ship,

3054
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:22,390
which say that's a ship full of people 
or ship full of rats.

3055
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:23,613
I say it's a ship full of rats and pour 
a bunch of poor fuckers trying to get 

3056
02:17:26,351 --> 02:17:27,930
some sleep.
Yeah,

3057
02:17:28,110 --> 02:17:28,943
we're just bags of bacteria.
We're bags of bacteria and we don't 

3058
02:17:32,471 --> 02:17:33,304
understand a lot of it because it is.
It's so fucking small and it's 

3059
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:37,580
mysterious.
Well,

3060
02:17:37,581 --> 02:17:38,414
how about probiotics?
That's how recent is that where people 

3061
02:17:40,421 --> 02:17:44,370
figured out that you have to take in 
healthy bacteria in your body every day?

3062
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:46,270
Two decades,
three decades.

3063
02:17:46,271 --> 02:17:47,800
I meAn,
when did you figure that out?

3064
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:51,070
When do people start taking probiotics?
You take them every day,

3065
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:52,000
right?
Yeah.

3066
02:17:52,130 --> 02:17:55,270
I'd taken a live form.
I'd like mostly in.

3067
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:58,480
I like to eat either kimchi or 
sauerkraut.

3068
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:01,270
I do that and in kombucha drink kombucha
everyday.

3069
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,380
How you did stuff.
Oh,

3070
02:18:02,381 --> 02:18:03,020
I love it.
Yeah.

3071
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:04,400
I always keep it here too.
If you want one.

3072
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:06,040
Wow.
We always have it here.

3073
02:18:06,130 --> 02:18:06,640
I drink that.

3074
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:07,473
The real stuff that you have to have an 
id to show the gts kombucha as the shit 

3075
02:18:11,081 --> 02:18:11,914
because it's over one half of one 
percent alcohol and you can't get drunk 

3076
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:17,860
but one half to one percent alcohol.
You have to be 21 to buy it.

3077
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:19,413
Oh,
it's that strong over one half of one 

3078
02:18:20,951 --> 02:18:23,340
percent and it's made out of like dairy,
right?

3079
02:18:23,341 --> 02:18:24,470
It's like raw dairy.
No,

3080
02:18:24,471 --> 02:18:24,631
no,
no,

3081
02:18:24,631 --> 02:18:25,450
no.
That's key for.

3082
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:28,660
That's a different thing you're thinking
of a key for is like a green.

3083
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:29,993
It was green involved to somehow.
I don't understand really how kiefer's 

3084
02:18:32,261 --> 02:18:34,210
made somebody explained it to me and I 
just blanked out,

3085
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:37,480
but it's a fungus.
It's kind of like a fungus.

3086
02:18:38,370 --> 02:18:40,180
It's a growth,
some sort of a thing.

3087
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:41,313
Kombucha.
Yeah.

3088
02:18:41,410 --> 02:18:43,600
I just didn't make it.
I used to make it really?

3089
02:18:43,601 --> 02:18:43,881
Yeah,
yeah,

3090
02:18:43,881 --> 02:18:46,360
yeah.
When I first came to la,

3091
02:18:46,450 --> 02:18:49,630
I actually,
this girl I was dating got me a piece.

3092
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:50,703
She got me like a live organism.
She told me how to do it and you'd get 

3093
02:18:52,961 --> 02:18:54,640
like a bowl,
like a glass bowl,

3094
02:18:54,641 --> 02:18:55,474
like one of the big punch bowls and you 
fill the bowl up with sugar and water 

3095
02:18:58,870 --> 02:19:00,910
and I forget what the other ingredients 
are,

3096
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:02,133
but you stirred all in,
make it dissolve and then you put the 

3097
02:19:04,271 --> 02:19:05,104
fungus in there and then you put it in 
the frigerator or you leave it on the 

3098
02:19:06,881 --> 02:19:07,900
counter.
I don't remember.

3099
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:09,700
What much fungus do you think to leave 
it on the counter?

3100
02:19:09,970 --> 02:19:11,390
You just put a good chunk.
Yeah.

3101
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:15,310
You know you have like a piece of this 
stuff and the longer you let it ferment,

3102
02:19:15,610 --> 02:19:17,170
the stronger the kombucha is going to 
be.

3103
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:18,363
And then I would take it in.
I would pour it into like this big 

3104
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:22,863
bucket and then drink it and I was like,
it's too much of a pain in the ass 

3105
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:27,070
because you couldn't buy it anywhere 
back then.

3106
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:28,453
The only way you can get it in 1994,
unless you knew some like super hippie 

3107
02:19:31,131 --> 02:19:31,964
health food store that sold it most of 
the time you got it from other people 

3108
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:36,230
and I was like,
does this even work?

3109
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:38,840
Like doing what am I even doing?
So it's even good for you.

3110
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:40,011
But I was like,
oh,

3111
02:19:40,011 --> 02:19:41,630
she might be right.
Wow.

3112
02:19:41,710 --> 02:19:44,300
A kombucha everyday.
everyday,

3113
02:19:44,301 --> 02:19:46,880
everyday you have that.
Or sauerkraut or kimchi.

3114
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:48,590
Sauerkraut to.
I love sauerkraut.

3115
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:51,200
Raw sauerkraut,
but kimchis huge,

3116
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:56,260
super high in probiotics.
It's like fermented cabbage.

3117
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:58,920
So it's all like organisms in it.
Yeah,

3118
02:19:59,030 --> 02:19:59,863
it's almost shit growing.
My stomach feels distended and somebody 

3119
02:20:03,771 --> 02:20:05,900
told me that the probiotics can help,
that.

3120
02:20:05,901 --> 02:20:08,120
There's probably a lot of bacteria in 
there.

3121
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:09,013
It could be.
Would you drink a do take in a lot of 

3122
02:20:11,151 --> 02:20:13,910
sugar?
Pasta or pasta?

3123
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:16,220
That's sugar unfortunately.
Yeah,

3124
02:20:16,221 --> 02:20:19,940
I know and I,
I've tried to take a fucking bagel every

3125
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:21,920
morning and then I try to never have 
pasta,

3126
02:20:21,921 --> 02:20:24,740
but unfortunately all that fucking 
yummy,

3127
02:20:24,741 --> 02:20:25,574
delicious shit.

3128
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:30,620
Like every now and then I'll let myself 
have like a giant pastrami sub.

3129
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:31,610
Yeah.
Well,

3130
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:33,800
you know,
Italian bread,

3131
02:20:34,310 --> 02:20:35,143
mustard and swiss cheese and I love it,
but you feel like shit afterwards 

3132
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,480
because your body has to process all 
that sugar.

3133
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:43,790
Right?
All that bread is terrible for you.

3134
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:47,720
So you just eat vegetables and meat for 
the most part.

3135
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:49,730
I mean I fuck around.
I don't.

3136
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:53,520
I don't have a totally strict diet.
I have a mostly strict diet.

3137
02:20:53,570 --> 02:20:56,090
You eat rice sometimes?
Most of the time,

3138
02:20:56,091 --> 02:20:58,280
no,
but sometimes like I'm having sushi.

3139
02:20:58,281 --> 02:20:59,360
I'm like,
fuck it,

3140
02:20:59,361 --> 02:21:02,990
let's live more.
But if I'm not feeling that,

3141
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:07,860
I'll either appeal the sushi off of the.
Off of the rice have succeeded.

3142
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:09,070
Like sashimi.
Yeah,

3143
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:11,270
but I'll eat like one out of every 
three.

3144
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:12,890
I'll eat the rice.
Just gotta.

3145
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:16,100
If you're on a diet where your body's 
fat adapted,

3146
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:16,963
if it's burning off fat,
as soon as you tip the scales and you 

3147
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:21,350
have too many carbohydrates,
it's like fuck it.

3148
02:21:21,350 --> 02:21:23,510
We're going back to carbohydrates.
Then you get tired.

3149
02:21:23,511 --> 02:21:24,350
Easy.
You get hungry.

3150
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:25,490
Easy.
It's like it.

3151
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:26,443
It fucks with the system.
Once you start getting that fat adapted 

3152
02:21:29,091 --> 02:21:29,924
state and it's hard when you're out to 
eat a decent lunch that doesn't have 

3153
02:21:33,471 --> 02:21:35,720
carbs in it,
everything's a fucking sandwich.

3154
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:38,150
Salads,
salads,

3155
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:40,460
chicken salads and salmon.
Salmon is really good.

3156
02:21:40,461 --> 02:21:42,050
It's cutting oils in it.
Healthy oils.

3157
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:45,080
Ask them for olive oil,
pour the olive oil on the salad.

3158
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:46,880
Nothing wrong with balsamic vinegarette 
either,

3159
02:21:46,881 --> 02:21:48,340
but uh,
you know,

3160
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:50,510
most salad dressings are bullshit.
Yeah.

3161
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:53,240
Most salad dressings,
just nonsense and sugar.

3162
02:21:53,241 --> 02:21:56,630
And you drink,
like if you have like a delicious french

3163
02:21:56,631 --> 02:21:57,920
dressing,
like why thing?

3164
02:21:57,921 --> 02:22:00,020
It's delicious.
It's fucking desert.

3165
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:01,430
Yeah.
You're eating dessert,

3166
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:04,310
dessert,
ketchup that you pour over your salad or

3167
02:22:04,311 --> 02:22:06,860
my kid eats fucking granola bars all day
and I'm like,

3168
02:22:06,861 --> 02:22:08,000
dude,
that's a candy bar.

3169
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:09,710
Yep.
it's just sugar.

3170
02:22:10,050 --> 02:22:12,500
It doesn't seem like.
It seems like you're eating oats and all

3171
02:22:12,501 --> 02:22:15,680
healthy and shit.
You just as better off eating a snickers

3172
02:22:15,681 --> 02:22:16,514
bar.
Yeah.

3173
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:18,590
Same shit.
I'm kinda.

3174
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:19,820
What about fruit?
Somebody?

3175
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:20,683
Somebody told me that not all fruit is 
good to eat because it's got too much 

3176
02:22:22,371 --> 02:22:23,090
sugar.
Well,

3177
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:25,980
fruIt of today we have to really realize
when everybody's

3178
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,180
using these terms.
Gmo,

3179
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:28,313
and this is something I've looked into 
pretty heavily and I had this guy kevin 

3180
02:22:30,541 --> 02:22:35,220
folta on my podcast as a food scientist 
and he's kind of explaining while people

3181
02:22:35,221 --> 02:22:38,460
have a lot of misguided misconceptions 
about gmo foods,

3182
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:40,230
he's like,
essentially everythIng's gmo,

3183
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:43,440
like everything has been in some way or 
another modify that you're eating,

3184
02:22:43,441 --> 02:22:47,100
whether it's tomatoes that have been 
modified to stay on the shelf longer,

3185
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:48,053
whether it's oranges or modified to be 
far more juicy and delicious than 

3186
02:22:50,461 --> 02:22:51,930
they've ever been in the past.
Apples,

3187
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:54,710
they're like,
we're talking about apples was like old.

3188
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,400
Somebody else was just talking about 
this recently,

3189
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:58,020
who was.
I don't remember if I looked it up.

3190
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:01,530
there are thousands of different apples 
that didn't pull it up to that podcast,

3191
02:23:01,531 --> 02:23:05,580
but there's only like five now.
Thousands of different.

3192
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:06,850
Was it?
Rob was rob.

3193
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:07,710
Rob.

3194
02:23:07,710 --> 02:23:08,280
Hello,
rob.

3195
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:10,170
Rob wolf is a biologist.
I'm pretty is.

3196
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:13,740
What the fuck is his bio?
Bio.

3197
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:17,130
Fucking something.
Some scientists character.

3198
02:23:17,250 --> 02:23:20,070
Really smart guy,
but he was explaining that they all used

3199
02:23:20,071 --> 02:23:20,904
to be like crab apples.
They'll still be like kind of sour and 

3200
02:23:22,591 --> 02:23:24,300
you can eat them.
You remember crab apples when you were a

3201
02:23:24,301 --> 02:23:25,950
kId.
We throw them at each other,

3202
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:28,640
throw them at cars.
There are little tiny things.

3203
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:30,870
Green and they were salary shit.
You could eat them,

3204
02:23:30,871 --> 02:23:31,704
you'd eat them if you're really hungry,
but most of the time you wouldn't eat 

3205
02:23:33,091 --> 02:23:33,720
them.
Yeah,

3206
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:35,520
that's what apparently with apples used 
to be.

3207
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:40,970
Those were wild apples and people if I 
just take that and I don't know how they

3208
02:23:41,221 --> 02:23:42,054
do it,
but they figured out how to splice 

3209
02:23:42,781 --> 02:23:43,614
things and change things and selectively
breed certain plants and they came up 

3210
02:23:48,871 --> 02:23:51,630
with different strains.
That's why corn looks the way it looks.

3211
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:52,943
Old school corn was like the size of a 
hobos dick and it was so naughty and 

3212
02:23:57,691 --> 02:23:59,490
fucked up look and it was like four 
inches long.

3213
02:23:59,491 --> 02:24:01,950
So it's A little tiny thing.
It tastes the same.

3214
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:04,110
No,
I mean it's a hobos dick.

3215
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:05,640
No,
hobos dicks are weird,

3216
02:24:05,641 --> 02:24:06,870
man.
They're so variable.

3217
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,193
You never know what you get.
And it could be a recent hobo and be 

3218
02:24:12,111 --> 02:24:13,100
like,
that guy who punched you.

3219
02:24:13,130 --> 02:24:15,790
Just old school,
not blowing veteran.

3220
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:20,080
His dick tastes like battery acid 
addict.

3221
02:24:20,090 --> 02:24:20,923
That's been through the pacific 
southwest for guys just doing nothing 

3222
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:25,590
all day and he comes in your mouth.
What do you think that tastes?

3223
02:24:26,270 --> 02:24:30,260
Because if they say that like a guide 
drinks orange juice has come,

3224
02:24:30,261 --> 02:24:31,910
tastes better.
Have you heard that?

3225
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:33,170
Yeah.
Whenever I heard that,

3226
02:24:33,171 --> 02:24:34,004
I was like,
how many dicks do you have to suck for 

3227
02:24:34,971 --> 02:24:37,050
you figure that out.
You can get away from me.

3228
02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:43,220
Do you hold it with your fucking 
scientist?

3229
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:46,500
He's sucking dick with a lab coat on.
Taking notes.

3230
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:47,623
My asparagus not recommended.
Switching it around in your mouth like 

3231
02:24:52,101 --> 02:24:55,940
you're a wine connoisseur,
right?

3232
02:24:55,941 --> 02:24:58,670
If a guy eats pineapples,
pineapples is cum.

3233
02:24:58,671 --> 02:25:01,250
Tastes better,
but conversely,

3234
02:25:01,251 --> 02:25:02,870
if you just knew it nothing but smoking 
meth,

3235
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:05,840
your loads have to taste like hot death.
Yeah.

3236
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:08,510
And it does.
And it's fucking lumpy.

3237
02:25:09,380 --> 02:25:12,560
Pesticide loads.
Tastes like roundup.

3238
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:21,320
It's not good when you have to kill it.
Not much either.

3239
02:25:21,321 --> 02:25:26,321
It's like a fuckinG hershey's kiss 
swollen.

3240
02:25:28,430 --> 02:25:33,430
I had shit,
motherfucker.

3241
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:39,460
Fuck.
She's immediately tripping on meth.

3242
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:40,653
She's out of her mind.
Do you remember when that actor fuck's 

3243
02:25:43,481 --> 02:25:44,800
his name?
Tom sizemore.

3244
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:47,720
When tom sizemore went off the rails.
Yeah,

3245
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:49,300
and did a porn.
I'm like,

3246
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:50,173
they would play his,
his thing on opie and anthony all the 

3247
02:25:52,241 --> 02:25:54,190
time because when he was coming he was 
like,

3248
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:56,740
oh,
mother fucker,

3249
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:02,050
just a cracked out load.

3250
02:26:02,870 --> 02:26:06,820
There's nothing like a car,
like the sound of a man orgasm.

3251
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:11,850
When he knows he's just off the rails is
off the rails on math making a porn.

3252
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:14,560
It was in saving private ryan.
Here he is.

3253
02:26:16,410 --> 02:26:20,530
That's his primal as it gets.
It's like the pure id being expressed.

3254
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:22,750
Just fuck it.
Can you play it?

3255
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:23,973
No.
Can't even show you this legal fee to 

3256
02:26:26,741 --> 02:26:28,000
play the audience.
Show this.

3257
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:30,240
He was a madman.
He was a madman.

3258
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:31,740
Wait,
how do you decide which clips here?

3259
02:26:31,741 --> 02:26:34,210
Lead to play tit on that,
so yeah,

3260
02:26:34,211 --> 02:26:36,310
we can get it away.
Get it off,

3261
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:37,240
get it off,
get off,

3262
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:41,290
get off the screen here on the screen.
I met him a long time ago.

3263
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:45,500
I did a show on vh one called the list.
Yeah.

3264
02:26:45,510 --> 02:26:46,343
Yeah.
I remember that.

3265
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:47,680
The host of it,
I got to.

3266
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:49,090
You are the host of the list.

3267
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,700
I was a hope,
one of the,

3268
02:26:50,701 --> 02:26:52,010
and they wrote,
they rotated,

3269
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:54,880
rotated,
so I think I did two,

3270
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:56,073
maybe three episodes,
but one of them was I got to meet rob 

3271
02:26:58,991 --> 02:27:00,670
halford.
I got to meet rick james.

3272
02:27:01,630 --> 02:27:03,910
James was a macro,
didn't do none of them kids.

3273
02:27:04,210 --> 02:27:05,043
He was like,
we were talking about it and one of the 

3274
02:27:07,211 --> 02:27:09,130
gals from baywatch was on the show as 
well,

3275
02:27:09,131 --> 02:27:12,100
and she was a mom.
God,

3276
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:13,360
I can't remember her name,
but very,

3277
02:27:13,361 --> 02:27:16,360
very pretty girl.
Her name mary to nikki sixx.

3278
02:27:16,361 --> 02:27:18,430
No,
I don't think so.

3279
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:20,110
I don'T remember which one she was.
Anyway,

3280
02:27:20,410 --> 02:27:23,020
very nice girl.
Gina something or another.

3281
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:25,290
Anyway,
um,

3282
02:27:25,330 --> 02:27:28,060
she was,
it came up in some way,

3283
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:30,220
shape or form and she was like,
I don't buy it.

3284
02:27:30,330 --> 02:27:31,240
I don't buy it.
And he's like,

3285
02:27:31,241 --> 02:27:32,074
michael didn't do nothing to them.
Kids might go there And do nothing then 

3286
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:36,080
that's all bullshit imitation.

3287
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:39,370
I'm asking all bullshit.
And rick james had been out partying all

3288
02:27:39,371 --> 02:27:40,930
night.
So when he showed up,

3289
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:43,480
like we were warned that he might not be
able to do it.

3290
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:46,960
Like he got there and they,
you could tell he just been up,

3291
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:48,303
you knoW,
he's like,

3292
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:50,680
I'm,
I'm suffering from some sort of a cold,

3293
02:27:50,681 --> 02:27:52,270
so if I can't do this,
I can't do this.

3294
02:27:52,271 --> 02:27:53,050
And we were like,
hey man,

3295
02:27:53,050 --> 02:27:53,883
do what you can do to do.
But he went down and went out there and 

3296
02:27:56,050 --> 02:27:58,090
plow through like a trooper.
Wow.

3297
02:27:58,300 --> 02:27:59,020
Yeah.
But uh,

3298
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:02,950
he was defended Michael Jackson.
Margaret didn't do nothing but michael,

3299
02:28:02,951 --> 02:28:03,784
what's his face?
Tom sizemore came on and he had fucking 

3300
02:28:05,951 --> 02:28:07,600
slippers on.
He had like,

3301
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:08,493
slippers and fucking bathrobe.
I don't remember what he wore when he 

3302
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:12,154
sat down,
but I remember he showed up with 

3303
02:28:13,421 --> 02:28:14,254
slippers and a bathrobe and he was just 
right when he was just going off the 

3304
02:28:18,731 --> 02:28:20,550
rails right when he was going.

3305
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:21,453
It was supposed be him and val kilmer.
Val kilmer was out partying all night 

3306
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:26,570
and then he was with him and he's just 
like,

3307
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:27,351
val.
Karen was like,

3308
02:28:27,351 --> 02:28:28,340
fuck it,
I'm not going.

3309
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:31,010
So like last val kilmer was going to do 
the list.

3310
02:28:31,011 --> 02:28:32,950
Yes.
Falcon one was off the rails.

3311
02:28:32,990 --> 02:28:36,050
Don't remember when val kilmer got huge 
fat and went crazy.

3312
02:28:36,051 --> 02:28:36,884
That's right.
He did a play and we did a play for 

3313
02:28:38,421 --> 02:28:40,450
awhile and it was like,
what the fuck is val kilmer doing?

3314
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:43,370
Party in?
He was just going off.

3315
02:28:43,410 --> 02:28:45,980
It was just having fun and it was during
that time,

3316
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:48,440
that size more showed up.
It was a very nice guy.

3317
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:50,390
Super nice guy.
Math.

3318
02:28:50,391 --> 02:28:51,950
Huh?
I don't know what he was doing.

3319
02:28:51,951 --> 02:28:52,784
Who's doing a bunch of shit,
but then he wound up on celebrity rehab 

3320
02:28:54,201 --> 02:28:55,370
member.
Uh,

3321
02:28:55,371 --> 02:28:55,911
okay.
Oh,

3322
02:28:55,911 --> 02:28:57,030
that's right.
Yeah.

3323
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:58,280
Several seasons.

3324
02:28:58,370 --> 02:28:59,390
Was he?
Oh yeah.

3325
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:00,021
Oh,
that's right.

3326
02:29:00,021 --> 02:29:00,854
He was on with heidi fleiss.
Like heidi fleiss was like his 

3327
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:05,630
girlfriend.
That fucking celebrity rehab show.

3328
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:08,180
Could you iMagine if you try to do that 
today?

3329
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:11,550
They don't do it anymore.
Now it's,

3330
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:12,613
you're exploitinG people's.
The worst time you could ever have 

3331
02:29:15,561 --> 02:29:18,650
someone in front of cameras when they're
at their most vulnerable.

3332
02:29:18,710 --> 02:29:20,600
Yeah.
They are recovering from addiction.

3333
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:21,493
Do you don't think that that's an 
impediment to recovery and putting them 

3334
02:29:24,050 --> 02:29:24,883
on camera,
following cameras around them while 

3335
02:29:26,810 --> 02:29:29,090
they're trying to detox and figure the 
fucking life out.

3336
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:31,460
And you're giving them massive amounts 
of attention.

3337
02:29:31,461 --> 02:29:34,820
You're putting long shooting schedules.
You got lav mics on them and she started

3338
02:29:34,821 --> 02:29:36,500
having an affair.
As you encourage it,

3339
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:38,810
when you're supposed to discourage it is
crazy.

3340
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:42,290
It's everything that aa is not.
It's the opposite of anonymous.

3341
02:29:42,291 --> 02:29:43,910
You ever hear doug stand helps bid on 
it.

3342
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Now doug stanhope tortured dr drew 
really tortured him and he's 100 percent

3343
02:29:49,431 --> 02:29:50,200
right?
Yeah.

3344
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:53,030
Like look,
they allowed that to happen.

3345
02:29:53,031 --> 02:29:54,560
Dr. Drew figured like,
look,

3346
02:29:54,561 --> 02:29:56,360
I'm a competent doctor.
I'll take care of it.

3347
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:58,480
I'll make sure everything's fine.
At least it'll expose.

3348
02:29:58,490 --> 02:29:59,323
Like you could rationalize it,
it will expose to people what it's like 

3349
02:30:02,390 --> 02:30:03,223
to go through this.
And you see celebrities and movie stars 

3350
02:30:05,721 --> 02:30:06,554
going through this.
But a lot of it wasn't celebrities and 

3351
02:30:08,511 --> 02:30:11,270
movie stars.
It was like sorta celebrities like angie

3352
02:30:11,271 --> 02:30:16,270
dickinson where there's some guy on the 
show with some young guy was in brother.

3353
02:30:16,530 --> 02:30:17,540
Oh,
it was ian.

3354
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:19,220
I think so.
I shouldn't say that.

3355
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:21,400
Julia roberts.
Eric roberts was on.

3356
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:23,660
Well as he and he was on for,
for Pot.

3357
02:30:23,770 --> 02:30:26,660
It was hilarious.
So fucked up.

3358
02:30:26,661 --> 02:30:29,900
This dude's he's got a newspaper out,
he's drinking coffee,

3359
02:30:29,901 --> 02:30:33,020
good morning Shakes,
throw shitting themselves,

3360
02:30:33,021 --> 02:30:34,100
sweating through the night.

3361
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:37,040
He's like going through zero 
withdrawals.

3362
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:38,023
He's literally reading the times over a 
cup of coffee with his feet up on the 

3363
02:30:42,621 --> 02:30:43,454
beach during the ballot booth somewhere 
in some serene environment too is like 

3364
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:50,143
when you go to these rehabs,
that shit is expensive and it's like a 

3365
02:30:52,731 --> 02:30:53,564
resort.
You're getting like you're going to do 

3366
02:30:54,801 --> 02:30:56,810
yoga.
Then you do a meditation.

3367
02:30:56,811 --> 02:30:57,644
Maybe you get a fucking massage.
You drinking all like green green 

3368
02:31:01,641 --> 02:31:04,520
blended drinks and be well.
Who's paying for it?

3369
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:06,570
All the people that didn't have all the 
fun partying.

3370
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,513
I'm think you're paying for it now for 
the state only pays for so much right 

3371
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:15,500
now,
but I mean say you say your brother gets

3372
02:31:15,501 --> 02:31:17,720
all fucked up.
You sent him to rehab.

3373
02:31:17,721 --> 02:31:19,260
You're paying for it.
Oh,

3374
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:20,010
that's the worst.

3375
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,440
If you have a brother that's a coke 
addict and you have safety,

3376
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:25,380
you have a family and your wife's like,
you're not fucking paid for it,

3377
02:31:25,381 --> 02:31:26,530
greg.
Yeah,

3378
02:31:26,610 --> 02:31:27,870
he's gotta.
Get his shit together.

3379
02:31:28,530 --> 02:31:31,110
The fucking we need that money for 
johnny's college.

3380
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:34,620
Yeah.
My brother is the fourth time.

3381
02:31:34,621 --> 02:31:36,390
He's gotten fucked up in two years.

3382
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:38,980
And then your wife's like,
let's just kill him.

3383
02:31:40,030 --> 02:31:41,130
Let's just kill them.
You know,

3384
02:31:41,131 --> 02:31:42,550
you're probably some fucking loser.
I want to kill him.

3385
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:46,480
Let's take him to boston university life
insuranCe.

3386
02:31:47,650 --> 02:31:50,400
Not only we get rid of him like a bucks 
on the backend.

3387
02:31:50,470 --> 02:31:52,970
Rocky brother.
Let's take them fishing club.

3388
02:31:52,971 --> 02:31:53,980
Moved ahead.
Throw them in the ocean

3389
02:31:54,370 --> 02:31:57,710
godfather style.
How many people have done that?

3390
02:31:57,711 --> 02:31:58,544
How many people were killed?
Loved ones I thought were losers just 

3391
02:31:59,921 --> 02:32:01,620
for a life insurance policy.
Oh,

3392
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:02,830
all the time.
All the time.

3393
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:03,753
Yeah.
I feel like if you could see like the 

3394
02:32:05,741 --> 02:32:08,440
numbers of how many people have killed 
loved ones for money.

3395
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:11,090
Oh my.

3396
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:13,670
Yeah.
I mean they,

3397
02:32:13,700 --> 02:32:16,910
that's what that whole a dark internet 
is about,

3398
02:32:17,140 --> 02:32:17,973
you know,
getting a hitman to take as your 

3399
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:23,510
husband.
That's why my.

3400
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:27,560
I got a $1,000,000 insurance policy for 
my wife anymore than that.

3401
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:30,020
She fucking wants me gone.
That's a good point.

3402
02:32:30,290 --> 02:32:33,260
1 million lets her get.
Get her shit together to show you.

3403
02:32:33,261 --> 02:32:34,094
Don't have to pay taxes on that anymore.
That's one thing for the key is you set 

3404
02:32:37,371 --> 02:32:38,204
up a shell,
liKe we have a shell that it would pay 

3405
02:32:40,671 --> 02:32:41,504
into.
WhAt I'm thinking is actually 

3406
02:32:42,411 --> 02:32:45,000
inheritance tax,
inheritance tax.

3407
02:32:45,001 --> 02:32:47,100
Like if your kids inherited your money 
right there,

3408
02:32:47,101 --> 02:32:47,934
like if you left your kids $500,000,
your kids would have to pay off half of 

3409
02:32:51,501 --> 02:32:54,070
that to the government.
So they really would only get 2:15.

3410
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:55,550
The government uncle sam like.
Yeah,

3411
02:32:55,580 --> 02:32:57,070
like my gut.
That's right.

3412
02:32:57,370 --> 02:32:59,890
To take my cat.
I like to whip my bake.

3413
02:32:59,910 --> 02:33:01,370
Meanwhile trump's right.
He's like,

3414
02:33:01,371 --> 02:33:03,290
well this is fucked up because that 
money's already been taxed.

3415
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:05,720
LIke somebody earned that money is given
to you as a gift when they die.

3416
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:08,030
Like you shouldn't have to pay.
It's not earned income.

3417
02:33:08,810 --> 02:33:09,643
First of all,
it's only over one point $8,000,000 for 

3418
02:33:12,291 --> 02:33:15,470
a couple.
And my feeling is one point 8 million.

3419
02:33:15,471 --> 02:33:16,304
What do you mean that's the.
You don't pay any inheritance tax under 

3420
02:33:19,061 --> 02:33:21,110
one point $8,000,000.
Yeah.

3421
02:33:21,111 --> 02:33:21,944
So to me it feels like the framers of 
the constitution had come from europe 

3422
02:33:25,580 --> 02:33:28,970
where money had been handed down through
generations,

3423
02:33:28,971 --> 02:33:32,150
aristocracies useless,
wasteful,

3424
02:33:32,210 --> 02:33:35,240
dangerous motherfuckers,
and when they set up the constitution,

3425
02:33:35,241 --> 02:33:40,241
they said we need to have an estate tax 
to try to keep the money from all ending

3426
02:33:40,311 --> 02:33:43,460
up in the hands of a few families and so
I'm all for it.

3427
02:33:43,490 --> 02:33:47,540
I think then if you end up with more 
than one point $8,000,000 a year,

3428
02:33:47,541 --> 02:33:51,050
kids are set as well as their educations
will be set.

3429
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:54,560
That's a down payment on a house and 
then let them earn their fucking way.

3430
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:55,970
That's a good point.
Actually.

3431
02:33:56,030 --> 02:33:56,863
I never thought about that way.
You know what I didn't think actually 

3432
02:33:59,240 --> 02:34:02,660
honestly as weird as that or did think 
rather than that I have the problem with

3433
02:34:02,661 --> 02:34:04,010
is the money's going to go to the 
government.

3434
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:05,750
That's the problem is where does the 
money go?

3435
02:34:05,790 --> 02:34:08,600
Yeah.
It'd be one thing if you had inheritance

3436
02:34:08,601 --> 02:34:10,880
tax and it went towards a worthwhile 
charity,

3437
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:13,400
like should be able to pick.
You should be able to pick your chair.

3438
02:34:13,480 --> 02:34:14,350
Right?
Absolutely.

3439
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:15,380
That's the way to do it.
Well,

3440
02:34:15,381 --> 02:34:17,900
instead of giving it to the government 
and they spend as they wish,

3441
02:34:17,901 --> 02:34:19,510
they didn't even have to have a fucking 
receipt.

3442
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:21,730
You don't have to have an audit of what 
they do.

3443
02:34:22,090 --> 02:34:23,980
Well,
you look at what warren buffett is doing

3444
02:34:23,981 --> 02:34:26,020
now,
he's giving it away before he dies.

3445
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:28,390
That's what you gotta do.
If you want to control where it goes,

3446
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:29,553
give it away.
Save a couple million because that's 

3447
02:34:32,141 --> 02:34:34,540
what your kids will get and fucking give
the rest away the way you wanT to.

3448
02:34:34,570 --> 02:34:37,360
He's basically given it all away.
Ninety nine percent of it.

3449
02:34:37,390 --> 02:34:39,850
That's so insane.
This documentary about him.

3450
02:34:39,851 --> 02:34:40,684
That's really crazy.
I mean this guy like he literally lives 

3451
02:34:43,451 --> 02:34:47,620
in the same house he bought when he 
first moved to omaha,

3452
02:34:47,621 --> 02:34:49,510
Nebraska.
And how's that possible?

3453
02:34:49,511 --> 02:34:51,610
Like how?
Who watches his house?

3454
02:34:51,611 --> 02:34:53,470
like people must want to kidnap him all 
the time.

3455
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:54,333
He stays right there on the street.
They'd fucking show a picture of it 

3456
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:58,840
because you have like guards.
No,

3457
02:34:59,140 --> 02:34:59,973
come on.
He drives to the same mcdonald's every 

3458
02:35:01,601 --> 02:35:02,434
morning does he?
And he either gets an egg mcmuffin with 

3459
02:35:04,151 --> 02:35:04,984
sausage and the egg mcmuffin with bacon 
depending on as the stock market is up 

3460
02:35:08,021 --> 02:35:08,770
or down.

3461
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:09,930
Oh jesus.
And he.

3462
02:35:09,970 --> 02:35:11,110
He knows the exact.
He goes,

3463
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:14,260
It's a dollar 68.
I have that exact amount of money.

3464
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:17,470
He's fucking nuts.
He's like really?

3465
02:35:18,130 --> 02:35:20,610
Just flies commercial.
Yeah,

3466
02:35:20,620 --> 02:35:23,650
he takes coach seats were I think sell 
jesus christ.

3467
02:35:24,250 --> 02:35:27,220
drives a fucking car.
It's,

3468
02:35:27,221 --> 02:35:28,150
I dunno,
there's an old,

3469
02:35:28,151 --> 02:35:30,130
but it's like nothing.
It's enough in car.

3470
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:34,150
Maybe people don't believe he's that 
rich and that's why they don't rob him.

3471
02:35:34,450 --> 02:35:38,080
I think he's like the fifth richest 
person in the world or something.

3472
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:39,850
Well,
I think public person.

3473
02:35:40,030 --> 02:35:40,863
I think the real issue is like those 
saudi arabian arab prince dudes don't 

3474
02:35:44,651 --> 02:35:48,100
have to report their income.
I'll make that oil cash son.

3475
02:35:48,210 --> 02:35:50,500
Yeah.
Make that deep oil cash.

3476
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:51,393
Send their kids to New York city.
They're live in fucking five floors of 

3477
02:35:54,401 --> 02:35:55,234
an apartment building.
What was the thing you were telling me 

3478
02:35:57,190 --> 02:35:58,023
before the race?
Before the podcast started about erik 

3479
02:35:59,981 --> 02:36:01,840
prince,
who used to be the head of blackwater.

3480
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:05,020
There's some new store that just broke 
out about the United Arab Emirates.

3481
02:36:05,450 --> 02:36:06,283
Oh,
right.

3482
02:36:06,570 --> 02:36:09,610
I'm arranging some sort of thing when 
they were setting up,

3483
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:10,444
so some,
some back what they call backwater 

3484
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:17,520
communication between trump and a major 
russian official who's got close tieS to

3485
02:36:21,191 --> 02:36:24,190
putin and the black water guy who was 
orchestrating the deal.

3486
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:26,470
It'S in a.
it's in the waShington post right now.

3487
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:30,610
And it's saying it happened on july.
Fake news had happened the first week of

3488
02:36:30,611 --> 02:36:32,380
january,
right before,

3489
02:36:32,381 --> 02:36:34,180
right before he took office.

3490
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:37,443
Yes.

3491
02:36:38,310 --> 02:36:43,250
Back channel in some island.
The specialists islands.

3492
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:44,700
So they met there.
Yeah.

3493
02:36:48,170 --> 02:36:52,070
So who met someone from the 
administration?

3494
02:36:52,100 --> 02:36:53,450
This guy,
Eric Prince.

3495
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:55,610
Right.
Who's the founder of blackwater,

3496
02:36:55,611 --> 02:36:58,700
doeS not get much more evil than that.
Well,

3497
02:36:58,701 --> 02:36:59,534
he had,
they changed the name to something else 

3498
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:05,570
and then he moved to,
I think the United Arab Emirates.

3499
02:37:05,710 --> 02:37:09,350
I was shamed like the security guy for 
the united arab emirateS.

3500
02:37:09,490 --> 02:37:10,880
Uh,
yeah.

3501
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:14,630
they're like essentially have their own 
army of high level mercenaries.

3502
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:20,150
They were meeting and to explore whether
Russia could be persuaded to curtail its

3503
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:23,360
relationship with Iran,
including in Syria.

3504
02:37:23,900 --> 02:37:24,733
I think what happened with the Eric 
Prince guy is that once The arab spring 

3505
02:37:27,891 --> 02:37:31,040
shit started going down,
some of those super rich guys are like,

3506
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:31,933
uh,
yeah,

3507
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:33,650
it's uh,
it's fucking not,

3508
02:37:33,651 --> 02:37:35,300
have this happen over here.
Yeah,

3509
02:37:35,350 --> 02:37:38,390
let's,
let's put together a serious strategy.

3510
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:41,210
And so they went with that guy.
Wow.

3511
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:43,970
So much.
So much money.

3512
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:44,893
Well,
who knows how much money they have that 

3513
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:47,233
someone told me they have trillions,
but I don't know if that is that 

3514
02:37:48,681 --> 02:37:49,514
documented.

3515
02:37:50,630 --> 02:37:51,463
I don't know what's the richest person 
in the world is not like the richest 

3516
02:37:54,861 --> 02:37:55,694
public person,
like the richest public person used to 

3517
02:37:57,111 --> 02:37:59,090
be bill gates and then with some 
mexican,

3518
02:37:59,170 --> 02:38:00,410
a telecom guy.
Yeah,

3519
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,970
I remember that dude.
Yeah.

3520
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:03,710
But it's also,
um,

3521
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,633
it's,
I think the money iS spread out through 

3522
02:38:05,901 --> 02:38:10,630
these royal families and none of the 
money goes to the saudis.

3523
02:38:10,690 --> 02:38:11,160
You know,
the,

3524
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:13,280
the citizens now they don't get any of 
it.

3525
02:38:13,281 --> 02:38:14,114
There's these rural families that have 
fucking hundreds of members and the 

3526
02:38:17,691 --> 02:38:20,000
money all gets filtered throughout the 
family.

3527
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:22,580
Crazy.
And they each have nine kids.

3528
02:38:22,581 --> 02:38:25,760
And what's crazy is that that didn't use
to be the case too.

3529
02:38:25,761 --> 02:38:28,460
Like what the fifties or sixties,
like whenever they establish these,

3530
02:38:28,940 --> 02:38:31,550
these emPires,
is that right kind of money.

3531
02:38:31,551 --> 02:38:32,384
They weren't getting oil out of there.
Once they started getting oil out of 

3532
02:38:34,041 --> 02:38:34,874
there,
they just debt like you ever seen the 

3533
02:38:36,321 --> 02:38:41,321
growth of dubai over the past 30 years?
Like a timelapse images of the growth.

3534
02:38:41,530 --> 02:38:45,320
The islands.
Sandbars make Ireland.

3535
02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:46,183
Yeah.
They make their own islands and they 

3536
02:38:47,631 --> 02:38:50,180
have an ocean break to stop.
The islands were getting swamped,

3537
02:38:50,450 --> 02:38:54,590
but one of the major does a huge high 
rise on one of the islands.

3538
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:59,540
It just sank like five feet into the 
fucking sand.

3539
02:39:00,830 --> 02:39:03,740
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

3540
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:06,890
They built a high rise on sand.
Oh my god.

3541
02:39:07,710 --> 02:39:09,230
Yeah.
I just keep sinking.

3542
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:11,090
It's going to go lease leaning tower 
pieces.

3543
02:39:13,430 --> 02:39:14,870
What do they do?
TaMales.

3544
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:15,713
Shit.
You know they bring girls from the us 

3545
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:19,700
over.
They're hollow from Russia.

3546
02:39:19,730 --> 02:39:21,560
They say you want it from Russia.
but I hear,

3547
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:24,950
I hear stories about us girls to go with
it and get that paper.

3548
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:28,130
They think they're going to go get a 
little a paper going to date.

3549
02:39:28,131 --> 02:39:30,230
One guy.
You're going to date a whole family.

3550
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:32,090
Will you ever heard what the Salt number
nine,

3551
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:36,380
how he used to rock it now?
he used to have a disco in his house and

3552
02:39:36,381 --> 02:39:38,620
he would pay these girls extraordinary 
amounts of money.

3553
02:39:38,630 --> 02:39:39,463
Stay there for months at a time.
He'd have like 50 of them there and he 

3554
02:39:42,561 --> 02:39:44,570
would just come down and go,
you,

3555
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:45,463
let's do it.
And he would just come down the disco 

3556
02:39:47,130 --> 02:39:47,963
just fucking slide down the railing and 
his gold underwear and just start 

3557
02:39:51,081 --> 02:39:51,914
dancing last,
pick one and throw the dick to her and 

3558
02:39:55,341 --> 02:39:57,350
then go,
I'll see you in a week or so.

3559
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:59,870
And then they would just stick around 
and do whatever they had to do.

3560
02:39:59,871 --> 02:40:01,160
They'd go to the gym,
workout,

3561
02:40:01,161 --> 02:40:03,500
get their toes done,
and he'd pick a new one all the time.

3562
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:06,260
Wow.
He just had so much money.

3563
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:08,320
He just.
One prostitute was like,

3564
02:40:08,390 --> 02:40:09,890
he,
that's not good enough.

3565
02:40:09,930 --> 02:40:10,763
Yeah.
I want girls who are not prostitutes to 

3566
02:40:12,111 --> 02:40:13,750
Become prostitutes.
Yeah.

3567
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:19,160
So he just went deep.
What about melania trump?

3568
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:23,250
How dare you?
That's the first landing son of a bitch.

3569
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:24,390
It's equal pay day,
bro.

3570
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:29,320
She's going To have the equal pay.
When she divorced,

3571
02:40:29,470 --> 02:40:31,090
she's waiting to divorce that 
motherfucker.

3572
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:33,810
you know that she doesn't even want to 
live with them.

3573
02:40:33,811 --> 02:40:35,970
She doesn't want to live with him.
Listen,

3574
02:40:35,971 --> 02:40:37,950
our son,
he's only 10.

3575
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:40,370
Can't kick him out of the school.
He's got to stay in the school.

3576
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:42,570
10 year olds can't move.
They can't move.

3577
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:43,433
They can't move to Washington to be near
a dad who grabs women's pussies and 

3578
02:40:46,951 --> 02:40:50,490
admits it or who's the president?
Someone said something really funny.

3579
02:40:50,550 --> 02:40:51,780
I forget who it was.
they said,

3580
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:52,643
is that the first lady or is that a 
flight attendant on the first flight to 

3581
02:40:54,841 --> 02:40:55,674
mars?

3582
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:00,400
Yeah,

3583
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:01,233
she's a.
She's living with a lot of mixed 

3584
02:41:02,921 --> 02:41:03,754
feelings.
Looking a ring that fucking ring could 

3585
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:08,103
lord.
She grew up in a fucking mud town in 

3586
02:41:10,241 --> 02:41:12,730
eastern europe.
To that ring is insane.

3587
02:41:13,330 --> 02:41:15,940
That ring is like,
how much does that ring worth?

3588
02:41:16,360 --> 02:41:17,800
let's,
I guess let's say you guys,

3589
02:41:17,801 --> 02:41:22,801
because I'm sure it's on the internet.
I would say her ring is worth $5,000,000

3590
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:26,230
with 20.
Really $20,000,000.

3591
02:41:27,460 --> 02:41:28,780
Find out.
Find out young.

3592
02:41:28,781 --> 02:41:32,020
Jamie got bold as fuck right there.
I hope you noticed that.

3593
02:41:32,950 --> 02:41:35,080
Alyssa milano calls out.
What is she calling out?

3594
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:38,470
Melania trump's giant diamond rings and 
official portrait.

3595
02:41:38,471 --> 02:41:40,480
Why is he calling out the rings?
What?

3596
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:41,673
C'mon alyssa.
Which she's getting mad at some blood 

3597
02:41:44,201 --> 02:41:45,070
diamonds.
She didn't.

3598
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:48,200
Is that what it is?
Twenty five to $3,000,000 rang.

3599
02:41:48,350 --> 02:41:50,860
I'm so wrong.
What did you pick?

3600
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:54,260
I said five.
It's 25 parents.

3601
02:41:54,310 --> 02:41:57,520
Five carat.
So what is milana?

3602
02:41:58,060 --> 02:42:01,270
What's her problem?
I can handle it.

3603
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:06,420
I heard melania met donald on fuck 
island,

3604
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:08,463
which is one of these islands real.
He had a bring a eastern european women 

3605
02:42:11,891 --> 02:42:15,850
there and then billionaires shell up and
they all just fuck.

3606
02:42:16,530 --> 02:42:17,620
We've got to get richard.
Dude,

3607
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:23,920
you want to go to fuck.
I've got to get an invite.

3608
02:42:23,950 --> 02:42:26,620
If it all goes sour,
we're going to block fuck island.

3609
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:29,100
If it all goes wrong,
your wife leaves you mind.

3610
02:42:29,101 --> 02:42:30,670
Leaves me with like,
look dude,

3611
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:32,150
I'm not getting any younger.
Yeah,

3612
02:42:32,350 --> 02:42:33,490
listen,
who cares what everybody says?

3613
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:36,410
Go fuck island.
Then we start going after awhile.

3614
02:42:36,460 --> 02:42:37,001
It's just like,
dude,

3615
02:42:37,001 --> 02:42:38,890
what are you doing on tuesday?
You want to go to fuck island?

3616
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:40,330
All right.
He'll go to fuck island,

3617
02:42:40,331 --> 02:42:42,150
dude.
We'd be bar backs on fuck islands.

3618
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:45,790
We'd be hoping that they would be able 
to click all we have to.

3619
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:47,470
We worked there.
We get a job there.

3620
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:49,420
I'll carry the ice.
You carry the beer.

3621
02:42:49,570 --> 02:42:51,220
Come on dude.
We're definitely gonna

3622
02:42:51,250 --> 02:42:54,340
duh,
duh.

3623
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:59,000
You and me on fuck island drinking 
miller lite on the beach going.

3624
02:42:59,001 --> 02:43:00,920
We've got to get out of here.
They took our passports though.

3625
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:01,813
Fuck.

3626
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:05,233
We'd be laying down the real dick 
because he's billionaires can't fuck 

3627
02:43:07,830 --> 02:43:08,663
when these.
When would to be getting horny after 

3628
02:43:09,801 --> 02:43:11,980
awhile.
Think so these billionaires are

3629
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,100
on viagra and meth and they're just 
slamming it in.

3630
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:18,730
They probably have helmets on like 
exoskeletons and make them fuck harder.

3631
02:43:18,990 --> 02:43:19,823
Like some sort of an artificial spine 
that connects at the shoulders like a 

3632
02:43:21,821 --> 02:43:26,821
football outfit.
And you hear the hydraulic while they're

3633
02:43:27,881 --> 02:43:32,881
just slamming it in its viagara meth 
fueled dick to get a doctor.

3634
02:43:34,301 --> 02:43:36,160
That's right.
They're taking vitals at all times.

3635
02:43:36,161 --> 02:43:36,994
Like they just have enough viagara so 
their their veins pump up so fat and 

3636
02:43:41,411 --> 02:43:44,500
thick that they almost black out.
It's like a fine line.

3637
02:43:44,501 --> 02:43:45,334
You've got to get them to write to the 
edge whether they're seeing those here 

3638
02:43:48,401 --> 02:43:49,234
we get punched and you see stars.
They see those stars while they're 

3639
02:43:51,071 --> 02:43:52,800
fucking almost going out,
right?

3640
02:43:54,970 --> 02:43:55,803
That's what they're doing and then when 
they come they just throw them oxygen 

3641
02:43:58,181 --> 02:43:59,920
mask on him and rub their feet and they 
come.

3642
02:43:59,930 --> 02:44:04,930
They throw the girl right off the yacht 
here spent.

3643
02:44:06,350 --> 02:44:07,183
She's like a cartridge and they he's on 
the girls were flood because they know 

3644
02:44:12,461 --> 02:44:17,461
it's coming.
They swim to shore.

3645
02:44:17,951 --> 02:44:19,750
They collect their check.
They get on a plane.

3646
02:44:19,751 --> 02:44:21,680
They don't say shit.
They don't say,

3647
02:44:22,410 --> 02:44:25,810
that's just a day.
Clean out the undercarriage and centered

3648
02:44:25,830 --> 02:44:27,970
center.
All of a sudden homegirls go at jaguar,

3649
02:44:27,971 --> 02:44:29,910
convertible,
jaguar,

3650
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:33,910
whatever.
I think it's darker than that.

3651
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,060
I don't think you leave fuck island.
You just stay.

3652
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:41,560
I think as as the guy is fucking 
blasting his last dribble inside of you,

3653
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:45,510
you feel a cold barrel of a handgun on 
the back of your head.

3654
02:44:45,570 --> 02:44:47,950
Jesus.
Now this is barry on fuck island.

3655
02:44:47,951 --> 02:44:50,470
That's it.
I guess if there's countries,

3656
02:44:50,471 --> 02:44:52,800
obviously North Korea,
right?

3657
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:54,490
That guy's killing people left and 
right.

3658
02:44:54,610 --> 02:44:57,370
You can get away with killing people and
certain countries like 100 percent,

3659
02:44:57,850 --> 02:45:01,920
like he killed his half brother.
He killed who did kim jong moon.

3660
02:45:02,010 --> 02:45:02,843
Oh yeah.
He hired someone To do that and they 

3661
02:45:04,421 --> 02:45:05,920
apparently they didn't know they were 
doing it.

3662
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:08,110
apparently they were doing a prank.
They thought they were doing a prank and

3663
02:45:08,111 --> 02:45:10,720
he squirted him with something and it 
turned out to be some neurotoxin.

3664
02:45:11,130 --> 02:45:13,150
Zapped Him and killed him.
But um,

3665
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:16,690
he killed some guy who was a general.
And then he,

3666
02:45:16,750 --> 02:45:17,583
because he thought that it was like his 
uncle that he thought was trying to 

3667
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:21,183
remember that he killed his kids too 
because he didn't want his son's taking 

3668
02:45:24,101 --> 02:45:25,490
revenge.
So he.

3669
02:45:26,010 --> 02:45:27,430
Oh,
that's hard.

3670
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:30,400
So that's going on right now.
If that's going on,

3671
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:33,160
someone could shoot some crazy corrosion
chick on fuck island.

3672
02:45:33,310 --> 02:45:37,580
oh yeah.
So she did a documentary on fuck.

3673
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:40,560
Now that's allegedly,
by the way,

3674
02:45:40,561 --> 02:45:43,260
just in case the president is listening.
I bet he didn't.

3675
02:45:43,380 --> 02:45:45,770
He's an outstanding man.
How do you think he met her?

3676
02:45:45,780 --> 02:45:48,000
Perfect grooming.
He met her onj date.

3677
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:54,430
She swiped right.
Is it right?

3678
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:56,580
Right or left?
Swipe right.

3679
02:45:56,581 --> 02:45:58,080
He swiped right.
Parties.

3680
02:45:58,110 --> 02:45:58,800
Party.
begin.

3681
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:01,500
They met up at a starbucks for a coffee 
date first.

3682
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:04,020
Keep it safe.
Oh,

3683
02:46:04,021 --> 02:46:04,854
see,
she's upset of the kim jong iun offered 

3684
02:46:07,861 --> 02:46:10,000
no trace of him behind down

3685
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,350
to his hair according to sources in 
seoul,

3686
02:46:12,351 --> 02:46:14,240
South Korea.
Whoa.

3687
02:46:14,450 --> 02:46:15,283
The vice minister of the army was 
executed with a mortar round for 

3688
02:46:19,311 --> 02:46:20,144
reportedly drinking and carousing during
the official mourning period for kim 

3689
02:46:23,721 --> 02:46:26,240
jong il's death.
Holy shIt.

3690
02:46:26,270 --> 02:46:31,270
The vice minister of the army,
they shot him with a mortar round.

3691
02:46:31,491 --> 02:46:34,490
This is a different guy.
Holy fuck man.

3692
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:37,820
Tracking and carousing during the 
morning period.

3693
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:39,463
Oh my god.
They use an anti aircraft gun falling 

3694
02:46:41,601 --> 02:46:42,434
the mortar round method.
It seems that kim stepped up his blood 

3695
02:46:44,531 --> 02:46:45,364
lust a bit with his use of an anti 
aircraft gun antiaircraft guns to 

3696
02:46:51,381 --> 02:46:55,910
annihilate his perceived enemies.
He was anti aircraft guns on people.

3697
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:57,560
No shit.
Yeah.
