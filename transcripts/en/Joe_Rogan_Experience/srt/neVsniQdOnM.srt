1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,790
Yeah,
what's up man?

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,000
How you didn't see it?
Like why?

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,230
I have never seen a single,
a silly statement like I could kill a

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,710
wolf
so much fucking night.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,610
The people are so excited about this.
It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen,

6
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:26,230
man.
I can't,

7
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:28,390
I can't call it.
It was just tweet random shit all the

8
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:31,120
time and that just for some reason that
uh,

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,790
everybody had an opinion on it.
That's a weird one,

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,660
man.
It's funny though.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,510
I've seen a lot of people tweet really
ridiculous shit,

12
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:40,780
but I don't think I've ever seen
anything get this much speculation,

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,310
discussion,
debate.

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,470
People are mad at you if have pissed
off.

15
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,990
Like,
fuck you.

16
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,640
You can't,
can't be wolf.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,300
Jesus Christ,
Bro.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,190
Yeah,
it is a weird thing,

19
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:55,510
man.
It's a weird thing.

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,550
The social media today.
It must,

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,900
you know what it's.
I think it is.

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,050
I think you said it at a time where
people were looking for some shit to

23
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:07,051
argue that has nothing to do with trump.
Nothing to do with climate change.

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,261
It's like,
oh,

25
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:13,261
we got something here.
I'm glad I can be that source of a

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,190
distressed containment.
Yeah,

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,820
it does seem like that though,
doesn't it?

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,310
It's like you caught like,
I think it's like peaks and waves

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,430
because if you did this the day nine
slash 11 happened,

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,870
nobody,
nobody would give a shit.

31
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,170
They probably don't.
Uh,

32
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,630
you don't respect it.
Probably be like,

33
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,730
yeah,
exactly,

34
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,200
but can't believe you're doing this on
that day.

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,970
Some people would probably,
if you did it today,

36
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,110
they'd be like,
I can't believe you said that on

37
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:36,130
national woman's day,
Bro.

38
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,110
National Woman's Day.
You to talk about fighting wolf.

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,000
What's wrong with men?
He says,

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,390
what's wrong with patriarchy?
I can't call it man.

41
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:48,340
That's it.
It was interesting though.

42
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,970
My mom called him his sylaria man.
People ain't talking to for years.

43
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,970
I can't be the wolf.
I don't know man.

44
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,160
I don't know.
So do you always just tweet random shit

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,050
man?
Just randomly,

46
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,840
just whatever's on my mind.
I'm pretty active on there.

47
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,010
Was that.
So twitter is supposed to be.

48
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,500
It's a great platform,
man.

49
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,760
It's better.
It's one of the,

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,560
I think is the best social media
platform.

51
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,020
Yeah.
Well it keeps people from Ramblin.

52
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,590
Well it is.
So it's a,

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,050
it's a,
an extended ramble.

54
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,340
Yeah.
Well you can,

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,990
you know,
you can go on those little one,

56
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:20,531
two,
three,

57
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,800
fours where people like to.
Okay.

58
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,740
But what I'm saying is like if you read
people's facebooks,

59
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,870
people get so verbose on facebook.

60
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,200
I can't do it.
I haven't been on facebook for awhile

61
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,260
and the reason why I decided to get off
with my grandma requested me so lucy

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,640
maze.
Shout out to Lucy.

63
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,201
She's like,
Lucy,

64
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,340
major question your friend.
I was like,

65
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,480
I can't,
I can't be on facebook.

66
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,340
Right?
Facebook.

67
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,040
Grandma's not on twitter too.
Not on twitter.

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,840
Know some people that did not in the
public guy.

69
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,720
They don't know what to do with twitter.
Like,

70
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,320
what do I do with this?
Exactly.

71
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,030
One of my boys just got on.
Matter of fact,

72
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,120
he just got a smartphone actually and he
just got

73
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,440
a smartphone.
Don't have to loop man.

74
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,700
And so he.
So he gets on twitter and he's like,

75
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,780
so what do I,
what do I do?

76
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,850
Tweet man said,
well what do I say?

77
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,060
Whatever you want to say,
man.

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,140
It's like,
it's hard to.

79
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,000
I guess it'd be hard to gain a following
from scratch,

80
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,230
like let's,
you know,

81
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,400
a lot of people or you have a platform,
so you gotta say something fucked up and

82
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,980
then someone's gonna retweet that and
then people start following you.

83
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,940
I've seen people do that.
I think that's where,

84
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,790
that's where trolling started.
Oh yeah,

85
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,980
for sure.
Being in an audience and just trying to

86
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,410
Piss people off.
So trolling this word weird.

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,310
It's like I wonder how many.
I wonder who has the most fake accounts.

88
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,400
Like there's gotta be some dude out
there that has like a record number,

89
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,960
like 150 fake accounts.

90
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,410
Just trolls.
People I don't understand.

91
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,850
Like,
well that's because you're a successful

92
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,100
man with an actual life.
It's,

93
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,943
I mean,
that's true.

94
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,670
I appreciate that man.
Says a lot coming from you.

95
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,740
But uh,
I don't know man.

96
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,300
It's just weird,
like your whole,

97
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:55,570
like a Internet existence is just to
piss people off.

98
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,880
I guess it was humans like that in real
life anyway.

99
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,160
So.
Oh the definitely is.

100
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,110
It makes sense.
Yeah,

101
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,650
that definitely is.
But it's a new thing,

102
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,480
you know,
the ability to do it without seeing the

103
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:08,350
person and being in contact with them
physically to be on the other side of

104
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,480
the planet.
Yeah.

105
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,990
Matter of fact,
I saw a documentary you were on that

106
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:16,450
you,
you described it beautifully about how

107
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:20,330
when we first got on the Internet and it
was that aol dial up and everybody just

108
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,370
kind of mumbling around.

109
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,970
Everybody's just kind of bumping into
each other and then slowly finding a way

110
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,670
to interweave it into our existence.
It was a Dopa analogy that you put up.

111
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,260
Well,
we're in a weird stage right now,

112
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,930
or it's gonna suck.
I don't know what it is,

113
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,400
what's coming next.
But whatever's coming next is going to

114
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:41,260
be way more invasive than this.
It's got to be an man probably.

115
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,110
Jamie's got some goofy glasses.
He's got on check these bitches up.

116
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,690
He's got these snapchat glasses,
map check.

117
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,590
They have light bulbs in the eye,
like,

118
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:55,591
look when you're filming as cold,
look at that so you can actually can

119
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,500
actually snapchat from them.

120
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,560
Go to my phone and then I put it up like
I don't have to put all of them up and

121
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,650
it's not going on.
Wow.

122
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,020
This,
see,

123
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,200
this is just stage one.
Eventually it's going to be live all the

124
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,370
time.
Contacts.

125
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,690
Right.
Put it in context.

126
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,370
That'd be cold.
That's definitely gonna happen.

127
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,220
It's definitely gonna happen now.
When you,

128
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,760
when you said that shit about wolves,
how serious were you?

129
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,740
We have serious fucking around.
Well it's had fucking around,

130
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,920
but it's like when you started thinking
about it and breaking it down,

131
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,450
I really,
I felt like I can't,

132
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,600
but everybody thinks I'm talking about
lay everybody,

133
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,770
especially on twitter,
like they're posting these big ass

134
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,770
wolves with 200 pound plus wolves.
I'm like,

135
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,260
all right,
listen.

136
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,930
Like those are rare.
Right?

137
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,540
Right.
I'm not the biggest human on earth.

138
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,060
And you go get me a picture of the
biggest wolf.

139
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,520
You can find some fair.
It's not fair.

140
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:52,270
Right?
So Google average wolf size and I feel

141
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,770
like if it was,
you know,

142
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,860
my life was dependent on it.
Like you have to think like that.

143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,220
Right?
If you want it to a wolf

144
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,270
and he's threatening you and you'd like,
I can't get him,

145
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:03,230
but you did so well.
I feel like if you had something on you,

146
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,590
you'd have more of a chance.
I would have sort a knife or something.

147
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,510
I feel like I wouldn't be in the woods
without something.

148
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,980
But wolves.
Van,

149
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,340
do you know how hard they bite?
Yeah,

150
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,740
no,
I've done research.

151
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,370
I've done a little research.
Um,

152
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,040
I think it's like 1200,
five times stronger than a pit bull.

153
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,320
Right?
I think it's 2,500.

154
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,960
I think it's 2,500 pounds per square
inch.

155
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,490
See if he could find.
I was looking yesterday.

156
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,460
Yeah,
I think it up a mastiff was stronger

157
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,690
than a wolf,
which is weird.

158
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,820
It wasn't,
it wasn't even top five.

159
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,550
Fucking dog alligators and crocodiles
were stronger than that.

160
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,280
A gorilla was stronger.
The grills bites from you.

161
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,680
Wow.
I would've never imagined herbalism.

162
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,930
Yeah.
They're eating Broccoli and shit.

163
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,730
Strong branches.
Well,

164
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:50,150
they just have to fight other gorillas
for pussy because they have a one inch

165
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:53,300
Dick and they control a bunch of chicks.
I have to have a good bite.

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,140
How do you know that they have it?
Is that I know a lot of shit about girls

167
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,290
was a little tiny segment.
Well,

168
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,700
it's about uh,
whether or not the females are

169
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,920
promiscuous.
See when,

170
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,720
uh,
when you look at like it's,

171
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,090
it's,
it's actually a truth with humans too.

172
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,370
But testicular size and Dick size is
directly correlated to the amount of

173
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:15,500
promiscuous females around.
Really?

174
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,360
Yeah.
So if you're around a bunch of hoes,

175
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,120
your balls get bigger.
That's interesting.

176
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,330
What is the evolutionary advantage?
Like?

177
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,163
Well,
you got to,

178
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,180
you got a sling as much dick as you can
because these bitches are just running

179
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:29,960
around with every button.

180
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,860
I don't.
National Women's Day,

181
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:31,521
Bro.
No,

182
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,750
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

183
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,010
So sorry.
You're right.

184
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,020
I apologize.
So thoughtless of me.

185
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,230
But that's,
that's why chimps have big dicks and

186
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:40,630
chimps have giant balls.
Ever.

187
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:42,280
See Chimp balls?
Never seen a chimp chipboard.

188
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,480
Pull up some chip balls.
There's a

189
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,610
picture of this hairless chip who sit in
there and he has balls to just kick it

190
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:56,090
back to juicy,
right?

191
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,120
Payers like to Georgia peaches.
So he goes balls.

192
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,231
Wow.
Good.

193
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,200
Assize is fucking balls.
So like he's so big.

194
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,180
He's so jacked.
That's what chimps look like when you

195
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:08,870
take the hair off of them as crazy.
And that's the only 150 pounds.

196
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,570
So they have a shave.
This chimp?

197
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,840
No,
he has mange.

198
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,430
Okay.
See all his hands.

199
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,750
Like he's got the skin condition over
his hands and shit.

200
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,600
The animals a lot about.
Well here's what need even crazier one.

201
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,710
Pull up this picture.
Jamie.

202
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,840
Direct correlation between testicle size
and brain size and chimps versus humans.

203
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,520
Yeah.
See that's a human.

204
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,750
That's a chimp brain on the,
on the top and a chimp ball on the

205
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,790
bottom.
And what's the correlation?

206
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,190
Well,
they have giant balls and little brains.

207
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,820
If our balls were as big as our brains,
we would have a fucking serious problem.

208
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,180
First of all,
we wouldn't be able to walk that.

209
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,780
We would have to figure out some sort of
a harness.

210
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,280
I feel like my boss will be bigger
though

211
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,010
balls would be really in chimps than not
know that'd be a bigger than they are

212
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,310
now.
If what if we had smaller brains?

213
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,840
Yeah,
probably.

214
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,430
Yeah,
probably.

215
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,130
I guess.
Yeah.

216
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,470
What they think is that went with
chimps,

217
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,720
especially because chimps are seriously
promiscuous,

218
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,280
like there's no monogamy and the chimp
world.

219
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,020
Good for challenges.

220
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,810
Fuck everybody.
Good for getting it everywhere.

221
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,590
We still holding on barely.
We say,

222
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,370
well hold it on,
but it's like 50 percent divorce rate is

223
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,090
high man.
Yeah.

224
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,840
Which means 50 percent divorce rate and
out of the people that are not divorced,

225
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,620
how many of those people are living in
fucking abject misery?

226
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,480
Just constantly being beaten down by
life and not,

227
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,150
not being happy.
I sent old.

228
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,720
Uh,
it's an old customer for sure.

229
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,100
It's definitely an old customer.
There's an old quote from thoreau that

230
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:46,560
most men live lives of quiet
desperation.

231
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,140
That's really my favorite is a Chris
Rock.

232
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,651
He said,
uh,

233
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,720
he said a man is only as faithful as his
options.

234
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,750
Yeah,
that's a good quote to the,

235
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,010
uh,
the chimp thing though.

236
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,340
What's interesting about it is that
gorillas have figured out a way to hold

237
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:05,280
it down.
Like gorillas keep all those women like

238
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,840
faithful,
all female.

239
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,130
So he's a polygamous gorillas.
Okay,

240
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,310
well he has a bunch of women.
He has a Harem,

241
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,400
but the women don't fuck around with any
other males other than him.

242
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,520
So He's got this little dick ass and not
big balls either.

243
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,630
Gorillas are Mormons.
I didn't know.

244
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,740
Just giant,
you know.

245
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:25,170
So they're giant and they have giant
muscles,

246
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,310
giant faces,
giant jaws.

247
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,700
And they could kill other gorillas,
you know,

248
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:31,440
by biting them and tearing them apart
and shit.

249
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:35,100
But that's the only thing they use their
mouse for interested in branches and

250
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,350
Shit and leaves.
I don't know why,

251
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:41,160
uh,
they need that strong jodie fight off

252
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:43,950
all the other gorillas but a strong,
super strong.

253
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,640
But so other grills,
I'm always interested in the,

254
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,260
the,
like the evolutionary reason as to why

255
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:50,750
things are the way they are.
Yeah,

256
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,900
it's fast.
And so it's like,

257
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,600
it's their first instinct to bite,
you know what I mean?

258
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,770
Cause ours,
ours isn't.

259
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,050
I think they show their teeth more than
they bite,

260
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,370
you know,
they show the teeth,

261
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,990
they beat on each other.
Intimidation.

262
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,910
Yeah.
Because I've seen videos of gorillas

263
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,210
beating the shit out of each other.
This.

264
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,400
Oh yeah.
This is one recently,

265
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:08,190
right?
This is one at the zoo.

266
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,320
These two girls go at it.
It's like food bags.

267
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,590
Yeah.
And a big gorilla was like about 500

268
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,080
pounds.
Right.

269
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,730
And a big one of these dudes just start
circling each other.

270
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,620
But this is just because they're
assholes.

271
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,900
Whoever built this gym,
you're not supposed to have two

272
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,120
silverbacks together.
Yeah.

273
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,010
So most of what they're doing is just
like,

274
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,870
it's all for me to go to zoos anyway,
man.

275
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,050
It's depressing.
It's a prison,

276
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,630
you know,
it's not depressing.

277
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,570
Note,
I always say this,

278
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,210
the giraffe cage,
those drafts don't get seen me.

279
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,310
Give a fuck was just so chill.
I used to.

280
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,550
I had had a bit about it.
And when you need to go so slow,

281
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
but they don't.
There's no one's eating them.

282
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:46,170
They're happy.
That's all they want to do is just eat

283
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,580
and chill.
I did see a wild lines get after one

284
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:50,640
once.
Oh,

285
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,180
in real life.
You know the,

286
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,590
on the Internet.
I'll tell you one safari or something.

287
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,453
Nah,
hell no.

288
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,160
I went on safari and they saw,
they saw some lines out.

289
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,530
I think it got a Gimsburg or something
like that,

290
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:05,890
but they said it was crazy.
And so the female lions chase after this

291
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,810
thing and then they were there right
when it took it down.

292
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,840
That's crazy nature of scary place,
man.

293
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,850
Yeah,
that's why I'm surprised you think you

294
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:13,810
could take a wolf.
Well,

295
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,970
I'm not,
I'm not out here trying to hunt.

296
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,840
Well,
I'm just saying in the event if I catch

297
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,560
you avid,
like you look at like a grey wolf,

298
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,320
right?
They're small compared to me.

299
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,320
Well they just shot one of was 182
pounds in Minnesota.

300
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,161
She,
that was a bit.

301
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,600
Yeah,
everybody gave me that picture.

302
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,240
Sizable fucking bear.
That's something that was a big,

303
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,880
big wolf.
So if like that's on this side of the

304
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,440
spectrum.
If you go towards the middle.

305
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,790
So what do you think?
Like what size?

306
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,590
Like 100 pounds.
You can fuck up 100 pound thing.

307
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,210
So yeah,
that's dude man.

308
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,910
You know you can take some damage,
right?

309
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,450
Like you're gonna I'm not going to come
out like superman.

310
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:47,380
I got,
you know,

311
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,930
it's gonna hurt.
It's definitely gonna hurt.

312
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,100
Yeah.
I mean I might not.

313
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,600
I might bleed out afterwards.
Who knows?

314
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,610
But.
But you think you win overall.

315
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,810
You got to do,
what do you buy?

316
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:59,040
Like 2:30 or something.
So he sends me up over here.

317
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,460
Used to seeing dudes.
They're not going to make weight

318
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,970
70 going to be a problem.
Yeah.

319
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,420
Nah,
I don't know.

320
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,220
You see how you UFC or MMA fan.
Right?

321
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:16,840
So like how,
how,

322
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,900
how hard can humans.
Humans could kick pretty hard.

323
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:24,250
But the thing is all I gotta do is catch
them one on the bottom and all that.

324
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,270
I really don't think I could break a
wolf's job with my kid.

325
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,210
I don't think so.
It's crazy to think their body gives

326
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,460
better than ours does.
Like the thing about people,

327
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:36,280
one of the things about people getting
hit is that people resist.

328
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,590
They tighten up.
And that's true.

329
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,270
That's one of the reasons why people get
so hurt.

330
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,800
Ever seen.
The dude doesn't know how to fight.

331
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,950
They get stiff and
cracked and they wanted to hurt bad,

332
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,510
but as someone who's like loose and
relaxed,

333
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,640
I don't think a wolf is going to be
worried about you kicking him,

334
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,420
but that's what I'm saying.

335
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,720
So I'm also an athlete,
right?

336
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,930
So I have a different perspective of.
I've been in combat before that with the

337
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,340
wolves,
but I've been in combat before.

338
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,020
Fell out and it's basically combat,
right?

339
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,360
Definitely.
But,

340
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,640
uh,
I understand that you have to,

341
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,720
you have to,
you have to be as a,

342
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,960
as loose with your body as possible.
That's how you exert more energy,

343
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,480
more efficient energy here than,
than tensing up.

344
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:21,481
So all that's in my head and plus I know
what the wolf is thinking for the most

345
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:23,740
part.
I'm going to put up a video of a wolf

346
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:26,080
right now.
I'm going to put it up on a regular wolf

347
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,780
though.
Well,

348
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,040
this is just a video that someone got
recently at some dude found.

349
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,430
I'm going to put it up right now.
Check it out,

350
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:34,370
Jeremy.
Oh,

351
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,280
it's posted.
It's going to take like three seconds

352
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,700
for it to go up,
but it's a video that someone just sent

353
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:43,060
me and I watched it and I was like,
what the fuck?

354
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,240
It was a guy on a road and he saw this
wolf.

355
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,280
Um,
and you could see like,

356
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,550
the headlights are on this wolf,
this Wolf Lake.

357
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,500
Just checking them out on the road.
I'm terrified of wolves,

358
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,970
man.
I'm not saying I'm not scared.

359
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,150
I'm just saying,
oh,

360
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:03,410
I mean in a life or death situation.
Watch this.

361
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,260
Look at.
This is a Shitty fucking TV.

362
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,630
When is this guy coming to fix this?
To speed tomorrow.

363
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:09,740
Friday.
Thank God.

364
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,930
Look at that as a big as well.
Looking at him,

365
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,823
checking you out.

366
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,040
But how bold is this wolf?
And it's coming near headlight.

367
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,560
So odds are he probably got his pack
waiting though.

368
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,180
Oh yeah,
the pack somewhere.

369
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,030
Unless he got kicked out,
he might have got kicked him.

370
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:30,060
It looks like an older wolf.
He's got scars all over him.

371
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,700
You know,
he might be injured too.

372
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,400
I don't think he's injured.
I think he probably just got fucked up

373
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,860
by one of the other walls and they just
realized,

374
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:38,680
all right,
I'm going to find my own.

375
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,850
It was a scary man.
I'm with you.

376
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,550
I'm pleased you think you can kill one?
I do.

377
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,751
I says,
Dude,

378
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,700
man,
I think I killed coyote.

379
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,130
Coyote.
Yeah,

380
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,960
but I might be wrong.
I don't think you're wrong.

381
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:51,794
Well,
now,

382
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,180
coyotes,
foxes,

383
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,410
foxes.
Easy.

384
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,910
Fuck y'all.
Fuck a fox up.

385
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,753
Set it up.

386
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,853
Exactly.

387
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,470
It's interesting.
It's interesting to me how much,

388
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,770
um,
people have an opinion on wolves,

389
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,360
like all of a sudden these wolf experts
come at it.

390
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,870
Oh yeah.
No worries.

391
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,390
I get,
I think you kinda are though,

392
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:11,940
right?
Well,

393
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,900
I know definitely not a wolf expert,
but I know a lot about them.

394
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,710
You know what man I did.
Um,

395
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,890
I was on a Sitcom once and we had a
chimp on the set and it was a baby

396
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:23,040
chimp,
like a two year old chimp and it had

397
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,130
diapers on.
It was like a little baby and it climbed

398
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,650
it.
But I'm bad.

399
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,150
My back just slapped me a couple of
times on the back just to play.

400
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,880
It was just plan and I was shocked.
I was like,

401
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:36,720
how fucking hard this baby just hit me.
This is crazy.

402
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,600
And I grabbed his little body,
you know,

403
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,680
and he was being friendly.
It wasn't being mean or anything,

404
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,160
but I grabbed his little body and it
doesn't feel anything like a person like

405
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,900
you grew up with.
Even a strong person.

406
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,300
Like there's a little give to their
arms.

407
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:51,360
She looked even though like a fucking
power lifter dude like the mountain from

408
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:52,194
game of thrones.

409
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,650
I'm sure if that dude was just resting,
if you grabbed his arm,

410
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:59,760
this is a little bit of give to them
with chimps that like courted steel man.

411
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,080
There's,
it does not.

412
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:04,500
That's why a 150 pound chip is a strong
as a 500 pound man.

413
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,390
It feels like you're grabbing this
table.

414
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,300
Like literally.
Like it was confusing to me and then I

415
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,110
was thinking in my head like I just have
it in my head that that thing is like,

416
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:15,960
I would scale it down like okay,
but person was that big,

417
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,680
a person wouldn't be this strong,
but then when you touch it you realize

418
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,240
that is not composed at the same shit a
person

419
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,160
and do other things though.
Right?

420
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.
Like you know,

421
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,790
they,
they swing around on trees and those,

422
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,200
those muscles develop.
You know what I'm saying?

423
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,230
So can't,
you can't compare a human size chimp?

424
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,700
No you can't.
No you can't.

425
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,690
That's why when you see that hairless
one and you see how jack has a different

426
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,440
and plus they got thumb.
So it's like they,

427
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,790
it's different.
So how big a chimp you think,

428
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,380
fuck,
I don't think I could fucking champ up

429
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,220
man.
Keep Champs.

430
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,620
Maybe the one that you

431
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,760
fucked me up.
Like he didn't know it.

432
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,240
I'm,
I'm not.

433
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,390
I don't know.
I'm pretty realistic.

434
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,670
Then we say what?
You're pretty realistic then.

435
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,220
Yeah.
So you think in like a kick to the face.

436
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,760
That's the opening move with the wolf.
Got To be God to be and he don't know

437
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,370
what's coming.
He doesn't go was coming,

438
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,830
but he's going to leap towards your
throat and I'm going to leap towards

439
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:12,630
your job.
I feel like you got to have that

440
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:17,010
mentality and somebody sent me.
Somebody sent me an article to write in

441
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,090
Russia.
Some woman,

442
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,250
uh,
survived the wolf attacked and killed

443
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,350
the wolf.
Yeah.

444
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,720
Yes you do that.
I'm not,

445
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,420
I,
I didn't read past she see.

446
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:27,090
But that goes back to the whole chimp
thing because the Russians are built

447
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,150
different than regular white people.
I feel you.

448
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm gonna ask you are an athlete.

449
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,770
But it's true.
I just feel like saying,

450
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,810
I just feel like if you,
if,

451
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,320
if you come in with the mentality of I
got to beat this wolf.

452
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:41,154
Look,
there you go.

453
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,310
I will access it to death.
Come on man.

454
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,390
Shit.
Look at her.

455
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,320
Wow.
You probably have to be 56.

456
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,700
She's probably drunk from Dagestan.
Well those Dagestan people are hard as

457
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,830
fuck.
That's where Habib never got my office

458
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,930
from a bunch of a tough fighters from
Dagestan.

459
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,950
Dagestan's filled with just straight
killers.

460
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,990
Like we have to information man,
like right on him than anything.

461
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,650
Jesus Christ.
What does that human ken doll up in the

462
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:09,870
upper right hand corner can't breathe
properly,

463
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:12,990
do to plastic surgery.
Oh Jesus Christ.

464
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,790
Look at that guy's face.
What the fuck man?

465
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,180
What doctor did that?
They should find out.

466
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:24,090
What doctor did that as a dude that.
I guess it's a dude.

467
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,880
It seems like a not real thing.
It seems like physically.

468
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,870
Oh,
the help of plastic surgery.

469
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,910
Don't,
don't even.

470
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:36,390
I don't want to hear this talk.
What the fuck is that?

471
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,480
That's a.
that's the world we live in today,

472
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,980
man.
The thing you'd have going for you is

473
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,720
that a wolf doesn't really want to fight
to the death.

474
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,060
They just want to kill you.
Exactly.

475
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,600
They want to kill you.
If they can't kill you,

476
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,470
they might be like,
oh,

477
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,270
problem.
Because Fuck Outta here.

478
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,950
They said that about like mountain
lions.

479
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,260
I don't want to see them.
I need them.

480
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:54,520
I don't want to say one either.
But if you get attacked,

481
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:57,290
you're supposed to fight back.
I heard a because um,

482
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,120
my girl right now,
she from the northwest area and we went

483
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:03,900
on this little hike once and so she told
me while we were there,

484
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,550
it's like,
oh they have mountain lions.

485
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,970
They had little packets on how to deal
with if you see a mountain.

486
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:10,230
And I'm like,
if you'd have told me that there was

487
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:11,760
mountain lions here,
I will not have king.

488
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,540
But anyway,
so I'm reading the pamphlet and they say

489
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:20,350
if you get big they usually like they
get it back off their kids here.

490
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,600
Throw your arms up in the area.
Yeah.

491
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,260
They say if you have a kid with you,
you supposed to pick your kid up and

492
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:26,500
hold it over your head.
Man.

493
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,570
I'm not sure about that.
Yeah.

494
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:33,240
I don't know.
But people have killed mountain lions

495
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,710
before with knives and shit.
If you have a knife and get attack by,

496
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,470
it's possible.
Man,

497
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,090
that's all I'm saying.
Is this possible?

498
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,730
Well you definitely definitely have to
fight.

499
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,590
You don't want a wolf to just eat.
And if he had that mentality dog,

500
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,760
you just have to like mentality.

501
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,790
He has to be.
Because like you,

502
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,420
I'm an athlete,
so I come from like the mode of like

503
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
it's either hit or be hit,
kill or be killed,

504
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,270
like people out here trying to break my
bone.

505
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:00,400
So like you have to have kind of a
psychotic mentality.

506
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,240
Well you definitely do to play nfl.
Yeah.

507
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,070
Just no doubt about that.
I mean when you're staring down a team

508
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:09,220
of super athletes and you're just going
to collide with each other and try to

509
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:12,850
get across lines and just a totally
different way of living.

510
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,370
Your life's weird man.
That 99 percent of the world.

511
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,190
I tell people that like I've had 14
surgeries in my career.

512
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,850
It's just crazy.
Like it's normal to me.

513
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:24,340
And it's been one of the people that
play in the league like after the

514
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,660
season,
like usually everybody gets a Sergio of

515
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,960
something that that's been.

516
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,320
What have you had done?
I've had a meniscus several times.

517
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:34,620
I've had Achilles back,
uh,

518
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,100
my pinky,
my shoulder actually played,

519
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,780
um,
uh,

520
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,590
all of my 2000,
10 season with a broken collarbone.

521
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,030
Jesus did that game three and it's still
broke.

522
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,210
You can still feel it,
but with a broken collarbone.

523
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,970
Yeah.
How'd you do that mind over matter man?

524
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,690
Is it like.
Because.

525
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,490
Because at that time I was,
I went undrafted,

526
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,570
right?
So um,

527
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,220
I had just got my shot to start and it
was game three and I was having a really

528
00:21:57,221 --> 00:22:01,540
good season and um,
it was either like if in the NFL,

529
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,300
if you're not already paid,
like your,

530
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:06,010
your,
your position is up for grabs.

531
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,110
And so it's either,
either you,

532
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,600
you push through it or somebody's gonna
take your spot.

533
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,250
And so at that,
that was my,

534
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,630
that was my,
that was my time to shine.

535
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,463
So I was like,
Shh,

536
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,410
painkillers man.
So could you feel it moving around?

537
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,920
It was weird.
How had to protect it.

538
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,320
My brother in law has like a metal piece
there.

539
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,850
He lost his and BMX accident.
They put like a titanium rod.

540
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,000
I think I need that man.
Cause like right now it's dipped in.

541
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:32,380
You can feel it.
It's like dipped in.

542
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,040
Did you ever like get it looked at a na
[inaudible] cause I didn't want them to

543
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,770
know I was hurt.
And so because they bring that,

544
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,710
they bring that shit up,
like during when you're negotiating your

545
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:41,321
contract.
I was like,

546
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:42,520
Oh,
well he missed this because he was

547
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:44,590
hurting and they bring that,
they use it as leverage against you.

548
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,910
And so 2012 was when I signed my
contract the day after I was like,

549
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,280
I just want to let y'all know I broke my
collarbone two years ago and was like,

550
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:51,910
no way.

551
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,840
I was a kid.
I was like,

552
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:53,580
no way.
So I was like,

553
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,413
get an x,
y.

554
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,600
and so we got an extra.
I was like,

555
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:56,890
Holy Shit,
you did.

556
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,460
I would be impressed.
I believe that's the guy I want on my

557
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:01,294
team.
Dude.

558
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,880
Played with a broken collarbone.
It's bittersweet.

559
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,540
Right?
So like,

560
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,550
as soon as you tell them that that's
what happened,

561
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,301
then it's like,
oh,

562
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,930
well he gets injured.
Like it's a,

563
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,440
it's a weird word.
What is human?

564
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,210
Who the fuck doesn't get injured playing
in the NFL?

565
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,880
I mean,
you would think that's a rational way to

566
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:16,571
go about it.
You know,

567
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,760
anybody who's played pro football didn't
get injured.

568
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,800
I mean,
how's it impossible?

569
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,980
I don't feel like it's possible,
I haven't seen anybody.

570
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,160
I watched the super bowl and one of the
things I was thinking it was like,

571
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,100
okay,
you're watching all these dudes run and

572
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:32,650
collide with each other and watching all
these tackles.

573
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:35,710
And like I was trying to stockpile.
I was like,

574
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,220
in my head I was like,
how many injuries in my watch in here?

575
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,190
Like,
you know,

576
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,490
because a lot of times dudes will walk
off and then later that night they be

577
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:43,241
like,
Oh man,

578
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:45,110
my fucking back is killing me.
Right.

579
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,040
It's the word.

580
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,650
And then you get it diagnosed and
there's some sort of a bulging disc or

581
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,390
something.

582
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,270
The problem I had because most of my
issues that,

583
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,180
that kept me off the field with like
soft tissue injuries,

584
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:56,560
which you can't.
I can't run with,

585
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,220
uh,
with my hamstring won't get.

586
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,570
But like all the rest of my stuff.
Um,

587
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,870
my problem became like my pain,
my tolerance for pain,

588
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,040
my threshold.
It became so high that like,

589
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,950
I don't even know what hurt and what was
normal anymore.

590
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:10,690
So like,
I'm still kind of dealing with a lot of

591
00:24:10,691 --> 00:24:13,990
those aches and pains and stuff now,
but it's like you just push through it

592
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,140
because the pain was normal and you just
get accustomed to it.

593
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,831
Yeah.
You just.

594
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,200
Pain becomes a part of life.
Wow.

595
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,240
Yeah.
Did you always know that,

596
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:23,540
like when you were,
when you,

597
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,260
I'm sure you played in high school and
you played college,

598
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,610
did you always know that this was
eventually going to lead to like a point

599
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:32,320
where your body just wasn't gonna be
able to do it anymore?

600
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,690
I mean,
did you think about that

601
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,520
you set,
you say that,

602
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,413
right?
Um,

603
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,040
and people tell you about it,
but you know,

604
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:42,270
they say ignorance is bliss.
Like you don't know it's,

605
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,350
it's,
it actually affects you until it

606
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:46,270
actually affects you.
And so like,

607
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,430
you're like one of the worst games I've
ever been a part of what we were paying

608
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Chicago and 2012 I thing and it was
raining so they just run into the whole

609
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:59,470
game and the next day I woke up like I'm
limping,

610
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,670
like walking towards the bathroom,
like I couldn't.

611
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,180
It took me about five minutes in my
bathroom is like right there,

612
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:05,410
so I took like five minutes and I was
like,

613
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:06,130
literally,
like limping.

614
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,270
It was,
my body was just beat up most of

615
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,160
painkillers as well from the game and
like when you go,

616
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:13,900
when you're going through it,
you don't really realize it,

617
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:15,940
but like towards the end of my career,
um,

618
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:17,710
that's,
that's kind of why I decided to walk

619
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:18,930
away because I was like,
is,

620
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,350
is it worth it anymore?

621
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,880
You know what I'm saying?
I'm relatively healthy.

622
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:22,930
I could walk,
I could walk,

623
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,093
you know,
um,

624
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,530
who knows what I've done to my brain,
you know,

625
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:28,630
that,
that the onset of that comes on years

626
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,810
later,
but after awhile it was just,

627
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,350
it just stopped being worth it to me
anymore.

628
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,570
And plus I kind of just fell out of love
with it.

629
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,380
That's a weird place to be right now.
When you,

630
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:40,630
when you're saying like you don't know
what's going on with your brain,

631
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,360
do you notice anything now?
I'm not.

632
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,720
Nothing that I haven't.
No.

633
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,660
I mean I've definitely had concussions
before and,

634
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:52,060
and earlier on,
like the cte stuff kind of,

635
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:55,490
um,
that was like the product 2000,

636
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,540
1314 is when the science really started
in the news media really started talking

637
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:04,360
about it,
but growing up like it was kind of just

638
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:06,940
caught a dinger like he's got done and
what I'm saying you got dinged and no

639
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,340
one worried about the consequences and
so we didn't really know.

640
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,240
And so it was just,
it was just part of part of it.

641
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,120
I've definitely had concussions before
where you're like,

642
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,420
not really sure where you are,
but like somehow your subconscious knows

643
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,430
what to do when you play.
Wow,

644
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,010
that's weird man.
So you're out of it because you've got

645
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:26,510
cracked and you just kind of gone
through the game anyway.

646
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,210
Keep playing.
Do you remember it afterwards?

647
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,550
A parts parts that happens.
A lot of fighters,

648
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,470
like they'll get dropped in the first
round,

649
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,200
right.
And then there'll be on their corner and

650
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:40,780
the like the fourth round headed into
the fifth and they'll think it's the

651
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:42,880
second round two.
And then the coach go,

652
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:45,210
hey you,
you fought three more rounds and you

653
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:45,961
think he did.
They're like,

654
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:46,890
what?
Yeah,

655
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,690
it's crazy the second round,
right?

656
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,090
Like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

657
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,270
It's,
it's amazing to me that people are able

658
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:58,170
to function on such a high level,
not really conscious of what's going on.

659
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,460
That's got to be your training,
right?

660
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,560
Yes.
That's all training is you're training

661
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:05,310
your body to become second nature.
So now when you were in high school and

662
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:08,220
you were in college,
was there any talk at all about brain

663
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,070
damage?
Was there any talk about cte or the.

664
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,470
Not really.
Nobody worried about it now.

665
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,360
It was just not,
it wasn't.

666
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,450
The science wasn't complete.
I'm pretty sure there were,

667
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,020
there were neuroscientist saying like,
your brain damage is real,

668
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,800
but the science wasn't as definitive as
it is now,

669
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,800
but no one connected it the way they did
with boxing.

670
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,810
Uh,
not to us.

671
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,150
And to me,
um,

672
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,730
you know,
like,

673
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,500
like now people are,
are worrisome about putting the kids in

674
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,990
youth leagues and stuff like that.
And they're even talking about not

675
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,690
letting youth leagues happen.
I'll have tackle football at all,

676
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,670
which I'm an advocate for it.
I don't think there's a,

677
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,830
there's no point for it.
I'm like,

678
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,440
my kid,
my son did not gonna play football.

679
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,363
No,
no.

680
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,810
Wow.
That's crazy.

681
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,250
But you,
you made it my body.

682
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:56,700
So,
so they could have a free ride or

683
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,900
whatever they want to do,
man.

684
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,600
What if they want to play football?
I'm going to say sit down,

685
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,070
man.
You gotta trust my man.

686
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,353
Relax.

687
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,450
They want to be their own man.
You know,

688
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,020
I can't.
I'm not going to physically stop him.

689
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,251
I mean,
I probably could,

690
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,680
but um,
I would,

691
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,160
I would,
I would,

692
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,130
I would seriously sit them down and let
them know the consequences,

693
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,660
showing people and show them the risk
factors involved.

694
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:24,990
Like it is not worth it.
I know you want to enter and I mean,

695
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,020
as much as,
as,

696
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,200
as a son wants to walk into his father's
shoes,

697
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,030
uh,
it's just not worth it,

698
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,290
man.
It's really nice and you're probably not

699
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,840
going to be as good.
That's just how.

700
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,590
What if you kid wanting to fight like a,
like box?

701
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,080
Yeah.
Box or boxer.

702
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,900
I wouldn't advocate that either.
He wouldn't let them do that.

703
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,150
I'm pushing them to go towards like a
education.

704
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,360
I want them to be scientists.
Like if I had to do it over again,

705
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:49,620
I wouldn't never played football.

706
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,491
I really,
yeah,

707
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:51,420
it'd be a scientist.
Not even.

708
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:54,420
You would start from the beginning,
like if you could go back to college and

709
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,410
knowing what you know now,
wow.

710
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,860
Not even close and just because of the
damage to your body will that.

711
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,640
And uh,
so it's,

712
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,270
it's a weird,
it's a weird thing.

713
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,104
So like,
you're,

714
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,010
you're in your prime physically as a,
as a man,

715
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:13,410
but you're,
you're in your infancy mentally.

716
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,290
Right?
Right.

717
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,460
And so like I'm just now figuring out
who I am and what kind of man I want to

718
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:18,294
be.
And,

719
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,730
and you're,
you're,

720
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,620
while you're in your prime,
that's when you're in the public eye.

721
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:24,950
So you have to deal with all of that on
top of figures.

722
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:27,570
So you're figuring out who you are in a
fishbowl.

723
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,100
And it's,
it's a really weird,

724
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,110
really weird thing.
So I don't even want to deal like,

725
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,880
like any kind of recommendation or any
kind of

726
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,180
fame or whatever people want to call it.
Like I don't,

727
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,440
I don't like it,
I don't want it.

728
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,220
I feel like the best to me,
the best,

729
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:48,100
uh,
society would be a artist and a

730
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,310
scientist.
That would be a ideal society to me.

731
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,500
Wow.
That's an interesting take on things.

732
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,290
Considering how successful you've been
playing football,

733
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,010
playing football obviously was very
financially rewarding to you.

734
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,190
Made you famous for sure.
I mean if just some regular dude went on

735
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,450
twitter and start talking about I can
take a wolf farmer.

736
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,400
I know that he killed.
Nobody will care and be like,

737
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,660
shut up stupid that anybody cares
anyway,

738
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:13,960
but it's
fucking my twitter.

739
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,810
But I said you were coming to school and
was going to kill.

740
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,853
I don't know man.

741
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,400
It's,
it's a,

742
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:30,740
it's a weird.
I'm like,

743
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,600
once you get to that,
to that financial summit that um,

744
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,630
everybody strives for that American
dream.

745
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:39,140
You realize that there is no there and
if you ain't happy with $10,

746
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:40,790
you're not going to be happy with a
million.

747
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,010
It's just not happening.
Now,

748
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:45,020
granted,
there are some things that you need,

749
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,900
you need monetary
value in the society to,

750
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,980
to a certain extent.
I think they did a study.

751
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:56,750
It's like after $75,000 a year,
money can't buy happiness like so

752
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,760
everything else out there is kind of,
it's just luxury and really if you put

753
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:02,630
it in perspective,
I think like 35 percent.

754
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,730
I mean if,
if you,

755
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,570
if you,
if you make $35,000 a year,

756
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,340
you're in the top one percent of wealth
in the world.

757
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,720
Yeah.
Something like that.

758
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:12,020
So it's all about perspective man.
And once,

759
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,943
once,
once I.

760
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,480
It took me to get to that financial
summit to understand that unfortunately.

761
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:20,810
But the weird thing about it is once you
tell people that and you're on top of

762
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:23,360
this financial summit,
he's for you to say,

763
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:24,194
I'm like,
all right,

764
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,500
of course.
Yeah.

765
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,990
Yeah.
Easy for you to know.

766
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:29,840
A lot of miserable millionaires.
I do too.

767
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,550
It's really interesting that you said
that like growing up and figuring out

768
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:39,470
who you are while you're in a fishbowl
and you were also involved in not just

769
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,910
you,
not just in a fishbowl,

770
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,790
you're involved in like this competitive
fishbowl where you're,

771
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:44,960
you're,
you're,

772
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,640
your value is being judged by your
ability to cover distance and speed,

773
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,570
but your ability to score points or it
stopped people from scoring points.

774
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,040
That's kind of crazy too.

775
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,990
It's,
um,

776
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,400
football is not a place for a like
thinkers and I'm not,

777
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,830
I'm not saying that I'm the only person
that has these thoughts,

778
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:06,260
but it's like if you,
if you like questioning authority and

779
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:08,570
you're questioning a lot of things,
like football is not the place for you

780
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:10,790
because if,
if you're inquisitive at all,

781
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:15,260
it's kind of comes off as arrogant and
it comes off as I'm like disruptive.

782
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,080
And I never was.
I was,

783
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,430
I was always just like,
why do we do things this way?

784
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:20,241
Like why,
why?

785
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,250
Like especially like in college,
right?

786
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:25,820
So like football has this like weird,
um,

787
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,090
relationship with coach to player that
like you can talk to other men,

788
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:34,520
like you can treat them like shit.
So the coach,

789
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,520
the coach can yell at the player you
piece of Shit,

790
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:39,680
you're not doing it right.
But if I use,

791
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,100
if he was working at home depot and your
boss comes to upc shit,

792
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,210
you didn't stock that,
buys the,

793
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,380
it'd be like you'd be calling hr rather
saying basis or weird for some reason in

794
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:50,030
that arena.
It's okay.

795
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,680
And like I was like,
listen man,

796
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,680
if you want me to do something,
like I used to tell my coach was like,

797
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,670
don't yell at me.
Like there's no reason for you yet

798
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,600
because like one on one I could,
you know what I mean.

799
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,310
Easier than a wall.
Yeah.

800
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,383
Man

801
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,760
didn't make any sense to me.
Like why,

802
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,160
why on this field is it okay.
But as soon as we walk out to the field

803
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,090
you want,
you wouldn't,

804
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,410
you wouldn't dare yelled at me like
that.

805
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,900
Why is that okay?
And plus you got a hot head coming out

806
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,530
of high school.
Um,

807
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,750
I mean I was,
at least in a lot of us are because I

808
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,120
mean,
you usually come from those

809
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,153
neighborhoods were,

810
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,840
do you think that's just because they
have to control these big groups of

811
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:26,380
super athletes so they have to kind of
posture and like yelling at him,

812
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,840
like you would yell at like a guard dog
or something like that.

813
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
His cattle,
right?

814
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,530
So you just have to,
you just have to.

815
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,780
It was just that same old mechanism of
fear,

816
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:34,560
right?
So people,

817
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,350
people ruled by fear.
So you wrote the biggest stick.

818
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,130
So that,
that's,

819
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,560
that's how,
that's how humans have done it for

820
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,670
centuries.
That's how they get into your head about

821
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,560
who this leverage of you.
I have fear,

822
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:48,090
I have your scholarship,
I have this,

823
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:49,710
I have this.
If you don't do what I say,

824
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,950
all that gets taken away and it works.
But for me it did it.

825
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:53,784
And I was like,
I don't,

826
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,620
I'm in because of that.
You're,

827
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,110
you're labeled as like a trouble there.
Yeah,

828
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:02,970
like I was part of the reason why I
didn't get drafted.

829
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:05,730
I found out like the coaches said that,
um,

830
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,820
I was,
I was,

831
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,290
I wasn't coachable.
I was like,

832
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,173
Nah,

833
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,070
like getting yelled at.
Wow,

834
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,860
that's bizarre.
It's seen that before.

835
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:19,730
I've seen coaches screaming at athletes
that could kill them and you don't see

836
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:20,361
that in others.
What,

837
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:25,361
you definitely don't see that in mma,
mma also like the coach relationship

838
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:28,760
with the fighters,
like a father son relationship and a lot

839
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:31,880
of ways they're like brothers or at the
very least family,

840
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,860
you know,
that's like an intense bond.

841
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,420
I'm not saying every coach is like that,
but it's,

842
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,361
it's,
it's a,

843
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:40,220
it's definitely a culture.
Yeah,

844
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,910
it's definitely a coach.
Do you think that's changing and like

845
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,160
with this whole kaepernick thing and
people are sort of aware of people being

846
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:51,161
more socially conscious,
more aware of people using their,

847
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,520
their,
uh,

848
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,070
their fame for a platform to voice their
voice,

849
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:57,170
their opinions on certain social issues.
Is,

850
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,220
is that changing?

851
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,440
He has to because um,
well social media is just changing

852
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,220
everything.
It's changing the way we think.

853
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:09,080
It's changing the way situations are
monitored because it's like a,

854
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:10,710
there's a camera with you everywhere.
So,

855
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,600
um,
but I think,

856
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,281
uh,
in a,

857
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:14,490
in a,
in a bigger sense,

858
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,240
um,
athletes in general are becoming more

859
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,970
outspoken.
Athletes are becoming a more well

860
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:22,420
versed,
um,

861
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,100
they're really understanding their brand
power and with that,

862
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,370
uh,
you have to change the way things have

863
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:31,230
been,
things that have been done in the past,

864
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,680
like,
like a simple stuff like training camp,

865
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,800
training camp used to be two days full
pads and you're hitting at a time,

866
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,980
you can't do that anymore because the
athletes are getting bigger,

867
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:41,701
stronger,
faster.

868
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:45,270
So if you want your catalog last long,
but you got to take care of them when

869
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,760
you're practicing cattles that just talk
like that.

870
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:49,400
So it disturbs the truth though.
No,

871
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,180
it is.
That's why it's disturbing.

872
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,900
We get compensated heavily in the NFL or
the NCAA.

873
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,910
Is this a whole nother conversation?
Those,

874
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,450
those crooks don't pay their employees,
but as far as the NFL,

875
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,950
you get compensated and you,
you know,

876
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,590
the risks for the most part,
you know,

877
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:08,880
the risks going into the NFL.
Like I chose to do this as a at a young

878
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:09,480
age.

879
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,030
I'm glad you just said that.
Those crooks don't pay their employees.

880
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:14,580
Get out as a dark and dirty fucking
business.

881
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,410
College sports hate it.
I hate it.

882
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
I hate it now.
I don't have anything to do with it,

883
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:19,800
but I watch it.
I'm like,

884
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,560
that's cool.
When you find out how much those fucking

885
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,470
schools get from all those people in
order to make sure that their team is

886
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:27,630
successful because the alma maters wanna
Yay.

887
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,390
We fucking won again,
and they did.

888
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,850
They get billions of dollars.
There are fucking huge,

889
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,340
huge business man.
It's the athletes don't get paid

890
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,540
anything.
Nah,

891
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:37,374
man.

892
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,840
I've told many many times I've told my
side of that story,

893
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:42,520
man,
I don't.

894
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:43,700
I'm not a fan of the NCA.

895
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,010
I don't.
I'm not a fan either.

896
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,830
I think it's stealing.
I think you're stealing from those

897
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:52,080
athletes and ruining their careers.
Most likely for you.

898
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,550
If you do four hard years of college
football,

899
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:57,280
what are the odds you're going to get
out of that without a permanent injury?

900
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,550
I had,
I think three or four of my surgeries

901
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,260
came from college.
Yeah.

902
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,800
It's playing for free.
You pay for and my buddy,

903
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,150
hey,
you get an education.

904
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,710
And See,
that's the thing that kills me when

905
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:12,440
people say that,
to say that I hate that.

906
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,490
So when I first went to school I wanted
to study astronomy.

907
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,630
Like that was what I wanted to study.
So I went to my academic advisor and I

908
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:20,111
was like,
okay,

909
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:22,240
this is what I want to do.
Like it took me a year to figure out,

910
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:22,961
okay,
this is what I do.

911
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:24,360
I was,
I was in love with the stars in the

912
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,151
college.
That's one of the,

913
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:27,820
I just wanted to know about it and,
and as soon as I said,

914
00:37:27,821 --> 00:37:28,121
he's like,
oh,

915
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:28,901
you can't do that.
I was like,

916
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:29,680
why?
He's like,

917
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,650
because the,
those classes conflict with the practice

918
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,210
schedules in the meeting schedules.
And I was like,

919
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,460
well shit.
And so I had to wait another year in

920
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:40,180
order to find what I wanted to do and
ended up settling for a philosophy,

921
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:42,520
which was a cool major.
But it wasn't,

922
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,820
it didn't.
I felt like if,

923
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,540
if,
if I would've got influenced by,

924
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,810
by,
uh,

925
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,980
astronomy early on,
then it would have changed my trajectory

926
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:53,350
would have changed the way I thought
about a lot or I'd arrived to the

927
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,060
conclusion that I met now a lot sooner.

928
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,231
Yeah.
The,

929
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,510
the whole.
You're getting an education thing.

930
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,060
What are you getting a real education?
Yeah.

931
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,710
Hell No.
Hell no,

932
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,390
no,
it's about,

933
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,100
it's about a month,
maybe a month or three weeks after the

934
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:13,010
season before you go into spring ball,
which is like,

935
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,420
you're up at five in the morning lifting
and running and Yada Yada Yada.

936
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,290
Um,
but there was like a three,

937
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,510
three week period where they,
they leave you alone and you're just

938
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:23,690
like a regular student.
And I did not know what to do with my

939
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:24,530
time.
I'm like,

940
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:25,520
how,
how are these,

941
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,770
how are these people not ace in their
classes?

942
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,990
Like I didn't understand like how.
I mean,

943
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:34,040
granted they were taking courses but
it's just like you have so much time.

944
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,190
I didn't know what to do with my time
because it before.

945
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,500
Whereas before I'm up early in the
morning,

946
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,730
lifting weights,
running,

947
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,550
then go into class,
then after class get a little lunch,

948
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,160
then go to another class.
Then you come back in,

949
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:46,600
you're in meetings and after meetings
you go to practice and after practice

950
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,380
you get find some kind of energy study
yet.

951
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,820
Well give me a rundown.
So like what time of morning would you

952
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,310
get up?
So when you were in school?

953
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,620
Usually.
Usually I had some of the most.

954
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,180
Most of my classes were the 8:00
classes,

955
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,120
so 8:00 AM you're up now?
I up before that.

956
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,830
So,
so independent on the day.

957
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:06,430
So you have to get a workout in
depending on everybody.

958
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,520
Every strength coach has a different
protocol so you have to lift at least

959
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,240
three times a week.
Three,

960
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,950
three to two to three times a week.
And so you either lift before class or

961
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:17,320
before practice or after practice.
So you have to,

962
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,590
you have to find your time with after
practice you got to be hard,

963
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,890
right?
You're,

964
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,631
yeah.
Really.

965
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,420
Then you're just kinda going through the
motion so.

966
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,010
But do you,
do you want to do it before practice

967
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:28,960
because then you might be tired when you
go into practice,

968
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:30,940
you might not perform up to the best of
your abilities.

969
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,830
Uh,
I,

970
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,540
I was,
I was not the best at that.

971
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,870
I used to get in trouble a lot because I
was like,

972
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,020
there's no way you guys can expect me to
do all of this shit.

973
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,020
I used to get in trouble for skipping
weights

974
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,750
and I wasn't big on weight to anyway.
I'm like,

975
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:46,870
I was like,
I didn't see that because we had a lot

976
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:49,300
of Olympic weight lifting and that's
kind of changing too.

977
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:51,760
We had a lot of like dead lifts and
squats and shit like that.

978
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,320
And I was never a fan of that stuff.
I was like,

979
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:57,310
this is not a conducive to being
successful.

980
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,600
What do you think is Plyo,
Plyo?

981
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,600
Uh,
like yoga,

982
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,120
Yoga,
Yoga would real.

983
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,390
Yeah.
If we had a yoga,

984
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:05,760
I'd have been there every time because
it's like you're,

985
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,640
you're getting loose.
Any kind of you being limber is more

986
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,020
important to me and strong in my
opinion,

987
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,010
especially in my position.

988
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,480
And my position,
I mean that's something,

989
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,440
there are some positions like d linemen
and office alignment where you gotta you

990
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:20,050
gotTa Push,
but I'm not one of those because I

991
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,780
wasn't one of those positions.
Being a running back as like dbs

992
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:24,500
receivers,
like stay limber,

993
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,510
stay hydrated with good nutrition.
So for you it's more important to be

994
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:32,830
flexible and to be able to move your
body in very fluid ways.

995
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,370
So to be able to avoid take downs,
they will avoid somebody trying to

996
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,570
tackle you,
you,

997
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,360
you,
you more pliable is better in my

998
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:41,194
opinion.
Yeah.

999
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,420
That's interesting.
That's an interesting way of looking at

1000
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:44,830
it.
So you would uh,

1001
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:46,750
they would force you to do certain
amount of lifts.

1002
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,400
Yeah.
You got to do a certain amount of lifts

1003
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:51,100
and then you got to go to class and you
got to stay up and then when you're

1004
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,010
doing these lifts,
so they supervised or you have to do

1005
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,280
coaches in there.

1006
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,360
So that's another thing that bothers me
too.

1007
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:01,330
I was like a rebel man because it's like
they will follow you around the weight

1008
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:02,070
room.
Right?

1009
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,720
Because some guys liked to like,
you know,

1010
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,240
try to try to jerk the system and I'm
like,

1011
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,830
like,
this is what I want to do with my life.

1012
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,810
Like I'm not going to cheat myself.
Like stop following me around.

1013
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,920
Right.
It wasn't long.

1014
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:12,760
Yeah,
it was like a weird.

1015
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,660
And then they have class checkers that
follow you make sure you go to class

1016
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,090
class.
It's just like,

1017
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,830
Bro,
like I just feel like a little kid,

1018
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,960
man.
I get out of my face.

1019
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:23,440
And so like after a while that just wore
on me and like the whole system wore on

1020
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,900
me and on top of that,
like I'm hungry.

1021
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,580
You know what I'm saying?
You don't get the food out.

1022
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,390
People get on me again.
People from Tennessee hate me bro.

1023
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,140
It's weird.
But I'm from Tennessee.

1024
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,830
Why?
As I went to,

1025
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:36,920
I went to and for some reason,
anytime I say anything about the NCAA,

1026
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,090
they think I'm talking about tenancy
itself because weird.

1027
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,710
They're like,
fuck you man.

1028
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,980
Like I,
I still have people like to this day,

1029
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:47,780
matter of fact,
yesterday a mom mentioned something

1030
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:48,614
about,
um,

1031
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,990
like fumbles.
I had from like 10 years ago.

1032
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,160
It's weird man.
People will.

1033
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:56,660
Awkward Man.
Well people love to bring up things that

1034
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:58,790
you've done wrong.
When I was like 18 years old.

1035
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,680
I love it.
Love it.

1036
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,720
It's funny man.
It is funny.

1037
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,200
So you would get up in the morning and
you would have to figure out when

1038
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:08,360
you're.
So would you schedule your lifts and

1039
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,790
it's not a,
it's not necessarily schedule is more

1040
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,800
like a um,
whatever suits your schedule the best.

1041
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:19,820
So if you have an 8:00 class,
you get to go before class or whenever

1042
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:22,250
your break is during.
How many classes are you doing today?

1043
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,770
Like two or three.
And what?

1044
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:27,620
You're supposed to keep a certain GPA.
Two point five.

1045
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,320
So you have to keep up to par.
What is that?

1046
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:32,530
Like a c average and just like see,
see averages.

1047
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,170
So you would go to your class,
you do whatever you gotta do.

1048
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:39,080
And then how many times a day are you
practicing?

1049
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,930
A once a day.
Once you have meetings,

1050
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,410
meetings are like an hour 30 and the
meetings are essential or going over

1051
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:47,540
strategy and go here.
You get your playbook,

1052
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:51,230
your game plan,
watch film on the other team or

1053
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:54,230
yourself.
Is it hard to motivate yourself watching

1054
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:55,250
all that shit?
Yeah,

1055
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:58,190
after awhile for me because like um,
my quarterbacks are different.

1056
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,890
They don't have to um,
exert as much physical energy as we do

1057
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,410
and they're,
they're more on a mental game so they

1058
00:43:06,411 --> 00:43:10,370
have to know the defensive games that
the defensive coordinators playing.

1059
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,050
Right.
So what covers then wider,

1060
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,600
what the safety is doing.
Don't have to know that as a running

1061
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:17,720
back you kind of have to know,
but I'm not as much.

1062
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,060
You kind of just have to know where
their blitzes are coming from.

1063
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,163
Oh boy.
With the,

1064
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,220
with the intricacy,
but

1065
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,420
after awhile I got it.
I didn't need to watch much film in

1066
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:29,000
order me to get my assignment done.
So a lot of times I'm just sitting there

1067
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,650
wasting time.
Like I feel like that too.

1068
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,990
Yeah,
I would imagine sitting there watching

1069
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,620
some stupid place.
I always told my coaches,

1070
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:37,670
especially in the league,
I was like,

1071
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,940
you could give me my game plan like
Saturday before the game and I'll

1072
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,290
execute it like I didn't need.
I think a lot of what they do and the

1073
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:51,110
NFL is just reinforcement.
It's just over and over and it's

1074
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,400
repetition,
repetition,

1075
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,590
and after a while,
especially if you're a veteran,

1076
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,300
I get on there.

1077
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,800
That's why Brett Farve,
like when he was deciding on whether to

1078
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,900
come back or not,
it was like I,

1079
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,850
I would love to,
but all that other shit.

1080
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:05,330
I don't like doing all that.
The meetings and that kept him back

1081
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,201
here.
Man.

1082
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:09,980
He really just gets old.
It gets super old man and you don't know

1083
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,030
what you're doing and you and you will,
uh,

1084
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,620
uh,
well versed in your craft.

1085
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,030
Don't you don't need half of that shit.
And this is terrible for the younger

1086
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:21,560
cats that are listening to this man was
something about a guy like Brett farve

1087
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,330
too,
with all that fucking gray hair or

1088
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,580
grizzled old veteran.
He's a goat milk still wanting to do it.

1089
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,940
Go crazy.
Right?

1090
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,920
It's just crazy.
They still wanted to do it.

1091
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,430
I mean,
how many times I've been deemed as was

1092
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,670
saying,
I don't know,

1093
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,880
get hit a lot though.
Like,

1094
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,100
like get enough.
You know,

1095
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:44,700
Jim Mcmahon is all fucked up now.
I mean most ex players are.

1096
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,150
Yeah.
Most experts are.

1097
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,470
I was reading that sports illustrated
article about Mcmahon and they did an

1098
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:53,430
interview on one of those sports radio
stations.

1099
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:56,260
I was listening to it.
It was disturbing and it was talking

1100
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,450
about it.
He'll be like somewhere and you just

1101
00:44:58,451 --> 00:45:00,930
totally forgot how he got there,
where he's going,

1102
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,440
why,
why don't have my keys in my hand?

1103
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:03,950
Where am I going?
Yeah,

1104
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,440
I mean part,
it's part of the unfortunate part of the

1105
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,420
prizes.
So they would follow you around.

1106
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,130
They'd make sure you go to classes.
Like what?

1107
00:45:12,131 --> 00:45:13,120
Some dude with a clipboard.

1108
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,710
Yes.
Extra foster.

1109
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,240
Some ga.
Now they will say anything though,

1110
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,520
right?
Does anyone say anything?

1111
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:20,220
So like they would,
they would send them and they would

1112
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:23,830
check and see if you're in there and if
you're not in there they report back to

1113
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,120
coach and like,
oh he missed on.

1114
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:26,470
So.
ANd then you gotta go up to the coaches.

1115
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:26,891
I was like,
well,

1116
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:27,790
why weren't you?
I'm like,

1117
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,480
the crazy shit is in college.
That's where you kind of learn how to

1118
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:34,690
time management as that's where you
learn your time management as,

1119
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:35,590
as an adult,
right?

1120
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,440
So they don't even allow you to become
an adult.

1121
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,020
How most adults become adult in that
college system.

1122
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,410
So like some teachers,
some professors will give you a syllabus

1123
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:45,620
and say,
here's,

1124
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,960
here's,
here's going to be the work for it and

1125
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:49,240
show up when you want to show up,
but you're responsible for your own

1126
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:51,250
information at the end of the day.
For the most part,

1127
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,510
we don't even get that,
uh,

1128
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,320
that,
that luxury you have to go every single

1129
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:56,620
day,
every,

1130
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,311
every,
every class.

1131
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:58,780
And I'm like,
not even,

1132
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,790
students aren't even required.
Why am I required?

1133
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,780
Yeah.
You could study at home.

1134
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,230
You want it to maybe even learn more.
And that was really good.

1135
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,240
Beginning of like online,
like syllabus is online stuff.

1136
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:14,140
So like I'm not sure if maybe maybe
colleges have adjusted that to that

1137
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:15,340
nowadays.
But from when I was,

1138
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,440
when I was going,
they,

1139
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,350
they,
they made,

1140
00:46:17,351 --> 00:46:18,880
it was mandated you have to go to every
class.

1141
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,990
Well it seems like you're preparing for
a career in professional sports,

1142
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,160
but you're also pretending that you're
getting like a real education,

1143
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,410
like a regular person.
Yeah.

1144
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,800
But it is kind of pretending because
there's not a way you could be preparing

1145
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:39,260
for like high level college athletics
and have the same time to devote towards

1146
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,260
studies.
Nah,

1147
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,950
you can't.
Yeah.

1148
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,500
And that's why like that's why I say I
would,

1149
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,880
I would do it again if I,
if I had to do it again,

1150
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,070
I would do something else.
He just wouldn't go football at all

1151
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,440
because I'm like the shit that keeps you
up at night now it's not football.

1152
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,850
And that's how I knew I was tying to get
out.

1153
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:56,010
Like I'm sitting on the sidelines and
I'm thinking about other shit.

1154
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:00,810
Like what kind of show a physics like
really up at nightmare.

1155
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,670
It keeps me up at night.
What kind of physics?

1156
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,080
Theoretical physics.
So what got me into it was relativity.

1157
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:08,430
That's what,
that's what hookeD me,

1158
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:14,090
like einstein equals mc squared.
What kind of just fascinated by the

1159
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:15,470
concept of it.
Uh,

1160
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:18,090
it's,
I don't know how anybody isn't man,

1161
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,240
like it's the whole store really.
So you still.

1162
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,580
So relativity brought me in and how it
happened was one day I was,

1163
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:29,620
I was actually hired man,
so I was smoking weed crazy here and it

1164
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:33,640
kinda hit me because like you,
you hear about what einstein did but you

1165
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:36,250
don't really understand it because I
mean unless it sparks interest.

1166
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:38,290
Right?
And So I was just sitting there watching

1167
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:43,000
the documentary and he proved how a
light bends,

1168
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,950
right?
So like gravity,

1169
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,380
gravity bends light and it just kinda
hit me.

1170
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:48,430
I was like,
that shit is crazy.

1171
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:50,740
So I just started digging more and more
and more.

1172
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,360
And you researched,
uh,

1173
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,490
the beginnings of when we started a
research enlightened,

1174
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,170
the first place,
like newton figured out that like breaks

1175
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:02,770
and it's just the whole entire science
history of,

1176
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,400
of that,
that aspect of light gravity is just

1177
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,600
blew me away.
And I just,

1178
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,430
I just got hooked.

1179
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,830
Neil degrasse tyson was here two weeks
ago and fuck my head up.

1180
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,660
My head has been broken ever since.
He said that if you go one g like out

1181
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:16,770
into space,
like you say,

1182
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:20,820
if you are on a like a rocket,
it shoots one g out in space.

1183
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:25,200
If it continues to go at one g,
that same force because there's no air

1184
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:27,990
and space,
the momentum of that because most of the

1185
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:31,140
time what they do with the rockets
cutoff and then you just move forward on

1186
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:34,260
the momentum because you're in a vacuum,
you just flying through space.

1187
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,680
But if you continue to propel at one g
you will reach like just under the speed

1188
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:44,160
of light.
So if you like,

1189
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:46,320
if you go into somewhere that's five
light years away,

1190
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,710
it would take one year more.
So instead of five years it will take

1191
00:48:49,711 --> 00:48:50,544
you six years.

1192
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,710
So it's 10 light years away.
It'll take you 11 years.

1193
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,140
So it's a year under the speed of light.
I was like,

1194
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:59,010
what in the fuck
light.

1195
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,890
It's crazy how fast light moves and you
can get that fast almost as fast as the

1196
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:07,740
speed of light by just going one.
Gee,

1197
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:10,710
I didn't know that.
That's been fucking with me for two

1198
00:49:10,711 --> 00:49:12,180
weeks.
I've been just,

1199
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,850
I'll sometimes get up in the morning and
I'll just trying to,

1200
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,930
trying to think of how fast that is.
She's crazy.

1201
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,560
Like if you were watched someone whiz by
you,

1202
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,400
you wouldn't even be able to be able to
see it.

1203
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,990
Yeah,
it would be too fast for you to see it.

1204
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,180
And that's a person in a tube.

1205
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,120
alright.
And then you started digging into the

1206
00:49:30,121 --> 00:49:33,520
relativity about that he's going to be
aging slower than you.

1207
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,200
Yes,
he's moving faster.

1208
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,690
That's really crazy.
So that shit shit like that keeps me up

1209
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:40,030
at night man.
And so like I wish like I'm to the point

1210
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:44,780
now where like I've done enough reading
about it like an in and unless I start

1211
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,810
learning the math of it,
like I've,

1212
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:48,140
I've reached my limit of,
of,

1213
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,440
of what to know about physics.
Are you thinking about doing that?

1214
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,240
Yeah,
I'm probably gonna get back in school.

1215
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,940
Wow.
What have you become like some fucking

1216
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,070
certain scientists that'd be dope,
man.

1217
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,260
Go down there and work on the large
hadron collider or some shit to me that

1218
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:02,470
that's more um,
I mean I guess any,

1219
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:06,730
any kind of a goal that you set as a
seven year old and obtain is you should

1220
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:09,990
be super proud of,
but like my conscious tells me he's

1221
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,950
like,
you haven't given anything to the

1222
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:14,380
society and that's just the way my brain
thinks.

1223
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,230
And so it's like,
unless I do something like that,

1224
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,720
like I just,
I just feel like I've been bumping

1225
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:20,860
around on the.
How old are you now?

1226
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,990
30.
Will you still got plenty of room?

1227
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,003
Yeah,
for sure.

1228
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,690
I'll be,
I'll be coming late in the game,

1229
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:27,460
but um,
yeah,

1230
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,070
yeah.
But you're

1231
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,490
coming into the game with a lot of life
experience,

1232
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,620
like at an intense level that most
people just couldn't ever even

1233
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:36,320
comprehend I show.
You know what I mean?

1234
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:40,640
There's gotta be some sort of enhanced
perspective from playing football at the

1235
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:43,190
highest level in the world.
I mean there's,

1236
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,640
there's gotta be something too that
you're playing in the nfl,

1237
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,810
the just the,
just the amount of intensity and just

1238
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,550
the problem solving that you're having
to deal with on the field and just the

1239
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,330
overcoming the physical injuries,
that mental strength did you have to

1240
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:03,170
have to deal with the kind of pain that
you've had to experience that alone,

1241
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:03,921
all that stuff.
I mean,

1242
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:06,590
all that stuff.
It might not seem like it applies,

1243
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:08,690
but I feel like everything applies.
I think every,

1244
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,310
everything,
every book you read,

1245
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:13,760
every relationship you're in,
every friendship you have,

1246
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,220
everything that you see,
the changes,

1247
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,830
the way you look at life,
all those things sort of added layers to

1248
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:21,560
your existence.
Not appreciate the pep talk,

1249
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:26,561
man.
it would be crazy if you became some

1250
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:29,320
crazy huge physicist.
esther,

1251
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,230
esther,
esther.

1252
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,700
That was a goal of my man is to,
is to definitely

1253
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,430
bachelor's.
What's completely possible now for sure.

1254
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,460
Bachelor'S as possible and phd is
possible too if you really want to work

1255
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:39,880
towards it.

1256
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,810
YeAh,
it's a,

1257
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,390
it's a long agregious process.
But,

1258
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,060
um,
I think I'm up for a minute.

1259
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,710
I just want to do a little more relaxing
because I just retired.

1260
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:48,544
And what

1261
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,220
november and what caused you to retire?
Like physically?

1262
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,153
Are you okay or.

1263
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:52,471
Yeah,
I'm,

1264
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:54,560
I'm okay.
Physically it was just a little bit of

1265
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:56,270
both.
So I had a couple of nagging injuries

1266
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,970
and I also saw him sitting on the
sidelines and my,

1267
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,760
I'm just not into it.
I,

1268
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,750
I remember vividly thinking like,
I don't care at all who wins this game?

1269
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,640
I don't care man.
And like,

1270
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,480
and so like that's why

1271
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,970
I love,
I love Adam Gates.

1272
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:13,530
He's the,
he's the head coach of the miami

1273
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:15,840
dolphins and um,
uh,

1274
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,180
they,
the whole organization in miami,

1275
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:20,280
like they,
they let me bow out gracefully.

1276
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:22,230
They respected what I did in nfl and
they were like,

1277
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:22,681
listen,
like,

1278
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,570
you know,
you do how you want to do it and we're

1279
00:52:24,571 --> 00:52:28,020
not gonna make it hard for you because
some organizations can be a dick about

1280
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:29,850
it.
Like they could take money from you,

1281
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:33,480
they could do all kinds of shit.
But they were really good about the

1282
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:37,170
process and It was because I guess it's
the way I explained it to him,

1283
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:37,890
I was like,
man,

1284
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:42,450
I feel like they have a good team.
And I felt like if I'm sitting here just

1285
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:45,420
holding on for a check,
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting

1286
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:47,370
my time.
And so there is no,

1287
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,960
there's no reason for me to be here
anymore because of my heart just isn't

1288
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:51,630
in it anymore.
I appreciate what the game did for

1289
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:52,650
myself,
my family,

1290
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:55,000
and it's kept me driven for 30 years
minute,

1291
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,130
but it was just time ago.

1292
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,780
That's a very balanced perspective for a
lot of people.

1293
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:00,790
The big paychecks are harder to walk
away from,

1294
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,830
of course,
of course,

1295
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,030
but you have the point of view.
You have the enough perspective,

1296
00:53:07,031 --> 00:53:09,670
enough objective perspective,
look outside of it and go,

1297
00:53:09,671 --> 00:53:11,650
this is not,
is not where I want to be.

1298
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,400
And uh,
it was,

1299
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:14,161
uh,
it was a weird,

1300
00:53:14,161 --> 00:53:16,240
a parting too because I,
I,

1301
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,690
it's all I've known since I was seven
years old every,

1302
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,890
every fall,
like,

1303
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,720
and for one before.
And even before that,

1304
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,970
getting ready for football,
it's just all I've known,

1305
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,930
it's been,
it's been my.

1306
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:25,990
And

1307
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,850
um,
I just got to the point where it's just

1308
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:32,730
a whole big world out there and I just
need to,

1309
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,980
I need to feed off that.
That's,

1310
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,550
that's very confident of you too.
That's what's really powerful about that

1311
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,240
is that you realize that you're kind of
starting from scratch,

1312
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,230
obviously not because you're financially
successful and you've got some stuff

1313
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:49,860
going on,
but you're entering into a completely

1314
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:52,830
different world now as far as like the
potential of your future.

1315
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,690
Right.
And it's,

1316
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,930
you got to like,
I've always been a humble cat man.

1317
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:00,690
I'm like,
I never thought that I was any bigger or

1318
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:02,730
better than like,
none of that shit ever mad at me because

1319
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,850
I always,
I would be in the middle of a game man

1320
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:07,110
and think like,
this is weird.

1321
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,830
People just watching this play a game
like this shit is so it's like 100,000

1322
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,360
people and you're like,
this is so awkward to me.

1323
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:15,570
But I've always kept that perspective.
Like I didn't think anything of it

1324
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,350
because I didn't think anything of it
and it was just a game at the end of the

1325
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,183
day.
And so,

1326
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,770
um,
I don't know man,

1327
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:23,220
if the future is,
is,

1328
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:24,720
is,
it's wide open now.

1329
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:25,620
And I,
like I said,

1330
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,270
extremely,

1331
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,540
uh,
appreciative of everything that the game

1332
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,210
has brought me though.
Now when you were in college that the

1333
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:37,260
big thing in college football is always
like the players getting paid off.

1334
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,710
They're getting money,
you know,

1335
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,460
they're getting like any of that shit
ever happened with you.

1336
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,660
Yeah.
[inaudible] uh,

1337
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,440
uh,
caused a big stir awhile back because I

1338
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,303
made it that,
um,

1339
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,093
and this is a weird

1340
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,800
thing too,
is like,

1341
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,610
so players were mad at me for saying
that.

1342
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,031
I was like,
why?

1343
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:58,460
Why would you say that you fuckIng it up
for the younger cats.

1344
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,980
And um,
so like once y'all realize that these

1345
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:05,150
rules at the nca made or stupid and it,
all it takes is for everybody to stand

1346
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:08,600
up and say this is stupid.
Like they'll go away that their own

1347
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:10,550
separate entity.
Nobody answers,

1348
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,770
like they don't answer to anybody,
they don't own,

1349
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:18,100
they're just the ncaa and they have
contracts with the television stations

1350
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,630
and so that's what's,
that's what's keeping them in play.

1351
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,730
The millions of dollars.
Billions.

1352
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,721
So if,
so,

1353
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:24,554
if,
if,

1354
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:28,180
if the athletes finally wake up and say
like,

1355
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,870
my dad had a great idea.
So say all the top recruits stopped

1356
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:33,380
going to the big schools,
right?

1357
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:36,290
So they stopped,
started going to place like grambling or

1358
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,000
what are some,
some,

1359
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,330
some of the smaller schools,
right?

1360
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,110
Uh,
that would take away the ncaas leverage

1361
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,910
and then you can start paying the
players.

1362
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:47,630
And I'm not saying that they should get
a salary like the nfl.

1363
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:50,000
I don't know.
Those semantics can be worked out when

1364
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:53,480
the time comes.
All I'm saying is the ncaa is,

1365
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:57,050
they're there,
they're holding everybody hostage by a

1366
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:01,580
system that was put in place in the 19
thirties or twenties or something like

1367
00:56:01,581 --> 00:56:05,600
that when the big business of college
football wasn't even close to what it is

1368
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:06,760
now.
Right?

1369
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,720
Yeah.
So the sponsorships and all of that

1370
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:10,880
stuff,
it wasn't even near what it is now.

1371
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:15,190
You have the tostitos fiesta bowl,
you have to know is sugar bowl.

1372
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,320
These are companies that are paying
millions of dollars in order to have

1373
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,610
them play under that,

1374
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,110
under that guise.
What seems to me like that.

1375
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,980
What colleges almost like a farm

1376
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,230
team,
if they don't want to call it that.

1377
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,370
Yeah,
you're,

1378
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,270
you're pretending that these are
students and the kinds of students,

1379
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,420
I mean that you make them sit in class
and you make them get a c.

1380
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,960
There are,
there are cats that play that are going

1381
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:39,100
to go pro in something that has sports,
that's for sure.

1382
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,550
Do you think that it would be okay if
they did it the way they're doing it

1383
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:45,430
now,
but they pay the athletes and they make

1384
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:48,200
school and option that,
that,

1385
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,220
that to me,
we've discussed a lot of that van and

1386
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,960
um,
I don't,

1387
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:54,940
I don't see a problem with that.
And I'll tell you why.

1388
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:59,560
And I also think you should be able to
get a degree in football because there

1389
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:01,990
are so many jobs at the nfl has,
right?

1390
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:03,100
You have commentators,
you have.

1391
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,100
Do you have staff that work all
throughout the nfl offices?

1392
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,740
Why can't you major in football?
That's a great idea.

1393
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,670
It's a business.
It's a business,

1394
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,830
but the reason we're treating it like
it's not a business and we continue as

1395
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,020
soon as we wake up and say this is a
business,

1396
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,440
I think progression will happen and it
always does,

1397
00:57:20,441 --> 00:57:21,274
but it,
it.

1398
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,650
They're just holding onto this circular
reasoning.

1399
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,370
No,
no,

1400
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,300
they're amateur athletes.
Well,

1401
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:26,920
why are the amateur athletes?
Because we don't pay him,

1402
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:28,530
but why don't we paint?
Because they're amateur athletics.

1403
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:30,170
Like,
man,

1404
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,000
I guess it's ridiculous.
Yeah.

1405
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,970
And I feel like if you did get a degree
in football,

1406
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:37,150
then your time could be spent learning
physiology,

1407
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:42,190
strength and conditioning protocol
because it took me until I didn't really

1408
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:44,530
understand nutrition.
So I got out of college honestly.

1409
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,171
Really?
Yeah.

1410
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,160
I didn't really understand it.
Um,

1411
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,900
there wasn't a nutritionist there,
but like it wasn't as detailed as it is

1412
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:50,350
now.

1413
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,020
Like what were they telling you?
Like what didn't care?

1414
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,880
That was the thing.
I didn't care.

1415
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:56,200
I was,
I was,

1416
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,680
I was drinking a lot and I was eating a
lot of windows,

1417
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,800
right,
because when you're young,

1418
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:01,700
you're 19 years old,
it don't affect your body,

1419
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,160
you can put whatever in your body
really.

1420
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,980
Um,
but then when you start getting a to

1421
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:07,350
where this is your job,
um,

1422
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,960
and you can start filling those burgers
on you the next day it was like,

1423
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:12,310
hold on,
maybe I need to look into this.

1424
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:13,940
So I looked into it independently and
that's what I,

1425
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,120
I didn't understand what nutrition for
the body,

1426
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,770
I really don't understand,
but you can,

1427
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,930
you could do nutrition,
physiology,

1428
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,420
uh,
everything that you're interested in and

1429
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:27,070
that is a helpful to your craft.
Do you think when you're young that it

1430
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:30,250
doesn't affect your body or do you think
you're not tuned in enough to your body

1431
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:31,600
to realize it's affecting you?

1432
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,350
I think a little bit of both,
man.

1433
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:38,050
Like you have to,
you have to watch what you eat as you

1434
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:38,910
get older.
That's for sure.

1435
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,700
And when I really started noticing it
was like a 23,

1436
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:44,290
24 when I was like,
all right,

1437
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,380
those heavy weekends where I'm eating
whatever I want and getting drunk or

1438
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,171
they're,
they're,

1439
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:50,320
they're,
they're fucking with me.

1440
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:53,700
So I have to really start looking at
what is good to put them on board and

1441
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:57,310
whether or not you kind of know just
based off the pyramid and you growing up

1442
00:58:57,311 --> 00:58:58,960
here and what's good and what's bad.
Um,

1443
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,110
buT once you,
once you understand and break down the

1444
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:06,550
carbs and all of this stuff that you're
putting in your body,

1445
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,460
you really,
it takes your game to the next level.

1446
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,130
And it did that to me.
So what kind of advice they give you in

1447
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,900
college as far as nutrition,
what they tell you to eat?

1448
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,290
A lot of the same stuff.
A lot of little grilled.

1449
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:20,600
Make sure nothing fried.
You don't want to,

1450
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,640
you don't want to load up on carbs.
A certain kind of carbs are good for

1451
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:27,740
you.
like so some carbs like sweet potatoes

1452
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:30,860
are really good.
So they were giving me that good

1453
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:32,480
information.
I wasn't,

1454
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,820
I,
I wasn't ready to receive the

1455
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,470
information,
so I can't fault them,

1456
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,270
but once you go to college then he
started really paying attention to it.

1457
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:40,250
And what,
what,

1458
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,680
like what did you follow after that?
Uh,

1459
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:48,110
this ain't the same model that,
um,

1460
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,610
so it was like the grill,
the grill,

1461
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,050
the grill stuff,
that's stuff like that.

1462
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,570
And then I have such an addictive
personality.

1463
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:57,530
I started doing a lot,
so I started getting into being a vegan

1464
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,360
and plant based,
um,

1465
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,360
and,
and so it led me to,

1466
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:06,890
they're like a researching food and
nutrition,

1467
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,710
that lifestyle lifestyle's not for me.
Uh,

1468
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,420
I tried it for about six,
seven months,

1469
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,940
but um,
yeah man,

1470
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:16,880
I mean I tried the best I could to eat
as healthy as I could.

1471
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,370
But what happened with you,
with trying vegan?

1472
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,160
Um,
it was really good,

1473
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,990
man.
I met a lot of good people with vegans

1474
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:26,210
come out of the woodworks to show the
support.

1475
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:29,810
Uh,
they also put you into a good team when

1476
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:30,644
you leave though.

1477
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
Trader.
Yeah,

1478
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,700
they get mad superman.
Um,

1479
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:37,070
but,
uh,

1480
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,560
you know,
I kind of support the lifestyle man.

1481
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,070
I'm plant based,
you can be a vegan and drink coke and

1482
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:46,730
eat chips all day,
but like plant based lifestyle,

1483
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:48,230
I feel like it's really healthy and it
really,

1484
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:50,090
I felt really good while I was eating
like that.

1485
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,930
Um,
but for me I got tired of constantly

1486
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:55,880
worrying about what I was going to put
in my body.

1487
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,400
like,
so every meal was a prep,

1488
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,160
I had to do it every single end and
everything in our,

1489
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:05,720
in our lives is like a,
a celebration and all celebration is

1490
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:10,520
usually centered around food and meat.
So I got tired of doing that,

1491
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:11,354
so I was like,
all right,

1492
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,410
if I died two years earlier,
do you really think you're going to

1493
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:17,100
though?
Do you think it's bad for the eat meat?

1494
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,620
no.
In moderation.

1495
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,320
I think if you just load up on a lot of
me,

1496
01:01:21,321 --> 01:01:23,480
it can be unhealthy.
Did you,

1497
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:26,750
when you were,
I'm eating a vegan diet,

1498
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,450
did you notice performance benefits?
Uh,

1499
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,850
it's all anecdotal.
I don't have any,

1500
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:33,300
you know,
but uh,

1501
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,420
I felt like I recovered a little faster.
Um,

1502
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,140
but again,
it's all anecdotal and it could have

1503
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:42,170
been holding my head.
I think just eating a lot of vegetables.

1504
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:45,740
We'll do that for you for sure.
Whether or not you eat meat at all or

1505
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:48,740
fish or anything,
I just think it's so beneficial to eat a

1506
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:50,120
lot of vegetables.
One hundred percent.

1507
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,680
And look at one thing.
I know a different show.

1508
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:55,880
Is it cleanse me like your,
um,

1509
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:00,320
your bowel movements?
Oh well it juSt slides out and that's

1510
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,420
not to get too grotesque man.
But it's really

1511
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,840
important.
Merrily I'll do it,

1512
01:02:05,841 --> 01:02:07,430
but it's,
it's you,

1513
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:10,250
you noticed a difference and you really
understand what a healthy bowel movement

1514
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,830
is and what,
or not healthy no matter if you're just

1515
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:15,800
eating cheeseburgers and stuff and
you're not getting a lot of vegetables

1516
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:18,590
and a lot of fiber and yeah,
people don't even know.

1517
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,160
yeah,
it's a different,

1518
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,110
it's a different uh,
especially if you blend it.

1519
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,260
If we blend like kale shakes,
bridges,

1520
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:28,750
lubes the whole process.
I wasn't big on the uh,

1521
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:29,730
on the blender,
man.

1522
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,030
I'm big on it because I can eat way more
than I would ever in a salad.

1523
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:33,990
Right.
Like if,

1524
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,690
uh,
there's only so much you can eat in a

1525
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:37,540
salad,
but five,

1526
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:41,620
blend that shit up and break it down to
24 ounces of like semi liquid.

1527
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:44,430
RigHt.
That's a lot of weight of vegetables and

1528
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,990
just seems to me that just massive boost
of nutrients that enter into your

1529
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,880
bloodstream and your digestive tract.
I'm just not as good with the patients.

1530
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:54,630
Yeah,
no,

1531
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,461
I understand.
What,

1532
01:02:55,461 --> 01:02:57,360
what about protein when you were,
um,

1533
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,980
being a vegan,
what did you,

1534
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:01,650
uh,
did you use like pea protein or a hemp

1535
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:03,040
protein?
Like what kind of protein?

1536
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,820
We stay away from him because um,
uh,

1537
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:07,710
they test for,
for,

1538
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,750
for weed and they said sometimes I
don't,

1539
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,300
I didn't want to,
I didn't want to take the chance.

1540
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:12,991
I didn't.
Wow.

1541
01:03:12,991 --> 01:03:17,130
I'm not well versed on what is and what
is now some honest shit that doesn't

1542
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,981
test positive.
No,

1543
01:03:17,981 --> 01:03:19,950
I'm done.
So I could do whatever I want and I

1544
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:21,930
don't know why they would say that
because most,

1545
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,650
if you get good hamp.
Well,

1546
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:26,250
I guess that's the thing is good.
That's what they said.

1547
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,190
They seen him.
they said flaxseeds can make you test

1548
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:30,110
positive.
Well,

1549
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,980
you know,
poppy Seeds can make you test positive

1550
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:33,600
for marijuana.
That's crazy.

1551
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,090
Yeah.
like people have tested positive on

1552
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:39,510
those random drug tests to give people
their jobs from having a poppy seed

1553
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:41,650
bagel that's,
you're shooting heroin.

1554
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:46,200
It's just like the fucking stupid.
Anyway.

1555
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:47,034
Like in the nfl,

1556
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,280
they need to,
um,

1557
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,720
uh,
let,

1558
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,640
let guys use a weed for,
for pain.

1559
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,530
Oh,
for sure.

1560
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:59,290
It's ridiculous.
We'll definitely cbds for sure because

1561
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:02,930
it's not even sipo aside.
Snagged the cbd oil that comes from.

1562
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,290
It comes from hemp plant.
That's not psychoactive.

1563
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:11,200
My were really good for you to super
good for inflammation and joint pain and

1564
01:04:11,201 --> 01:04:12,550
things along those lines.
Matter of fact,

1565
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:13,520
when I had my,
um,

1566
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,190
we actually,
we have some right here.

1567
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,900
Sit right here.
That's what it is.

1568
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,670
Yeah.
This is a charlotte's web.

1569
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:22,630
This is actually one of my sponsors.
Now they make hemp oil.

1570
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:23,810
Yeah.
I didn't mean to play.

1571
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,980
I'm going to do it.
It's actually on this podcast.

1572
01:04:26,981 --> 01:04:30,790
I have to do a sponsor about it,
but this stuff is great and you just

1573
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,610
take it drops.
It's good for you.

1574
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:34,960
A negative effect.

1575
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,200
When I had my back surgery in 2014 or
13.

1576
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,430
And uh,
what did you have done?

1577
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:44,890
l five s one.
I had a,

1578
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,220
it's this ectomy.
Dissectomy.

1579
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,460
Yeah.
Um,

1580
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,220
they uh,
they prescribed percocet and percocet I

1581
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,060
used to.
I used to take them for everything else.

1582
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:58,450
They used to make me like gag and throw
up every single time I took them.

1583
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,570
And so it really,
in any painkiller that was heavily,

1584
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:04,570
heavily sedate you,
I would always like throw up and they,

1585
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:08,290
they told me that if you like,
have a gag reflex too much,

1586
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:11,110
like you could read.
I could of reset my desk really.

1587
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:16,030
So for like two days I was just like in
pain after the surgery and my dad was

1588
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,780
like,
man,

1589
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,130
go some weed or alex,

1590
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,030
I'm gonna,
go get you some weed.

1591
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:19,930
I was like,
what?

1592
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:22,541
He's like,
yeah man.

1593
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,250
So he went to.
They're lucky that I was in la.

1594
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:27,220
I got it in la and had to dispensary.
And so,

1595
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:29,190
uh,
got some and uh,

1596
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,300
it,
it helps immediately and I was like,

1597
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:34,690
there's no way that they shouldn't be
okay,

1598
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,040
just totally be lyrical.
Were being rude,

1599
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,470
being fucked,
you know what I mean?

1600
01:05:39,471 --> 01:05:43,210
It's slowly but surely it's starting to
become legal recreationally.

1601
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:45,220
It's legal now in California
recreationally.

1602
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:48,250
But the federal government is still
resisting it because of the influence of

1603
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:51,760
the pharmaceutical companies and also a
bunch of other people that like the

1604
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:55,270
prison guard unions,
they don't want it to be legal because

1605
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,670
they have less people to arrest.
It's kind of fucked up.

1606
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,770
Yeah.
Know the prison industrial complex.

1607
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,330
It's scary shit.
A real thing.

1608
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:03,280
They're making money off people being in
cages.

1609
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,010
It's like are people are human batteries
and you get money off of this matrix.

1610
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,450
The matrix.
It really is.

1611
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:12,610
It's like a very low level version of
the matrix.

1612
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,300
But it's terrifying if that logic with
all the science that's in place about

1613
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:18,880
what's dangerous and what's not.
They're prescribing percocet.

1614
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:20,560
So like here fella,
take these.

1615
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,030
Makes no sense.
Young strapping,

1616
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:24,220
buck wants to take some shit that might
get you hooked.

1617
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:25,390
They have this,
they have this,

1618
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:26,930
this waiver we have to sign.
So there's,

1619
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:30,850
this is painkiller called toradol in the
nfl,

1620
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:31,500
right?
Yeah,

1621
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,820
it's awful.
But I took it a lot because prescribed

1622
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,540
that shit to my dog.
Really?

1623
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:38,780
He's a great dog.
Got bit so like for.

1624
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:42,100
So if a tornado we have to,
we have to sign this waiver that says

1625
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,850
you're kind of just given up your.
It's not,

1626
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:47,560
we're not responsible for but they'll
let us take that,

1627
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:51,250
but they won't let us smoke weed and
they're abandoned dudes that smoke weed

1628
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,200
and suspended dudes.

1629
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,080
That's right.
He retired because even just,

1630
01:06:55,081 --> 01:06:56,940
um,
I leave josh gordon.

1631
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,070
He played receiver for the browns.
He was one of the best young receivers

1632
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:01,420
I've seen in a long time,
but he,

1633
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,270
they banned him for a year because he
tested positive for two or three times

1634
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:08,350
and it's like you throw it away.
I mean granted he needs to be smarter,

1635
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,400
but like you're throwing away an entire
medical career because of weed,

1636
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,750
like it's crack cocaine,
you know what I'm saying?

1637
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:17,800
It's like it's trying to send a message
to the youth to stay away from the

1638
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:22,390
illegal drugs.
Reagan all over again trying to rule off

1639
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:23,500
of fear.
It's fear,

1640
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:25,270
man,
let's not based on reality.

1641
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,140
The reality is if you were to legalize
drugs,

1642
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,660
period,
you can regulate it and that way you can

1643
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:34,330
do it in a controlled environment and
that way you don't have all of this.

1644
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,820
I mean that's what they do with the
prohibition of alcohol.

1645
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,290
Legalize it.
Well,

1646
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:40,390
that's also what they're doing right now
with an opiate.

1647
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:43,000
Pills.
I mean oxy cottons are not illegal.

1648
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:45,290
They can be prescribed.
They just have to have a doctor

1649
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,740
prescribes this ridiculous.
It is pretty crazy.

1650
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,720
well,
it's really crazy when people realize

1651
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:54,400
that marijuana helps pain relief as much
if not better than all that stuff and it

1652
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:57,120
doesn't have any of the addictive
properties and if you do the.

1653
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,730
There have been people that have said
that it's addictive and there's some,

1654
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:02,410
some studies that pointed that in
certain individuals,

1655
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,250
but I would state that those people
probably addicted to fucking everything.

1656
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,950
I couldn't.
I just don't call it physically.

1657
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,610
I don't get how marijuana is addictive,
it just doesn't make any sense.

1658
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:17,270
I've smoked pot every day for years.
Then I'll take like a month off and

1659
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,133
nothing.

1660
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,760
Not an ache.
A pain,

1661
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,740
not a no shakes,
no nothing.

1662
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:25,850
Just you just don't have it.
It's like drink orange juice then don't

1663
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,950
drink the orange juice.
No.

1664
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,170
Really nothing there.
Nothing happens.

1665
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,041
I'll get it,
man.

1666
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:31,874
I was,
I'm,

1667
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,010
I'm not like a heavy smoker like that,
but like,

1668
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:34,600
um,
like a,

1669
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,700
a,
had on a saturday night when I ain't

1670
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:41,510
going nowhere.
I'm all set up my pipe and my,

1671
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,460
my second.
I'm going to watch a great movie.

1672
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,690
Why not fall asleep?
Yeah.

1673
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:48,230
What the fuck is wrong with that?
I don't get it man.

1674
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:51,950
And meanwhile you can get percosets or
get drunk as hell and ruin your liver.

1675
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:53,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

1676
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:55,040
I got,
I had a nose operation.

1677
01:08:55,041 --> 01:09:00,041
They've got my deviated septum fixed and
this dogs began to nothing.

1678
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,590
They told me it was bad.
It's people fucking complaining about

1679
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,570
everything.
I remember before I got tattooed people

1680
01:09:05,571 --> 01:09:06,340
like,
oh my god,

1681
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,900
patches are so painful in the first
tattoo.

1682
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,040
I was like,
that's it.

1683
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,840
That's the shit that everybody's
competitive,

1684
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,040
man.
Shit hurts.

1685
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,920
I always wonder,
right?

1686
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:18,800
Not,
not saying like not playing tough guy,

1687
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:22,040
but I really wonder what pain feels like
to other people.

1688
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:25,310
I assume that I know what your pain is
like.

1689
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,230
Right?
But I don't know if that's true because

1690
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,200
why does,
why do I like certain foods and other

1691
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:31,780
people think it tastes like shit.
Yeah,

1692
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:34,280
and something's got to be different.
It bothers me too.

1693
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,770
That's got to be different.
Like your taste buds.

1694
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,760
It's not just simple like a.
I can take it.

1695
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,220
I think there's a.
I think people will experience different

1696
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,730
sensation.
It kills me how people don't like spicy

1697
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:49,130
food.
Like I love spicy Food.

1698
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:51,480
They make little kicking it.
He's like,

1699
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,030
oh,
why would I want to burn my mouth?

1700
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:53,490
I'm like,
oh,

1701
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:56,630
why wouldn't you?
And maybe I just like a little bit of

1702
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:57,450
pain every now and then.

1703
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:58,100
Well,
it's not a,

1704
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,500
it's a,
it's a kind of a sensation more than

1705
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:03,290
it's a paint sorta.
No,

1706
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:03,470
no,
no.

1707
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:06,410
It is.
But it doesn't hurt to you,

1708
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:09,140
but it doesn't hurt like have you ever
had a habanero pepper?

1709
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,630
That's what I'm saying.
Do you know what I have in the morning?

1710
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:15,140
I drink bone broth with habanero sauce
in it to fuck.

1711
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,400
Yeah.
Why?

1712
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,990
It's good.
It's good for you.

1713
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,360
Okay.
Bone broth.

1714
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,860
Both good and good for you.
It tastes good.

1715
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:25,250
Like beef bone broth.
And I put some.

1716
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,870
Put some habanero sauce in there.
See that's,

1717
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,340
that's the.
You deep into that nutrition?

1718
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:33,470
I can.
That's great.

1719
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:34,400
I'm telling you,
it's like,

1720
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,240
it's like a delicious tea,
like a warm fluid.

1721
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,450
Sit down and have some bone broth.
Dude,

1722
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:41,720
you would like it.
I'm telling you.

1723
01:10:41,721 --> 01:10:43,670
I'm open man.
there's a place down the street actually

1724
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:46,790
that sells it.
The California.

1725
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,070
So what kind of bones?
Chickens.

1726
01:10:49,071 --> 01:10:50,670
Really good.
Turkey's good.

1727
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,310
You can taste it.
A different kind of guy.

1728
01:10:52,311 --> 01:10:53,144
Yeah.
Yeah.

1729
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,520
Chicken is probably the best tasting
bone broth.

1730
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:00,160
Jamie grease spot in New York.
I went to called bravo broth.

1731
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,450
Yeah,
they like my grandma's do,

1732
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,190
but it was just like,
it tasted like chicken soup,

1733
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,710
just the water,
the broth,

1734
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:08,100
whatever.
They just boiling bones.

1735
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,000
That shit is brand.
I've never even heard of people drinking

1736
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,530
boone's.
It's pretty recent.

1737
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,040
I mean not really mean people

1738
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,100
been doing it for a long time,
but it's pretty recent as a fad around

1739
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:19,470
here in particular and there's a place
out here,

1740
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,600
I think it's called sunlife organics.
The joint that cells bone broth and they

1741
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:26,370
add,
they'll add a little hot sauce to it and

1742
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:27,900
that's where I got the idea.
I was like,

1743
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,070
ooh,
I like it.

1744
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:32,190
And so then I buy bone broth,
buy it in bulk,

1745
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:34,620
bring it home.
I have like at any given time I might

1746
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:38,010
have 40 bottles of bone broth and
refrigerator that's been entered.

1747
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,910
You know,
she's great.

1748
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:42,730
I never even as it made his way to Texas
yet.

1749
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,730
What about bone marrow?
Do every bone marrow.

1750
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,420
Oh man.
Never had a bone before

1751
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,270
in any aspect.
Well,

1752
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:56,820
and a lot of fancy restaurants,
they sell bone marrow and what they're

1753
01:11:56,821 --> 01:11:59,070
doing is they're taking the femur of the
cow.

1754
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:02,970
They saw it and then they slice it down.
The middle peter going crazy.

1755
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:06,030
Then they cook it,
the bacon in the oven and there's like a

1756
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,240
gelatinous fatty substance in the middle
that's incredibly nutritious and

1757
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:15,210
especially like these days where people
are on these real high fat key to genic

1758
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:18,780
based diets are all the rage.
A lot of people are eating bone marrow.

1759
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,490
Show them some bone marrow.
Young jamie,

1760
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:23,730
they don't like that.
So you'll get that and a lot of times

1761
01:12:23,731 --> 01:12:25,710
people see that like with a little
toast.

1762
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:29,290
People like it with toast,
but you just take the bone marrow with a

1763
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:32,670
fork and scoop it out of that,
that the dark stuff in the center there,

1764
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:35,760
scoop it out of there with a fork and
just slurp it down.

1765
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,713
I love it,
man.

1766
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:39,600
If it's on the menu,
I fucking order it every time I got to

1767
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:40,500
try this man.

1768
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,540
This shit is.
What about organ meat?

1769
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:47,570
You eat organ meat like from actual
liver heart and that's the way to Oregon

1770
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:50,461
either.
Man.

1771
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:54,090
I'm from the inner city man.
So I'm not that culture with the uh,

1772
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:56,740
with the pallet man.
Well that's not even.

1773
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,020
I've been to,
when I was a kid,

1774
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,810
my grandmother used to cook that.
Live it.

1775
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,070
yeah.
It's contrast to the city.

1776
01:13:03,071 --> 01:13:05,580
So.
Well I think it's one of those things

1777
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:09,140
were poor people aided initially because
they didn't want it to go to waste.

1778
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:12,600
Like we're wealthy.
People would eat like the finer cuts of

1779
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,500
meat.
Like philemon,

1780
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:14,610
yon,
you go to a restaurant.

1781
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:16,770
I'll have the full,
a medium rare.

1782
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,000
But um,
you know,

1783
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,230
people would shy away from things like
liver and they do think that that's.

1784
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,820
But it's real good for you,
man.

1785
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:26,490
I heard people eating it and you eat the
chitlins too.

1786
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:27,700
Oh yeah.
I'll eat that.

1787
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:33,000
Christ.
Do you ever have a menudo with the tripe

1788
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:34,440
in?
It does a joint.

1789
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,630
ThAt's I gotta tell you,
take you to this place,

1790
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:38,760
jamie.
There's a legit joint.

1791
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:42,400
I will never say the address because Ins
will show up and they'll fucking

1792
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,720
heartbeat.
It's not a single person in their eating

1793
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,160
or working there.
That's illegal,

1794
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,790
but it's so good.
It's so mexican.

1795
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:52,260
That's menudo.
Menudo.

1796
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,890
Menudo is they like to have it on
saturday and sunday.

1797
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,170
I've heard of it.
What is it though?

1798
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:01,040
It's a soup and it's a soup with a bunch
of different jazz in it,

1799
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,700
but see that stuff in the middle?
That's tripe.

1800
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:06,320
That's all cow stomach.
That stuff that looks like waffles too.

1801
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,880
Like that.
That's the interior of a cow.

1802
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:11,890
Stomach it.
Take that and boil and chop it up at.

1803
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,250
Damn.

1804
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,560
It is so delicious.
I know you think like,

1805
01:14:14,561 --> 01:14:16,810
I'm not eating that.
I'm telling you man.

1806
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,430
And they.
It's supposed to be a cure for a

1807
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:19,720
hangover.
She looks gross,

1808
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,360
man.
I mean,

1809
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,830
I'm not judging the taste.
I'm saying it looks terrible.

1810
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,830
I'm telling you,
if you just try it and it was gross.

1811
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,970
Put the uh,
the bather on it.

1812
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,200
Pop a little bit.
I know they do that right.

1813
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:35,170
That's always drives me crazy when they
put like a piece of celery on your

1814
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,390
plate.
Am I supposed to eat that tower?

1815
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,150
What's?
Yeah.

1816
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,620
What's this?
Garnish with parsley there.

1817
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,380
See that might look gross,
but I never had it,

1818
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,720
but I've had it so many times.
It looks amazing.

1819
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:48,490
You experienced with the motto,
man.

1820
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,620
First time I heard it was in boulder.
This is joint in boulder called pupusas.

1821
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:56,530
Is this just,
it's crazy because it's in boulder,

1822
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:58,210
Colorado,
like what kind of mexican food they're

1823
01:14:58,211 --> 01:14:59,290
going to have in boulder,
Colorado,

1824
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:03,340
so it makes things out there,
but it a mexican right by say I grew up

1825
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:04,510
in albuquerque,
New Mexico,

1826
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:09,970
so it's just south of New Mexico and to
me new mexican food is better than like

1827
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,880
mexican food real because it's,
it's different.

1828
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,780
It's like,
it's like smothered in the chili.

1829
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,750
They have chili's hatch.
Green chili is real famous for.

1830
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,370
Um,
and so it's,

1831
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:24,460
We'll see Colorado New Mexico have this
debate over who started.

1832
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,130
I don't know who fucking started it,
but it's good as hell.

1833
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,430
What's more prevalent in New Mexico?
Think right?

1834
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,650
It's like growing up.
yeah.

1835
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:35,860
But like you hear people in Colorado,
but I had started here so I was like,

1836
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:36,430
man,
you got It.

1837
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,650
Whatever
man.

1838
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:40,523
I don't know,
but I mean,

1839
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:44,230
green chilies and New Mexico are
synonymous.

1840
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:45,710
That's like one of the things.
Yeah,

1841
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,260
that's what I grew up on.
So like when I,

1842
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,890
when I left,
um,

1843
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,590
you know,
I went to high school in san diego and I

1844
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:52,780
left and I like ordered something with
green chili on it.

1845
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,930
It was not to Chile.
I was accustomed to when I was like,

1846
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:56,710
what is this?

1847
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,660
Like an order mexican food.
It was like what I looked at as like

1848
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:03,520
texmex yeah,
was just not the same and I was

1849
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,660
disappointed to say the least,
but someone needs to talk to Donald

1850
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,050
Trump for the kicker.
All these mexicans out,

1851
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:10,060
you're gonna fuck up the entire.
He tripping.

1852
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,030
It's crazy stripping.
But it's scary because you just give

1853
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:17,310
these people look if you give people the
green light to start rating people and

1854
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,720
catching people when they're dropping
their kids off at school,

1855
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:21,730
which is some of the stuff that I've
been seen in the news.

1856
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,190
I don't know how much of it as happening
or what's happening,

1857
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,640
but when you're making it dangerous for
people to get an education,

1858
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,700
you're making it dangerous for kids to
get educated.

1859
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,940
Right?
It's crazy.

1860
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:36,130
The shit that gets me,
man is like the majority of trump

1861
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:40,150
supporters are like christians.
Right?

1862
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:43,280
And if you look at jesus's main
messages,

1863
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,880
like love thy neighbor and Mexico is our
neighbor.

1864
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,970
Yeah.
I don't understand the disdain,

1865
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,340
like I don't understand them.
If they do the right thing,

1866
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:54,480
that's what I'm saying.
Their paperwork come over here the right

1867
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,290
way.
The way my granddaddy did.

1868
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,930
Your granddaddy got on a raft,
you piece of shit.

1869
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:02,590
You know the grand daddy,
anybody came up with the mayflower,

1870
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,010
didn't have any fucking paperwork.
It's crazy.

1871
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,930
But for some reason,
like none of those facts matter.

1872
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,840
Those people like I don't,
I don't.

1873
01:17:09,841 --> 01:17:10,070
I don't

1874
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,350
understand that man.
All that turn the other cheek shit and

1875
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:13,340
all that.
Some faggot.

1876
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:16,520
True that jesus wrote about back in the
day before they understood that faggot

1877
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:21,200
shit was.
People get mad whenever somebody said,

1878
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:24,380
how come every time you talk about trump
supports use a shitty southern accent.

1879
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,050
Oh,
well maybe because he'd get upset.

1880
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:31,650
Maybe I will keep doing it now.
Yeah,

1881
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,650
it's a weird time,
man.

1882
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:35,330
It's a real weird time.
I fucking,

1883
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,490
you know,
I have some weird ideas about

1884
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:41,090
nationalism and boundaries and stuff
like that because I think that America

1885
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:45,530
is more of an idea than it is a place.
I think America as an idea is a great

1886
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:48,020
idea.
I think it's amazing to have this one

1887
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:52,010
place where there's like a,
there's probably more creativity and

1888
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:55,250
more innovation in this country and more
music and art,

1889
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,830
more,
more fascinating things happening in

1890
01:17:57,831 --> 01:17:59,750
this country than almost any other
country.

1891
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,040
I mean,
there's great things happening

1892
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,090
everywhere.
Don't get me wrong,

1893
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:07,330
but I mean this is a hotbed of
creativity and innovation and art and I

1894
01:18:07,731 --> 01:18:11,000
think that's what makes me proud to like
to be an american.

1895
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:13,520
If I was proud,
I'd be proud of like all the people that

1896
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:15,590
came before,
all the people that were here,

1897
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,000
all the,
you know,

1898
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:22,001
all the neil degrasse tyson's and jimi
hendrix and all the fucking greg,

1899
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,820
you know,
lenny bruce and richard pryor and all

1900
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:30,821
the art and comedy and writing and
history and all the science and

1901
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:34,160
mathematics and all the great shit
that's been accomplished in this one

1902
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:35,060
area.
It's amazing.

1903
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:38,240
It's not a border,
it's not like a line in the sand.

1904
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:41,360
To me it's more like an idea.
So to me,

1905
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:44,630
the idea always been about people come
here because they want to do better,

1906
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,840
so you're trying to stop people from
doing better and they're like,

1907
01:18:47,841 --> 01:18:49,390
well,
they gotta they gotta fill out their

1908
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,520
paperwork and they got to do it right
the way our grandparents did know,

1909
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:53,990
our grandparents didn't do it that way.

1910
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:56,540
It was easy to come over here.
Back when my grandparents came over,

1911
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,340
my grandparents came over on a boat.
They came over from Italy and they just

1912
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,390
got on a boat.
It was fucking easy.

1913
01:19:02,391 --> 01:19:04,070
They got to ellis island.
Sign here.

1914
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:04,940
All right,
everybody's good.

1915
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:07,140
Go to work,
but now you know,

1916
01:19:07,141 --> 01:19:10,250
you say it's.
You got to make it harder for people to

1917
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:12,620
come across,
but it's almost impossible.

1918
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,190
If you want to immigrate from Mexico,
if you're a poor person and you want to

1919
01:19:16,191 --> 01:19:19,400
immigrate here from Mexico,
good fucking luck.

1920
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,830
Good luck.
It is not easy.

1921
01:19:21,831 --> 01:19:23,810
It's not easy to come here from fucking
Canada.

1922
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:25,970
I've had friends that have tried to come
here from Canada.

1923
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,220
Yeah.
Try to get a green card or try to become

1924
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,630
a citizen.
Holy shit.

1925
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,970
Is it hard?
It's a massive process.

1926
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:33,950
Like I,
I have a friend,

1927
01:19:33,951 --> 01:19:35,720
a good friend of mine and his daughter,
um,

1928
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:40,880
met a guy in Colorado and she came down
here and just got a new boyfriend,

1929
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:42,080
like,
I'll stay with you in Colorado.

1930
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:43,850
She cannot work because she's from
Canada.

1931
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,743
Well,
because,

1932
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,820
you know,
I guess they just assume like,

1933
01:19:46,821 --> 01:19:48,170
oh,
you're from that patch of dirt.

1934
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:50,140
You're not allowed to work over in this
patch of dirt.

1935
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,060
And that shit,
man,

1936
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,030
it's crazy.
She's a normal functioning shot,

1937
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,820
terrorist.
She's educated,

1938
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,140
she's smart.
She talks well like,

1939
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:01,610
why can't you just work like everybody
else could work getting work at jamba

1940
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:02,430
juice.
Nope.

1941
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:06,950
I said it's paranoia man.
It's like people just are afraid of

1942
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,000
everything and granted that

1943
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,840
all real threats,
you know what I'm saying?

1944
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,730
But it's like you can't,
I just don't feel.

1945
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,060
I just don't believe in living in that

1946
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:14,160
fear.
No.

1947
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:19,161
It's just a constant state of hypnosis.
Nationalism,

1948
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,610
you know,
and it's team.

1949
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:24,090
It's a team mentality but not a team
mentality and a positive sense.

1950
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:27,930
And a team mentality and an exclusionary
sense like you're excluding all these

1951
01:20:27,931 --> 01:20:30,190
other people from joining the team.
Like,

1952
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,700
well if they all come over here then
they're going to ruin our quality of

1953
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:34,530
life.
Are you sure?

1954
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,940
I'm not.
I'm not sure

1955
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,510
man.
National nationalism is.

1956
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:41,810
It's one of the worst things actually.
I don't,

1957
01:20:41,811 --> 01:20:42,800
I don't like it at all.
Like I,

1958
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:44,510
I'm,
I'm super proud.

1959
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:46,250
I love America.
This is a dope place to be,

1960
01:20:46,251 --> 01:20:48,680
but like I'm not,
I'm not like,

1961
01:20:48,681 --> 01:20:52,110
oh fuck your country over my country.
Like it had never hit me.

1962
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,860
Like my pride isn't,
isn't like that.

1963
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:57,560
And my pride is just like,
it's dope to be from here and I enjoy it

1964
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:58,100
here.
But like,

1965
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,880
eh,
I don't have any disdain towards any of

1966
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:00,830
the country.
I just don't.

1967
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:01,431
Well,
you know,

1968
01:21:01,431 --> 01:21:03,500
what fucks me up,
it's that team mentality.

1969
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:07,160
You could break it down to the macro
level because people in houston don't

1970
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:09,890
like people from dallas.
You know what I'm saying?

1971
01:21:09,891 --> 01:21:11,720
It's like it gets goofY.
I mean,

1972
01:21:11,721 --> 01:21:14,150
dallas and houston might as well be
Mexico in America.

1973
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:17,180
I mean it reallY might as well.
But you tell it's big though.

1974
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,930
It's weird,
but you're from.

1975
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,970
You're from houston,
right?

1976
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,450
No,
you live in houston.

1977
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:26,150
I lived in houston and dallas might as
well be in a fucking civil war if you

1978
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:28,040
talked to half the people,
they don't fight like,

1979
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,030
oh,
you're from dallas,

1980
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:30,170
motherfucker.
Let's do this.

1981
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:33,560
It's not like you want to fight,
but if you tell people that you're,

1982
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:36,080
you know,
you live in houston or you love houston,

1983
01:21:36,081 --> 01:21:37,820
they're from dallas.
Like fuck.

1984
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,240
ExactlY.
Did they get weird in austin?

1985
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,390
It's kind of like the middle ground.

1986
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,970
Austin like,
well hey man,

1987
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,540
but it's kind of cool,
relaxed,

1988
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,550
hippie brother tries to,
hey guys,

1989
01:21:49,551 --> 01:21:53,120
don't fight.
Let's just be cool here in Texas.

1990
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,600
And then you got weird spots.
So they're like,

1991
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,440
odessa.
You might as well be mexican,

1992
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:59,200
I don't know.
Dust.

1993
01:21:59,201 --> 01:22:00,590
So you're trying to pretend you're not
mexican.

1994
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,390
I've never,
I've never made it out to any of the

1995
01:22:02,391 --> 01:22:04,610
small,
small parts of the Texas

1996
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,520
border.
I've,

1997
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:12,630
I've had a friend of mine who lived a on
what is directly across from juarez,

1998
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:17,330
el paso.
They said that one of the buildings that

1999
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:19,100
he was at,
he got shot,

2000
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:24,250
like got hit with a bullet from someone
involved in gang warfare on the other

2001
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:26,640
side of the border like they were so
close to.

2002
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,870
Or is thAt a bullet from war as hit one
of the buildings?

2003
01:22:29,871 --> 01:22:31,500
He was in a.

2004
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:37,190
What is happening?
Well that should know the region right

2005
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:37,880
there.
You dumb.

2006
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,070
Fuck that.
We got to kick them out of our country

2007
01:22:40,071 --> 01:22:45,071
please.
It's so funny arguing people,

2008
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,400
they just have talking points and they
don't ever think about anything.

2009
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,260
Well,
you know what?

2010
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,280
They.
You can have talking points and you can

2011
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:54,860
have points and their points are okay.
They're not

2012
01:22:56,450 --> 01:23:00,110
to Be discussed and debated,
but when people get so many solid

2013
01:23:00,111 --> 01:23:03,640
opinions on certain things,
the problem is that nobody has rocks out

2014
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:07,180
of the pens because they're usually.
Their beliefs aren't based on any kind

2015
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:11,470
of a foundation and the research.
It's all based on somebody that says

2016
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:12,330
something.
Right.

2017
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:16,780
Usually on podcasts or television that
they agree with and all of a sudden your

2018
01:23:16,781 --> 01:23:19,330
opinion becomes a fax from sean hannity
type shit.

2019
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:22,460
Yeah.
I've never really watched him and um,

2020
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,020
I,
you know,

2021
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:25,730
it's one thing if they weren't human,
like if,

2022
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,890
if you had like some neanderthals to
lived in Mexico and they were dangerous,

2023
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,670
they like to eat people like,
look,

2024
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:34,390
we gotta we gotta fucking real problem
falls coming over here eating us.

2025
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,460
But no,
they're just folks,

2026
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,710
they're just,
they're just folks that people

2027
01:23:38,711 --> 01:23:42,400
dehumanize people all the time.
I may say I saw it at my sport and you

2028
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:43,280
see it,
I mean in,

2029
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:45,490
in every aspect of life.
Yeah.

2030
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,140
Well,
how about Israel and palestine?

2031
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,910
Yeah.
That is the craziest shit ever.

2032
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:52,540
I was watching this documentary on the
history of Israel and palestine.

2033
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,220
What is it?
Because I've been looking for one.

2034
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:56,010
Oh man,
I'm So,

2035
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:58,750
so trying to do to quite a few of them
out there.

2036
01:23:58,751 --> 01:24:00,490
I need,
I need to find one because I don't think

2037
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:03,220
a documentary honestly is comprehensive
enough.

2038
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:08,221
I'd really good book like I've tried to
read up on it and it just gets deeper

2039
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:12,010
and deeper and deeper.
It's almost impossible to unravel.

2040
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:14,950
These people have been,
uh,

2041
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:19,980
at each other.
Like Israel is this one strange area,

2042
01:24:20,111 --> 01:24:22,120
right,
because you have this jewish state

2043
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:27,270
that's surrounded virtually on all sides
by arab states and and they hate Israel.

2044
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:32,170
Israel hates them and they're trying to
push people out and then the

2045
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:35,690
palestinians are claiming that this is
their land and they were pushed out and

2046
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:38,680
I used to do this bit and people just
get so fucking mad at me.

2047
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,900
They used to get so mad at me because I
was.

2048
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:45,250
I said that I was watching tv and I was
watching this thing about the

2049
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:47,560
palestinians versus the israelis and I
go,

2050
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:52,770
there's a brown skinned guy with dark
curly hair throwing rocks at a brown

2051
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:56,110
skinned guy with dark curly hair holding
a machine gun.

2052
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,410
And I'm like,
you guys look super fucking similar.

2053
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,320
This like watching a tennis match
machine.

2054
01:25:02,321 --> 01:25:05,050
The williams sisters.
I mean this isn't like the africans

2055
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:08,920
versus the nordic people.
Like you could clearly tell like one if

2056
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:11,380
you've seen an african person and you
see someone from China.

2057
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,510
Okay,
well I see you guys look real different,

2058
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:19,290
but like israelis and palestinians there
fucking so close until they talk.

2059
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:22,330
But you say that to people,
they get so mad at you.

2060
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:24,100
We have a very different.
Okay.

2061
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,820
I can't really.
I don't.

2062
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:27,080
I think there's a difference,
man,

2063
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:31,060
kind of,
but it's similar enough that they could

2064
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,340
pass for each other,
you know,

2065
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:34,420
things.
I think that's debatable.

2066
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:35,703
Debatable.

2067
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,340
We got the,
uh,

2068
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:40,623
the,
the,

2069
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:45,770
we're going to figure it out.
That would be search type pictures way

2070
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:46,840
people,
excuse me sir.

2071
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,260
Turns out the panel of students or one
pound heavier on average.

2072
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:56,830
It's just fucked up when you see that
kind of a dispute that you don't think

2073
01:25:56,831 --> 01:25:58,900
is ever going to get settled inside your
lifetime now.

2074
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:00,220
No,
no,

2075
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,770
it definitely won't be an hard time.
Like it's a state that was established

2076
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:06,080
in the 19 forties.
It's still there today and there's still

2077
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:08,570
hotly under debate and you're wondering
like,

2078
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,100
see that.
That's why I,

2079
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:13,160
I'm so confused about.
And it's such a hot button issue too

2080
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,720
because it's like as soon as you bring
it up,

2081
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:15,141
he was like,
hey,

2082
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:15,980
uh,
you know what I mean?

2083
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,920
And I'm just honest inquiry,
right?

2084
01:26:18,921 --> 01:26:20,390
Because I don't really know enough about
it.

2085
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:25,130
So I'm trying to read up on it and it's,
it seems to Be super,

2086
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:27,130
um,
uh,

2087
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,520
there's little red flag that raised it
to me.

2088
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,720
Then during this last republican,
before trump was president,

2089
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,110
one of the republican debates were all
of them on a panel,

2090
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,640
lIke they were just like,
I'm super privileged Israel.

2091
01:26:38,641 --> 01:26:40,880
I'm so pro Israel and all of them that
I'm pro Israel too.

2092
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:43,130
And I'm just like,
why are you so proud?

2093
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,860
It just made me think lIke,
and that's what made me start digging

2094
01:26:45,861 --> 01:26:46,970
into it.
And it's like,

2095
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:49,260
I mean usually,
uh,

2096
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:53,600
I don't agree with a lot of what the
republicans say and so it just makes me

2097
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:57,740
think what is the underlying issue here?
And that's christianity.

2098
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:59,900
That's a big thing because the pro
Israel people,

2099
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:02,720
the really heavy duty evangelical
christians,

2100
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:07,820
they really truly believed that inside
their lifetime jesus is going to return.

2101
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,650
Right.
And he's going to return to Israel.

2102
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:12,140
So.
Oh yeah,

2103
01:27:12,141 --> 01:27:15,190
there was a vice documentary on it.
So that's what I mean,

2104
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,250
it's probably deeper than that.

2105
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:17,780
It's probably the reason why.
Yeah,

2106
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:22,400
well it's hard loan ally that's non
muslim in that area.

2107
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,700
How did they,
how did they become our outlier?

2108
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:27,920
Because we armed the fuck out of them,
but I know that had to be a reason

2109
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:28,400
though,
right?

2110
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,150
Well,
I think we see the way they live their

2111
01:27:32,151 --> 01:27:34,280
lifestyle.
I mean there's very many reasons I'm

2112
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:36,440
simplifying it,
but it's much closer to ours.

2113
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:39,980
Then these arab states,
I mean women in Israel,

2114
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:42,560
first of all,
they have all the rights that women in

2115
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:46,340
America do pretty sure other than the
fact that they have to go to the army,

2116
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:48,600
they have to,
they have mandatory army service and

2117
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:50,810
it's a lot of people think would be a
good thing for America.

2118
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,960
Mandatory military service because it
would make you understand like this

2119
01:27:55,130 --> 01:28:00,130
about sacrifice and discipline and also
that you're a part of this thing instead

2120
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:01,100
of saying,
you know,

2121
01:28:01,101 --> 01:28:04,430
we should go over there and kick their
ass like whose we are you doing that?

2122
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,320
Well you're going to send your kid.
Exactly know.

2123
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:07,154
I mean that's,
that's a lot.

2124
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:10,740
I mean,
I think we'd have way fewer in her

2125
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:14,840
interactions with other countries if
everybody's kids had to go over there

2126
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:17,270
and do it.
People would be less than it would if it

2127
01:28:17,271 --> 01:28:19,790
wasn't a voluntary thing.
If it was an involuntary thing,

2128
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:22,580
we'd be much more judicious in our use
of military.

2129
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,920
When you brought up that a dehumanizing
thing.

2130
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:28,220
It's to me when when people bring a war
and stuff like that,

2131
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:29,660
it's like they just throw out these
numbers.

2132
01:28:29,661 --> 01:28:32,960
Like those Weren't humans that died.
That shit boggles my mind.

2133
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:35,530
like if that was your mother or your
father,

2134
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,790
sister,
like maybe maybe people do feel like we

2135
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:40,520
as he gave his life to a cause.
But like for me it's like man,

2136
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:43,490
at the end of the day I was fighting for
dirt and nobody owns.

2137
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,190
You can't take it with you and your box.
I don't understand it.

2138
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,271
Well,
not only that,

2139
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:51,200
it's impossible to fix parts of the
world.

2140
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,920
Like if you look at it like what's going
on right now in Syria,

2141
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:00,020
how many people are gonna have to die
before they figure out that part of the

2142
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:02,160
world.
I mean that like if you were there

2143
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,900
you would just want to get the fuck out
of there as quickly as possible because

2144
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:11,730
everybody could die at any moment there
and any moment anything could happen.

2145
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:13,770
Missiles are slamming into apartment
buildings.

2146
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:17,520
It's like you just gotta get the fuck
out and that can happen in this world.

2147
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:22,500
Like the world conflicts can escalate to
the point where they're just nonsensical

2148
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:25,020
where you can't make any sense of it.
You just gotta get the fuck out.

2149
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,160
Like if you were living right now in
Syria,

2150
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:28,890
I mean you would say,
you know,

2151
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,470
part of me wants to fight for this.
This is my city,

2152
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:32,820
this is my country,
this is where I'm from.

2153
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,260
And parties like,
fuck

2154
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,110
this Greece,
I will.

2155
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:38,710
Why don't we go to journal?
I don't got that any man.

2156
01:29:38,711 --> 01:29:39,940
I just,
I just don't like.

2157
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:45,390
My pride runs from my inner circle and
my family to my community and after that

2158
01:29:46,191 --> 01:29:48,010
it's like,
what are we fighting for?

2159
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:50,140
You know what I'm saying?
Unless you're stepping in my,

2160
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:53,140
my home base,
I don't understand the point,

2161
01:29:53,141 --> 01:29:54,180
man.
I don't got that emmy.

2162
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:55,900
Well,
when you get to something like world war

2163
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,880
two,
when you get to something like the nazis

2164
01:29:57,881 --> 01:29:59,530
were trying to take over the world,
that makes sense.

2165
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,150
Pushing into Poland and you go,
okay,

2166
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:02,760
we got a real problem here.
That make sense?

2167
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:03,521
It's crazy.
Fuck.

2168
01:30:03,521 --> 01:30:05,830
Might really like what's going on.
North Korea,

2169
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:07,850
North Korea scares the shit out of me.
See?

2170
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:09,610
And that's what I don't understand is
like,

2171
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:13,450
so you got a juggernaut country like
that who's basically waving a flag

2172
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:14,730
saying,
I don't fuck with you,

2173
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:15,780
you know,
I'm going,

2174
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,880
I'm all by myself and we don't really do
anything.

2175
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,450
We don't really.
Well,

2176
01:30:20,451 --> 01:30:23,230
the problem is they do do things and
they do know.

2177
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:25,900
They know that what I'm saying we to
them you mean?

2178
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:28,360
Yeah,
well we're looking at them now.

2179
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:33,460
I mean those apparently this is all
rumor and not who knows what,

2180
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:36,030
what was really sad,
but apparently that's the main thing

2181
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:40,440
that Donald Trump was informed about.
When obama left office.

2182
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:43,710
One of the things obama said like this
is the biggest issue is North Korea.

2183
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:48,450
These is a maniac that kim jong un is a
fucking murderous maniac and he's

2184
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:52,650
running a military dictatorship so and
he's got prison camps and they've got

2185
01:30:52,651 --> 01:30:55,470
these people that are born in prison.
They're born prisoners,

2186
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:57,720
they're their slaves and they killed
them.

2187
01:30:57,721 --> 01:30:59,130
They do whatever the fuck they wanted
them.

2188
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:01,920
If you don't listen to those people,
if you don't listen to the military,

2189
01:31:01,921 --> 01:31:03,810
they can kill you.
You have no rights.

2190
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:04,950
You have to do with you.
I mean,

2191
01:31:04,951 --> 01:31:09,180
people were put in jail because they
didn't mourn hard enough for the death

2192
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:10,660
of his father.
Yeah.

2193
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:14,670
They were given jail sentences,
hard labor,

2194
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,280
because they didn't try hard enough.
We.

2195
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:17,950
We played it recently.
There was these people.

2196
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,710
It's like the worst acting you've ever
seen.

2197
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:21,510
The people on the street,
while kim,

2198
01:31:21,511 --> 01:31:24,690
when kim jong il died and they were just
wailing,

2199
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,300
just fallen down.
They couldn't.

2200
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,730
They couldn't cry hard enough and they
had to do it.

2201
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,580
They had to do it publicly.
It was so nuts.

2202
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:33,760
See,
that's what I need to do,

2203
01:31:33,761 --> 01:31:34,331
man.
I need to.

2204
01:31:34,331 --> 01:31:38,530
I'm.
I'm pretty up on my domestic politics.

2205
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,470
I'm kind of out of the loop on foreign
policy and I'm out of the loop on

2206
01:31:41,471 --> 01:31:42,211
everything.
I just talked.

2207
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:44,620
Shit.
I watched a few Youtube videos.

2208
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:47,660
I read a few articles occasionally.
A book crosses my eyes.

2209
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,440
It's good to know.
Most of the time I don't know what the

2210
01:31:50,441 --> 01:31:53,160
fuck I'm talking about.
It's too much to know.

2211
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,390
That's true man.
That's.

2212
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,350
That's definitely true man.
Like if you wanted to.

2213
01:31:56,351 --> 01:31:58,230
If I.
If I really sat down with someone who's

2214
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,800
a real expert

2215
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,790
on foreign policy,
you know what you really get you.

2216
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:05,560
You really get a guy who knows a lot
aBout one area.

2217
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,600
if a re a real expert on foreign policy,
say if you were talking to someone who's

2218
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:12,520
an expert on China,
like international relationships with

2219
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:15,010
China,
the international relationships with

2220
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:16,870
China,
it's probably super complex,

2221
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:20,990
is probably so much to know and so much
to understand it so much to go over like

2222
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:21,640
the,
the,

2223
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:26,640
the for you to be a real expert.
How could you fucking know all that?

2224
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:29,230
All right.
How could you possibly know all that?

2225
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:32,200
That's one of my problems is like once,
once I.

2226
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:34,540
Once I want to learn something,
I got to learn everything about it.

2227
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:36,070
Like I said,
I learned conceptually.

2228
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,150
That's good though.
Yeah,

2229
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:40,990
there's bad though because like I have a
one track mind so like it'll consume me

2230
01:32:40,991 --> 01:32:44,800
for three months
because that's how people get good at

2231
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:45,010
things.

2232
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,780
So that's probably why you were a great
football player.

2233
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,930
It's probably the same thing.
I mean that's obsession becomes

2234
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:50,580
obsessive.
Yeah.

2235
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:53,560
But I feel like that's the case with
anybody who gets really good at things.

2236
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,830
You get just completely nuts about it,
get absorbed with it.

2237
01:32:56,831 --> 01:32:58,570
That's true because if you just casual
about it,

2238
01:32:58,571 --> 01:33:00,040
but the dude next to is obsessed with
it.

2239
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,960
He's going to get better at it,
going to get better,

2240
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:03,640
you know,
just no doubt about it.

2241
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,050
Snow,
no way around it,

2242
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:06,520
man.
You know?

2243
01:33:06,521 --> 01:33:09,700
I remember when I was a training jujitsu
heavily,

2244
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:12,880
I would still,
and I still had jobs and stuff,

2245
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,350
you know,
I was busy,

2246
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,530
but I would meet these young kids.
They're like 17 and 18.

2247
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:20,800
They be training two times a day and
lifting weights as well,

2248
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:23,620
and just constantly going over new moves
and I was like,

2249
01:33:23,621 --> 01:33:25,540
this dude has no way I'm catching up.

2250
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:30,190
There's one they have that.
When you have that real true passion

2251
01:33:30,191 --> 01:33:32,380
obsession,
that's the only way to hit real

2252
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:33,370
excellence.
That's true.

2253
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,930
I always tell kids like,
man,

2254
01:33:34,931 --> 01:33:35,950
they'll tell me like,
um,

2255
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:37,421
uh,
you know,

2256
01:33:37,421 --> 01:33:39,590
I want to do this,
I want this,

2257
01:33:39,591 --> 01:33:40,840
I want to be at this,
and I'm just like,

2258
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:45,070
you have no idea to discipline it takes
in order to be the best at your craft.

2259
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,370
Like people don't understand that shit.
Like people will look at like,

2260
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,413
um,
the,

2261
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:49,980
we,
we,

2262
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,940
we kind of take,
take for granted the,

2263
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:55,810
the top of the top of the top of,
of anything really,

2264
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,400
right?
We take that shit for granted because

2265
01:33:57,401 --> 01:34:01,480
you're looking at a finished product and
you don't see the story behind it until

2266
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:03,760
it hits the news,
hits the,

2267
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:07,720
the show that you love.
Watching what the people who are best at

2268
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:09,040
what they do have been doing it for.

2269
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:12,190
Like a great example is like,
I'm a comedy right?

2270
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,160
So like,
this pisses me off when people say like

2271
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:17,410
overnight sensation about a comic,
right?

2272
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:20,860
But then you dig into their background
and they've been working on like 18,

2273
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:23,800
20 years they've been doing gigs or
they've been going on shows and they've

2274
01:34:23,801 --> 01:34:26,350
been just kind of harnessing that craft
and then all of a sudden boom,

2275
01:34:26,351 --> 01:34:27,790
they blow up and people are like,
oh,

2276
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,170
overnights,
bullshit.

2277
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,460
Comedy looks so easy.
It does.

2278
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,490
Because you're just talking like you're
talking right now.

2279
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:35,490
I'll just do it in front of a
microphone.

2280
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:38,650
Say funny shit.
You know how to talk and make a bicycle

2281
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:40,130
club.
And a lot of ways it's kind of been kind

2282
01:34:40,131 --> 01:34:41,630
of like running like,
oh,

2283
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,620
what is your running back?
Can run.

2284
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:48,700
He's got to catch the ball to catch a
ball problem would be the greatest ever.

2285
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,380
I'm the best at running.
How do you,

2286
01:34:50,381 --> 01:34:51,940
how are you the best?
I'll just add man.

2287
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:56,200
I just my mentality,
I know I know how to do it,

2288
01:34:56,201 --> 01:34:57,680
but I don't know how to catch that ball
and run.

2289
01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:58,120
man.

2290
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,230
I like this last like two or three
months.

2291
01:35:00,231 --> 01:35:00,771
I've been,
uh,

2292
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:04,010
I've been going to the,
to the laugh factory and comedy stores

2293
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:07,690
and stuff or a comedy venues and uh,
I just,

2294
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,400
I just have a whole new respect for
comedians.

2295
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,440
that shit is so hard,
man.

2296
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:15,200
It's like you go to a venue and people
were just sitting in that chair,

2297
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:16,790
like,
yo make me laugh.

2298
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:19,430
It's the weirdest shit ever.
And you guys do it.

2299
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,470
Like it's,
I got so much respect for comedians.

2300
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,510
There's a weird gig.
Well,

2301
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,490
Not only do it with chuck out our
material every two years.

2302
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,650
Exactly.
That's where I'm at right now.

2303
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:29,370
I'm like four months in.
Right?

2304
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:32,570
That's hard dude,
because I'm working on shit.

2305
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:35,060
That's like,
a lot of it's on rubber legs.

2306
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:37,620
It's not so super solid.
yeah,

2307
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:39,210
some of it's solid.
I would have asked.

2308
01:35:39,211 --> 01:35:40,520
So.
So what's the process?

2309
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,770
So it's like,
do you think of jokes?

2310
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,470
Like do you sit down and I mean,
I,

2311
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:46,250
I'm totally ignorant to this.
So like,

2312
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:48,170
do You sit down and you'd be like,
all right,

2313
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:51,160
I'm going to write funny shit today for
like an hour or like,

2314
01:35:51,161 --> 01:35:54,020
or just randomly go throughout your day
and

2315
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:59,790
this is
a body man,

2316
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:06,160
that's the brazos.
Now I'll be tAlking about some talking

2317
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:09,010
about some crazy shit.
That's the main process.

2318
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:11,650
No,
that's part of the process.

2319
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:13,660
The other part of the process is sitting
down,

2320
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,670
um,
uh,

2321
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:19,390
maybe a sit down,
thinking about things like maybe just

2322
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:22,570
sometimes I'll watch a documentary to
watch a documentary and sometimes I'll

2323
01:36:22,571 --> 01:36:26,440
watch it because I go,
I bet there's some material in this

2324
01:36:26,441 --> 01:36:29,500
subject and then sometimes I'll just sit
right in front of my computer or

2325
01:36:29,501 --> 01:36:34,330
sometimes I'll sit with a pad and a pen
and a piece of paper or sometimes I'm

2326
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:36,300
just in my car and an idea you don't
want.

2327
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,150
One of the things that gets me,
it's,

2328
01:36:38,151 --> 01:36:40,030
it's,
it's tough to do because I like to,

2329
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:41,950
I like to listen to shit when I'm in my
car,

2330
01:36:41,951 --> 01:36:44,660
but I find out when I don't listen to
shit wanna just have the,

2331
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:46,210
the,
the sound off.

2332
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:48,940
No radio.
I'll come up with ideas because my mInd

2333
01:36:48,941 --> 01:36:53,680
is forced to think and then I'll write
those ideas down and then once you wrIte

2334
01:36:53,681 --> 01:36:55,670
those ideas down,
any idea that you write down,

2335
01:36:55,671 --> 01:36:56,980
it was like a seed,
you know,

2336
01:36:56,981 --> 01:37:00,040
and then you try to water that seed and
you try to get It to grow into something

2337
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:03,610
that's viable and half of them don't
ever grow.

2338
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:07,320
At least if you're lucky,
have like,

2339
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:10,000
I try,
I try to write some jokes and be like,

2340
01:37:10,001 --> 01:37:12,580
let me see what these people go through.
And it's just like,

2341
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:14,680
you know where to start.
Yeah,

2342
01:37:14,681 --> 01:37:15,730
it's hard.
It's crazy.

2343
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:19,000
It's just a matter of starting,
like knowing where to start is hard,

2344
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:23,020
but the key is to really just start.
And then once you start then you sort of

2345
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:25,770
chop it down like you start,
you write a bunch of shit down and

2346
01:37:25,771 --> 01:37:28,000
you're all this nonsense,
but maybe there's something right there.

2347
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,910
And he'd take that little piece of It
and then I'll put that on copy and paste

2348
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:33,130
out on another thing.
And then I'll start from scratch.

2349
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:38,310
So like I might write 1500,
2000 words and then out of those words

2350
01:37:38,831 --> 01:37:41,900
is a paragraph there,
maybe something in that paragraph and

2351
01:37:41,901 --> 01:37:44,740
then I'll pull that paragraph thrown in
somewhere else and then maybe I'll go

2352
01:37:44,741 --> 01:37:47,320
back over that other 2000 words that I
didn't,

2353
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:51,200
you know,
take and I'll do it with fresh eyes like

2354
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:55,800
the next day and maybe a new thought.
It's that process that we don't that

2355
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:56,040
like

2356
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,470
I just,
I just have super respect for a man

2357
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,420
because it's like,
it's,

2358
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,980
it's a fun job though,
man.

2359
01:38:01,981 --> 01:38:02,820
Like,
look dude,

2360
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:05,220
I've been doing it for like almost 30
years.

2361
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,270
You can't play football for almost 30
years.

2362
01:38:07,271 --> 01:38:10,510
She gave up
nothing.

2363
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,240
He goes,
you're so glad about that.

2364
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:17,880
Your mind gets a little fucked up.
Your mind can get fucked up.

2365
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:20,700
Your mind gets fucked up wHen things
aren't going well.

2366
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:21,691
It's,
it's always,

2367
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:22,290
it's,
it's,

2368
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:26,820
it's,
it's so intriguing to me how like

2369
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:31,490
comedians are really kind of like the
narrators of our society and they kinda

2370
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,150
just,
they,

2371
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:38,360
they find a way to like explain that
shit.

2372
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:39,900
That's,
that's normal everybody.

2373
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:42,120
And to look at it and see how silly is
this shit.

2374
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,190
You know what I mean?
And that's why.

2375
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,810
That's why I love.
I love comedy is such an art to me man.

2376
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:48,990
So you're thinking about doing it.
I want to do it just like as a bucket

2377
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:51,420
list thing.
Just to try and say I'm not,

2378
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:55,110
I'm not trying to be like a touring.
I just want to like retirement.

2379
01:38:55,111 --> 01:38:57,030
So I'm just like,
I'm looking at shit that's interesting

2380
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:57,540
to me.
I was like,

2381
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,130
I'm gonna try it man.
This comedians,

2382
01:38:59,131 --> 01:39:00,810
they get real upset about that kind of
shit.

2383
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:01,541
Really?
Yeah.

2384
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:02,374
Yeah.
They go,

2385
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:04,520
these guys think they can do what we do
not,

2386
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:07,920
but that's what I'm trying.
But I don't feel like that at all.

2387
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,350
My,
my feelings totally opposite.

2388
01:39:10,351 --> 01:39:13,260
My feeling is you could,
you definitely could definitely do it.

2389
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:16,110
I appreciate the smart guy.
I'm pretty sure you're funny.

2390
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:18,000
I think you could do.
I think anybody could do it if you're

2391
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:19,440
funny.
If you're smart and you're funny and

2392
01:39:19,441 --> 01:39:20,710
you're honest,
you'll start.

2393
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:22,320
Everybody starts from a different spot.

2394
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:24,270
Like there's some people that are just
naturally funny.

2395
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:26,250
I met some people like my friend eddie
bravo,

2396
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:29,430
I tried to talk him about doing standup.
He did it a bunch of times back in the

2397
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,230
day,
but he's just naturally funny.

2398
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,620
He just says funny shIt.
He sees funny shit and I was like,

2399
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:35,790
dude,
you're a comedian.

2400
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,820
You just never did it.
like you could be hilarious because

2401
01:39:38,821 --> 01:39:42,660
he'll fucking have us client some nights
just ridiculous shit,

2402
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:47,940
but it's a matter of starting off with
one step and then you learn how to walk

2403
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:50,430
and then you learn how to run and then
you're going to learn how to run better

2404
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:51,720
and then you got to figure out the
moves.

2405
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,040
I mean,
it's really the bunch.

2406
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:55,140
There's a whole path to it.
It's whether or not you're willing to

2407
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:57,900
take that path because that path might
take 10 years.

2408
01:39:58,050 --> 01:39:59,550
That's what.
That's what everybody says,

2409
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,610
man,
I love good sets before those 10 years,

2410
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:04,020
don't get me wrong.
It's not like 10 years.

2411
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:06,660
Then finally I got a laugh.
Laughs all along the way,

2412
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:09,030
but I sucked.
You know,

2413
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,820
definitely kind of take you awhile to
find out who you are as a,

2414
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:14,640
as a comic and then that's the other
thing though.

2415
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:17,700
You do a special.
Like I just did my last netflix special

2416
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:18,490
bro.
That shit with.

2417
01:40:18,490 --> 01:40:19,920
So comedy.
Oh thanks.

2418
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,790
The dolphin.
Oh my god.

2419
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:24,000
No,
that's a true story.

2420
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,890
I fell out,
man.

2421
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,660
That's a true story.
I was so high.

2422
01:40:27,661 --> 01:40:28,890
I was watching those dogs.
I'm like,

2423
01:40:28,891 --> 01:40:31,060
how come nobody ever catches dolphins on
official?

2424
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,180
Oh fucking smarter than you,
man.

2425
01:40:33,181 --> 01:40:35,510
We're filling with water people.
I started really,

2426
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:39,230
really made me think.
I bet it was gds.

2427
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:40,093
oh,
thank you.

2428
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,270
That was really something that I really
thought about.

2429
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,200
I wrote a blog about it way back in the
day.

2430
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,820
I think it's called hello stranger.
Alright.

2431
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,270
About that.
That very subject.

2432
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:53,010
That's what I love.
Comedy man.

2433
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,420
Like yo,
you,

2434
01:40:55,590 --> 01:41:00,590
you find a way to like encapsulate the,
the weirdest and most brilliant thoughts

2435
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,710
that we have tried.
The problem is once you do one every two

2436
01:41:05,711 --> 01:41:07,360
years,
one of the things that happens is you

2437
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:08,830
run out of shit to talk about.
Right?

2438
01:41:08,831 --> 01:41:09,341
Right.
Oh,

2439
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:11,020
you don't have necessarily anything to
talk about,

2440
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,310
but what I liked to do then when I feel
like stagnant is I like to not do

2441
01:41:15,311 --> 01:41:19,390
anything,
just let my brain like reach its

2442
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,610
balance.
Just come back.

2443
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:24,090
You have ever just went on stage wIth no
materials.

2444
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,290
winged it only on these shows that we
do.

2445
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:28,510
We have these shows called stand up on
the spot.

2446
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:33,250
My friend jeremiah watkins put on the
show where you actually wing it to the

2447
01:41:33,251 --> 01:41:38,251
audience of suggestion so the audience
will yell out like a a bushes paintings

2448
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:41,870
because George Bush paints.
Now you're seeing his painting not seen

2449
01:41:41,871 --> 01:41:44,030
as this nice.
Some of them are weird.

2450
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:44,861
Yeah.
Not bad.

2451
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:46,270
Better than me.
That's dope man.

2452
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:47,163
I mean,
I

2453
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:52,940
don't know criminaLs or whatever,
but he can separate.

2454
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,670
You kind of have to.
Right.

2455
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:00,700
I was trying to explain that to somebody
about bill cosby and I was like,

2456
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:03,340
It's a very complex situation because
he.

2457
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:06,940
Yes,
he most likely did those things that

2458
01:42:06,941 --> 01:42:09,130
they're accusing him of crazy.
Pretty likely.

2459
01:42:09,131 --> 01:42:10,330
Pretty like,
I don't know.

2460
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:13,060
I wasn't there,
but it seems highly unlikely that that

2461
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:14,800
many people,
and there was always that rumor,

2462
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:19,420
there was always that rumor,
but he also was a brilliant comedian who

2463
01:42:19,421 --> 01:42:20,730
was.
He was a rapist.

2464
01:42:20,731 --> 01:42:23,380
It was like he was a brilliant comedIan.
Alleged rapist,

2465
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:25,330
man.
You got to got to say like,

2466
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:26,141
like,
oh jay,

2467
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:27,100
right?
Oh yeah,

2468
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:29,530
fucking murder a man.
But like two could play.

2469
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,440
That was nice.
Was nice man,

2470
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:35,230
but I don't.
I don't understand how people can't

2471
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:38,770
separate your performance from you who
you are as a human.

2472
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:41,350
I never understood that.
Did you see the recent thing where his

2473
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:45,340
doctor said that if the understanding of
cte was available back then,

2474
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:48,310
they might've used that as a defense as
awful.

2475
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,600
It's crazy.
Well,

2476
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,470
what's really crazy is that doctor is
essentially saying that jose oj did it

2477
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:55,560
even though he was acquitted.
Yeah.

2478
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,150
He's in jail for.
That means jail for stealing and shit.

2479
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,650
I know in that funny.
He might get out soon.

2480
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:00,990
Yeah,
I know who he is though.

2481
01:43:00,991 --> 01:43:03,910
I thought it was like december.
I think he has an opportunity,

2482
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:06,120
I think in october,
but I think it's one of those things

2483
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:09,220
like a parole thing because I think he's
in jail for 25 years,

2484
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:13,000
but I think he's been in jail for nine
and he might get released,

2485
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:16,090
but is that what it is?
It says october,

2486
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:19,210
but here's the thing man.
You kind of know that they're not reaLly

2487
01:43:19,211 --> 01:43:22,600
jailing him for that.
Not really jaylin him for that.

2488
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:26,560
Which is weird that the the.
Because he was trying to get back his

2489
01:43:26,561 --> 01:43:27,520
stuff,
right?

2490
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:31,420
Yeah.
If people don't know the story of oj,

2491
01:43:31,421 --> 01:43:36,110
I believe someone had stolen some of his
autographed merchandise or as

2492
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:40,150
memorabilia and he was trying to get it
back and someone in the room with them

2493
01:43:40,151 --> 01:43:42,190
had a gun.
Like the guy he went,

2494
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,840
we held.
They held them hostage.

2495
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:46,330
They pulled a gun out.
I think they had it out,

2496
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:50,680
but I think what it was was they went
into the room with the people and lock

2497
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:52,070
the door and nobody's leaving,
which is

2498
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,740
like a kidnapping charge.
Can't kidnap people.

2499
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:56,120
Man.
That's crazy though,

2500
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:58,520
that we're supposed to believe that.
That's what kept him in jail for nine

2501
01:43:58,521 --> 01:44:00,350
years.
So you definitely know because if you

2502
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:05,150
watched the judges deliberation when he
was going to jail them,

2503
01:44:05,151 --> 01:44:08,230
you could tell it was like we deserved
the.

2504
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:09,180
Yeah,
you deserve this.

2505
01:44:09,181 --> 01:44:12,140
Like just throwing the book.
If that was your first offense,

2506
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,970
you might not even be in jail.
Yeah,

2507
01:44:13,971 --> 01:44:16,390
I kinda believe they're not going to
give him parole on the.

2508
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,213
I don't know,
man.

2509
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:21,350
I just got to hold.
The whole thing was so weird to me,

2510
01:44:21,351 --> 01:44:22,660
man.
There was a,

2511
01:44:22,661 --> 01:44:24,800
um,
there was a woman who was in the manson

2512
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:26,750
family who,
uh,

2513
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,800
was one of the people that murdered
Sharon Tate and she was up for parole

2514
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:34,070
recently and they were talking to her
and there were,

2515
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:37,280
you know,
asking her why she did it and how she

2516
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:41,660
did it and she just sort of explained
that she was a part of this call to and

2517
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:44,840
that they had really kinda like
convinced her that this was the way to

2518
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:46,730
do it and this is the way to live.

2519
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:49,100
We have to fight these people and
they're all on acid.

2520
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:51,620
They're all fucking freaking out.
And she was trying to explain it and

2521
01:44:51,621 --> 01:44:52,340
they're like,
yeah,

2522
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:57,340
no parole
explaining how she stabbed her and the

2523
01:44:57,591 --> 01:44:59,930
woman was pregnant too,
just to have the baby.

2524
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:05,620
It's just not,
it's just crazy that some people go to

2525
01:45:05,631 --> 01:45:08,900
jail for life,
for stupid shit.

2526
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,750
Like smoking pot.
Like there's people that are in jail for

2527
01:45:11,751 --> 01:45:14,750
selling pot in there,
in jail with life sentences.

2528
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:16,380
It must have.
I mean,

2529
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:19,310
I guarantee you people have died in jail
for marijuana sales.

2530
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,990
Guaranteed.
Guaranteed.

2531
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:27,010
But It's still of kind of possible that
if you tell somebody you could get out

2532
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:29,140
early,
man.

2533
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,410
It's a depends on who you are actually.
Oh,

2534
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,690
it must.
But uh,

2535
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:35,960
it also depends on the overcrowding of
the state,

2536
01:45:35,961 --> 01:45:37,910
right?
Like someone was telling me that a

2537
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:39,950
Louisiana in particular,
uh,

2538
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:45,190
during new orleans during katrina,
rather like when new orleans was getting

2539
01:45:45,741 --> 01:45:48,080
flooded,
my friend was like,

2540
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,240
dude,
they had what they would call,

2541
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,840
you know,
like instead of felt they would call it

2542
01:45:53,841 --> 01:45:58,841
misdemeanor murder as a joke because
dudes would be murdering guys and they'd

2543
01:45:59,391 --> 01:46:02,390
be out in really short sentences because
they just haven't heard about.

2544
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,510
I heard about that.
Yeah,

2545
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,760
see if you could pull up that term
misdemeanor murder neW orleans,

2546
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,070
because like this guy was joking around
about it and I didn't.

2547
01:46:10,071 --> 01:46:12,620
I never looked into it deep enough to
know whether it was telling the truth,

2548
01:46:12,621 --> 01:46:16,070
but I had heard it more than once.
They were just letting people out.

2549
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:18,050
Murderers.
Yeah,

2550
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:19,040
I think,
yeah.

2551
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:23,210
New orleans often accuses
institutionalized missy misdemeanor

2552
01:46:23,211 --> 01:46:24,450
murder.
Article seven.

2553
01:46:24,451 --> 01:46:25,970
Oh,
one of the criminal code requires the

2554
01:46:25,971 --> 01:46:28,430
state release.
A defendant who has not been charged

2555
01:46:28,431 --> 01:46:31,520
with a crime after 60 days before
hurricane katrina,

2556
01:46:31,521 --> 01:46:35,870
a few hundred people per year were
released under article seven slash 11,

2557
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:39,230
so someone who committed murder,
they wouldn't be charged inside of 60

2558
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:42,080
days because they probably overburdened
and they would let someone out.

2559
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:45,530
Holy shit,
it's there.

2560
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:50,220
The big easy to get away with murder
metal filler article.

2561
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:52,770
Wow.
Yeah,

2562
01:46:52,771 --> 01:46:57,771
so some spots it's just so fucking
chaotic in a way with the people in

2563
01:46:57,841 --> 01:47:00,330
jail.
He's in prison for petty offenses.

2564
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:04,800
Drugs,
still they are violating our rules.

2565
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:06,960
It's ridiculous.
We have too many rules.

2566
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,180
You know,
if that many people are in jail for

2567
01:47:09,181 --> 01:47:11,580
violating rules,
does that necessarily mean that many

2568
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:14,010
people should be in jail or does it mean
we have too many roles,

2569
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:18,360
but you got to figure out like if
someone is a victim of these situations

2570
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:21,210
is so as soon as someone's a victim,
then that's probably where we should

2571
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:22,400
serve and protect.
Right.

2572
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,430
I don't understand how people,

2573
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:27,060
um,
view our laws as the gospel.

2574
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:31,800
I mean,
certain things obviously are

2575
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:36,780
demonstrably bad for society,
but some shit like this is such a,

2576
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:37,861
there,
there,

2577
01:47:37,861 --> 01:47:39,360
there,
there are things that could be amended

2578
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,610
that just needed to be.
Man.

2579
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:42,600
What would you change?
Like if you could,

2580
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:44,790
if you could geT into the judicial
system?

2581
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:45,880
Uh,

2582
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:50,830
well for the drugs there is no way that
they should be first.

2583
01:47:50,831 --> 01:47:52,150
Right?
That's one of the big ones.

2584
01:47:52,151 --> 01:47:53,260
The first one.
That's one of the big ones.

2585
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:55,210
Um,
what else?

2586
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:56,853
Um,

2587
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:02,200
oh no ma'am.
I have to deliberate on now.

2588
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:04,690
I mean the,
uh,

2589
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:09,750
the prison industrial complex as far as
a locking up people of color has been a

2590
01:48:09,941 --> 01:48:12,250
problem in our communities for years.
Uh,

2591
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:16,390
I think that the policing needs to
change.

2592
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,210
I think that,
and I think if you're going to look at

2593
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,130
other,
I mean we juSt got done talking about

2594
01:48:22,131 --> 01:48:23,510
this yesterday,
but I think if you're going to look at

2595
01:48:23,511 --> 01:48:26,960
other parts of the world saying they
need our help places like Afghanistan

2596
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:31,580
where we've sent massive amounts of
troops and resources into Iraq in

2597
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:32,503
particular,
right?

2598
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:37,550
I think if they put that amount of money
to figuring out how to build back these

2599
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:39,480
impoverished communities,
I just,

2600
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:41,210
instead of just leaving them the way
they are.

2601
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:41,900
Yeah,
that's bad.

2602
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:44,330
Figure out some way.
I don't know what the fuck it is mean

2603
01:48:44,430 --> 01:48:47,690
because you'd have to like go through a
couple of generations to get rid of the

2604
01:48:47,691 --> 01:48:51,050
cycle of the negativity that some of
these people have experienced growing up

2605
01:48:51,051 --> 01:48:54,110
with all the crime and all the crime.
PoverTy all the time.

2606
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:55,310
Yeah.
that's right there together.

2607
01:48:55,311 --> 01:48:58,810
And then also the momentum of that crime
and poverty just,

2608
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:02,690
it's hard to break loose of and it
doesn't help by putting them in jail or

2609
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:03,680
worse,
it

2610
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:07,490
becomes a mentality.
So like I always found a significant

2611
01:49:07,491 --> 01:49:10,190
like kind of growing up like in the
inner city,

2612
01:49:10,191 --> 01:49:14,300
like so like violence is so normalized,
right?

2613
01:49:14,301 --> 01:49:16,370
So it's like you like,
like being,

2614
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,400
like being who you like being tough on
the streets was like the good thing to

2615
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:25,830
be growing up and like,
so if you've heard of somebody like it

2616
01:49:25,831 --> 01:49:29,300
says committed murders or,
or beaten up people or whatever like

2617
01:49:29,301 --> 01:49:29,900
that,
like,

2618
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:31,440
and this is fucked up,
but like that,

2619
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,820
that mentality it reverberates through
some of the neighborhoods is like that's

2620
01:49:34,821 --> 01:49:36,560
cool.
Like that's what you want it to be,

2621
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,300
not you don't want to kill people but
you want it to be,

2622
01:49:38,301 --> 01:49:41,490
to have that tough label and that,
that mentality and that site,

2623
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:43,880
their psyche.
It's infectious.

2624
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,540
And you sent me,
so you see it with,

2625
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:47,210
with,
with music and entertainment,

2626
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:48,360
it's,

2627
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,640
it's,
it's something that's embedded in our

2628
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:53,170
and our culture.
And I started way back then but it's

2629
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:57,820
still hEre and it seems like it ramped
up when it became a big part of a

2630
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:00,220
popular rap culture.
Like when I was a kid,

2631
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:03,640
there was not,
you didn't hEar about nearly as much

2632
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:08,641
gang violence as we did after,
like nwa came out when you started

2633
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:11,460
hearing rap music with a lot of violence
in it.

2634
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:12,220
Oh no.
Yeah.

2635
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:15,840
That they were the originators of that.
Yeah,

2636
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:18,310
for sure.
But the violence in the neighborhoods,

2637
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:20,140
they really didn't start with the rap
era.

2638
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:24,160
Started with the crack era,
which the rat very came out of the crack

2639
01:50:24,161 --> 01:50:25,900
era.
So it all came together.

2640
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:26,973
Yeah.
That's good.

2641
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:28,980
That's a really good point actually.
And it's,

2642
01:50:28,981 --> 01:50:30,610
you know,
what else is a really good point too,

2643
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:33,580
is that,
that all sudden it glorified it and it

2644
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:35,800
made a lot of wannabes and that's true.

2645
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:38,130
Um,
and I mean it's,

2646
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:40,480
it's unfortunate but.
And that's why I love art.

2647
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:43,360
Art is always a reflection.
It's a mirror of society,

2648
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,750
right?
So unless you go to that lacma place,

2649
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:50,230
you ever go that la county museum of art
and never seen him don't go.

2650
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:53,170
I appreciate that.
It's one of the modern places where they

2651
01:50:53,171 --> 01:50:56,080
have like a,
a box on the ground.

2652
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:58,060
It was like a plexiglass box.
I go,

2653
01:50:58,061 --> 01:51:00,280
what is that?
Is that that's the actual art,

2654
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:04,780
the plexiglass box,
because the box represents what you want

2655
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:08,920
it to be.
The art looked down at the box.

2656
01:51:08,921 --> 01:51:12,040
It's really brilliant actually when you
think about it that way because the box

2657
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,040
ended up.
Man,

2658
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,970
that's a fucking box.
It's a box.

2659
01:51:15,971 --> 01:51:17,050
It's on the ground.
You know what that is?

2660
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:20,590
That's a dude who you buy weed off of.
That's his coffee table,

2661
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:21,220
right?

2662
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,170
You go over his house.
He said,

2663
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:25,090
hey man,
I love this fucking amber plastic coffee

2664
01:51:25,091 --> 01:51:26,110
table.
You got bro.

2665
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,190
Yeah,
dude,

2666
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:31,420
I fucking chop my buds up on this band
is a nice tent though.

2667
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:32,500
Yeah,
it's not bad,

2668
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,280
but the fact that it was roped off and
that it was an actual.

2669
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,280
It's an actual piece of exhibit.
That's a piece of art.

2670
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:41,800
Fuck you.
I would never have got it.

2671
01:51:41,801 --> 01:51:44,260
Looks like a fuck.
You know?

2672
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:47,240
Someone else that's funded.
It's funded.

2673
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:49,450
That's like,
isn't it like who funds that?

2674
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:52,210
Who funds?
Isn't that a big part of it is public.

2675
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:53,830
It's the la county museum of national
art.

2676
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:55,120
Oh,
that's amazing.

2677
01:51:55,121 --> 01:51:58,090
Because what it represents a spaghetti
and we all liked spaghetti.

2678
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:01,300
It makes you think about your child.
That's crazy.

2679
01:52:01,301 --> 01:52:02,040
You know,
like that.

2680
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,790
What did you like string hanging from
the ceiling?

2681
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:05,170
Yes.
Okay.

2682
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:05,921
Well,
you know what,

2683
01:52:05,921 --> 01:52:08,680
it reminds me of like string hanging
from back when I was a kid.

2684
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:11,620
When you had to rent porn,
you got to go through beads,

2685
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:14,840
like to get to the porno section.
I was in my era,

2686
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:17,700
man.
I'm way older than umass.

2687
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,290
I was there when it all went down.
But see everybody,

2688
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:22,810
like a lot of.
A lot of black moms and grandmas have to

2689
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:27,710
beat
mexican mothers to wiser.

2690
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:29,480
A rock there.
Is that an rps?

2691
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:34,120
The la lacma thing?
Well that's an a rock and it represents

2692
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:37,610
rocks.
Not appreciate how they got the rock.

2693
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:41,500
No,
I don't because this guy could have paid

2694
01:52:41,501 --> 01:52:44,590
for a fucking teacher.
No bunch of shit.

2695
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,460
We just hired a better

2696
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:49,920
group of.
Of coaches for a football team.

2697
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:51,740
Dog.
You do?

2698
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,630
I liked that one.
Well that's why it's there.

2699
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:55,520
You know why?
Because the world's all different,

2700
01:52:55,521 --> 01:52:58,220
like hot food tastes different to me
than it does to some folks.

2701
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,770
It must be.
Some people looked at that and it goes,

2702
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:04,270
it's hazing and they got this feeling.
I could just look at him.

2703
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:06,800
I can appreciate somebody pulling that
rock there.

2704
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:09,950
Somebody might've even looked at that
box on the ground and got that feeling.

2705
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:11,840
I'm not denying.
They'd have to explain that one to me,

2706
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:13,970
whether they'd be like with this is what
it is.

2707
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:16,410
It's like everything is so defined.
Okay.

2708
01:53:16,411 --> 01:53:18,350
And when you read a book,
all the words are in the order.

2709
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:21,170
I mean,
even if you're thinking about what this

2710
01:53:21,171 --> 01:53:22,550
person wrote,
they wrote it.

2711
01:53:22,551 --> 01:53:24,410
Okay,
so they're forcing this into your mind.

2712
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:27,320
So this artist is giving the opportunity
to.

2713
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:32,570
This is giving you the opportunity to
put inside that box or to whatever,

2714
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:34,570
put whatever signification,
whatever,

2715
01:53:34,590 --> 01:53:37,130
whatever important significance of that
box.

2716
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,410
It's all up to your interpretation,
man.

2717
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,230
She has a point.
I don't know why she.

2718
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:43,970
She,
she might.

2719
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,430
She's transitioning.
She seemed like she was transitioning

2720
01:53:46,431 --> 01:53:48,000
while I was talking.
I was like,

2721
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:50,540
I lost my girl.
I started out as a girl and then I got

2722
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:53,650
annoyed and I became a gay guy for a
little while at the end.

2723
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:57,710
That was
the old lady who smoked cigarettes

2724
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:02,300
are very different.
Right?

2725
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:05,900
Like you can go gay guy or lady was
spoke cigarettes.

2726
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:08,780
There's that.
See,

2727
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:12,770
this is where we put the stuff.
Lacma.

2728
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:15,140
There's a video two.
There's a video that was playing at

2729
01:54:15,141 --> 01:54:19,060
giant screen and it was like people
playing catch with a ball thrown into

2730
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:23,600
trip to like slow motion with like a
volleyball catch.

2731
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:25,580
It was so fucking stupid.
I was like,

2732
01:54:25,581 --> 01:54:27,140
what are you doing?
This is,

2733
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:30,880
you've got a video of a guy throwing a
ball to another guy.

2734
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:32,290
Got to be able to express yourself.

2735
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:36,780
I kind of feel them now,
man.

2736
01:54:36,781 --> 01:54:38,040
And that you uh,
what's,

2737
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:39,680
who's funding it?
Who's funding it?

2738
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:41,560
Did we find out the ball thing?
Oh,

2739
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,600
the la county museum of art.
They're probably mad at me right now.

2740
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,540
It's so snotty.
They're good pub man.

2741
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:50,280
So snotty.
So many people that were snoball

2742
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,110
taxpayers have last name.
Oh,

2743
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:56,890
well
I disagree with your fucking schools in

2744
01:54:56,891 --> 01:54:59,000
la.
Think about what teachers get paid.

2745
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:02,420
Think about cops lacmas most reliable
patrons,

2746
01:55:02,421 --> 01:55:06,080
10 million taxpayers,
and I guess people can sign up and give

2747
01:55:06,081 --> 01:55:07,700
money if you like,
being around on the weirdos.

2748
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:10,340
But here's the deal.
Those weirdos,

2749
01:55:10,341 --> 01:55:12,650
man to them.
It's cool when they go there,

2750
01:55:12,651 --> 01:55:13,650
they like it,
you know,

2751
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:16,040
I'm a fucking idiot.
It just because,

2752
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:18,100
I mean,
are you a weirdo?

2753
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:22,070
I'm aware I'm an idiot because I don't,
I don't know how you looking at that

2754
01:55:22,071 --> 01:55:25,400
plastic box in the ground.
Don't appreciate a bunch of people that

2755
01:55:25,401 --> 01:55:27,710
like it.
I got a question for you man.

2756
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:29,240
Okay.
So,

2757
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:31,400
um,
I've been a fan of you for a long time,

2758
01:55:31,401 --> 01:55:32,840
right?
so what?

2759
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:33,980
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

2760
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,480
Appreciate you.
Appreciate what,

2761
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:39,360
uh,
what Made you make this switch from like

2762
01:55:39,361 --> 01:55:44,020
being a moon landing denier to like
crazy if we didn't.

2763
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:46,020
If you don't know,
I don't think we're crazy.

2764
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:46,801
No,
this is.

2765
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:50,400
This is my take on it.
Absolutely.

2766
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:55,110
I don't know enough about astrophysics,
about space travel,

2767
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:59,430
about the science.
That's the work that's been done about

2768
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,280
how to get a rock rocket to the moon and
back.

2769
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:06,570
I definitely don't know enough.
That's rocket science and I've looked at

2770
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:11,690
a lot of very compelling documentaries
that explain why they think it was

2771
01:56:12,001 --> 01:56:16,320
hoaxed and they'll show you some footage
and you can look at some of the footage

2772
01:56:16,321 --> 01:56:19,590
and it looks fake as fuck.
There's some footage that to me looks

2773
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:22,410
really doctored.
There's some delay yet to this day.

2774
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,750
Some guy would.
When you ever seen ones where it looks

2775
01:56:24,751 --> 01:56:27,060
like they're on wire,
so to astronauts are on wires.

2776
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:29,310
I have.
There's somewhere.

2777
01:56:29,311 --> 01:56:31,650
There's a video where they look at their
own trampoline there,

2778
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:32,880
bounced around on trampolines.

2779
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,820
The physics are different in different
videos.

2780
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:38,610
This is where it gets weird,
like the physics are different from the

2781
01:56:38,611 --> 01:56:41,700
apollo 11 moon landing.
We see them waddle around on the surface

2782
01:56:41,701 --> 01:56:44,760
of the moon.
They moving it like half speed and then

2783
01:56:44,761 --> 01:56:48,060
you see them in other ones like the one
where they bounce around the area,

2784
01:56:48,061 --> 01:56:50,850
like they're moving different during the
same thing,

2785
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:53,340
but it looks different.
The first one was very grainy.

2786
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:58,341
They showed it on a projection screen.
It's just there's a.

2787
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:01,170
There's a couple different
possibilities.

2788
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:06,270
One possibility is it just looks weird
because it's on the moon and your brain

2789
01:57:06,271 --> 01:57:07,860
is trying to interpret it and your
brain's going,

2790
01:57:07,861 --> 01:57:09,240
well,
that's fake because you don't really

2791
01:57:09,241 --> 01:57:12,890
understand with one six ers,
gravity really does to a body of.

2792
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:15,990
That's one possibility.
Another possibility,

2793
01:57:15,991 --> 01:57:20,991
which has been shown to be true is that
some of the stuff that they passed off

2794
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:26,570
as being legitimate photographs of space
travel was actually test runs where they

2795
01:57:27,841 --> 01:57:31,890
blacked out the background and pretended
that they were in space and there's one

2796
01:57:31,891 --> 01:57:34,800
really clear example of this is Michael
Collins,

2797
01:57:34,801 --> 01:57:37,110
Michael Collins,
who was a guy who was a board apollo 11

2798
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:38,850
and jim and I 15.

2799
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:44,270
There's a photo of him in the middle of
a sea of.

2800
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:47,160
What is it when they walk around outside
the space,

2801
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:49,620
these facebook.
Why does that seem like a bad word?

2802
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:51,750
It's like spacewalk,
like if it doesn't seem like that's the

2803
01:57:51,751 --> 01:57:55,140
official title is the middle of a
spacewalk probably something more.

2804
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:57,180
A little more syllables.
Yeah,

2805
01:57:57,181 --> 01:57:58,770
something slicker.
Anyway,

2806
01:57:58,771 --> 01:58:02,160
so he's doing the space walk and he's
got this harness on is holding onto this

2807
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:07,760
thing and it was apparently just an
image that had already been published,

2808
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:13,070
have him in a training exercise and they
blacked out the background and flipped

2809
01:58:13,071 --> 01:58:16,980
the picture upside down.
So same exact photo,

2810
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:19,320
same exact photo.
I mean people have lined it up and

2811
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:21,190
switched it over.
It's the same photo.

2812
01:58:21,191 --> 01:58:25,890
It's just been edited.
So the one on the left was them

2813
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:28,670
practicing how to use these.
I don't get that.

2814
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:31,290
The harness is some sort of a thing that
you're hanging onto it.

2815
01:58:31,291 --> 01:58:32,640
I guess it moves them around a little
bit.

2816
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:36,060
They were trying to practice it on the
left and the right.

2817
01:58:36,061 --> 01:58:38,640
They just pass it off.
But those are publicity photos.

2818
01:58:38,641 --> 01:58:39,474
Right.
Alright.

2819
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,351
So you got to go.
Well,

2820
01:58:40,351 --> 01:58:42,370
okay,
well who approves the publicity photos?

2821
01:58:42,371 --> 01:58:47,371
It could easily be just some idiot who
works in the publicity department who

2822
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:51,040
didn't marketing and who didn't think
they had enough photos from the moon

2823
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:54,190
that we're good of spacewalks.
It's probably insanely difficult to take

2824
01:58:54,191 --> 01:58:57,520
a spacewalk photo.
So does that mean that they faked the

2825
01:58:57,521 --> 01:58:58,450
moon landing?
No,

2826
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,450
but it means that people fake things.
So you've got to throw it,

2827
01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:03,030
like,
got to be really objective and looking

2828
01:59:03,031 --> 01:59:04,000
at that.
Okay.

2829
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:09,450
So people say fake things.
They definitely filmed a lot of the um,

2830
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:13,540
the training exercises that they did
have the moon landing.

2831
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:16,450
They filmed a lot of shit.
They definitely did.

2832
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:22,680
If that is already been proven that they
took this fake photograph and they tried

2833
01:59:23,801 --> 01:59:25,540
to pass it off as a real space.
Right.

2834
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:29,050
It's entirely possible that some of the
stuff that they filmed,

2835
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:33,130
they made out to look like they were on
the moon when they were not.

2836
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:36,280
But does that mean they didn't go to the
moon?

2837
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,780
No,
it doesn't.

2838
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:40,990
And so when I was saying it proves that
they didn't go to the moon,

2839
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:46,930
I,
my critique of myself is that I didn't

2840
01:59:46,931 --> 01:59:50,980
look at it objectively because I wanted
one conclusion to be true and I wanted

2841
01:59:50,981 --> 01:59:52,960
that conclusion to be that the moon
landing was fake.

2842
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:56,260
So I looked at it and I Was and I was
saying to myself,

2843
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:59,230
okay,
did I come to this conclusion because

2844
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:02,410
there's a lot of evidence that shows it
to be fake or have I seen a lot of

2845
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:05,980
evidence that looks fake and does that
mean that they didn't go to the moon?

2846
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,903
No,
it doesn't.

2847
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:08,440
There's,
there's a bunch of different

2848
02:00:08,441 --> 02:00:10,750
possibilities.
There's a ton of different

2849
02:00:10,751 --> 02:00:12,910
possibilities.
There's also the possibility that

2850
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:17,710
whatever photographs they took can get
severely damaged in the radiation of

2851
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:20,050
space and it was really difficult to do.
Right.

2852
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:23,980
That's possible too.
And that they decided somehow or another

2853
02:00:23,981 --> 02:00:28,600
that they were going to pass off these,
that they actually did go and they're

2854
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:31,570
deciding they're going to pass off some
of these fake videos.

2855
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:35,440
So there's a bunch of possibilities.
The possibility that it looks fake

2856
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:39,670
because I'm dumb and because I don't
understand anything about the physics of

2857
02:00:39,671 --> 02:00:43,280
one six earth's gravity and it just
looks weird because it's shitty film in

2858
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:45,970
1969.
That's possibility number one.

2859
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:50,860
Number two is they fake some things.
Or number three is they didn't really

2860
02:00:50,861 --> 02:00:55,530
have good footage because like you
couldn't take film through the airport,

2861
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:58,650
remember that like people would go
through those right radar detectors and

2862
02:00:58,651 --> 02:01:00,460
you're filming get jacked and they
wouldn't,

2863
02:01:00,461 --> 02:01:01,760
weren't responsible,
you didn't use film.

2864
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:03,400
But I know people that might,
you know,

2865
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:06,520
I have friends that are photographers
and um,

2866
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:08,680
my uncle's a photographer and he would
tell me,

2867
02:01:08,681 --> 02:01:12,510
you can't send the film.
Like if you have like you've taken a

2868
02:01:12,511 --> 02:01:15,700
roll of film and the awesome,
I don't know,

2869
02:01:15,701 --> 02:01:20,200
I don't know what the fuck they did,
but I know that some film has been

2870
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:23,690
damaged or maybe it's an urban myth.
Maybe would find out.

2871
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,920
Film got damaged by a,
those radar things in the air force.

2872
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:31,740
X-rays,
ex-rays theory.

2873
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:36,010
I could appreciate the mindset though of
looking at your opinion objective,

2874
02:01:36,011 --> 02:01:36,820
lee,
and saying,

2875
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:39,830
am I tripping?
It's look at the facts and say,

2876
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,440
I'm just not really sure.
I think that's the problem with people

2877
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:46,100
today when people in period is that
they're afraid to say,

2878
02:01:46,101 --> 02:01:47,630
I don't know.
YoU know what I mean?

2879
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:49,280
They're super afraid.
It's like,

2880
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:51,350
to me,
ignorance is such a gift,

2881
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:54,710
like it just gives you an opportunity to
learn some shit if you're humble enough,

2882
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:57,920
like don't assume you know.
Even the shit I feel like I know I still

2883
02:01:57,921 --> 02:01:59,420
feel like I don't know.
Yeah.

2884
02:01:59,421 --> 02:02:02,540
Well that seems.
You have a very healthy ego for a big

2885
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:07,370
young fucking super athlete.
It's fucking fucking football man.

2886
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:09,560
Like no,
but I'm saying he goes very healthy.

2887
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:11,300
You have a really good way of looking at
things.

2888
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:14,240
I think that's the right way to be mad
at.

2889
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:19,220
You can't be married to,
to like ideas and opinions like that

2890
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,680
because they're not you,
but we think that they are.

2891
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,710
They're like an extension of us,
so we want to win these arguments.

2892
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:28,490
That's why we want to be right.
I think it gets real scary when you want

2893
02:02:28,491 --> 02:02:30,770
to be right,
and then you're willing to ignore

2894
02:02:30,771 --> 02:02:32,570
evidence that might show that you're
wrong.

2895
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:35,720
That's how I felt about myself and by
the way,

2896
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:38,120
if you wanted to see if you wanted a
conspiracy,

2897
02:02:38,121 --> 02:02:40,880
that's a good one.
That seems like it might be possible.

2898
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,740
The moon landings.
One of the best ones,

2899
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:48,070
and this is why it's so attractive
between 1969 in 1973.

2900
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:50,900
He's still on the fence about this,
huh?

2901
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:51,770
No,
no,

2902
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:53,770
not at all.
I'm not enough.

2903
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,250
I'm on the,
I don't know shit fence.

2904
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:59,390
That's where I lived,
but between the facts on this side.

2905
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:00,920
I'm with you though.
They sent,

2906
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,890
I think it was seven mission.
Six of them were successful.

2907
02:03:03,891 --> 02:03:06,110
The only one that wasn't successful as
apollo 13.

2908
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:08,750
right.
They sent these fucking people around

2909
02:03:08,751 --> 02:03:11,630
the moon.
Two hundred 50,000 plus miles out there

2910
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:15,740
and back,
but ever since then all they've been

2911
02:03:15,741 --> 02:03:18,800
able to do is get people into near earth
orbit ever since then,

2912
02:03:18,801 --> 02:03:21,500
like the highest anyone's ever gone.
I think it'S 400 miles,

2913
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:26,770
so they went from 260,000 miles all the
way to the moon and back to 400 miles.

2914
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,490
Everything iS like inside and they've
never gone through the van.

2915
02:03:31,491 --> 02:03:34,120
Allen radiation belts.
I never got into deep space and return.

2916
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:36,400
They haven't done that since 19,
60,

2917
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:37,940
1973.
I thought,

2918
02:03:37,941 --> 02:03:39,770
and I could be wrong,
but I thought it was because of like

2919
02:03:39,771 --> 02:03:43,130
funding could be like,
because you know we not lacmas got

2920
02:03:43,131 --> 02:03:44,540
funds.
Show me,

2921
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:47,180
show me how that makes sense.
You don't want to fund space travel.

2922
02:03:47,181 --> 02:03:51,230
You want to fund that fucking acrylic
box or box editor by the way.

2923
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:54,590
That's perfect.
It is great.

2924
02:03:54,591 --> 02:03:55,910
One,
I don't,

2925
02:03:56,510 --> 02:04:00,020
I don't think that I know whether or not
we went to the moon,

2926
02:04:00,050 --> 02:04:04,670
but I'm telling you that if you wanted a
juicy conspiracy to get excited about,

2927
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:07,070
I've looked into.
It's the best one to get excited about.

2928
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:11,390
I lost all the data I see because I see
like,

2929
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:13,990
you know,
you go down to youtube wormhole and you

2930
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:19,540
start watching barry sanders highlight
and then I'm looking at a jfk being

2931
02:04:19,641 --> 02:04:23,460
Michael Jackson and it.
But like I,

2932
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:24,210
I,
I,

2933
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:27,260
I,
I just don't see what the motive would

2934
02:04:27,261 --> 02:04:31,340
be like what is the fucking cold war?
First of all,

2935
02:04:31,341 --> 02:04:34,250
we wanted to beat the russians because
we were in a race to see who didn't get

2936
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:37,100
to the moon and here's one of the things
that we do know for a fact.

2937
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,190
The russians faked

2938
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:40,620
a bunch of shit.
They faked a bunch of footage.

2939
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:42,090
Yeah.
Yuri gagarin,

2940
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:45,090
who's the first man in space.
They had a video,

2941
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:46,580
might be an expert on this man,
but there.

2942
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:47,610
Well,
I studied this.

2943
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:49,770
I debated a guy who was a really nice
guy,

2944
02:04:49,771 --> 02:04:53,970
but I'm phil plait,
who's a bad astronomer?

2945
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:55,750
Astronomer.com.
Okay.

2946
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:56,840
And um,
he,

2947
02:04:56,850 --> 02:04:59,400
he was a lot of thIngs he wasn't willing
to admit though that were unfortunate

2948
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:02,370
because maybe he could have convinced me
more if he was.

2949
02:05:02,371 --> 02:05:05,670
And one of the big ones was that warner
von braun was a nazi.

2950
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:08,730
We,
they hIred a bunch of nazis to,

2951
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,810
to run the space program.
It was called operation paperclip and

2952
02:05:12,811 --> 02:05:15,570
what operation paperclip was,
where they took a bunch of nazi

2953
02:05:15,571 --> 02:05:17,850
scientists and relocated them to the
United States.

2954
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:21,120
We lost some of them to Russia.
Russia scooped up some of them.

2955
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:25,200
But when we ended the world war ii and
nazi Germany collapsed,

2956
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:27,600
we went in and took the scientists,
will,

2957
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:31,920
wernher von braun was the head of a
rocket factory in,

2958
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:32,813
in,
um,

2959
02:05:33,450 --> 02:05:38,450
in berlin where these to hang the five
slow as jews in front of the rocket

2960
02:05:39,121 --> 02:05:43,110
factory for all the other workers to see
warner von braun,

2961
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:46,590
the simon wIesenthal center said if
wernher von braun was alive today,

2962
02:05:46,591 --> 02:05:48,630
he'd be punished for crimes against
humanity.

2963
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:51,790
This is news.
No,

2964
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:56,310
wernher von braun was a straight up nazi
and this guy was not willing to admit

2965
02:05:56,311 --> 02:05:57,144
that,
you know,

2966
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:58,021
it's like,
well,

2967
02:05:58,021 --> 02:05:59,460
you know,
just because someone's in Germany.

2968
02:05:59,461 --> 02:05:59,601
No,
no,

2969
02:05:59,601 --> 02:05:59,820
no,
no,

2970
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:00,181
no,
no,

2971
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:01,340
no.
He was a nazi.

2972
02:06:01,690 --> 02:06:04,110
He was a nazi.
Were there any actually killed anybody?

2973
02:06:04,210 --> 02:06:06,150
Maybe had to be a nazi.
I mean,

2974
02:06:06,151 --> 02:06:07,290
we're not saying that.
Look,

2975
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:11,310
if you're fucked and you're in this
neighborhood and that it overcomes the

2976
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:13,140
entire neighborhood,
you want to keep your family alive.

2977
02:06:13,141 --> 02:06:14,260
So you put that thing on your,
uh,

2978
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:17,310
your jacket sleeve.
You put that swastika on and you see a

2979
02:06:17,311 --> 02:06:20,700
guy like everybody else.
Maybe you're not really a nazi.

2980
02:06:20,701 --> 02:06:23,070
Ideologically,
maybe you're not seeing your heart,

2981
02:06:23,071 --> 02:06:25,710
maybe just trying to stay alive.
That's entirely possible too,

2982
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:30,420
but he was a nazi.
He was a fucking nazi and they had

2983
02:06:30,421 --> 02:06:34,470
slaves that were running rocket
factories in berlin where they were

2984
02:06:34,471 --> 02:06:36,210
figuring out how to make rockets.

2985
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:38,580
I said,
brandon,

2986
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:39,301
I got.
I got.

2987
02:06:39,301 --> 02:06:40,680
I need to.
Yeah.

2988
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:44,640
Operation paperclip,
cold war president truman authorized

2989
02:06:44,641 --> 02:06:49,641
operation paperclip in august of 1945.
The us army secretly admitted 88 german

2990
02:06:49,801 --> 02:06:53,130
scientists and engineers to help the
development of rocket technology,

2991
02:06:53,131 --> 02:06:55,920
including wernher von braun,
arthur rudolph,

2992
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:59,790
and her buttocks struggled.
Her berkus,

2993
02:06:59,830 --> 02:07:03,000
her roberta's hubertus ubertis.
That's a great name.

2994
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:04,440
It's not a great name.
Bring that back.

2995
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:08,160
If you have a fucking stud kid.
It was like one of the strongest men in

2996
02:07:08,161 --> 02:07:09,790
the world.
His name is hugh bertis.

2997
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:12,530
My you.
It

2998
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:18,480
was named after announcing,
so that was like something in the debate

2999
02:07:18,481 --> 02:07:22,530
that guy was not willing to admit,
which made me even more skeptical that

3000
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:27,030
he was right about the other stuff.
The other thing was that they like and

3001
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:31,410
moon rocks that they've collected from
the moon have turned out to not really

3002
02:07:31,411 --> 02:07:35,920
be moon rocks like a bunch of them for
sure have been tested by scientists and

3003
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:39,010
they found that these rocks are from
another planet.

3004
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:42,640
There was,
there was a rock that thEy gave to

3005
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:47,670
whoever's the head of holland and it was
personally given with a plaque by neil

3006
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:49,870
armstrong,
buzz aldrin,

3007
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:53,050
and Michael Collins,
and it turned out to be petrified.

3008
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:58,051
Wood moon rock given to holland by neil
armstrong and buzz aldrin is fake.

3009
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:02,680
It's a moon rock given to the dutch
prime minister by the apollo 11

3010
02:08:02,681 --> 02:08:05,200
astronauts in 1969 turned out to be a
fake.

3011
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:08,890
So they were giving people pieces of
petrified wood saying,

3012
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:11,110
this is for you.
We went to the moon.

3013
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:13,880
God bless America,
growing 300,

3014
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:18,820
8,000 euros.
Now there's a bunch of possibilities.

3015
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:20,890
Okay,
let's just be honest about this because

3016
02:08:20,891 --> 02:08:24,340
this story's from 2009.
It's entirely possible that between

3017
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:26,590
1,969 that.
Well,

3018
02:08:26,591 --> 02:08:28,240
this is.
There's multiple sources,

3019
02:08:28,241 --> 02:08:32,410
but that's the telegraph.
That's a legit news source for sure.

3020
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,160
What I'm saying is that it's entirely
possible that someone stole that moon

3021
02:08:36,161 --> 02:08:38,050
rock and replaced with that.

3022
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:39,910
That's possible.
That's possible,

3023
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:43,270
or as possible.
They just had some fake rocks.

3024
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,360
Here's the thing.
Bill clinton had a fucking.

3025
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,540
He had a quote in his book in one of his
books,

3026
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:54,460
I think his book is called my life,
and he had a quote about the moon

3027
02:08:54,461 --> 02:08:58,640
landing and a story about him having
this conversation with a carpenter under

3028
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:01,870
carpenter said that he didn't believe
the moon landing.

3029
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,540
He goes,
them television fellers they can make

3030
02:09:04,541 --> 02:09:06,760
anything look real,
and he said,

3031
02:09:06,761 --> 02:09:08,880
this is a quote and bill clinton's
fucking book.

3032
02:09:08,881 --> 02:09:10,750
He saId,
back then I thought that guy was a

3033
02:09:10,751 --> 02:09:13,540
quack,
but after our crank,

3034
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:16,480
whatever crazy person,
but after eight years in the white

3035
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:18,250
house,
I was wondering if he wasn't ahead of

3036
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:19,600
his time.
Oh wow.

3037
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:24,340
This is a guy that was the fucking
president of the United States and he's

3038
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:29,400
talking specifically about an old carpet
telling them the moon landing was fake,

3039
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:33,160
and then he says,
I wondered after eight years in the

3040
02:09:33,161 --> 02:09:35,620
white house,
if that guy wasn't ahead of his time.

3041
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,830
Causation,
correlation.

3042
02:09:38,831 --> 02:09:39,580
Yeah,
no,

3043
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:40,510
look,
look,

3044
02:09:40,511 --> 02:09:41,960
could be bullshit.
Yeah,

3045
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:43,690
could be bullshit.
One hundred percent.

3046
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:46,570
It could be just a good story and I
think that's the thing about conspiracy

3047
02:09:46,571 --> 02:09:49,900
theories is like they lead you on all
these dead end chases.

3048
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:52,090
Oh yeah.
What's weiRd is that trump's a

3049
02:09:52,091 --> 02:09:55,520
conspiracy theorist is a lot more
adjectives.

3050
02:09:55,521 --> 02:09:56,850
You can add on to that.
Yeah,

3051
02:09:56,950 --> 02:10:01,530
but the conspiracy theory aspect is
interesting as far as I know.

3052
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:03,070
he's to want to know about.
You have those.

3053
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:04,600
That's probably what the first shit he
did.

3054
02:10:04,601 --> 02:10:06,640
He probably sat down.
What's going on with the aliens?

3055
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:09,610
Where do we hAve an interest in it?
Where do we stand?

3056
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:12,880
You would get It.
I do.

3057
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,880
I do.
I don't think we have been visited.

3058
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:17,350
Come on onto.
Let me tell you something.

3059
02:10:17,370 --> 02:10:19,630
Okay.
You become the president.

3060
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,340
President foster.
How are you,

3061
02:10:21,341 --> 02:10:22,180
sir?
Would you,

3062
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:23,350
uh,
would you like to do today?

3063
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,320
Uh,
I like to find out if there's fucking

3064
02:10:26,321 --> 02:10:29,140
aliens.
First of all,

3065
02:10:29,141 --> 02:10:30,250
man.
Oh man.

3066
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:32,080
First day on the job,
I'm like,

3067
02:10:32,110 --> 02:10:34,010
take me to the.
I need to know

3068
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,800
what the fuck we're up against.
Are they real?

3069
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:40,250
I need to know.
There's no way I would need to know if

3070
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:42,080
you knew that there might be a
possibility.

3071
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:43,810
They knew you sat down with all the
apps.

3072
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:46,060
I definitely had to ask you.
Fuck ya know,

3073
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:48,860
if you heard rumblings of you and mike
pence were in the elevator.

3074
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:50,360
Um,
mr [inaudible] would be my vice

3075
02:10:50,361 --> 02:10:50,991
president.
Okay.

3076
02:10:50,991 --> 02:10:53,140
who would you vote for?
President and I am not mike.

3077
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:54,260
Mike,
mike pence.

3078
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:55,490
But yeah,
we own elevator.

3079
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:58,970
Who would it be?
You don't want to be vice president?

3080
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,810
No shit bro.
That's means you get shot at a sam

3081
02:11:02,811 --> 02:11:03,410
harris.
Man.

3082
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:04,221
That's a good one.
That's,

3083
02:11:04,221 --> 02:11:05,140
that's my,
that's my girl.

3084
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:08,300
I would let him be president though.
Have you had him on you a bunch of

3085
02:11:08,301 --> 02:11:08,960
times?
Really?

3086
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:09,930
Yeah.
Bunch of times.

3087
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:12,390
He's on a week.
two was crazy.

3088
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:15,530
I'm subscribed to you on youtube and the
shit keeps kicking me off and I don't

3089
02:11:15,531 --> 02:11:16,920
know what's going on with that.
Uh,

3090
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:17,421
that's,
uh,

3091
02:11:17,421 --> 02:11:20,930
the government tries to control me.
It can't handle the truth.

3092
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:23,150
Man.
Shit pissed me off.

3093
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:24,013
I don't know,
man.

3094
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:26,240
I don't.
I think it's just an algorithm issue

3095
02:11:26,241 --> 02:11:28,370
because we also have an issue with them.
We retweet.

3096
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:31,940
I'm like the,
there's an automatic tweet that youtube

3097
02:11:31,941 --> 02:11:35,450
does and it sends out that we're going
live that we're broadcasting live.

3098
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:39,880
Tweets it out to people or sends it out,
but it sends it in a fucking spanish.

3099
02:11:40,210 --> 02:11:42,950
Was it like it was,
it was the dark today.

3100
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:45,450
Today it says I started a live stream on
youtube,

3101
02:11:45,451 --> 02:11:46,140
but the last was,
yeah,

3102
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:50,060
it was like dutch or swedish or a bunch
of weird languages that I didn't,

3103
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:51,360
I couldn't speak.
I said,

3104
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:52,010
interesting man.

3105
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:52,380
Yeah,
my,

3106
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:53,121
my,
for some reason,

3107
02:11:53,121 --> 02:11:53,810
my,
um,

3108
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:56,990
my google shows up in my inbox,
this is my name,

3109
02:11:57,020 --> 02:12:00,950
like in german,
like the inbox thing and says just in

3110
02:12:00,951 --> 02:12:01,401
german,
I'm like,

3111
02:12:01,401 --> 02:12:03,500
I have no idea because you got hacked
some german,

3112
02:12:03,501 --> 02:12:04,820
godly man.
Yeah,

3113
02:12:04,821 --> 02:12:07,220
man,
I don't got shit to hack though.

3114
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:08,900
Hm.
Yeah.

3115
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:13,400
So the long answer of your question,
that's,

3116
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:15,830
that's where I stood on this whole moon
landing thing.

3117
02:12:15,831 --> 02:12:19,130
That's why I came around to thinking in
a different way that was way too

3118
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:19,964
convinced that I was.
Right,

3119
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:20,980
right.
I'm like,

3120
02:12:20,990 --> 02:12:24,950
I'm convinced I was right,
but fucking real low levels of

3121
02:12:24,951 --> 02:12:26,960
understanding of any of the sciences and
stuff.

3122
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:29,030
Yeah,
I think that's the problem is as a

3123
02:12:29,031 --> 02:12:31,340
society,
we're so scientifically illiterate,

3124
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:32,630
you know,
and that,

3125
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:35,720
that,
that causes so much room for speculation

3126
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:40,130
and you're kind of um,
kind of prisoner of,

3127
02:12:40,131 --> 02:12:40,964
of,
of,

3128
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:44,120
of people who are masters of their
crafts,

3129
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:47,480
you're kind of a prisoner to their quote
unquote agenda.

3130
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:49,270
I don't want to put that,
that bad of a term on it,

3131
02:12:49,271 --> 02:12:50,990
but you're kind of prisoner of that
because we don't have,

3132
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:51,853
we don't have any,
any,

3133
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:56,060
any choice,
but to take their word for war,

3134
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:58,040
to pursue it yourself.
Right.

3135
02:12:58,041 --> 02:12:59,590
To learn about what they're talking
about yourself,

3136
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:01,760
but if they're right or not.
Well that's,

3137
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:03,110
that's absolutely the case,
right?

3138
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:05,120
BecauSe you know,
that's the case in almost everything

3139
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:07,070
else.
Like that was always like a real problem

3140
02:13:07,071 --> 02:13:11,000
with martial arts was there was this one
dude who had all the information and you

3141
02:13:11,001 --> 02:13:13,310
didn't know and then you would listen to
them station and we're like,

3142
02:13:13,311 --> 02:13:14,520
whoa,
is that true?

3143
02:13:14,650 --> 02:13:17,000
And you would think it was true.
But now like there's videos you can

3144
02:13:17,001 --> 02:13:19,580
watch on youtube of like some crazy kung
fu.

3145
02:13:19,581 --> 02:13:22,280
Dude that's just talking nonsense.
He doesn't really know how to do

3146
02:13:22,281 --> 02:13:24,110
anything.
He's just got some crazy thing about

3147
02:13:24,111 --> 02:13:27,800
cheap power and if you don't know,
you think this guy is real.

3148
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:30,920
But once you know you go,
oh you motherfucker.

3149
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:31,980
So like someone can pull

3150
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,850
the wool over your eyes about that.
They could just easily do it with any

3151
02:13:35,851 --> 02:13:36,684
kind of science

3152
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:38,580
rocket traveler.
And see that's what really got me

3153
02:13:38,581 --> 02:13:41,190
interested in science.
It was like you fall,

3154
02:13:41,191 --> 02:13:42,740
especially with this climate change
shit.

3155
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:47,640
So like you start reading the articles
people give you why it's not real and

3156
02:13:47,641 --> 02:13:50,400
then you go and follow the source.
Like that's where I really learned to

3157
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:53,460
start filing the sources at all the
articles because it's those sources that

3158
02:13:53,610 --> 02:13:57,390
you lead to the main source of where the
information actually came from and it

3159
02:13:57,391 --> 02:14:02,130
usually leads to like a scientific paper
published in a journal and they're

3160
02:14:02,131 --> 02:14:07,131
fairly easy to understand because it's
very with the math and the in the,

3161
02:14:07,461 --> 02:14:09,540
in the actual science is probably won't
understand,

3162
02:14:09,541 --> 02:14:14,070
but like you can get to the break down
how they got to that conclusions and

3163
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:19,071
that's what I can appreciate about is it
actually gives you a uh,

3164
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:20,160
an understanding.

3165
02:14:20,450 --> 02:14:24,700
Yeah.
With citations shows you each what we,

3166
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:27,050
each study was all about certain things
on it.

3167
02:14:27,051 --> 02:14:28,310
Yeah.
That's super important to be able to

3168
02:14:28,311 --> 02:14:30,950
look at that stuff.
And obviously they've got a lot of math.

3169
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:32,110
I got a lot of times though,
man,

3170
02:14:32,111 --> 02:14:33,170
I do it.
It was biology.

3171
02:14:33,171 --> 02:14:34,880
Sometimes I do it with like,
um,

3172
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:37,670
different discoveries event.
I got obsessed with this chimpanzee that

3173
02:14:37,671 --> 02:14:40,070
they found the Congo.
It's called the bondo ape.

3174
02:14:40,370 --> 02:14:43,610
And I start reading as much as I could
read about this chimpanzee is one

3175
02:14:43,611 --> 02:14:47,210
chimpanzee in the Congo.
That's way bigger than other

3176
02:14:47,211 --> 02:14:48,680
chimpanzees.
It's enormous.

3177
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:51,050
It's like a six foot tall,
300 pounds.

3178
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:52,940
Pansy.
They walk upright.

3179
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:55,520
The huge,
enormous chimps.

3180
02:14:55,521 --> 02:14:56,354
Not.
Okay,

3181
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:59,290
well they have two different kinds of
chimps to like the locals called him a

3182
02:14:59,390 --> 02:15:02,000
tree beaters and that they have another
one,

3183
02:15:02,001 --> 02:15:04,850
I think they call them the ground
dwellers and tree beaters.

3184
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:06,410
I think that's what they call them
because the,

3185
02:15:06,411 --> 02:15:09,440
these chimps are so big that they nest
on the ground,

3186
02:15:09,441 --> 02:15:11,720
like gorillas.
They don't even bother climate trees

3187
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:12,583
jesus,
but it's just,

3188
02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:15,770
they're limited to this one area.
They have a crest on their forehead,

3189
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:19,370
like a gorilla where it's a high crest
of the bone.

3190
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:23,750
So they have these big massive plates of
muscle that they bite down with.

3191
02:15:24,050 --> 02:15:26,120
and then they have like this gorilla
crest.

3192
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,070
Regular chimps don't have that.
RIght?

3193
02:15:28,190 --> 02:15:30,410
So when they first found skulls from
these things,

3194
02:15:30,411 --> 02:15:32,060
they were confused.
They were trying to figure out was a

3195
02:15:32,061 --> 02:15:35,180
hybrid between a gorilla and a champion.
But then,

3196
02:15:35,181 --> 02:15:36,650
um,
um,

3197
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:38,480
did you,
where'd you get that?

3198
02:15:39,610 --> 02:15:41,880
That looks like that looks fake.
It looks weird.

3199
02:15:41,970 --> 02:15:43,370
That looks fake,
but see that one?

3200
02:15:43,371 --> 02:15:45,890
Okay,
go up to go push your cursor above and

3201
02:15:45,891 --> 02:15:47,030
then go slightly to the right.

3202
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:48,830
Go all the way to the right.
Keep going.

3203
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:50,290
No.
The bottom level.

3204
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:51,880
Bottom level.
Yeah.

3205
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:52,171
No,
no,

3206
02:15:52,171 --> 02:15:52,990
no,
no.

3207
02:15:52,990 --> 02:15:56,000
Were those those pictures right above?
Just go straight above.

3208
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:56,893
Now.
Go to the right,

3209
02:15:57,260 --> 02:15:58,610
to the right,
to the right.

3210
02:15:58,611 --> 02:15:59,570
One more.
Next guy.

3211
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:01,160
That picture.
Sorry.

3212
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,440
Yeah,
just make it bigger.

3213
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:05,930
That was taken by a guy named carl.
I'm on.

3214
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:11,140
He's a swiss wildlife photographer and
he became obsessed with these bondo apes

3215
02:16:11,691 --> 02:16:14,240
in,
I feel like it was somewhere around 1996

3216
02:16:14,630 --> 02:16:19,250
and he moved to the Congo and he stayed
there for quite a while trying to take

3217
02:16:19,251 --> 02:16:21,560
photographs of these really elusive
animals,

3218
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:26,650
but they got that one on a camera trap
and it's a fucking huge chimpanzee.

3219
02:16:27,830 --> 02:16:30,250
There's another line that is dead that
they shot

3220
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:32,590
and it's uh,
these two guys hold it by the.

3221
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:35,800
That'S one for sure.
But that's a pretty bIg one,

3222
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:37,900
but there's that one right there.
That's a way bigger one.

3223
02:16:37,901 --> 02:16:42,640
They shot that one at the airport.
It is fucking huge and it was shot

3224
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:45,010
somewhere,
some near some airstrip,

3225
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:50,220
so that's like one of the big pieces of
evidence other than now they have bones

3226
02:16:50,291 --> 02:16:55,291
and they have a scat samples and tissue
samples so they know they exist but

3227
02:16:55,631 --> 02:16:56,830
they're really,
really,

3228
02:16:56,831 --> 02:17:00,940
really hard to get to because the Congo
is like almost as wide as the United

3229
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:04,780
States and it's just filled with fucking
crazy shit that can kill you.

3230
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:08,410
Everything everywhere you'd go is just
monsters.

3231
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,830
Just everywhere.
Fucking crocodiles.

3232
02:17:11,410 --> 02:17:14,080
Wild man.
And the people that are dangerous as

3233
02:17:14,081 --> 02:17:14,940
fuck too.
Yeah.

3234
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:18,670
But this area is particularly dangerous
where because it's so.

3235
02:17:18,671 --> 02:17:19,790
It's really difficult to get them.

3236
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:21,320
But I got obsessed with this god damn
thing,

3237
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:24,000
so I was reading everything I could read
about that.

3238
02:17:24,001 --> 02:17:26,280
All right.
I have never been.

3239
02:17:26,590 --> 02:17:27,480
No,
I've never heard of it.

3240
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:30,490
Never fell in love with the apes like
that man.

3241
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:32,130
I'm fascinated by apes,
man.

3242
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:35,300
I feel like we're so close.
We're just,

3243
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:38,780
we're just the hair,
but I just took.

3244
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:40,750
So to me,
there's just,

3245
02:17:40,751 --> 02:17:42,220
when you look at them,
I,

3246
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:44,980
I got super high once when I went to the
zoo and hung out,

3247
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:48,610
I was by myself,
sat in front of a chimpanzee cage for

3248
02:17:48,611 --> 02:17:52,320
like a good solid hour man.
Washington's champs.

3249
02:17:52,780 --> 02:17:53,860
I was on an edible.

3250
02:17:56,890 --> 02:18:01,630
They sent you back and I remember like
watching them interact with each other,

3251
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:05,110
thinking like they're,
it's like they're like people but not.

3252
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:07,900
They're like people,
but wAy more brutal.

3253
02:18:07,901 --> 02:18:09,670
Way more.
Certainly way less paths.

3254
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:11,750
Airy,
kind of airy.

3255
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:15,190
Not too long ago I took my kids,
they love it go.

3256
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:18,820
But um,
I don't remember what kind of primate it

3257
02:18:18,821 --> 02:18:19,361
was,
man,

3258
02:18:19,361 --> 02:18:21,970
but he was just hanging on the cage and
we was walking by and he was just kinda

3259
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,130
like following us.
And I was like,

3260
02:18:24,131 --> 02:18:27,940
I felt so weird man.
Like it was almost like he was like,

3261
02:18:28,180 --> 02:18:29,680
what's going on man?
How y'all doing?

3262
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:31,450
Like he wanted to.
It was the weirdest shit.

3263
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:34,420
I wasn't even on the edible.
Yeah,

3264
02:18:34,421 --> 02:18:38,060
it's weird when you see their nature
come out there like us.

3265
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:40,990
You ever seen one?
There's one where a little kid was like

3266
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:45,150
pounding our chest in front of the
window and patch

3267
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:48,880
himself after he cracked it.

3268
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:53,650
I saw that was he cracked the glass man.
Y'all need to be in there,

3269
02:18:53,651 --> 02:18:54,790
man.
Yeah.

3270
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:56,530
They shouldn't be in there.
I don't.

3271
02:18:56,531 --> 02:18:57,400
I mean,
the only.

3272
02:18:57,401 --> 02:19:01,930
The only thing that I could see that
would make sense why you want to keep

3273
02:19:01,931 --> 02:19:04,510
them there because if they're so
endangered that you need to keep them

3274
02:19:04,511 --> 02:19:07,810
alive in these contained environments
before they figured out a way to

3275
02:19:07,811 --> 02:19:09,760
reintroduce them back into the wild.
I don't know,

3276
02:19:09,761 --> 02:19:12,130
man.
It's thinking as part of the

3277
02:19:12,131 --> 02:19:16,330
evolutionary process.
It's like 99 percent of all species have

3278
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:17,620
died off.
Yeah.

3279
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:18,700
It's part.
It's part of.

3280
02:19:18,730 --> 02:19:20,620
So you think we should just let him die.
Let him die.

3281
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:21,880
Whoa.
That's deep.

3282
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:23,410
It is.
I know that people want.

3283
02:19:23,830 --> 02:19:26,200
People don't want to hear that,
but it's just showing me what everything

3284
02:19:26,201 --> 02:19:27,860
dies.
You know what's fucked up?

3285
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,800
What if we're killing?
What if we're letting these gorilla stay

3286
02:19:30,801 --> 02:19:32,840
alive,
but really if we just let them die,

3287
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:35,360
they would evolve into something way
cooler.

3288
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:36,620
That's.
That's what I would have said,

3289
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:38,660
don't know.
That's the shit that I've been thinking

3290
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:39,411
about dog.
It's like,

3291
02:19:39,411 --> 02:19:43,190
all right,
so the evolutionary tree of life,

3292
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:46,400
right?
Like we have fucked it up.

3293
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:49,220
I don't want to say fuck it up because
it was definitely a part of it,

3294
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:54,550
but it's like we're directly influencing
it and I just wonder what,

3295
02:19:55,070 --> 02:19:58,070
like where's it gonna go from here,
like what?

3296
02:19:58,130 --> 02:20:00,100
All lifeforms do that though,
but not like,

3297
02:20:00,150 --> 02:20:04,400
like we've kind of escaped because
natural selection is all about survival

3298
02:20:04,401 --> 02:20:06,100
and it's all about,
uh,

3299
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:08,930
that's basically it.
Just adapting to the environment to

3300
02:20:08,931 --> 02:20:11,480
survive.
And now it's not about that anymore.

3301
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:14,000
We don't,
we don't adapt to our environment to

3302
02:20:14,001 --> 02:20:14,834
survive anymore.

3303
02:20:15,050 --> 02:20:16,540
We,
we create our environment.

3304
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:18,650
It's different.
It's definitely different.

3305
02:20:18,651 --> 02:20:21,800
But it's still adapting to the
environment because instead of using

3306
02:20:21,801 --> 02:20:25,160
like physical tools aNd attributes,
we figured out a way to do it mentally

3307
02:20:25,161 --> 02:20:27,430
where we create things that can alter
the environment.

3308
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:30,770
What I'm saying.
So like still what it signals is to me

3309
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:36,070
is a new form of life.
Like it's a physical structure like

3310
02:20:36,380 --> 02:20:40,690
structures and things that we're using,
whether they're um,

3311
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:45,530
household appliances or electronics,
all that stuff is evolving as well,

3312
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:46,480
like it's all happening.
Right?

3313
02:20:46,481 --> 02:20:49,820
And so that's the new,
like the new ability to adapt.

3314
02:20:49,821 --> 02:20:52,280
It's all coming out of these things
instead of coming out of us.

3315
02:20:52,281 --> 02:20:54,240
We're putting our work into that.
But that's what I'm saying.

3316
02:20:54,241 --> 02:20:55,074
I,
I'm,

3317
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:59,090
I'm not sure about,
I don't think we've ever seen this part

3318
02:20:59,091 --> 02:21:03,380
of evolution a arise like this before.
No,

3319
02:21:03,381 --> 02:21:05,610
we haven't not like this now.

3320
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,630
And it's crazy to me.
I don't like,

3321
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:10,910
I'm just so like I love that live in the
time that we do the information age and

3322
02:21:10,911 --> 02:21:13,700
all that shit,
but like I still want to be able to live

3323
02:21:13,701 --> 02:21:15,890
like 300 years from now to see where
we're at in society.

3324
02:21:15,891 --> 02:21:17,320
I would love to see that.
Yeah.

3325
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:18,920
Would love to see it too.
But I'm scared.

3326
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:22,730
I want to see it happen though.
Like this now I like this.

3327
02:21:22,731 --> 02:21:25,940
Now I'm fascinated to see what this,
what's happening here.

3328
02:21:26,390 --> 02:21:27,330
I am too,
but like,

3329
02:21:27,770 --> 02:21:30,140
like I,
I want to see ai and I want to see,

3330
02:21:30,141 --> 02:21:32,540
um,
I want to see life on other planets.

3331
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:34,820
I think ai is going to turn out like
blade runner.

3332
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:37,010
I think they've run it.
I don't,

3333
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:38,180
you never saw that.
My one thing,

3334
02:21:38,181 --> 02:21:40,550
so I saw blade.
He never said I saw that too.

3335
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:42,200
I don't know.
Blade runner,

3336
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:45,860
blade runner is harrison ford movie
about these artificial people that are

3337
02:21:45,861 --> 02:21:48,830
so difficult to tell that they don't
even know they're artificial.

3338
02:21:48,831 --> 02:21:51,440
People know.
Well,

3339
02:21:51,441 --> 02:21:53,030
they're gonna they're doing it again.
Right.

3340
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:56,750
Who's going to be the blade runner guy
now is harrison ford in it.

3341
02:21:56,751 --> 02:21:58,550
Again,
that would be crazy.

3342
02:21:59,630 --> 02:22:03,950
Rutger hauer gosling and harrison.
Ryan gosling.

3343
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:05,353
Yeah.
Good move.

3344
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:09,380
But it was um,
two great science fiction movie,

3345
02:22:09,381 --> 02:22:11,750
man.
Ryan gosling can act till polish it off.

3346
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:13,460
It's,
it's a really good movie,

3347
02:22:13,461 --> 02:22:14,300
man.
I got to check him out.

3348
02:22:14,310 --> 02:22:17,210
Still it holds up to.
It's one of those few movies that holds

3349
02:22:17,211 --> 02:22:18,890
up.
I got to check him out.

3350
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:21,800
It was probably like about the,
I mean the movie was made,

3351
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:25,010
I want to say in the nineties,
eighties,

3352
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:26,040
82,
82.

3353
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,420
Yeah,
that was before my time before

3354
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:31,050
everybody's time,
but it seemed.

3355
02:22:31,051 --> 02:22:35,410
I think they were like saying it was
like 2030 or some shit like that.

3356
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:37,153
Two years.

3357
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:41,880
That is so funny.
They always think that it was going to

3358
02:22:41,881 --> 02:22:45,210
be way more crazy than it is crazy.
We got to have a boys man.

3359
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:47,450
Yeah.
But you know,

3360
02:22:47,610 --> 02:22:50,130
what they never expected is the craziest
thing,

3361
02:22:50,131 --> 02:22:52,120
which is the internet.
They thought that our,

3362
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:56,520
our evolution would term would be like
people would fly around in cars like

3363
02:22:56,521 --> 02:22:58,980
they had flying cars and shit.
That's what they thought was gonna

3364
02:22:59,010 --> 02:23:02,790
happen and then they would have
artificial people that you couldn't

3365
02:23:02,791 --> 02:23:06,060
distinguish like a surrogates.
Well,

3366
02:23:06,061 --> 02:23:09,260
they were the rutger hauer character was
the most fascinating one.

3367
02:23:09,310 --> 02:23:12,480
I check this movie out fucking movie.
That's my favorite shit.

3368
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:14,470
And there's that girl that was.
What was the name?

3369
02:23:14,471 --> 02:23:16,200
Shawn?
What was her name?

3370
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:23,000
She was a huge deal for a long time.
She was a huge movie star sean.

3371
02:23:23,830 --> 02:23:24,663
Goddammit.

3372
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:26,503
But

3373
02:23:26,650 --> 02:23:30,490
she was one of those people,
one of the first people that we saw,

3374
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:32,410
um,
and the younger generation,

3375
02:23:32,411 --> 02:23:37,000
Sean Young to like sort of crack from
the pressure of startup success,

3376
02:23:37,001 --> 02:23:40,960
just woo woo.
Crazy.

3377
02:23:40,961 --> 02:23:42,240
Yeah.
That fishbowl.

3378
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:43,720
The fishbowls no joke.
Right?

3379
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:45,340
It's,
it's a weird thing man.

3380
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:47,770
He said weird,
funny shit.

3381
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:48,970
a man.
So like I'm having dinner.

3382
02:23:48,971 --> 02:23:52,510
I got my kids and stuff.
We hAd the table and just a couple of

3383
02:23:52,511 --> 02:23:53,530
years ago.
And um,

3384
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:55,490
I mean houston is,
some guy comes and says,

3385
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:56,590
hey man,
big fan man.

3386
02:23:56,591 --> 02:24:00,070
Can you take a picture of my baby?
And then puts his baby on a table.

3387
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:04,540
Well what the fuck?
Like it's the weirdest shit ever met.

3388
02:24:04,541 --> 02:24:06,310
And people do weird stuff like that all
the time.

3389
02:24:06,311 --> 02:24:09,010
I suppose baby on a table on the table,
I'd take a picture of my baby and I'm

3390
02:24:09,011 --> 02:24:10,960
like,
baby off the table.

3391
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:12,160
That's so weird.
Yeah.

3392
02:24:12,190 --> 02:24:14,230
I mean you probably get all the time
people do weird shit.

3393
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:15,880
It was.
So that's a weird one.

3394
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,540
Click here to take a picture of a band.
People like,

3395
02:24:18,550 --> 02:24:19,200
people like,
oh,

3396
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,760
I like hold my baby.
They take a picture.

3397
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:22,690
I'm like,
if I drop your baby,

3398
02:24:22,691 --> 02:24:24,100
do you know what kind of shit I'd be
like,

3399
02:24:24,101 --> 02:24:27,250
I'm not holding your babies.
What is wrong?

3400
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:30,030
Why would you want me to hold the baby?
Has no clue who I am.

3401
02:24:30,050 --> 02:24:32,140
Like doesn't care.
People are strange.

3402
02:24:32,410 --> 02:24:34,720
Maybe once milk people are fucking
strange.

3403
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:38,080
I think the the.
At least you were a young man when you

3404
02:24:38,081 --> 02:24:41,260
experienced that would freaks me out.
It's child stars.

3405
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:45,640
I couldn't because it's accused like you
never get normalcy.

3406
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,410
No fucks you up.
You,

3407
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:48,490
you.
There's no normal.

3408
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:51,020
However you never get it.
I know you're,

3409
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,110
you're,
you're born famous.

3410
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:55,990
Like if you're famous when you're seven.
Telephone.

3411
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,700
Do you remember before seven?
I don't remember.

3412
02:24:57,701 --> 02:25:00,730
For 74 is when I really started like,
okay,

3413
02:25:00,731 --> 02:25:01,564
I'm in the world.

3414
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:04,870
jamie,
you got any memories or when you were

3415
02:25:04,871 --> 02:25:07,240
seven?
Few of like being at a babysitter and

3416
02:25:07,241 --> 02:25:10,450
like maybe.
So if everything from seven onwards.

3417
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:12,010
Fame.
It's a funny story.

3418
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:15,570
My mom to this day dot d,
she denIes it.

3419
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:20,140
So I have this vivid memory.
I was three years old and I used to have

3420
02:25:20,141 --> 02:25:22,660
a babysitter right across the street
from my apartment complex.

3421
02:25:22,661 --> 02:25:27,661
I used to to africa to name,
but one day I come into the room and

3422
02:25:28,891 --> 02:25:31,050
there's paramedics.
I didn't know they were paramedics,

3423
02:25:31,051 --> 02:25:32,980
but there's paramedics and she's
sitting,

3424
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:36,790
she's laying on the couch.
She was pregnant all the time and I see

3425
02:25:36,791 --> 02:25:38,620
her.
Her belly split open.

3426
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:41,260
Well,
I saw csection at like three or four

3427
02:25:41,261 --> 02:25:43,900
years old.
My mom does not believe me to this day.

3428
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:45,840
She's like,
there's no way you saw csection.

3429
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:47,740
I'm like,
how do I notice like how,

3430
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:48,510
how do I.

3431
02:25:48,510 --> 02:25:49,990
And I,
I didn't say anything at the time

3432
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:52,750
because I mean,
how did I know that didn't happen in

3433
02:25:52,751 --> 02:25:54,780
every babysitter place run?
No,

3434
02:25:54,781 --> 02:25:56,470
I did,
but I saw it as a kid.

3435
02:25:56,860 --> 02:25:58,300
I was very bad.
They should have.

3436
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:00,640
I'm not sure why they didn't take me out
of the room.

3437
02:26:00,650 --> 02:26:03,410
Like,
that's disturbing man.

3438
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:06,880
But as a good fee to see this,
it's just information,

3439
02:26:06,881 --> 02:26:08,200
right?
Like nobody got hurt.

3440
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:11,620
It seems like a crazy thing,
but it's how life gets into the world.

3441
02:26:11,621 --> 02:26:15,100
Like if I was like cutting a belly open
and I see a three year old,

3442
02:26:15,101 --> 02:26:17,890
I'm like,
you should probably leave the room just

3443
02:26:17,891 --> 02:26:19,990
in case.
I doN't know what it did to me.

3444
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,340
Right.
I don't know.

3445
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:25,060
I wouldn't encourage a three year old to
do it like that.

3446
02:26:25,061 --> 02:26:26,140
I know it'd be good.
Oh no,

3447
02:26:26,141 --> 02:26:27,100
it's good for the kid.
Didn't know.

3448
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:29,530
He needs to leT them know what I'm
saying.

3449
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:30,490
Get up,
quote billy.

3450
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:33,820
Don't be a pussy.
If you're going to make this place

3451
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:34,663
contaminated.

3452
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:38,410
Some girls do it just to keep their
pussy tight.

3453
02:26:38,830 --> 02:26:39,810
Are you serious?
Yep.

3454
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:42,520
I'm not taking any chances.
So selfish.

3455
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:45,130
Mm.
Or they're just having a national

3456
02:26:45,131 --> 02:26:46,560
woman's.
They look.

3457
02:26:46,770 --> 02:26:47,603
They're like,
listen,

3458
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:51,910
the kids going to be fine.
Debby son was born by csection.

3459
02:26:51,911 --> 02:26:55,030
He's fine.
The kids find that is crazy.

3460
02:26:55,031 --> 02:26:56,260
That's a real thing.
Yeah,

3461
02:26:56,261 --> 02:26:57,820
it's a real thing.
Yeah.

3462
02:26:58,040 --> 02:26:59,600
Aura.
There was a thing that you've

3463
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:01,750
advertised.
Jody is used to have a joke about,

3464
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:04,490
about vaginal rejuvenation.
You know,

3465
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:05,880
they used to talk about that all the
time.

3466
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:07,990
That was like a.
Because it became a thing where they

3467
02:27:07,991 --> 02:27:12,991
could type that baby back like so.
So to know everything else bro.

3468
02:27:14,530 --> 02:27:19,270
I bet if you have a big thing and you
have to make a small thing involves

3469
02:27:19,271 --> 02:27:22,450
cutting,
cutting and stitching and I would

3470
02:27:22,451 --> 02:27:25,270
imagine that would be.
That's a weird.

3471
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:27,210
That's a weird place to get cuddled.

3472
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:30,550
But I couldn't do it.
Ooh.

3473
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:32,350
Yeah.
And then what happens after that?

3474
02:27:32,351 --> 02:27:35,110
What if it's too tight when it doesn't
work anymore with dr.

3475
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:38,500
Fucks up nonsurgical.
Thirty minute treatment.

3476
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:40,210
Thank god.
It's quick.

3477
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,390
It only takes 30 minutes.
That's what everybody wants.

3478
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:46,010
I can fix your pussy at 30 minutes.
Where do I sign a better Man?

3479
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:48,200
What do I put my credit card?
A quick be better.

3480
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:52,780
There was a 30 minute procedure.
Tightens up your box and girls just are

3481
02:27:52,781 --> 02:27:54,280
so lazy.
They don't go.

3482
02:27:54,490 --> 02:27:56,380
I don't have 30 minutes,
but

3483
02:27:58,210 --> 02:28:01,120
30 minutes tell you have to do.
Are you saying that's not good?

3484
02:28:01,121 --> 02:28:01,451
No,
no,

3485
02:28:01,451 --> 02:28:01,811
no,
no,

3486
02:28:01,811 --> 02:28:02,561
no.
baby baby.

3487
02:28:02,561 --> 02:28:04,630
It's amazing.
I'm not saying it's not good,

3488
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:07,300
but you can make it perfect.
Make it purple.

3489
02:28:07,301 --> 02:28:10,840
I you fucking around.
Like if there was a 32nd dick

3490
02:28:10,841 --> 02:28:14,320
rejuvenation procedure where there was
like a place that you could go and they

3491
02:28:14,321 --> 02:28:19,090
can make your dick bigger vice national
rejuvenation flying in,

3492
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:22,020

3493
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:24,710
flights out of kennedy that was directly
going there.

3494
02:28:25,030 --> 02:28:26,570
Good morning America.
YeaH.

3495
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:28,160
It's a real thing.
Yeah.

3496
02:28:28,170 --> 02:28:29,540
Look at it.
I had no idea.

3497
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:33,200
This is my favorite part.
did you know that you age and every part

3498
02:28:33,201 --> 02:28:35,450
of your body,
you're talking about old pussies.

3499
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:38,690
They just planted a thought in your
head,

3500
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:42,950
but knew patrice o'neal and say age,
like age,

3501
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:44,510
like bread.
Now like why?

3502
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:47,090
Hold on,
go back.

3503
02:28:47,091 --> 02:28:47,930
Don't,
don't scroll down.

3504
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:52,790
Look at the top paragraph here.
female wellness is just as important as

3505
02:28:52,791 --> 02:28:56,240
taking care of your face.
What in the fuck does that mean?

3506
02:28:56,270 --> 02:28:57,290
I would agree.
Yeah,

3507
02:28:57,291 --> 02:29:00,770
but what she's saying,
female wellness.

3508
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:02,540
She's talking about having a tight
pussy.

3509
02:29:02,541 --> 02:29:07,541
You got to be a low bit man.
Sell your product and you can't just be

3510
02:29:07,791 --> 02:29:08,390

02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:36,920
Look at this shit.
Thermiva is a 30 minute nonsurgical

3519
02:29:36,921 --> 02:29:41,150
treatment that gently applies radiation
radio,

3520
02:29:41,170 --> 02:29:46,010
free radio frequency,
rf frequency to reclaim,

3521
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:51,190
restore and revive feminine wellness
without discomfort or downtime.

3522
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:55,710
Downtime from dick.
Where's the.

3523
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:59,270
Where's the small ones?
The small print that is a small print

3524
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:02,900
like I'm really concerned that while
getting rejuvenated,

3525
02:30:02,901 --> 02:30:04,590
I can't take dick.
Oh no,

3526
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:08,150
there's got to be a before jamie.
Go back.

3527
02:30:08,210 --> 02:30:09,920
Go back so I could read more of that
stuff.

3528
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:14,030
yeah.
This,

3529
02:30:14,030 --> 02:30:19,030
this is crazy.
It increases nourishment to tissues by

3530
02:30:19,311 --> 02:30:24,311
stimulating blood vessel production and
increases sensitivity by stimulating

3531
02:30:24,651 --> 02:30:27,020
nerve regeneration.
Okay.

3532
02:30:27,350 --> 02:30:32,060
That doesn't seem true because I've.
If everything that I've read about nerve

3533
02:30:32,061 --> 02:30:37,061
regeneration is it as a very slow and
tedious process now it is like if you

3534
02:30:37,101 --> 02:30:38,030
get injured,
right?

3535
02:30:38,031 --> 02:30:39,680
Yeah.
So my dad actually had.

3536
02:30:39,850 --> 02:30:43,140
We not sure what happened,
but he kind of lost feeling in his arm.

3537
02:30:43,141 --> 02:30:45,440
He a pinched nerve.
I think that's probably what it was,

3538
02:30:45,740 --> 02:30:47,810
but like it's slowly creeping.
It's way too.

3539
02:30:47,811 --> 02:30:49,610
It was like two years ago and it's
slowly.

3540
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:51,620
He still struggles with it,
but you know,

3541
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:54,830
he's slowly getting better slowly as
slow process though.

3542
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:56,430
Real slow,
super slow.

3543
02:30:56,750 --> 02:31:01,080
My friend boss route and the former ufc
champion had a neck surgery.

3544
02:31:01,081 --> 02:31:05,780
He had something fucked up in his neck
and his arm shrunk to the point where he

3545
02:31:05,781 --> 02:31:09,230
calls one arm is baby arm atrophy and
it's coming back now.

3546
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:12,140
Slowly but surely.
But every time I see him like a year

3547
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:13,370
later,
it's like a little bit better.

3548
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:15,230
Yeah.
I mean it's multi,

3549
02:31:15,231 --> 02:31:20,070
multi year process and this guy was ufc
heavyweight champion and he was a bad

3550
02:31:20,071 --> 02:31:23,340
motherfucker has prime and it got him to
the point where it's.

3551
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:26,340
And it doesn't even grow back.
So you telling me they just blast your

3552
02:31:26,341 --> 02:31:29,280
pussy with some radiation and those
nerves are going to go back.

3553
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:33,930
Why wouldn't they take that nerve pussy
thing and put on boss rutan's arm?

3554
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:38,520
You know,
I have a female wellness on my own.

3555
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:39,960
Yeah.
Well,

3556
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:43,110
It was embarrassing,
but to get my arm back had to go to the

3557
02:31:43,111 --> 02:31:46,190
female wellness center,
get I had a.

3558
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:48,780
I had a stick in the vaginal
rejuvenation machine.

3559
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,250
Hey,
whatever works though.

3560
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:52,830
Yeah,
but if it did work,

3561
02:31:52,831 --> 02:31:56,760
that's probably one of the first places
they would use it on a lot of things

3562
02:31:56,761 --> 02:31:57,540
that we could use.

3563
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:01,260
Female wellness or just call it female
wellness is hilarious.

3564
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:04,350
Female wellness.
Definitely a cool women know what you're

3565
02:32:04,351 --> 02:32:05,790
talking about.
If we're talking about like give you

3566
02:32:05,791 --> 02:32:08,010
talk about like women's health issues,
you go,

3567
02:32:08,011 --> 02:32:10,500
oh abortion,
you know like women's rights,

3568
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:12,390
abortion.
I know you're talking about abortion,

3569
02:32:12,391 --> 02:32:15,390
but you see women's rights when it comes
to like a woman's health rights,

3570
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:18,930
reproductive rights.
We're really talking not just about

3571
02:32:18,931 --> 02:32:20,640
birth control pills but also about
abortion.

3572
02:32:20,641 --> 02:32:24,000
So if you say women's reproductive
rights immediately people think

3573
02:32:24,001 --> 02:32:26,100
abortion,
but if you say feminine wellness,

3574
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:28,050
you don't think.
I think.

3575
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:30,390
I think like breast cancer.
Yeah,

3576
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:32,250
that's what pops up in my head.
Yeah.

3577
02:32:32,251 --> 02:32:35,380
I would say it is deeper than that.
Juvenile nation,

3578
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:38,460
they're using it in a weird way.
They kind of co opted that term.

3579
02:32:38,850 --> 02:32:41,280
Feminine wellness is important,
bro.

3580
02:32:41,670 --> 02:32:42,550
It is important.
It is.

3581
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:45,390
Sure.
Confidence is everything.

3582
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:48,630
Confidence is everything.
And if you know you got a rejuvenating

3583
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:50,640
pussy,
this puts a sparkle in your eye.

3584
02:32:50,641 --> 02:32:53,910
There is no denying that pep in your
step.

3585
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:56,730
It's just the way she's tried.
I know she got the procedure done.

3586
02:32:57,300 --> 02:32:58,890
I'm going to ask her.
Don't ask her bro.

3587
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:02,310
Just get pissed.
So,

3588
02:33:02,311 --> 02:33:03,480
uh,
what have you been doing in your spare

3589
02:33:03,481 --> 02:33:04,010
time?
You get,

3590
02:33:04,010 --> 02:33:05,720
you're a pussy,
rejuvenated or anything.

3591
02:33:08,060 --> 02:33:10,380
They will never admit it to the end of
time.

3592
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:12,050
No time.
Mother's pussies.

3593
02:33:12,090 --> 02:33:15,720
amazing.
Everybody's putting in my family is

3594
02:33:15,721 --> 02:33:17,220
amazing.
We have amazing pussies.

3595
02:33:19,420 --> 02:33:23,520
Then
for this fucking conversation,

3596
02:33:23,521 --> 02:33:28,521
deteriorate.
Another word on here for just a pelvic

3597
02:33:29,461 --> 02:33:33,690
exam is another word for I just googled
wellness or whatever.

3598
02:33:33,691 --> 02:33:36,200
Female wellness exam that popped up and
yeah,

3599
02:33:36,410 --> 02:33:37,440
see,
that makes sense.

3600
02:33:37,441 --> 02:33:40,440
Like a pelvic examination,
checking you for issues,

3601
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:43,810
not tightening up your box.
I'm scared of that prostate thing.

3602
02:33:43,811 --> 02:33:46,230
That's come scary.
Or you already did it.

3603
02:33:46,380 --> 02:33:49,340
The finger in the ass.
Checking for a physical.

3604
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:50,920
For physical.
They put a finger mass.

3605
02:33:51,350 --> 02:33:52,160
Yeah,
whoa.

3606
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:53,940
Hey man.
Very uncomfortable.

3607
02:33:55,030 --> 02:33:57,060
I wasn't,
they just lube it up,

3608
02:33:57,240 --> 02:33:58,890
stick it in there.
and I'm dreading it,

3609
02:33:58,891 --> 02:34:00,240
man.
It's weird.

3610
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:03,640
People have problems though.
You got to be that prostate problems or

3611
02:34:03,650 --> 02:34:06,750
real issue with people like you.
How many people have like ball cancer,

3612
02:34:06,751 --> 02:34:08,870
prostate cancer,
and my grandpa,

3613
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:10,250
my grandpa died from prostate cancer.

3614
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:15,180
Cancer scare the shit out of me.
And what scares the shit out of me is

3615
02:34:15,181 --> 02:34:17,620
um,
our society,

3616
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:21,640
like what we've created is so awesome.
Like have been in the city is amazing.

3617
02:34:21,970 --> 02:34:23,470
Being able to go to a restaurants,
amazing.

3618
02:34:23,471 --> 02:34:25,960
Being able to fly on a plane,
go across the country.

3619
02:34:25,961 --> 02:34:27,220
Look,
all of a sudden we're in Florida.

3620
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:30,160
It's all amazing.
The food that we eat,

3621
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:33,310
the fact we get food anywhere.
The fact that you can go to wendy's and

3622
02:34:33,311 --> 02:34:36,790
just pull right in and get a burger,
but what,

3623
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:41,200
how much cost is that on our biology?
All that amazing stuff.

3624
02:34:41,201 --> 02:34:43,750
Like how bad is it to be in a polluted
area?

3625
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:46,440
Like how bad is it?
What life expectancy is actually the

3626
02:34:46,750 --> 02:34:50,470
highest it's ever been though it's true.
It's true because people have great,

3627
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:52,900
they have great medicine and procedures
and they catch things early,

3628
02:34:52,901 --> 02:34:55,050
the really good at treating cancer,
but what,

3629
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:58,150
how good are we at recognizing what's
causing that stuff?

3630
02:34:58,510 --> 02:35:00,400
How much of it is diet?
You know,

3631
02:35:00,550 --> 02:35:03,240
how much of it is nutritional
deficiencies in your diet?

3632
02:35:03,770 --> 02:35:06,930
Probably think it was the number one
killer is heart disease I think.

3633
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:08,440
Yeah.
I think heart disease,

3634
02:35:08,710 --> 02:35:11,260
which is also connected to obesity and a
lot of folks.

3635
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:13,550
Is that the number one retailer?
oh,

3636
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:14,590
cigarettes.
Terrible.

3637
02:35:14,591 --> 02:35:16,450
The fact that that's still around and
it's crazy.

3638
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:18,120
When I was a kid,
um,

3639
02:35:18,570 --> 02:35:21,700
when I was like 15,
I smoked a cigarette once when my

3640
02:35:21,701 --> 02:35:22,650
sister,
my sister's,

3641
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:25,060
she kept smoking for a few years after
that,

3642
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:28,390
but it was a couple of friends.
We just moved into this neighborhood and

3643
02:35:28,391 --> 02:35:29,224
I'm like,
I'll try it.

3644
02:35:29,620 --> 02:35:31,540
And I was like,
this is so crazy.

3645
02:35:31,541 --> 02:35:35,500
Like the fact that anybody wants to
smoke that first pool,

3646
02:35:35,560 --> 02:35:40,210
like I felt like I was gonna die and
you're voluntarily and what are you

3647
02:35:40,211 --> 02:35:43,530
getting out of it?
You get like a little buzz a little bit.

3648
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:46,180
You get a little bit of a.
That's what people who smoke cigarettes.

3649
02:35:46,181 --> 02:35:47,350
I'm like,
well I want you to just smoke weed.

3650
02:35:47,351 --> 02:35:48,760
Like you actually get something out of
it.

3651
02:35:49,030 --> 02:35:53,770
Like you just sit there and die.
But I felt you get like kind of an

3652
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:58,390
opposite thing out of it because with
cigarettes you get an ah fuck it feeling

3653
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:01,580
like I don't give a fuck.
Who gives a fuck the fuck it.

3654
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:04,030
I've never felt that man.
That's what I got.

3655
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:06,060
I never got this article came out.
Sorry.

3656
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:08,500
Like came out like seven days ago or
earlier this month.

3657
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:12,700
Building near freeways in la.
Not supposed to be within 500 feet of a

3658
02:36:12,701 --> 02:36:14,170
freeway.
Just definitely do.

3659
02:36:14,780 --> 02:36:18,920
Ellie keeps building near freeways even
though living there makes people sick.

3660
02:36:19,310 --> 02:36:22,280
Are you one of the two point 5 million?
Southern California is already living in

3661
02:36:22,281 --> 02:36:24,170
the pollution zone.
Wow.

3662
02:36:24,650 --> 02:36:26,090
Yeah.
When I pass on the four,

3663
02:36:26,091 --> 02:36:27,350
oh five,
and there's those.

3664
02:36:27,351 --> 02:36:30,440
Look at this jesus christ.
People there suffer higher rates of

3665
02:36:30,441 --> 02:36:31,610
asthma,
heart attacks,

3666
02:36:31,611 --> 02:36:34,140
strokes,
lung cancer and preterm births.

3667
02:36:34,170 --> 02:36:35,600
Reeks.
Recent research.

3668
02:36:35,810 --> 02:36:38,810
Recent research has added more health
risks to the risk.

3669
02:36:38,870 --> 02:36:41,060
To the list,
including childhood obesity,

3670
02:36:41,061 --> 02:36:42,800
autism and dementia.
Wow.

3671
02:36:43,700 --> 02:36:46,640
Wow.
See that's when you click that recent

3672
02:36:46,641 --> 02:36:48,860
research button and see what they talk
about.

3673
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:52,060
Boy.
Yeah.

3674
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:53,990
There's apartment buildings like right
off the four.

3675
02:36:53,991 --> 02:36:56,660
Oh five when you're driving towards
santa monica.

3676
02:36:56,661 --> 02:36:58,100
And I'm like,
that is like,

3677
02:36:58,101 --> 02:37:00,800
you're living right there.
Especially in la man.

3678
02:37:01,240 --> 02:37:02,810
Don't go nowhere.
It's just like,

3679
02:37:02,811 --> 02:37:07,220
it's just a $15 everywhere man choking
in it.

3680
02:37:07,850 --> 02:37:08,870
Do you like living in Texas?

3681
02:37:09,140 --> 02:37:09,973
No.
No,

3682
02:37:10,010 --> 02:37:11,030
no.
Were you going to settle?

3683
02:37:11,370 --> 02:37:13,640
I haven't figured that one out yet.
I was um,

3684
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:15,650
I was thinking around,
I think denver,

3685
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:21,350
but I heard never was super dope,
but I had a buddy that just moved from

3686
02:37:21,351 --> 02:37:24,100
la.
I'm from denver to la and he's just

3687
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:24,411
like,
man,

3688
02:37:24,411 --> 02:37:25,820
it's just,
he's just dead over there.

3689
02:37:25,821 --> 02:37:27,170
I can't.
I got to be alive.

3690
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:27,691
And I'm like,
oh,

3691
02:37:27,691 --> 02:37:28,940
it crazy.
I feel you man.

3692
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:31,010
Go to the mountains,
bitch.

3693
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:33,560
The mountains,
not an outdoors do.

3694
02:37:35,110 --> 02:37:38,050
It's definitely dead in terms of like
city action.

3695
02:37:38,051 --> 02:37:40,050
It's nothing like this out here.
Yeah.

3696
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:44,540
Denver is interesting though,
is denver's had legal weed for a long

3697
02:37:44,541 --> 02:37:46,970
time because they,
they basically weren't arresting people

3698
02:37:46,971 --> 02:37:51,890
for it for the longest time.
They had kind of said like a state or a

3699
02:37:51,970 --> 02:37:55,640
citywide thing that they weren't going
to arrest people when I first came

3700
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:57,410
there,
like I don't remember what year,

3701
02:37:57,411 --> 02:38:00,470
but I've been working at the comedy
works in denver for a long time and when

3702
02:38:00,471 --> 02:38:02,210
I first went there they were like,
yeah,

3703
02:38:02,211 --> 02:38:05,150
we don't arrest people for weed and I
don't want to like,

3704
02:38:05,151 --> 02:38:07,760
yeah,
they passed something in the city where

3705
02:38:07,761 --> 02:38:09,410
they don't arrest people for weed in the
city.

3706
02:38:09,650 --> 02:38:10,431
I'm like,
that's crazy.

3707
02:38:10,431 --> 02:38:12,820
But this is Colorado.
Like I thought of colorado's like

3708
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:14,100
cowboys,
like,

3709
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:15,740
like,
well you think of Wyoming,

3710
02:38:15,741 --> 02:38:19,670
the republicans and real strict,
but denver was never like that.

3711
02:38:19,671 --> 02:38:22,370
It's like a weird.
It's a weird town man.

3712
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:23,233
What,
what's.

3713
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:24,940
I mean,
you know a lot about dishes.

3714
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:29,980
What started the movement in denver to
go towards progression and we.

3715
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:36,280
Well I think the statewide movement of
Colorado making marijuana legal and

3716
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:40,640
being the first state along with seattle
or Washington state rather.

3717
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:41,983
I think,
um,

3718
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:45,130
Colorado people don't like people
telling them what the fuck to do.

3719
02:38:45,730 --> 02:38:47,030
That's a big part of it.
I mean,

3720
02:38:47,031 --> 02:38:49,550
they're rugged people.
you've got to realize if you can,

3721
02:38:49,790 --> 02:38:53,930
if you're family made it to Colorado,
like in the 18 hundreds of whatever,

3722
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:58,490
you got some rugged jeans is that deep.
Oh man,

3723
02:38:58,580 --> 02:39:02,480
those people move there.
There's a core group of people that

3724
02:39:02,481 --> 02:39:07,190
settled in Colorado during the gold rush
manifest destiny man,

3725
02:39:07,191 --> 02:39:08,700
when people came over and it's crazy.

3726
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:12,830
homestead,
get blocks of land and stay on it for a

3727
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:14,270
few years and he can get to own it.
Yeah,

3728
02:39:14,271 --> 02:39:15,770
man,
that shit all happened.

3729
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:18,320
And those were the gold rush people,
man.

3730
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:19,410
All right,
right.

3731
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:21,020
I mean,
wasn't that what Colorado was originally

3732
02:39:21,021 --> 02:39:22,810
settled?
Wasn't California was right?

3733
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:24,920
California gold rush.
Like why the fuck do people go to

3734
02:39:24,921 --> 02:39:27,290
Colorado?
That's what I have no idea.

3735
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:30,620
We'll put google.
When was denver established?

3736
02:39:31,610 --> 02:39:34,100
I'm going to guess I'm going to take a
guess.

3737
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:36,050
I'm going to say it was like the 17
hundreds.

3738
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:39,890
Now I'm going to go after that.
Eighteen hundred 50 1800.

3739
02:39:39,891 --> 02:39:41,630
18 50 slash 50 18,
58.

3740
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:42,980
Holy shit.
Perfect.

3741
02:39:42,981 --> 02:39:44,090
That was really good.
That was pretty good.

3742
02:39:44,091 --> 02:39:45,200
And I bet.
Very good.

3743
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:49,640
So think about that.
What kind of gangsters traveling across

3744
02:39:49,641 --> 02:39:52,460
the country?
You know,

3745
02:39:52,461 --> 02:39:57,461
you had to be a bad motherfucker to get
across the country if you live here,

3746
02:39:57,800 --> 02:39:58,280
right?

3747
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:01,100
In California.
The same thing holds true like the

3748
02:40:01,101 --> 02:40:05,050
people that first got here,
like in the 17 and 18 hundreds,

3749
02:40:05,090 --> 02:40:07,040
whatever it was and at first settled
here,

3750
02:40:07,250 --> 02:40:10,270
but then everybody comes in here and all
the actors and it's just the.

3751
02:40:10,271 --> 02:40:14,040
Well gene pools water down.
But in denver that gene pools not

3752
02:40:14,041 --> 02:40:16,230
watered down.
You've got a bunch of people in still,

3753
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:21,240
right?
The original dna is of just gangsters

3754
02:40:21,960 --> 02:40:25,200
who came over here to try to make it in
the wild west.

3755
02:40:25,790 --> 02:40:30,790
So that's interesting.
So you're saying the liberalism of the

3756
02:40:31,051 --> 02:40:33,930
move from east to west and the,
uh,

3757
02:40:34,890 --> 02:40:39,150
the gene pool of not giving a fuck.
That'S interesting.

3758
02:40:39,450 --> 02:40:41,550
Yeah,
it has to be that there's definitely

3759
02:40:41,551 --> 02:40:43,560
something to it because if you think
about it,

3760
02:40:43,561 --> 02:40:46,770
all the,
like the really like there's a giant

3761
02:40:46,771 --> 02:40:48,870
group of immigrants in the east coast,
this country.

3762
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:52,470
And there's also like a real hostility
that's almost like ancient on the east

3763
02:40:52,471 --> 02:40:55,430
coast of the country that's different
from the hostility on the west coast.

3764
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:59,370
It was like an ancient sort of like
shitty way people get along with each

3765
02:40:59,371 --> 02:41:01,770
other in New York.
And you could attribute it to the call

3766
02:41:01,830 --> 02:41:04,230
that you can attribute it to the
weather.

3767
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:05,780
You know,
you get attributed to about

3768
02:41:05,781 --> 02:41:07,980
overpopulation but on top of each other.
Yeah,

3769
02:41:07,981 --> 02:41:09,390
you could.
You could attribute it to that.

3770
02:41:09,391 --> 02:41:11,580
I think in both things could be possibly
true.

3771
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:14,850
But there's other spots like you go to
Canada and the weather,

3772
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:17,940
the weather's horrible.
Like toronto is crazy traffic and a lot

3773
02:41:17,941 --> 02:41:19,620
of people and they're nice as hell.
I heard.

3774
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,390
Yeah,
I went to Canada once.

3775
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:22,740
They're so nice,
so nice.

3776
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:25,800
So I don't know what it is,
but I think it has something to do with

3777
02:41:25,801 --> 02:41:30,180
the fact that the original people that
came there or these hard scrabble people

3778
02:41:30,330 --> 02:41:33,630
that we're trying to make it by getting
on a boat and traveling across the ocean

3779
02:41:33,631 --> 02:41:36,050
to a land that they really didn't know
much about me.

3780
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:38,790
He might've known someone here,
they might've had an uncle or family

3781
02:41:38,791 --> 02:41:41,100
members and they were going to try to
settle.

3782
02:41:41,130 --> 02:41:44,760
I mean those are gangster people.
You have to be so and then the people

3783
02:41:44,761 --> 02:41:46,800
that were sick of those people like,
fuck this,

3784
02:41:46,801 --> 02:41:49,560
we're going to keep going and kept going
west.

3785
02:41:49,890 --> 02:41:51,450
And then in 18,
58,

3786
02:41:51,480 --> 02:41:55,310
they settled in denver.
I mean those were rugged people,

3787
02:41:55,320 --> 02:41:58,560
man.
so when you see that city there and that

3788
02:41:58,561 --> 02:42:02,640
city is embraced by the rocky mountains,
so you have this constant natural beauty

3789
02:42:02,641 --> 02:42:04,360
around you.
It's like a little bowl to it.

3790
02:42:05,220 --> 02:42:07,590
I mean it's a bowl and you look out your
window.

3791
02:42:07,591 --> 02:42:09,690
Like if you stay in a hotel in denver,
you look out the window,

3792
02:42:09,691 --> 02:42:10,524
you're like,
whoa,

3793
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:12,240
you see the rocky mountain and you're
like,

3794
02:42:12,241 --> 02:42:15,690
holy shit.
Real clean city to like a super guy was

3795
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:18,990
while I was walking downtown and it's
like they keep it up here.

3796
02:42:19,050 --> 02:42:20,250
They do.
Yeah.

3797
02:42:20,670 --> 02:42:23,910
It's also like you have to be a certain
kind of person to be able to survive

3798
02:42:23,911 --> 02:42:25,280
that winter.
You know,

3799
02:42:25,430 --> 02:42:29,580
you got to be the kind of person that
can just fucking tolerate shit and still

3800
02:42:29,581 --> 02:42:32,850
show up at work and get things done.
you can't be a baby out here.

3801
02:42:32,851 --> 02:42:34,950
You could be a baby.
How you can be like,

3802
02:42:34,951 --> 02:42:37,830
I don't like to go out when it rains
because all the oil on the road,

3803
02:42:37,980 --> 02:42:39,810
it's like people don't know how to drive
in it.

3804
02:42:39,850 --> 02:42:43,710
It's not doing this.
I'm going to call in and I'm going to

3805
02:42:43,711 --> 02:42:46,440
say in,
in Colorado they have to go to work on

3806
02:42:46,441 --> 02:42:49,080
black ice.
People juSt sliding around on each other

3807
02:42:49,081 --> 02:42:51,780
like bumper cars fast,
very fast and the furious.

3808
02:42:51,781 --> 02:42:56,750
And you ever hit black ice or driving.
I've never hit black guy just like the

3809
02:42:56,760 --> 02:42:59,660
cold.
So I'm one of the whining people getting

3810
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:02,190
out.
While you don't have to like the cold.

3811
02:43:02,300 --> 02:43:04,110
This is the thing man.
Especially a guy like you,

3812
02:43:04,130 --> 02:43:04,501
you've,
you've,

3813
02:43:04,501 --> 02:43:05,700
you've,
you've proven yourself.

3814
02:43:05,701 --> 02:43:08,550
So physically tough.
Nobody could ever say that.

3815
02:43:08,551 --> 02:43:10,620
The reason why you don't like the cold
because you're a pussy.

3816
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:11,271
No,
no,

3817
02:43:11,271 --> 02:43:11,441
no,
no.

3818
02:43:11,441 --> 02:43:12,274
I just don't

3819
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:13,020
like.
Yeah,

3820
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:15,400
I'm definitely not a pussy.
That's what I was fucking.

3821
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:16,833
Definitely.
Not that.

3822
02:43:16,910 --> 02:43:18,310
That's what I was a famous football
player.

3823
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:19,310
Pitcher,
right?

3824
02:43:19,410 --> 02:43:21,040
I'm not a pussy.
I just not stupid.

3825
02:43:21,041 --> 02:43:23,100
I don't want to be cold.
I just don't get to see it.

3826
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:25,170
I also don't like being hot though,
you know?

3827
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:27,520
Well you tell those people,
why don't you just be cold all the time

3828
02:43:27,550 --> 02:43:29,550
if you're such a bad ass,
why we're close.

3829
02:43:29,990 --> 02:43:32,170
What you need to be warm.
You fucking pussy.

3830
02:43:32,530 --> 02:43:33,970
Oh,
sometimes you need to be a pussy,

3831
02:43:34,210 --> 02:43:36,100
but right now you know,
fuck out of here.

3832
02:43:37,230 --> 02:43:40,050
Like people live in san diego.
Like one of the things that you'll,

3833
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:41,640
you'll talk to you about,
you know,

3834
02:43:41,720 --> 02:43:44,890
if you have a bunch of buddies that live
in san diego and they asked him about

3835
02:43:44,891 --> 02:43:46,030
it,
like why do you live in san diego?

3836
02:43:46,030 --> 02:43:47,980
They're like,
it's never shitty here.

3837
02:43:48,670 --> 02:43:50,740
The weather's perfect always.
Why would you move?

3838
02:43:50,890 --> 02:43:54,610
I went to high school down there.
It's with part a mission bay.

3839
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:55,620
Oh,
that's nice.

3840
02:43:55,620 --> 02:43:58,780
Mission beach area.
So that was the craziest part is la

3841
02:43:58,781 --> 02:44:00,560
jolla.
They've got a comedy store out there as

3842
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:03,190
different and they got these mansions
that overlooked the ocean and

3843
02:44:03,240 --> 02:44:08,240
everybody's on pills as a whole is like
is like a different.

3844
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:13,090
A different areas.
Too much money,

3845
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:16,480
so much money out there.
There's too much money whenever you get

3846
02:44:16,481 --> 02:44:20,140
too much money in an area,
just like nobody knows what to do.

3847
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:21,540
I didn't know what to do.
Yeah,

3848
02:44:21,570 --> 02:44:23,020
but they get crazy.
That's.

3849
02:44:23,310 --> 02:44:27,040
You start buying yachts,
snorting coke and on the yet.

3850
02:44:27,450 --> 02:44:29,500
Yeah.
You're crazy,

3851
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:32,170
right?
I can't do the water either though.

3852
02:44:32,290 --> 02:44:33,940
That cornado island,
that's a.

3853
02:44:33,941 --> 02:44:38,590
That's a crazy rich island saying this
isn't a white white people and whites.

3854
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:41,260
Usually the case.
White people.

3855
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:44,310
White people go,
let's plant the flag.

3856
02:44:44,630 --> 02:44:49,110
Melvin
white sand to go with my wife.

3857
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:51,110
My wife's parents.

3858
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:55,471
Yeah.
That core.

3859
02:44:55,471 --> 02:44:58,030
Datto island.
There's a bunch of fucking donald

3860
02:44:58,031 --> 02:45:00,880
rumsfeld lives there.
It's one of those places are nice.

3861
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:02,830
It's exclusive for sure.
yeah,

3862
02:45:02,831 --> 02:45:04,480
it's weird.
It's like a wave from san diego.

3863
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:07,360
You actually have to go.
You can drive there though,

3864
02:45:07,361 --> 02:45:08,640
right?
You can drive with the drive over.

3865
02:45:08,650 --> 02:45:11,230
Some crazy bridge going out.
They probably have dynamite on the

3866
02:45:11,231 --> 02:45:14,550
bridge just in case fucking riots.
To me,

3867
02:45:16,670 --> 02:45:18,150
it's so weird.
Like the dog,

3868
02:45:18,250 --> 02:45:20,560
the dogs out there,
they're so friendly.

3869
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:22,780
Everything.
It's weird.

3870
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:25,900
Well that was one of the things you said
were you're talking about being able to

3871
02:45:25,901 --> 02:45:28,580
take a wolf feel like I grew up with
like straight pit bulls around.

3872
02:45:28,630 --> 02:45:30,940
I knew how to handle myself in it.
I mean you had to,

3873
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:32,770
you know what I'm saying?
like usually like sometimes you had to

3874
02:45:32,771 --> 02:45:36,310
kick him and run and kick them in the
legs and they limp,

3875
02:45:36,910 --> 02:45:37,330
you know what I'm saying?

3876
02:45:37,330 --> 02:45:39,100
So you had to,
had to maneuver sometimes.

3877
02:45:39,101 --> 02:45:40,310
Sometimes.
I used to outrun them.

3878
02:45:41,510 --> 02:45:45,010
It's tough but it's like I'm,
I mean I'm new to the whole dog thing so

3879
02:45:45,011 --> 02:45:47,250
I got a dog,
I've got a husky was,

3880
02:45:47,380 --> 02:45:50,510
I used to be fearful of dogs,
like not fearful in a sense.

3881
02:45:50,550 --> 02:45:53,350
Like I was scared it was gonna kill me.
Like I just didn't want to have to fight

3882
02:45:53,351 --> 02:45:54,440
the dog.
Like it's not,

3883
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:55,691
it's not in me.
Right.

3884
02:45:55,691 --> 02:45:57,250
So that's a crazy thing to have to worry
about.

3885
02:45:57,570 --> 02:46:00,340
Like it was every bit that I got,
I got bitten in the face when I was

3886
02:46:00,341 --> 02:46:01,570
seven.
Yeah.

3887
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:04,270
So like my uncle,
he was staying with us at the time and

3888
02:46:04,271 --> 02:46:07,090
he had dogs and for like two weeks I
never had a problem before.

3889
02:46:07,091 --> 02:46:08,770
I was like eight.
I never a problem before,

3890
02:46:08,771 --> 02:46:10,100
so I was back from school

3891
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:15,520
and a sudden like I woke up just happy
and I hear her and I was like,

3892
02:46:17,270 --> 02:46:18,350
you know,
it was me,

3893
02:46:18,450 --> 02:46:19,690
like,
you can't talk to dogs.

3894
02:46:19,740 --> 02:46:23,020
So I was scared as shit.
And so like I woke up and he just asked

3895
02:46:23,021 --> 02:46:24,920
me saying ever since then kind of dog.

3896
02:46:25,140 --> 02:46:25,680
Well,
yes.

3897
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:29,260
German shepherd,
bite kids,

3898
02:46:29,270 --> 02:46:31,290
man,
those dogs bite kids.

3899
02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:34,260
When I was a kid,
my aunt got bit by a german shepherd.

3900
02:46:34,261 --> 02:46:36,180
She got a face fucked up by a german
shepherd.

3901
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:39,420
I'm a,
I know two or three other kids that have

3902
02:46:39,421 --> 02:46:41,020
been bitten by german shepherds.
Yeah.

3903
02:46:41,310 --> 02:46:42,143
It was weird,
man.

3904
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:43,990
And so ever since then,
fuck I don't,

3905
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:45,690
I didn't,
I didn't fuck with dogs at all.

3906
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:49,250
Like I hated them.
And then we had this one pit that I got

3907
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:51,900
swept the like dog.
I walked by your fence every day,

3908
02:46:51,901 --> 02:46:53,460
like get it,
get it together,

3909
02:46:53,461 --> 02:46:55,980
man.
But lIke I used to run from him rum from

3910
02:46:56,160 --> 02:46:57,300
so many different.
You know what,

3911
02:46:57,301 --> 02:46:59,110
it probably became a game for him
privately

3912
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:01,620
many different times.
You walk by and still couldn't get you

3913
02:47:01,621 --> 02:47:04,100
on one day.
Motherfuckers gonna come by and I'm

3914
02:47:04,101 --> 02:47:07,510
going to kinda figure my way through
this so I'm going to get them.

3915
02:47:07,690 --> 02:47:08,760
I got nothing else to do.

3916
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:10,660
This one I found out about dogs.
So I finally was like,

3917
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:11,810
I was 29 years old.
I was like,

3918
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:14,010
I got to get over this fear.
Like I gotta get up gotta,

3919
02:47:14,011 --> 02:47:17,940
get a dog and see what it's all about.
So I got a husky cutest little thing

3920
02:47:17,941 --> 02:47:21,990
ever.
And after awhile I started understanding

3921
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:26,400
the dogs more and you understand that
they're really only pieces of shit if

3922
02:47:26,401 --> 02:47:30,180
the owners are pieces of shit.
And so like the dog directly reflects

3923
02:47:30,181 --> 02:47:33,900
its owner.
And so now I understand like growing up

3924
02:47:33,901 --> 02:47:36,480
in the neighborhoods I grew up,
nobody has time or money to care for the

3925
02:47:36,481 --> 02:47:37,500
dog,
like they should.

3926
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,880
So they're henri.
Yeah,

3927
02:47:39,890 --> 02:47:41,400
just like the people.
Yeah.

3928
02:47:41,410 --> 02:47:46,110
It's just like the people.
So as president,

3929
02:47:46,350 --> 02:47:49,390
what's your first move?
A.

3930
02:47:49,390 --> 02:47:49,410
Remember

3931
02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:51,500
I'm not going to be a vice president,
but I'll be like,

3932
02:47:51,501 --> 02:47:54,440
I'm gonna be in my cabinets to much a
house of cards.

3933
02:47:54,470 --> 02:47:57,110
Do you want to know?
I'll be like,

3934
02:47:57,111 --> 02:47:59,480
I'm the dude who got fucked up by the
hooker,

3935
02:48:02,620 --> 02:48:04,310
but I won't be involved in of that.
No.

3936
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:07,160
Sean spIcer,
that fucking dude here take the hits.

3937
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:09,740
He has to go up there and say,
say the bullshit that he knows is not

3938
02:48:09,741 --> 02:48:11,330
true.
That's what I need you to do.

3939
02:48:12,350 --> 02:48:13,340
You know what?
I do do it though.

3940
02:48:13,550 --> 02:48:16,460
I'll let the people know when I'm lying.
I just wear a fake mustache.

3941
02:48:16,820 --> 02:48:19,820
So I'll give the same press conference
and I'll have a fake mustache.

3942
02:48:19,850 --> 02:48:21,260
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

3943
02:48:21,261 --> 02:48:26,090
But sentence the president is an
alerting me of this important news.

3944
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:28,280
You know,
the first thing I probably do,

3945
02:48:28,281 --> 02:48:30,450
I probably pardon?
People in jail for weed.

3946
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:32,410
Oh,
nothing to do with me being here and

3947
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:33,100
talking.
Eat.

3948
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:35,120
But it's like,
it's such a problem.

3949
02:48:35,420 --> 02:48:36,880
It's such a problem.
Yeah.

3950
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:39,800
The president pardoned chelsea manning,
right?

3951
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:42,230
Didn't obama pardoned chelsea manning?
He pardoned him,

3952
02:48:42,231 --> 02:48:44,890
I think at partner commuted her
sentence.

3953
02:48:44,930 --> 02:48:47,480
Yeah.
So pardon means you're exonerated of any

3954
02:48:47,481 --> 02:48:50,360
guilt,
whereas community your sentences just so

3955
02:48:50,361 --> 02:48:52,160
he's allowed to pardon a bunch of people
that.

3956
02:48:52,161 --> 02:48:53,810
Right.
Does he have like 20 pardon or something

3957
02:48:53,811 --> 02:48:54,760
like that?
No.

3958
02:48:54,910 --> 02:48:58,370
You get the most.
I think there's a limit though.

3959
02:48:59,140 --> 02:49:01,190
I don't think there's a limit.
I thought it was like comps,

3960
02:49:01,490 --> 02:49:02,020
like,
you know,

3961
02:49:02,020 --> 02:49:05,330
feel like you work at a comedy club.
You get 20 comps on saturday night.

3962
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:08,040
My friends want to come to this

3963
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:08,873
show.
Good.

3964
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:12,570
Safe table.
Nineteen hundred and 27.

3965
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:13,450
Go for him.
Whoa.

3966
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:15,690
Convicted of federal crimes.
Wow.

3967
02:49:17,460 --> 02:49:19,470
Pardon?
Commutation of sentence.

3968
02:49:19,471 --> 02:49:23,520
Remission of fine or restitution and
reprieve?

3969
02:49:24,200 --> 02:49:25,033
No,
he.

3970
02:49:25,340 --> 02:49:27,600
He should have a list of the people.
Listen to the people.

3971
02:49:27,810 --> 02:49:29,050
Click the list.
It's fine.

3972
02:49:29,051 --> 02:49:30,790
To who?
Alicia did side of chicago.

3973
02:49:31,280 --> 02:49:33,150
Who's at two toolbox,
mom?

3974
02:49:33,350 --> 02:49:34,440
No,
no,

3975
02:49:36,600 --> 02:49:37,110
she was,
uh,

3976
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:39,660
she was uh,
an activist back in the,

3977
02:49:39,930 --> 02:49:43,620
when the black panthers were rising and
she thinks she got political side of

3978
02:49:43,621 --> 02:49:48,030
them and I think it was Cuba and the,
I think it was the fbi was after this

3979
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:51,030
was in the fbi,
was treating the black panthers like a

3980
02:49:51,031 --> 02:49:53,550
terrorist organization and they were
offering.

3981
02:49:53,551 --> 02:49:55,130
They offer huey p,
newton,

3982
02:49:55,131 --> 02:49:58,500
and it was a big deal and a side issue.
I think she's still on the run.

3983
02:49:59,060 --> 02:50:00,420
Whoa.
Where is she?

3984
02:50:00,700 --> 02:50:02,980
I couldn't say.
I think it's not

3985
02:50:05,620 --> 02:50:06,380
pushy.
Uh,

3986
02:50:06,380 --> 02:50:09,570
what was,
what were they accusing her of a that I

3987
02:50:09,571 --> 02:50:10,440
couldn't tell you,
man?

3988
02:50:10,530 --> 02:50:11,670
Uh,
there was,

3989
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:13,770
there's a whole bunch of conspiracies
back then

3990
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:19,220
little member when obama was running for
president and they found out he was

3991
02:50:19,511 --> 02:50:23,870
friends with a professor in chicago.
That was one of the weatherman.

3992
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:28,700
I don't remember the weatherman was a
documentary that I watched duncan trust.

3993
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:30,460
My friend called me up.
Dude,

3994
02:50:30,461 --> 02:50:32,170
you got to see this.
It was crazy.

3995
02:50:32,410 --> 02:50:35,860
They were taking acid and robbing banks
and having orgies together.

3996
02:50:36,210 --> 02:50:37,150
and I was like,
what?

3997
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:40,300
Obama was known as the weatherman,
it was this group,

3998
02:50:40,301 --> 02:50:45,070
this radical group in the 19 seventies
that was trying to overthrow the

3999
02:50:45,071 --> 02:50:48,400
government and they were just a bunch of
crazy people and they were doing acid

4000
02:50:48,401 --> 02:50:51,760
and one of them wound up being a
professor one day.

4001
02:50:52,210 --> 02:50:56,830
Here it is bill ayers and the ninth and
the 2008 presidential election

4002
02:50:56,831 --> 02:50:59,770
controversy.
So this guy was one of the members of

4003
02:50:59,771 --> 02:51:04,771
the weathermen and he went from being
essentially an antigovernment terrorist

4004
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:11,230
to me to be in a college professor.

4005
02:51:12,130 --> 02:51:14,410
And uh,
it was a college professor,

4006
02:51:14,411 --> 02:51:15,280
right?
What does it say here?

4007
02:51:16,390 --> 02:51:17,770
My eyes were way too shitty to read
those.

4008
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:21,250
Trying to read what it says
great.

4009
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:23,590
Confirms or denies,
but it was a big deal.

4010
02:51:23,591 --> 02:51:24,221
Yeah.
It says here,

4011
02:51:24,221 --> 02:51:28,150
the weathermen right there is a
committee heading the weathermen

4012
02:51:28,151 --> 02:51:31,150
starting at its creation the summer of
1969.

4013
02:51:31,420 --> 02:51:34,090
The hippie movement has sort of a hippie
movement,

4014
02:51:34,091 --> 02:51:37,450
but another one of those,
but a lot like a lot of those hippie

4015
02:51:37,451 --> 02:51:39,340
movements.
Hold on a second to claim that those

4016
02:51:39,341 --> 02:51:42,370
three members of the weatherman who had
died during the accident of explosion

4017
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:44,230
all assembling.
Oh,

4018
02:51:44,330 --> 02:51:46,150
they were trying to blow shit up,
man.

4019
02:51:47,230 --> 02:51:50,710
Jesus christ,
project mayhem thing and a fight club.

4020
02:51:50,711 --> 02:51:51,880
That kind of idea.
Yeah.

4021
02:51:51,881 --> 02:51:53,710
They were trying to blow buildings up
and shit.

4022
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:55,293
So,
uh,

4023
02:51:55,360 --> 02:51:58,930
he apparently knew obama,
so he was just like this real super

4024
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:02,170
radical lefty.
Probably did some time.

4025
02:52:02,290 --> 02:52:04,810
got out,
became a college professor.

4026
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:05,800
I mean,
did he go,

4027
02:52:05,801 --> 02:52:05,980
did

4028
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:08,240
he do time?
Um,

4029
02:52:08,241 --> 02:52:12,700
I'm trying to figure out to thing that
how obama was connected to them.

4030
02:52:13,400 --> 02:52:15,580
I think obama just knew him,
you know,

4031
02:52:15,581 --> 02:52:17,650
it was like one of those thinGs.
Yeah.

4032
02:52:18,430 --> 02:52:22,330
Mama contacts with ehrs,
password bIking in the same neighborhood

4033
02:52:22,331 --> 02:52:23,800
or something like,
well,

4034
02:52:23,801 --> 02:52:25,570
what is it?
What's the big deal about that?

4035
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:29,460
I think there's more than that.
I think they had some sort of a,

4036
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:34,470
a cordial friendship and there was a
concern that he was connected to a guy

4037
02:52:35,571 --> 02:52:37,540
that used to be.
BuT the guy was free now.

4038
02:52:37,750 --> 02:52:39,940
Right.
So like what kind of mistakes of people

4039
02:52:39,941 --> 02:52:43,470
made when they're 18 that you can
exonerate them from when they're 50,

4040
02:52:43,710 --> 02:52:45,610
you know,
isn't there like a certain limit to the

4041
02:52:45,611 --> 02:52:48,350
amount of time that you have to be?
You know,

4042
02:52:48,480 --> 02:52:50,550
I
mean,

4043
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:53,650
can you be held responsible for some
shit that you did when you were 18?

4044
02:52:53,650 --> 02:52:56,440
That's tough.
That's the tough about the murder thing.

4045
02:52:56,760 --> 02:52:58,960
Like weather underground,
that's what they call themselves.

4046
02:52:59,020 --> 02:53:00,660
That's not the weatherman.
The weather underground.

4047
02:53:00,661 --> 02:53:03,040
If you kill somebody at 16,
15 years old,

4048
02:53:03,041 --> 02:53:06,120
like life,
like I'm not.

4049
02:53:06,330 --> 02:53:09,180
I guess it's just a tough subject
because I was,

4050
02:53:09,210 --> 02:53:13,880
I had this argument the other day like
how subjective morality is and it's kind

4051
02:53:13,881 --> 02:53:18,881
of all just based on super subjective
life experiences and opinions will have

4052
02:53:19,301 --> 02:53:22,990
a war subjective.
You're allowing people to go over and do

4053
02:53:22,991 --> 02:53:24,190
it and then you,
you,

4054
02:53:24,320 --> 02:53:26,080
you know,
you slip them and say thank you for

4055
02:53:26,081 --> 02:53:30,700
killing those people that have always
been super affect cognitive dissonance

4056
02:53:30,701 --> 02:53:32,110
about that.
LIke it's,

4057
02:53:32,900 --> 02:53:34,470
it's because we,
we've,

4058
02:53:34,471 --> 02:53:36,250
we've,
we've normalized it to the point where

4059
02:53:36,251 --> 02:53:39,020
you see where you hear casualty of war
is a,

4060
02:53:39,360 --> 02:53:41,560
it is a normal term,
uh,

4061
02:53:41,590 --> 02:53:44,830
but those are like innocent civilians
being murdered sometimes,

4062
02:53:45,370 --> 02:53:47,890
sometimes,
and then there's the attitude that they

4063
02:53:47,891 --> 02:53:50,320
have to die in order to serve the
greater good.

4064
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:54,280
Some casual observers have to
accidentally be killed and some

4065
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:56,150
collateral damage.
Yeah,

4066
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:59,010
that makes terrifying.
It really is.

4067
02:53:59,540 --> 02:54:00,520
Yeah.
Well,

4068
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:06,320
the idea is that if we don't do that,
we will lose whatever headstart on

4069
02:54:07,031 --> 02:54:08,650
civilization we have over the rest of
the way.

4070
02:54:08,651 --> 02:54:11,780
just start all over how we do that.
Oh no,

4071
02:54:11,900 --> 02:54:14,110
It sounds right.
That sounds like some people say after

4072
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:19,140
they smoke pot,
I know we should be able to write,

4073
02:54:20,891 --> 02:54:22,780
but how would we,
what would we do?

4074
02:54:22,990 --> 02:54:27,160
I feel like we got enough technology and
enough smart people to just sit around

4075
02:54:27,161 --> 02:54:27,950
and say,
iron man,

4076
02:54:27,950 --> 02:54:31,090
this ain't working.
I totally agree,

4077
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:34,240
but I'm definitely have enough resources
to feed everybody.

4078
02:54:35,470 --> 02:54:36,880
Well,
we certainly are close.

4079
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:38,230
I think we have.
Yeah,

4080
02:54:38,231 --> 02:54:41,860
I mean it's a matter of figuring out
where to put it in whether or not we

4081
02:54:41,861 --> 02:54:45,960
should be eating the same shit we're
already eating because you know,

4082
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:51,130
if you look at all the different people
that are living in this country eating

4083
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:53,440
corn products,
just that alone,

4084
02:54:53,441 --> 02:54:54,340
like why is that the case?

4085
02:54:54,340 --> 02:54:56,040
Like why is corn and so many different
things.

4086
02:54:56,410 --> 02:54:58,780
It's not because it's good for you,
it's not because we're doing the best

4087
02:54:58,781 --> 02:55:00,160
job arose in abundance,
right,

4088
02:55:00,530 --> 02:55:04,040
well you can grow massive amounts of it
and these fields and the government

4089
02:55:04,041 --> 02:55:07,510
subsidizes it and then it becomes a
whole entangled sort of a system where

4090
02:55:07,511 --> 02:55:10,700
the farmers are growing it and If they
didn't have a subsidy from the

4091
02:55:10,701 --> 02:55:12,140
government,
it wouldn't be profitable.

4092
02:55:12,141 --> 02:55:14,060
But it is profitable.
And then the government,

4093
02:55:14,270 --> 02:55:14,811
you know,
they,

4094
02:55:14,811 --> 02:55:17,240
they know that those places,
they got to count on those folks when it

4095
02:55:17,241 --> 02:55:19,340
comes to like elections and things along
those lines.

4096
02:55:19,550 --> 02:55:22,870
And I started going to mess.
He gets entangled I guess.

4097
02:55:22,880 --> 02:55:23,830
Messy man.
Yeah.

4098
02:55:23,831 --> 02:55:27,170
So do we have enough to feed each other
with the way we're eating now?

4099
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:28,190
Yeah,
for sure.

4100
02:55:28,460 --> 02:55:30,020
But we shouldn't eat and the way we're
eating now,

4101
02:55:30,140 --> 02:55:31,670
so it's like,
yeah,

4102
02:55:32,060 --> 02:55:35,450
for sure we have enough food to feed
people the way we eat now,

4103
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:38,260
but we should be eating like at whole
foods.

4104
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:41,240
It's like when you go to whole foods is
like,

4105
02:55:41,241 --> 02:55:42,890
oh man,
you got to be registered shop here.

4106
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:44,960
Like why is that?
It's food.

4107
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:48,530
It's fucking real food.
Organic shit always.

4108
02:55:48,590 --> 02:55:50,300
I don't really understand that whole
thing either.

4109
02:55:51,230 --> 02:55:53,330
Well,
I mean it just means they don't have

4110
02:55:53,390 --> 02:55:54,650
pesticides on it.
right.

4111
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,050
Everything is organic.
Phyllis,

4112
02:55:57,470 --> 02:55:59,980
philosophically you can make.
You can make that argument every short

4113
02:55:59,990 --> 02:56:01,610
organic.
Even if we tamper with it,

4114
02:56:01,611 --> 02:56:03,200
we're organic.
We're from the earth.

4115
02:56:03,320 --> 02:56:05,000
Poisons natural.
That's what I'm saying.

4116
02:56:05,090 --> 02:56:07,700
Yeah.
I mean everything that you make is made

4117
02:56:07,701 --> 02:56:10,040
out of something on earth.
So anything that's artificial or

4118
02:56:10,041 --> 02:56:14,300
chemical or whatever the fuck it is
still made out of raw materials that are

4119
02:56:14,301 --> 02:56:16,940
found here on earth.
I agree.

4120
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:20,360
Yeah.
I mean some organic food is better for

4121
02:56:20,361 --> 02:56:22,850
you probably because it doesn't have
chemicals on it.

4122
02:56:23,240 --> 02:56:26,960
And with the idea of gmo is where it
gets real weird because almost

4123
02:56:26,961 --> 02:56:28,520
everything is genetically modified.

4124
02:56:28,930 --> 02:56:29,763
My uh,
my,

4125
02:56:29,800 --> 02:56:32,840
my stepdad's when they hit me today,
he's a geneticist.

4126
02:56:33,050 --> 02:56:33,591
Oh yeah,
yeah.

4127
02:56:33,591 --> 02:56:36,290
Phd.
He actually developed one of the firSt

4128
02:56:36,470 --> 02:56:40,680
strands for the tyson chicken.
And so he's like a bad ass to this

4129
02:56:40,750 --> 02:56:42,230
making franken chicken,
man.

4130
02:56:42,231 --> 02:56:44,570
So what did he do?
What did he do?

4131
02:56:44,750 --> 02:56:46,380
I mean,
I couldn't tell you how many chicken the

4132
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:51,400
fuck.
I don't know what he tells us stories

4133
02:56:51,591 --> 02:56:54,860
about how he like genetically modified.
You can genetically modified chickens

4134
02:56:54,861 --> 02:56:57,290
without feathers and all of this stuff.
That's crazy,

4135
02:56:57,291 --> 02:56:58,610
man.
Oh my god.

4136
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:01,160
That gene spLicing shit is amazing to
me.

4137
02:57:01,250 --> 02:57:02,430
Have you heard,
have you heard of crispr?

4138
02:57:03,500 --> 02:57:08,270
That shit is so you.
So you open that pandora's box of once

4139
02:57:08,271 --> 02:57:11,690
you genetically modify human,
you can't go backwards because they've

4140
02:57:11,691 --> 02:57:13,670
already started to do with embryos in
China.

4141
02:57:13,950 --> 02:57:14,721
Really?
Yeah.

4142
02:57:14,721 --> 02:57:17,060
They're starting to do with non-viable
human embryos.

4143
02:57:18,110 --> 02:57:21,170
So they're taking non-viable human
embryos and they're doing all these

4144
02:57:21,171 --> 02:57:23,780
genetic experiments on them and altering
the genes.

4145
02:57:23,781 --> 02:57:28,781
But the thing is,
what it is now is it's like the baby

4146
02:57:28,821 --> 02:57:32,870
steps towards something that will
probably be just,

4147
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:36,440
it's going to be standard maybe 100
years from now or whether that's the

4148
02:57:36,441 --> 02:57:38,990
next step in our evolutionary history.
What is this?

4149
02:57:38,991 --> 02:57:43,400
Jamie python breeder.
Genetically bred a python to have an

4150
02:57:43,401 --> 02:57:46,820
emoji on it home.
Oh my god.

4151
02:57:46,910 --> 02:57:48,460
I'm seeing it.
I didn't see it.

4152
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:53,390
It's got smiley faces all over it.
This is fucking insane.

4153
02:57:53,420 --> 02:57:55,150
How did he do that?
I just breed.

4154
02:57:55,160 --> 02:57:58,280
I think you said it took like eight
generations of breeding and can I can

4155
02:57:58,281 --> 02:58:01,930
sell this worth 4,500 bucks and 40 it
might.

4156
02:58:01,931 --> 02:58:04,650
Might've been wearing initially.
That's amazing.

4157
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:06,990
That's so cool.
That is so cool.

4158
02:58:06,991 --> 02:58:11,700
Looking emoji pythons as crazy.
And that's crazy because that's just

4159
02:58:11,701 --> 02:58:12,630
done through breeding.

4160
02:58:12,630 --> 02:58:16,170
Like like how to make a husky out of a
wolf and that's done through breeding.

4161
02:58:16,690 --> 02:58:19,200
But there's,
you know what you're talking about

4162
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:23,160
chickens that don't have any feathers
like serious science.

4163
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:26,970
So it goes deep,
like to the point of like how far do you

4164
02:58:26,971 --> 02:58:29,730
want to.
How far the restraints of our,

4165
02:58:29,820 --> 02:58:34,820
of our humanity and humanity is,
so if you genetically modify humans to

4166
02:58:35,251 --> 02:58:37,040
the point where,
uh,

4167
02:58:37,170 --> 02:58:41,340
you take out the genes that is the
cancer gene and you take out the jeans

4168
02:58:41,341 --> 02:58:44,700
and this and that and have that and to
the point of we're living our health

4169
02:58:44,701 --> 02:58:47,160
expectancy or the life expectancy goes
up exponentially.

4170
02:58:47,430 --> 02:58:48,660
Like,
is it,

4171
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:52,860
would it be moral to not take those
genes out of your kids?

4172
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:54,433
You know what I'm saying?

4173
02:58:56,320 --> 02:58:59,130
Here's a good question.
And then yeah,

4174
02:58:59,131 --> 02:59:00,360
the people that would be like,
look,

4175
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:03,000
I know my kid's gonna have a disease,
but that's what god intended.

4176
02:59:03,030 --> 02:59:03,863
Like,
whoa.

4177
02:59:04,210 --> 02:59:05,460
For ns.
To me,

4178
02:59:05,461 --> 02:59:08,430
that shit is crazy.
It's.

4179
02:59:08,550 --> 02:59:09,990
but it's also debatable,
right?

4180
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:11,560
The reason why.
yeah.

4181
02:59:11,580 --> 02:59:14,580
That's the reason why they have that
opinion in the first place is because

4182
02:59:14,581 --> 02:59:17,070
like,
I guess you could argue it even if I

4183
02:59:17,071 --> 02:59:18,900
don't agree with it.
You could argue that opinion.

4184
02:59:19,590 --> 02:59:21,570
And that's one of the weirdest things
about people.

4185
02:59:21,571 --> 02:59:25,260
There's just so much messiness to us
when it comes to something like that,

4186
02:59:25,261 --> 02:59:29,460
like some new technology.
That's a crazy technology.

4187
02:59:29,900 --> 02:59:33,000
You can make a super kid like you can
make your kids seven feet tall,

4188
02:59:33,001 --> 02:59:37,520
400 pounds solid muscle runs through
walls or make them a little pussy when

4189
02:59:37,530 --> 02:59:40,060
you want it to be a pussy,
whatever.

4190
02:59:40,260 --> 02:59:41,640
They only have two models.

4191
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:45,300
You know,
if you have a prius or a mustang.

4192
02:59:45,360 --> 02:59:47,670
Shelby,
that's it.

4193
02:59:47,700 --> 02:59:48,750
One of the two.
What are you gonna do?

4194
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:49,930
Oh,
we'll just take the prius.

4195
02:59:49,931 --> 02:59:51,420
My kids just going to read a lot of
books.

4196
02:59:51,450 --> 02:59:55,000
Fuck that.
My kids run through buildings now,

4197
02:59:55,110 --> 02:59:56,190
man.
I'm going to take the prius,

4198
02:59:56,191 --> 02:59:57,024
man.
Would you?

4199
02:59:57,230 --> 02:59:58,350
Well,
you already ran through building.

4200
03:00:00,050 --> 03:00:01,470
My opinion.
Skewed.

4201
03:00:01,980 --> 03:00:03,930
Yeah.
You should probably write a book on how

4202
03:00:03,931 --> 03:00:08,730
not to play football and be a good book.
It might not be a bad book coming from a

4203
03:00:08,731 --> 03:00:09,930
guy like you.
People would.

4204
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:11,870
People would definitely read it
official.

4205
03:00:12,150 --> 03:00:14,730
If maybe if I had to do again,
I'd never played football.

4206
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:16,260
Yeah.
Maybe that would be your book.

4207
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:19,380
see you started when you were seven.
Man.

4208
03:00:19,381 --> 03:00:20,400
How the fuck could,
you know?

4209
03:00:20,850 --> 03:00:22,410
That's what I'm saying.
Like I had no,

4210
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:24,690
whose idea was it a,
it was ours,

4211
03:00:24,691 --> 03:00:26,880
so me and my brother was just like,
fuck it,

4212
03:00:26,881 --> 03:00:27,714
let's play football.

4213
03:00:28,710 --> 03:00:29,610
I mean,
fine,

4214
03:00:29,620 --> 03:00:31,200
You're fat,
you're fat of it as a kid.

4215
03:00:31,500 --> 03:00:36,060
And so to me it's fun playing sports is
fun and it's fun to watch.

4216
03:00:36,090 --> 03:00:37,080
Yeah.
And so,

4217
03:00:37,140 --> 03:00:40,110
but the comradery you got from it.
Like I loved the life experiences like

4218
03:00:40,111 --> 03:00:42,360
that,
but it's just like I just feel like I

4219
03:00:42,361 --> 03:00:46,340
have so much more to me than that and I
just don't want to say wasted because it

4220
03:00:46,341 --> 03:00:48,030
was a,
it was a grand experience,

4221
03:00:48,031 --> 03:00:52,830
but I just put so much time into my life
that ended in an instant.

4222
03:00:52,920 --> 03:00:54,690
You know what I mean?
And it just feels like a lot of,

4223
03:00:54,691 --> 03:00:58,050
I don't say wasted time,
but it just feels like a lot of things I

4224
03:00:58,051 --> 03:01:00,270
feel like could still be benefited

4225
03:01:00,270 --> 03:01:02,020
me to this day.
I think so too.

4226
03:01:02,021 --> 03:01:03,920
Now I'm going to say something,
but whenever I say it,

4227
03:01:03,930 --> 03:01:05,920
people get mad at me,
but I have to say,

4228
03:01:06,310 --> 03:01:09,190
you should start a podcast.
I should start a pocket.

4229
03:01:09,220 --> 03:01:11,470
fuck yeah,
definitely should start a podcast.

4230
03:01:11,471 --> 03:01:14,570
Don't you think so jamie?
People like fucking rogan.

4231
03:01:14,720 --> 03:01:19,720
stop telling.
Interesting people should have podcasts.

4232
03:01:19,721 --> 03:01:22,330
Your story's interesting.
You know the whole thing thAt you're

4233
03:01:22,331 --> 03:01:24,970
doing right now is interesting.
Trying to figure out who the fuck you

4234
03:01:24,971 --> 03:01:29,110
are and 30 years of age after being a
famous football player and thinking you

4235
03:01:29,111 --> 03:01:30,700
could fuck a wolf up with your bare
hands.

4236
03:01:30,750 --> 03:01:31,930
See,
that's fascinating.

4237
03:01:31,960 --> 03:01:36,960
It's not thinking she's going to jump on
it right now to jump into five.

4238
03:01:37,750 --> 03:01:39,090
Man.
Now I've thought about it.

4239
03:01:39,460 --> 03:01:40,990
Talk about some of them people,
but it's like,

4240
03:01:41,360 --> 03:01:44,260
oh no,
you don't even have to do it like all

4241
03:01:44,261 --> 03:01:45,010
the time.

4242
03:01:45,010 --> 03:01:46,340
You can do it whenever you want.
Right?

4243
03:01:46,420 --> 03:01:49,990
Like people are under no obligation to
get it every day.

4244
03:01:49,991 --> 03:01:51,730
It's not like you're forcing them to
like,

4245
03:01:51,910 --> 03:01:53,690
okay look,
I'm going to sign the contract.

4246
03:01:53,691 --> 03:01:56,570
Do you guys pay me x amount of money?
I'm going to do this every monday to

4247
03:01:56,590 --> 03:01:58,240
whenever you want.
You do it on your phone.

4248
03:01:58,570 --> 03:01:59,640
I'll show you how to do it on your
phone.

4249
03:01:59,860 --> 03:02:02,980
I guess I got a laptop,
but I mean if you're somewhere.

4250
03:02:03,550 --> 03:02:07,450
YeAh,
like right now if we want it to set my

4251
03:02:07,451 --> 03:02:09,790
phone down here,
press the voice recorder and I'm telling

4252
03:02:09,791 --> 03:02:12,520
you it sounds good.
Like this ideA that you need like a lot

4253
03:02:12,521 --> 03:02:15,280
of equipment to do a podcast and you've
really not really.

4254
03:02:15,281 --> 03:02:19,180
I mean it sounds better.
You keep killing the game.

4255
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:22,510
Trying to stay one step ahead of the
free and I walked into a.

4256
03:02:22,610 --> 03:02:25,060
I like this is just for podcasts.
That's crazy.

4257
03:02:25,480 --> 03:02:29,170
Well we'll just wait till the next one
after we built studio dose.

4258
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:30,430
I gotta come back,
man.

4259
03:02:30,431 --> 03:02:31,040
Yeah,
for sure.

4260
03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:36,040
Free party world headquarters.
We're having a party party world

4261
03:02:36,611 --> 03:02:38,680
headquarters is where the next building
as it's going down.

4262
03:02:38,980 --> 03:02:41,170
that's good praise man.
You would have the best doing it for

4263
03:02:41,171 --> 03:02:42,250
show.
Thanks man.

4264
03:02:42,251 --> 03:02:43,690
You could do it for sure.
One hundred percent.

4265
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:45,640
like you could do.
Stand up too if you want to do that.

4266
03:02:45,641 --> 03:02:46,720
You don't do that.
Go man.

4267
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:48,050
There you go.
Got it.

4268
03:02:48,210 --> 03:02:51,160
The stand up thing.
I know about the pocket brendan shops

4269
03:02:51,161 --> 03:02:52,840
doing it.
My friend brendan shop,

4270
03:02:52,870 --> 03:02:54,310
he played.
What did he play for?

4271
03:02:55,210 --> 03:02:57,940
You got to play does preseason with the
bills.

4272
03:02:57,941 --> 03:03:02,140
I think as far as any fought in the ufc,
he was on the ultimate fighter and the

4273
03:03:02,150 --> 03:03:03,180
uh,
fought in ufc,

4274
03:03:03,190 --> 03:03:04,930
had some big wins I've seen now.

4275
03:03:04,930 --> 03:03:07,540
He has a podcast,
a real successful to two podcasts

4276
03:03:07,720 --> 03:03:10,630
fighter and the kid and he does this
thing called the big brown breakdown

4277
03:03:10,900 --> 03:03:13,390
where he goes over all the different
fights that are coming up.

4278
03:03:13,810 --> 03:03:17,920
So he went and now he's doing standup.
So he went from fighting,

4279
03:03:17,980 --> 03:03:21,010
like deciding like as a,
as an athlete,

4280
03:03:21,011 --> 03:03:22,480
like he was getting towards the end of
his run,

4281
03:03:23,140 --> 03:03:25,750
left fighting,
and then now it's like way more

4282
03:03:25,751 --> 03:03:30,640
successful doing this podcast and doing
standup and doing live podcast shows so

4283
03:03:30,641 --> 03:03:32,680
he could do it.
And you talk way better than him.

4284
03:03:32,710 --> 03:03:36,520
No offense books,
man.

4285
03:03:36,521 --> 03:03:39,670
I appreciate
me under the bus.

4286
03:03:39,870 --> 03:03:42,070
I was kid and he's,
he's a funny dude,

4287
03:03:42,071 --> 03:03:43,540
man.
Brenda's really funny.

4288
03:03:43,541 --> 03:03:45,700
He says hilarious shit.
You can do it too,

4289
03:03:45,701 --> 03:03:46,534
man.
I'm telling.

4290
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:50,260
The beautiful thing about podcasting too
is that you don't have to be anything

4291
03:03:50,530 --> 03:03:53,200
like you don't.
You could be funny or you could be smart

4292
03:03:53,230 --> 03:03:57,840
or you could be interesting like you,
whoever you are and just like that

4293
03:03:57,841 --> 03:03:58,430
stupid

4294
03:03:58,430 --> 03:04:01,130
box on the ground at the la county
museum of art.

4295
03:04:01,780 --> 03:04:04,790
Like some people might.
Some people might like that.

4296
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:06,610
No matter who you are.
Some people.

4297
03:04:06,620 --> 03:04:08,930
I'm not saying that you will be that box
metaphor.

4298
03:04:08,960 --> 03:04:11,150
Let's go with hot food.
You are in amber box

4299
03:04:12,950 --> 03:04:15,480
in your own right.
I was.

4300
03:04:15,590 --> 03:04:18,110
I should've gone with hot food.
Hot food fan.

4301
03:04:18,111 --> 03:04:20,390
I'm not a fan of that box,
but I'm saying some people fucking hate

4302
03:04:20,391 --> 03:04:21,200
hot food.
right?

4303
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:22,450
I don't understand those.
Yeah,

4304
03:04:22,460 --> 03:04:24,020
man.
He bring some people hot food.

4305
03:04:24,021 --> 03:04:26,840
They freak out.
TheY like like mashed potatoes.

4306
03:04:26,841 --> 03:04:29,000
That's what they like.
Mashed potatoes and boiled chicken.

4307
03:04:29,470 --> 03:04:31,950
Boiled chicken.
I like boiled chicken.

4308
03:04:32,090 --> 03:04:33,360
Disrespectful.
No,

4309
03:04:33,370 --> 03:04:33,901
no,
no,

4310
03:04:33,901 --> 03:04:34,734
no.
Soup.

4311
03:04:34,820 --> 03:04:37,640
Chicken soup is boiled chicken.
You got grill that at least first and

4312
03:04:37,641 --> 03:04:41,140
then just know how to cook us.
Usc.

4313
03:04:41,190 --> 03:04:44,180
You will be a cook.
I cook a few things.

4314
03:04:44,240 --> 03:04:46,150
Do you low,
but yeah.

4315
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:48,020
Where did that come from?
That's

4316
03:04:49,550 --> 03:04:51,860
last year.
Well listen,

4317
03:04:51,890 --> 03:04:54,950
here's what's crazy.
That picture has been redone.

4318
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:58,010
Think about all the images on the
internet is a beautiful place.

4319
03:04:58,011 --> 03:05:01,020
There's one dude who's like,
what does he deal with?

4320
03:05:01,030 --> 03:05:02,150
Saudi original?
No,

4321
03:05:02,151 --> 03:05:02,984
I did.

4322
03:05:05,530 --> 03:05:06,200
Yeah,
he's in Turkey.

4323
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:11,150
I thought he was in.
He's cutting this steak and he's dealing

4324
03:05:11,151 --> 03:05:15,450
with all this flare and every time he
cuts it he slaps his knife on the table,

4325
03:05:15,480 --> 03:05:17,780
but he does it with so much swag.
Yeah,

4326
03:05:17,810 --> 03:05:20,270
he's slicing through the.
I bet this guy get so much pussy.

4327
03:05:20,940 --> 03:05:22,200
It's not even close.
Right?

4328
03:05:22,580 --> 03:05:26,270
Because this is part of the reason.
I mean this germinating the latin lover,

4329
03:05:26,271 --> 03:05:30,170
romantic chef character.
So he geTs to the end.

4330
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:32,450
He could just lay them out,
but he.

4331
03:05:32,810 --> 03:05:35,210
Yeah,
and then he takes this it.

4332
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:37,790
He throws some,
sprinkled some salt on it.

4333
03:05:38,060 --> 03:05:43,060
That became that one thing.
A guy sprinkling salt became a meme that

4334
03:05:44,421 --> 03:05:47,150
just kept over and over and over again
was man,

4335
03:05:47,630 --> 03:05:48,463
it was black.
Twitter.

4336
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:49,940
Was that what it was like?
Twitter,

4337
03:05:50,360 --> 03:05:52,940
black.
Twitter is probably the most.

4338
03:05:53,410 --> 03:05:57,110
That needs to be a documentary about
that to be because it pushes so much of

4339
03:05:57,111 --> 03:05:57,650
our culture.

4340
03:05:57,650 --> 03:05:59,210
It's a.
Twitter does.

4341
03:05:59,720 --> 03:06:02,390
Jamie says that people steal from black
twitter,

4342
03:06:02,660 --> 03:06:05,390
do it on like a tonight,
show movies,

4343
03:06:05,730 --> 03:06:08,160
not tv,
show montages,

4344
03:06:08,190 --> 03:06:10,420
snl,
snl steals from the time

4345
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:16,100
it's not good.
It's just hashtag black twitter.

4346
03:06:16,300 --> 03:06:17,133
Just there's,
look,

4347
03:06:18,170 --> 03:06:20,150
I can't even get 100 percent.
Explain what it is,

4348
03:06:20,151 --> 03:06:21,890
but if someone's got to help me,
I got you man.

4349
03:06:21,891 --> 03:06:25,040
So how about did I get you?
I get like five or six accounts to

4350
03:06:25,041 --> 03:06:26,600
follow and you'll kind of get a feel
for.

4351
03:06:26,990 --> 03:06:27,480
Okay.
And then,

4352
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:29,210
uh,
I follow accounts that those people

4353
03:06:29,211 --> 03:06:30,310
interact with.
Yeah.

4354
03:06:30,350 --> 03:06:31,470
And then you see like,
so,

4355
03:06:31,471 --> 03:06:34,780
so a lot of the content that you see,
you know that Jordan cry face me like

4356
03:06:34,790 --> 03:06:36,320
twitter.
Oh,

4357
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:38,980
it's like they,
they moved to man,

4358
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:40,790
I say a week and I'm on to it and I'm
black.

4359
03:06:40,791 --> 03:06:41,940
So I bought.
It's,

4360
03:06:41,950 --> 03:06:43,850
it's,
it's ignorance at a very high level,

4361
03:06:43,851 --> 03:06:46,040
but there's brilliant involved.

4362
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:48,650
It's the coolest shit.
What's the brunch of humor?

4363
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:49,571
The humor.
Yeah,

4364
03:06:49,571 --> 03:06:50,051
the,
I mean,

4365
03:06:50,051 --> 03:06:50,990
you know,
as you know,

4366
03:06:51,170 --> 03:06:53,750
any kind of like a lot of humans is his
intellect,

4367
03:06:54,140 --> 03:06:57,180
his intellect.
And so the brilliance that comes from

4368
03:06:57,181 --> 03:06:58,800
that.
Is this the funniest shit?

4369
03:06:59,030 --> 03:07:00,120
All right,
I'm going to check it out.

4370
03:07:00,150 --> 03:07:03,270
Jamie's very well educated.
You know about blacks were kept for.

4371
03:07:03,271 --> 03:07:05,600
So yeah,
he buys yeezys.

4372
03:07:06,200 --> 03:07:09,200
See I can never get them with jamie
online.

4373
03:07:09,290 --> 03:07:11,040
He's not on black twitter.
No,

4374
03:07:11,100 --> 03:07:12,750
he's not.
He's,

4375
03:07:12,820 --> 03:07:14,740
he's been ousted.
He'll be rough.

4376
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:16,290
That'S my dude though,
man.

4377
03:07:16,530 --> 03:07:18,420
Well,
they asked him and then he immediately

4378
03:07:18,421 --> 03:07:20,340
Started producing it.
Anti-trump record.

4379
03:07:20,370 --> 03:07:24,240
he recognized what the fuck went down.
He deleted all his pro trump tweets.

4380
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:26,900
All of them are gone and now he's
producing some ant.

4381
03:07:26,901 --> 03:07:28,920
A buddy hired who?
You got another rapper like,

4382
03:07:28,921 --> 03:07:30,960
hey man,
how about you do this song?

4383
03:07:32,430 --> 03:07:36,390
He's helping the duty for him.
He felt he felt it.

4384
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:39,780
He's,
he's up there on a platform hovering

4385
03:07:39,781 --> 03:07:42,550
over people saying he would have voted
on trump yet craig.

4386
03:07:43,290 --> 03:07:45,480
No songs,
no songs properly at the propaganda.

4387
03:07:45,570 --> 03:07:46,460
It's propaganda.
Yeah,

4388
03:07:46,650 --> 03:07:48,120
that's what he did.
Deleted the tweet.

4389
03:07:48,121 --> 03:07:50,060
Said fake news.
I bet it's not fake news.

4390
03:07:50,460 --> 03:07:52,050
Uh,
but nobody wants to talk about it.

4391
03:07:52,080 --> 03:07:54,640
That is reconsidering about Donald
Trump.

4392
03:07:54,990 --> 03:07:56,850
Kanye,
kanye.

4393
03:07:56,851 --> 03:07:58,910
I thought you liked trump.
I thought you loved trump,

4394
03:07:59,130 --> 03:08:02,250
anti antitrypsin properly.
It's called propaganda,

4395
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:04,800

Did he have anything to do with it?

I don't know.
How did he.

03:08:10,801 --> 03:08:11,790
flowing.
