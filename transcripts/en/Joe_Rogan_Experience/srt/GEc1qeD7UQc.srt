1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,370
I know you guys are banging into your
coffee

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,190
and we're live.
You're jumping into swamps and English

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,110
royalties.
Homes

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,700
like to be introduced together.
You can get very careful when you get

5
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:20,701
into those sort of predicament in
beheading around every corner when she

6
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:24,190
messed with the royal family's private
swamps,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,990
especially if you're doing it for some
sort of a psychedelic purpose.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,300
You're trying to elevate yourself by
freezing yourself in there.

9
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,650
Cold,
swampy waters,

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,890
freeing yourself.
If you're embarking on a journey of

11
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:38,650
personal shamanism on royal territory.
Yeah,

12
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:40,360
yeah.
Your life's in your hands.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,740
Your life could shrivel up as quickly as
my sex organs did in that particular

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,930
predicament.
It's definitely an added element.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,790
The ads,
you have to consider it.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,210
It's not a place to go for pride,
but as soon as I like,

17
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,810
yeah,
as soon as I was sort of submerged in

18
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:53,810
it,
that's what those.

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,230
Because even that is just the.

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,160
In this case,
just an example of me,

21
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:01,360
a man simply jumping into cold lake and
I do have a tendency to over poeticize

22
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,470
the mundane experiences of me everyday
life,

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,790
but why not?
What else are we going to do while were

24
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,810
in a.
It did make me think.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,430
We are living on narrow lines,
narrow train tracks of existence,

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,870
never to have hurt myself,
got

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,140
animal nor capable of.
That's that sort of almost like an anti

28
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:24,790
orgasm like a negative repeat with you
would before what you said before you

29
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,520
got on camera,
how it represents the subconscious and

30
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:32,521
that going into the murky depths.
That main role is is in fairy stories,

31
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:35,680
myths and religion person,
if you're not already,

32
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,710
you reckon you'd world love is it?
Or an American scholar called Joseph

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,410
Campbell who was a cultural
anthropologist and he studied various

34
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:47,530
religions and folk towels and found
Corolla and comparisons and

35
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:51,610
consistencies and and sort of said that
where there are consistencies,

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,150
there's true.

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,090
If there's some Icelandic myth and it's
telling basically at the same story,

38
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:59,630
some African story of some native
American story or some daft Celtic folk

39
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:02,410
tale.
Why are human beings dislocated all over

40
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:03,760
the world,
coming up the same stories,

41
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,960
coming up the same experiences?
Well,

42
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,560
often in these stories,
the forest is used as the unconscious,

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,290
not only the forest represents the
unconscious,

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,140
often in mythology,
and you know when a character has to go

45
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:16,150
into the woods,
that means you've got to go into

46
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,410
yourself,
you're gonna have to go into new

47
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:22,411
territory and also under the water.
Similarly also represents

48
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:24,160
unconsciousness and will interest in
baton.

49
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:27,010
All.
Joe Is like not only ancient mythologies

50
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:30,490
and old stories,
but also personal dreams.

51
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:34,170
If you yourself have a drug like this is
where the work of Joseph Campbell in sex

52
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,170
with a worker,
Carl young dude,

53
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,790
he like.
He noticed that people in their personal

54
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,420
myths that drives your cameras,
said dreams are private myths.

55
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,080
Myths are public dreams in people's
personal dreams.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,100
They come up with images,
archetypes and stories that can also be

57
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,840
found in fairy tales.
You know,

58
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,000
just someone asleep.
I,

59
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,690
Oh,
I was just walking and I went into the

60
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,470
woods and I met this old woman in the
woods and she told me that everything

61
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,540
was going to be okay,
and then she put up a hood and winch

62
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,470
took a hood down again.
It was my mother's face.

63
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,910
He's like,
people are inventing their own myths

64
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,860
like that because of course all culture
is created by consciousness,

65
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,130
so on some level it's in us.
It's in US individually.

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah.
Joseph Campbell's work is amazing and

67
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:18,480
when you do look at all the different
stories and how they coincide and how,

68
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,790
how many similarities they share,
it is really interesting to see what are

69
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,280
people trying to accomplish with these
archetypes,

70
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,370
like what are they trying to sort out
because it seems like that has to be

71
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,180
some things.

72
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,720
Lessons passed down to children than to
pass down to other people so they can

73
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:34,420
learn things without having to
experience the woods themselves.

74
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,990
But then there's also some sort of
archetypes that they're sort of defining

75
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:41,230
the reality around them in a very
similar way all over the world.

76
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,250
I suppose what I record joe is the more
diverse our culture,

77
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,550
but like know it's weird isn't because
we don't want to live with globalization

78
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,720
and homogenization were cultural.
Corporatism is coming uniform for our

79
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,250
world,
but also there are many,

80
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,200
many,
many disparate experiences,

81
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,280
but on some level as human beings,
if we are anatomically as similar as we

82
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,710
are,
perhaps it's safe to assume that we're

83
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,160
psychologically comparatively similar
like you know,

84
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,760
even though you and I also so different
body types or whatever and look sort of

85
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:13,150
at a glance kind of dealing with both.
Ultimately you've got the same organs

86
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,910
with running in pretty much the same way
or perhaps we have the same

87
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,120
psychological Palette,
so throughout the world people are.

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,300
Everyone's having a very similar
experience of being human.

89
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,480
The anxiety of not being good enough,
the fear of death,

90
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,440
constantly looking for something in the
outside world that's gonna solve the

91
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:33,010
problems that's going to answer your
questions and like in a lot of these

92
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,430
ancient texts that I've mostly got at
fruit,

93
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:38,440
Joseph Campbell or you know,
Hinduism for beginners,

94
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,740
that's normally my entry point.
I like Uma auto didact,

95
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,570
self taught person.
That's one of the things I love about

96
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,840
your podcast is that can you can hear
you.

97
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,780
This is a person educated themselves and
continuing to educate themselves through

98
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,770
life.
Well,

99
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,020
like one of the things that are picked
up in that.

100
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,880
It's like the Indian very,
very ancient texts.

101
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,310
There are people that the same way as in
our,

102
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:00,310
like in our our time that's defined by
science and technology.

103
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,310
There were times where people define
themselves through meditation and

104
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,440
experiences in income,
in consciousness.

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,650
Like those people that wrote say the
upanishads,

106
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:11,320
whoever the hell they were.
These ratios,

107
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:14,260
these ancient Indian yogis that when
into deep,

108
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,320
deep meditative states and came back
with mantras and truves.

109
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,980
Those people are as diligent and as
fastidious as a scientist in a

110
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,960
laboratory that comes back and goes,
well look,

111
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:23,501
we've,
you know,

112
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:24,470
we've broke down,
you know,

113
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,370
Watson and Crick break it down the DNA.
They come back and go,

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
this is what it is to be human.
You are going to die.

115
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,320
You need to get.
You need to come to terms with the

116
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:35,050
relationship between your contract sale
for new material self.

117
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,640
That's the.
For me,

118
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:41,170
that's the stuff like that's the
conversation that I'm into and that's

119
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:43,240
why whenever I find it,
wherever it comes from Joseph Campbell

120
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,640
or young or even checking out this
podcast,

121
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,910
like a lot of stuff can hancock Graham
in Cox into that.

122
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,640
Always a pressie something deep in me.
That's why I'm always looking for,

123
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,474
you know,
Joe,

124
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,140
the moment we think that shutter you get
there's truth in there,

125
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,160
you know?
Yeah.

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,750
Well those pass that you're talking
about,

127
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,770
those paths that are carved in that we.
We sort of normalize all the experiences

128
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,340
that we have so they look totally,
totally sane.

129
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,870
If you just straight off those paths and
jump into that Lake and freeze your Dick

130
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,630
off and get out and you just do.
Why did I do that?

131
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,060
What are you.
You broke your little Jane,

132
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,730
the little chain of programming that's
going on in your brain.

133
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:23,690
You did something completely unusual and
sometimes just little things like that

134
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,110
little deviations off of that path will
take you into a completely different

135
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,944
place.

136
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,860
Are you still doing that kind of thing
in your life now?

137
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,913
Yeah,
sure.

138
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,920
That all the time with wherever it's the
cryo chambers or the isolation tanks or

139
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:45,241
the experiences with WESCO and ask it,
but I've done a lot of dmt with the more

140
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,050
potent,
shorter lasting form.

141
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,740
Obviously I've read accounts on it.
I've never done it.

142
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,700
I'm in recovery,
so allegedly things can be rearranged if

143
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,070
you're in recovery.
The problem with recovery is,

144
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,240
you know,
uh,

145
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,850
if you want to maintain complete and
total sobriety,

146
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,850
the only way to allegedly have that
experience,

147
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:09,950
and apparently it is possible is through
Kundalini and.

148
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,090
But according to people I know that have
done both,

149
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,970
they've done dmt and they've also done
Kundalini.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,260
It's virtually the same thing.
I'm like,

151
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,940
God can be reaching.
Yeah.

152
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:22,540
You just have to be completely dedicated
to the Kundalini practice.

153
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:26,140
You know,
you have to go to a very specific state

154
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,870
that's achievable once you have some
mastery.

155
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:32,710
Over the meditation and the Yoga
Principles,

156
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,620
I've done a fair bit of that.
Kundalini Yoga,

157
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,590
Bang into it.
In fact,

158
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:40,591
this toe on my forefinger here is an
illustration by Carl Young of the

159
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,710
Kundalini serpent.
The energy to come rises up.

160
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,220
Your animal energy can become the
coronated serp and bloodier getting that

161
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:49,930
toe down and I woke up in the middle of
the night,

162
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,240
severely regretting it.
Oh my thing go.

163
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,680
Why did I do that?
Mostly because Mark Mahoney,

164
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:59,800
the La tattooist that became sort of
somewhat besotted with him because he

165
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:03,330
would kind of like some sort of living
skeleton Elvis guy.

166
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,670
He mean so,
so sort of charming and enchanting.

167
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:09,480
I kept getting myself just silica him
out.

168
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,560
He appeared briefly in that film,
black mass,

169
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:13,430
that Johnny Depp Film.
I don't know if you saw it.

170
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,020
I didn't see the soldier.
That movie.

171
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:17,650
Yeah,
he's.

172
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,740
He has a cameo.
In the beginning of that you sort of got

173
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,830
blue ringtail was hey,
just sort of a fascinating guy and a

174
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,110
literal,
you know,

175
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,480
art is the proper tattoo artist.

176
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,210
People you know,
he's fast at these diode,

177
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,100
like gangster crime overlords
presidents.

178
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,860
Everybody's done sort of like a lot of
people,

179
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,230
but he's got a very easy way and it's
sort of a gentle kindness.

180
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,540
He told me this story once.
God,

181
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,840
I wonder if you'd mind me repeating this
in the media world when it used to be an

182
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:43,670
intravenous junkie.
He was in New York City and then you'd

183
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,230
like wandering along on the way to a
party and he saw a homeless fellow doing

184
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:49,060
paint,
Indonesia sort of for me and I'll get

185
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,700
those paintings and he bought these
paintings off this homeless guy and then

186
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,700
he went onto this part and then he went
and shot up in the bathroom and then he

187
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,100
heard a flurry of excitement at this

188
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,100
New York party because Andy Warhol,
Andy Warhol was arriving at the Party

189
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,710
and Warhol came upstairs and he said he
could hear like the acolytes around war,

190
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,020
how and he said he had.
He just banged up and he's getting a hit

191
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:10,470
and his eyes are rolling and he's
feeling fantastic and here's warhol

192
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,770
outside the room.
And Mark Mahoney had left some of his

193
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:17,100
paintings out there along with the works
of that homeless guy.

194
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:17,541
And he goes,
Whoa,

195
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:17,870
Whoa,
whoa.

196
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,350
Oh my God,
that's amazing.

197
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,400
Like looking at this stuff.
And he goes,

198
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:20,941
wow,
look at me.

199
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:22,620
I'm the coolest guy in the world is Mark
Mahoney.

200
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,020
I'm laying here banging up,
smack in a bathroom wall,

201
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,180
house out there,
dig in my work,

202
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,520
and of course when he went out it was
the homeless guy.

203
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,550
Stuff into.
Yeah,

204
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,160
he's a man with an anecdote or two.
I love that guy.

205
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,090
Your coffee's good,
mate.

206
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,450
I'm passing my tits.
Don't know what I'm saying.

207
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,580
So amazingly powerful for you.
This is it because I'm drug free for 13

208
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,540
years,
Joe and.

209
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
Oh,
so as I was saying Kundalini,

210
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,640
I've done a lot.
I couldn't and ever take you to a crazy

211
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,780
psychedelic state as I did when I was
using drugs.

212
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:57,090
I did psychedelics and it's.
I've never had that kind of like,

213
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,790
oh my God,
because I loved drugs.

214
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,540
But you never had a breakthrough moment
on psychedelics.

215
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,730
Yeah,
I had that realization.

216
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,090
What are considered to be myself was a
construction and it wasn't real,

217
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,650
but like my memories and my perception
and my desires are just a conglomeration

218
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:18,180
of biochemical impulses that Pew,
that I'm merely a conduit of pure

219
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,580
consciousness.
Then that's too heavy to deal with when

220
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,380
you're bloody 16.
All my mates were just doing it at

221
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,470
school and like,
you know,

222
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,570
carrying on like me,
I need to do psychedelics at the

223
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:31,170
hospital where a person monitoring my
heart going to be all right.

224
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,150
I can't do it under normal conditions.
So.

225
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:36,630
How old were you?
You weren't clean the 27.

226
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,260
So from 27 or nothing.
Just coughing.

227
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,390
I'm 41.
Yeah,

228
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,701
coffee.
Of course.

229
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,900
I was a sort of a,
you know,

230
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,090
pretty committed sex addict for a
decade.

231
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,280
You might want to dip your feet back in
the pond.

232
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,020
So you say this job,
this is

233
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,910
the problem is with me is I don't know
what your experience.

234
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,110
I know where your addictive tendencies
come out.

235
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,620
Well,
I have them for sure,

236
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,920
but uh,
where do they come out?

237
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,590
Um,
games or get addicted really badly to

238
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:07,900
games,
video games,

239
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,060
archery.
I'm addicted very badly to shooting bows

240
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,660
and arrows and he used to be cool.
Yeah.

241
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,743
Yeah.
Shoot.

242
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,631
Yeah,
I'm pretty good at it.

243
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,430
Robin Hood Style.
Well,

244
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:19,520
I don't use a recurve bow or use a
compound bow,

245
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,420
like a very complicated high powered
apparatus.

246
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,180
Shoots very accurately out to 70,
80,

247
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:27,850
90 yards,
but uh,

248
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:29,330
I practice it all the time.
Yeah,

249
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,500
it's fascinating.
It's a very.

250
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,850
It's a meditation.
Yeah.

251
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,890
Yeah.
Because there's something about when you

252
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,160
require so much concentration when
you're pulling a pullback and anchoring

253
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:41,150
and relaxing and centering the bow and
making sure everything's level and

254
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:44,270
relaxed and there's no excess movement
whatsoever.

255
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,910
As you release the Arrow.
It's all this very,

256
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:49,940
very difficult little dance of the
synapses that you're doing.

257
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,550
And in that dance,
there's no room for any extraneous

258
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,280
thought.
You think about your bills,

259
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,290
your bullshit,
your life death.

260
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,900
You don't think about anything but no
movement.

261
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,630
Release that Arrow.
Absolutely properly watched it sink into

262
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:04,210
the Bullseye and when you do it,
it's incredibly satisfying.

263
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,290
It must be made.
Is there some visualization involved in

264
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,380
that?
Yeah,

265
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,350
you definitely.
And a lot of people who will actually

266
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:15,520
get better from not even practicing.
They get better from visualizing.

267
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,500
More than practicing.
Yeah.

268
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,010
That they just,
they just go over the actual physical

269
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,430
mechanics of the shot,
visualize it locking in,

270
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,220
but it's a big thing with competitive
target archers,

271
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:31,270
the visualization aspect.
They go to hypnotists and they really

272
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:35,560
work on like a very specific pattern
that they visualize,

273
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,380
like a very specific pattern of drawing
the bow back,

274
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,340
finding your anchor point,
perfect release Arrow flying perfectly,

275
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,970
and in doing that they sort of
conditioned their mind and their body to

276
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,430
make that perfect shot over and over and
over again,

277
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,840
but it's so difficult to do that.

278
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,170
Even the best people fuck up the best
ones in the world and the Olympic

279
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,790
archery,
they'll occasionally,

280
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,130
you know,
get out of the line and get a nine or an

281
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:59,260
eight and they just,
they don't know why they'd been doing it

282
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,100
seven hours a day for fucking 20 years.
It doesn't matter.

283
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,700
It's so difficult that it net you.
There's no mastery.

284
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,440
You never totally master it.
There's variable.

285
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,840
You've got to be addicted.
If you go into a hypnotist and try to

286
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:13,900
hit bullseye,
man,

287
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,640
well imagine if that was your light in
it.

288
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,140
Imagine if that was how you made a
living,

289
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,290
how much you make,
and to be a narrative.

290
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,770
It's a good question.
I mean,

291
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,920
I know there's the Olympics,
right,

292
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,960
and so you can get sponsors from both
companies like [inaudible] and companies

293
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,090
that sell arrows and things along those
lines,

294
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:31,780
and it's.
It's a,

295
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,790
it's a practice that a lot of people
engage in,

296
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,700
so I would imagine it's probably more
money than you think there is.

297
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,990
Okay.
But yeah,

298
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,840
I just haven't seen it.
Even at the fairs are towards your

299
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,720
drawers for.
Here's the tricky thing is this doesn't.

300
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,310
It's not like,
like if you're.

301
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,450
If you're a professional boxer,
you have a very specific set of skills.

302
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,990
Right?
Right.

303
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,960
You know how to box floyd mayweather is
pretty.

304
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,030
God Damn sure he knows exactly what the
fuck he's doing,

305
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,100
but this isn't like boxing,
like anybody.

306
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,430
You can teach anybody to do this,
right?

307
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:05,050
It doesn't take any ridiculously
coordinated athletic movements,

308
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,830
some unusual genetic,
some fast twitch muscle fibers.

309
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,350
Now you just pull the bow back and you
release the Arrow.

310
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,220
So to make a living doing that,
to decide that I'm going to do something

311
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,810
that I could teach anybody to do in a
day.

312
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,450
I can take any regular person and work
on their footwork,

313
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,570
their stance rather and their
positioning and teach them how to shoot

314
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:22,900
an hour.

315
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,940
Yeah.
Breathing out of concentrate and relax.

316
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,940
You can get them shooting fairly
proficiently inside of four or five

317
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,910
hours.
Now imagine taking that to a level where

318
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,170
you're going to travel the world and
compete and just shoot at Bulls eyes for

319
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:38,560
your kids food.
That's what I'm saying.

320
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,200
It's a bunch of other people that are no
different than you.

321
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,430
There's.
I know a lot of those guys.

322
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,180
I know quite a few of those guys who
introduced me.

323
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,160
I will introduce you for sure.
Love to meet a professional guy that

324
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:48,820
I'll introduce you to.
The Guy who trained me,

325
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,170
John Dudley.
Next time he's in La and you're in La,

326
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,010
we'll make it happen.
He's a

327
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,140
good dude.
I want to learn about that madness.

328
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,910
Well,
Zealand motivation.

329
00:14:55,911 --> 00:15:00,911
Jimbo to unravel this man.
Oh no person who's devoted their life to

330
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:07,241
hitting the bullseye
that led him to this point of mastery.

331
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Don't make you feel insecure about the
hypnosis session.

332
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,690
Do you do yoga at all?
Ma'Am?

333
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,420
Do like regular yoga or Kundalini,
how often you do it?

334
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,700
I try and do yoga two or three,
like my exercise regimen change.

335
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:25,460
Not entirely unrelated to listening to
your podcast.

336
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,900
I like now do kickboxing once a week.
I do Jujitsu once a week and honestly

337
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,960
it's influenced me.
My Mate Nick got me into your podcast

338
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,160
and a lot of people that I hang out with
like,

339
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,090
you know,
sort of in there as you obviously know,

340
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,090
but even in the UK,
in the mixed martial art world,

341
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,040
this is a very central cultural artifact
and how it intersects with thinking

342
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,890
outside the box and a new vision of what
it is to be a man and living outside of

343
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:52,520
sort of state ideals and air
conditioning.

344
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,410
You know?
And that's very,

345
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,770
very,
I'm,

346
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,030
that's what I'm fascinated about is
these new,

347
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,050
like new ways of being a man like ha,
having tend to nurse awareness awakeness

348
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,850
but not being afraid or indeed ashamed
of the aspects of masculinity that have

349
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,870
somehow become cleverly maligned over
the last few generations.

350
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,700
So like may I say like a shout out to
the northwest and Paul busby because

351
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,210
they're the people side terminal people
that I do like.

352
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,380
That's a shout out to them.
I felt I was ridiculous there for

353
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,330
English and it was a hate crime.
You saw that.

354
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,660
I was giving them a shout out.
Oh right.

355
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,451
No,
that's actually.

356
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,890
That's another great one.
And there's no.

357
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,470
There's no doubt that the English accent
is the greatest accent.

358
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:38,260
That's why I use it for all noble
movies.

359
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,660
Any time there's a god or any sign
there,

360
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,450
you're speaking in a foreign language
that we've translated to English.

361
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,500
They have an English accent or anything.
Thrones,

362
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,010
gladiator,
everybody squats revolutions after all

363
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,370
of your economic success and Global
Dominion when it comes to an authority

364
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:59,380
figure used to come down from on the
heart,

365
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,370
you still can't have God.
God is actually still have a sort of

366
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:07,520
sense of realness,
game of thrones,

367
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,470
reverence for the regal,
but they're all.

368
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:12,260
They all speak some strange language
during some place with dragons.

369
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,570
It's all artificial,
right?

370
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,400
But yet they all speak with an English
accent.

371
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,870
No reason why they should not be from
Detroit.

372
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,850
Yeah.
Why?

373
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,760
Why don't they speak,
hey,

374
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,110
you fucking guys were coming over here
trying to fuck our broad

375
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,930
fucking balls and it's good.
Well,

376
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,990
it's fucking dragons in Shane.
Black in your dragons ask you to leave

377
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:35,570
the court because you've really loved
the tone some lot.

378
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,720
So it's like the opposite of going off
the course.

379
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:42,200
It's going so deep into the chorus that
everyone's wearing powdered wigs and

380
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:47,060
they're all aligning with some ancient
scrolls that they've pulled out of a jar

381
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:50,070
and a fucking cave and come somewhere
and it

382
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,800
has been decreed.
And you say everything's going to be

383
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:53,420
proper.

384
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,350
Yeah,
he's getting deep.

385
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,800
That's what I count on you guys for you
English properly and rely on us from now

386
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,200
the time in memorial because he sort of
burping during that stuff.

387
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,290
Yeah.
So that like I go do Jujitsu once a week

388
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,180
at a level that you know,
I mean I don't even know if it would

389
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:10,670
qualify for,
for the term Jujitsu at that level.

390
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:14,540
Up and practicing at the moment.
I've doing kickboxing where I had to go

391
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,080
to what is called a leisure center to
those words exist in nature center,

392
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,410
like a gym,
a community,

393
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:25,460
one to do my,
like white boy can see why MCA lined up

394
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:29,580
with like 10 year olds do in life to get
my white belt just to get on the ladder.

395
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,400
I do know,
I mean I've done that quite recently and

396
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,210
as well as that I do do yoga,
so I'm so I'm using this time.

397
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,180
I've stepped out of the madness of Los
Angeles.

398
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:40,630
The Madness of media that like,
you know,

399
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,530
the intensity of it,
you know,

400
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,550
during the time of what was like in
another thing that you talks about is

401
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:47,800
the shadow self.
All the.

402
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,760
I am not.
I also am.

403
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,790
If you think of that as I suppose a
simpler way of saying that is I've lived

404
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,000
this life that's been very focused on
comedy and the pursuit of individual

405
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,130
success.
Think what are all the things I've not

406
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,620
done as a result of that?
Like when I was a king and he's shy and

407
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:03,260
too ashamed to get into sort of like
sport type things,

408
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:05,390
you know,
and embarrassed and all that kind of

409
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,500
thing,
so you have to start to do kickboxing or

410
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,390
Jujitsu and even football or soccer as
you call it here,

411
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,310
you know,
like to do all of those things now to

412
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:15,710
start to learn about them as an adult
man,

413
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,820
it's a beautiful

414
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,740
thing when you take chances and do
things with other people that are take

415
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,310
chances and chances and doing new things
because you realize that it's really.

416
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:27,660
A lot of it is about the sort of
acceptance and the embracing of

417
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,910
vulnerability.
When you learn a new thing,

418
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,560
it's very important to learn new things

419
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,460
that it is that you.
Because I hear you say that and I know

420
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,640
what that means,
but the you actually could like I got so

421
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,210
much prejudice is about you as a sort of
a black belt.

422
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,100
Martial law is then as someone who is
embedded in the MMA mma world,

423
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,760
you are a person who is happy and
accepting of vulnerability.

424
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:54,761
Where in your life do you feel that you
are in embracing that vulnerability in

425
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,870
every.
Every time you try something new?

426
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,760
I enjoy.
I'm like in the archery thing,

427
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,760
I've only been doing it for four years,
but one of the things that I really

428
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:05,090
loved about is how fucking terrible I
was when I first started and it was like

429
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:06,710
there's,
there's something to this that I have to

430
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,360
figure out.
Yoga is a big one.

431
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,490
I've been really serious into yoga like
where I go several times a week at least

432
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:16,970
once a week for about a year and a
couple months,

433
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,800
a year and like two months or something
like that.

434
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,640
And one of the things that I really
enjoy about it is that I'm not very good

435
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,910
and I still get nervous before class.
Fuck man.

436
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,571
Yeah,
it's weird.

437
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:29,330
There's something.
It's one of those weird places,

438
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:34,250
like a yoga class is one of those weird
places where there's almost a sacredness

439
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:35,160
to it.
Like you,

440
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:38,030
you go in there and no one can leave
until the class is over.

441
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,950
Like they tell you,
they lock the front door and no one

442
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:42,440
comes in to visit the studio.
Everything's locked in.

443
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,290
No one watches.
You go in there and we don't talk.

444
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,010
No one talks.
You don't talk for 90 and you go through

445
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,820
this series of poses that are incredibly
difficult.

446
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,850
You're sweating like pounds and pounds
of water up.

447
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,740
I mean I'll,
I'll weigh myself before and after.

448
00:20:56,741 --> 00:21:01,741
I'll be down like four or five pounds
just from one class and it's very

449
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,310
difficult,
but it makes me nervous,

450
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,070
you know?
I do get nervous before I do it because

451
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,920
it has this.
I think it's difficult to do.

452
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,310
I think I don't necessarily physically
enjoy it while it's happening,

453
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,210
but I enjoy the effects after it's over.
But I think it definitely imparts a

454
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,560
feeling of vulnerability.

455
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,320
Hmm.
Because I always issue that if you are

456
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,950
really good at this is perhaps you know,
because of where I come from,

457
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,050
I always assumed that if you are date
good at some sort of fight in thing,

458
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,170
that that is a highly transferable skill
like that.

459
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,720
And I don't mean in a practical way,
if you're good at kickboxing,

460
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:37,190
you will also be good at yoga.
I just mean if you're good at

461
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,070
kickboxing,
you don't give a shit that you're not

462
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:44,071
good at yoga.
My assumption is if you're good at yoga,

463
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,510
the yoga side,
you're not meant to say you're good at

464
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:48,310
Yoga.
But giovan could it

465
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,450
sort of like when I'm in the MMA gym,
start guiding like,

466
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,630
well,
you may be strangling me now,

467
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,480
my man,
but wait till we get to down with dog.

468
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,530
No,
I sort of feel that.

469
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,950
All right.
Live humility into Jujitsu situation for

470
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,850
a beginner is an absolute humility.
He recognized,

471
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,000
you know,
because I'm dealing with people that are

472
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:10,960
good and like,
you know,

473
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,670
they have to do it like they're doing it
for a little kid,

474
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,301
you know,
like,

475
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,010
and I'm very aware that they're doing
that

476
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,080
well.
I think that if you get really good at

477
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,570
martial arts,
the only way to get really good is to be

478
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,580
completely objective about where you
are.

479
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,780
And if you're completely objective about
where you are and learning and trying to

480
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:30,320
improve upon your skills,
you apply that same feeling towards

481
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:32,720
everything else.
So the feeling that you get when you

482
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:35,390
totally vulnerable in martial arts,
you apply that same feeling when you're

483
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:37,790
learning yoga because that's the only
way to get really good at it.

484
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,340
The only way to really do it to 100
percent do it.

485
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:42,560
It's not to sit here and go,
this doesn't mean shit because I could

486
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,040
choke on it,

487
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,150
but in this going to help you,
it's not going to help you at all.

488
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,720
Matter of fact,

489
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,390
it'll hurt you,
it'll hurt you,

490
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:53,620
and it'll focus more on your own ego
instead of the ego dissolving.

491
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,420
Beneficial properties of the poses.

492
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,650
Oh,
drew and the ambience in the yoga

493
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,980
studio.
I would say that out loud doesn't mean

494
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,470
shit.
I could choke everyone in this room.

495
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,640
Well know I could fuck you up.
So settle down.

496
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,830
Don't get crazy about you're stretching.

497
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't know if you've read the
scriptures,

498
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,940
but there is no guidance.
Quite a little foreign.

499
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,530
And it's usually a metaphor.

500
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,010
That was the thing that Mckenna always
talk about that that's really what a lot

501
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:24,000
of the ancient yogis were about.
They were about smoking chillums of Hash

502
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:28,380
and then doing all these poses and if
you've ever done yoga while intoxicated

503
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:30,750
on edible,
the edible variety in particular

504
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:32,640
marijuana.
It's a beautiful thing.

505
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,860
I haven't because I only started yoga
because I'd stopped in a hash and all

506
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,710
other drugs.
You know like when the thing is with me

507
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:46,330
mate is when I was taking drugs,
that was what I was doing.

508
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,650
There wasn't room for.
Now I might pop to yoga.

509
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,820
You were fucking pro.
I was a full time dedicated pro 100

510
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:53,750
percent.
That's it.

511
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:54,584
Everyday,
you know,

512
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,900
can't do.
It was the amount.

513
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,620
What was the big drug was the problem.
I progressed through an escalation of

514
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,140
drug use.
That could be on any republican leaflet

515
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,790
case,
stone smoke pot or you will become a

516
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,980
heroin addict.
That's literally what I did.

517
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,840
Like I started with recreational drugs
was unable to properly.

518
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,390
The reason is this because it's not the
fault of the drugs themselves.

519
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,110
There's a component within me that he's
looking to find a solution that doesn't

520
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:24,350
happen.

521
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,500
You see when you have that perspective
on guy and in a place and being willing

522
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,840
to go in there and be vulnerable.
That kind of thing.

523
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:31,620
For me,
that makes me very sort of what are

524
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:32,540
called hot,
you know,

525
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:36,980
like scared like that or fuck fuck
tiffany drugs were always a thing that I

526
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:40,340
trusted to make me feel a little bit
better light and so when I was smoking

527
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:40,881
weed,
it's like,

528
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,890
all right,
there's that thing I've found that makes

529
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,160
me feel relaxed when coke and heroin and
crack.

530
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,910
It was the same reason.
It was an attempt to nullify,

531
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,060
medicate and contend with an innocent of
disconnectedness and discontentment,

532
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,880
which I think is a thing that comes up a
lot on your show in other guys because I

533
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,930
think that's in some way or another,
we're all looking for the sense of

534
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:04,460
connection,
the sense of completion.

535
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,770
I think in fact,
the thing that led me to be a drug

536
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,190
addict or a sex addict gambler,
wherever kind of addict you are,

537
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,940
I think the thing that's driving it is
this need for connection.

538
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,870
The sense that if this life,
because it don't fucking seem right to

539
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:22,871
me now this system like give me the real
deal.

540
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:25,520
What's the real thing you're not telling
me?

541
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:28,040
And that's why I'm fascinated by people.
Like terrence Mckenna says,

542
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,320
like if you.
You know what he dunks down the

543
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,400
pedestrian levels of consciousness.
There's this deep,

544
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,810
deep shit down there.
There's fascinating stuff.

545
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:38,540
There's machine elves,
there's corridors of kaleidoscopic

546
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,430
wonder to explore.
There's union,

547
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:41,080
there's God.

548
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,930
You know,
for garlic,

549
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,830
you maybe the best art.
That might be the best argument for

550
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:47,740
trying to do with the Kundalini way
because you have to earn it,

551
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,610
right?

552
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,620
I knew it'd be harder for me.
I've got,

553
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,830
I've got to do it by sort of stretching
and sort of aggressive breathing.

554
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,310
Instead of hitting that dmt shit

555
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,290
into my leathery old lungs.
Just take three.

556
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,190
You just take three and then you sit
back and tell me what you see at the

557
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,250
end.
In about 15 minutes.

558
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,000
You can't.
You can't,

559
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,060
can't be described beyond language to
describe it.

560
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:15,061
It's just my stubby fucking stupid ape
fingers trying to draw God with a crayon

561
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,560
on a patch of dirt.
It's not even a proper canvas problem of

562
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:23,440
all religions can.
It's just a question.

563
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,470
If you do see what you were actually
looking for,

564
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:30,380
what do you think is curious once you
there and you discover what,

565
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,910
what do you come back and aren't we just
backed all of this

566
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,980
even?
No,

567
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,400
you're right in waiting,
but because I have had moments in both

568
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,220
sobriety recovery,
Andy in active addiction where I've

569
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,380
gone,
Oh God,

570
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:46,290
I feel truly connected now.
I've had a lot of those moments in what

571
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,900
I would call unhealthy high.
It's like,

572
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:49,230
you know,
sort of sexual kind of,

573
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,640
Oh my God,
this is so amazing.

574
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:53,490
I want to live in this moment forever.
Or moments on drugs where I felt sort of

575
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:57,480
pure bliss,
but nowadays I tend to find it through

576
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,510
bloody altruism and kindness and
service.

577
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:02,940
Like sometimes when I think I'm being
truly useful,

578
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,790
I feel this sense of connection,
but you are right,

579
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:08,910
it is not sustainable.
There is no Viagra for enlightenment.

580
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:11,310
You can't sort of stay hard.
You know what I mean?

581
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:12,360
You sort of,
you feel like,

582
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,991
oh,
that's it.

583
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:14,780
I understand it right from this moment
for virome,

584
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,623
enlightened,
I'm.

585
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,160
That's it.
I'm never going to be anybody's bitch

586
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,840
again.
I'm never going to do anything straight

587
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,220
for the money.
I'm never going to care what other

588
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,020
people think about me ever again.
It's actually,

589
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:24,750
it's behind me,
but then someone will say something or

590
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:27,870
someone will do something enough back
here again,

591
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,650
I think it's very hard to capture the
divine.

592
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,270
You know?
I think you'd get like I've had in my

593
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:36,150
life moments of it.
I think when I do the yoga,

594
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:39,780
I practice yoga on my own practice,
yoga this morning and positions where

595
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:43,830
you go upside down and stuff and I think
you would if he was just determined to

596
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,930
describe things in a material and
secular way,

597
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:46,561
you'd say,
well,

598
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,940
you would just dizzy,
you know,

599
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:51,300
but what I feel is I go upside down and
when I come up straight again,

600
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,670
I feel my own individual consciousness.

601
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,830
My sense of myself.
I feel it sort of disappeared.

602
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:57,570
Like I can't remember who I am for a
moment.

603
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:01,110
It all goes away and then I feel this
secondary awareness in the back of my

604
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:03,960
mind.
Like I sort of a grid and awareness.

605
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,280
There's a nice sort of thing.
Hold on a minute,

606
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,410
I'm not me.
I'm not me.

607
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:11,970
There's something else inside of me and
the thing that in a might big sort of ax

608
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:12,960
to grind.
When I was doing that,

609
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,710
that Internet series the truth for a
while.

610
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:18,690
That got me into all sorts of
interesting scrapes and challenges over

611
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,100
the last sort of 18 months,
two years.

612
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:25,430
It was the idea of someone inside our
own consciousness is not free.

613
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,510
We are not free within our own
consciousness.

614
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:30,230
We have been conditioned to the point
that we don't know that we're

615
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,730
conditioned anymore and I think that
that sort of,

616
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,790
you know,
that's you.

617
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,040
You notice it in lightening rod moments
when there is sort of like an election

618
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,090
and you think,
oh my God,

619
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,180
people really in his fucking shit what
is going on my rage

620
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,323
cage.

621
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Perfect riff to at that moment.
Thank you very much this way.

622
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,330
Yeah.
Is that rage against the machine?

623
00:28:57,331 --> 00:29:00,770
Is that person smashing?
Smashing pumpkin.

624
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,390
I don't limit.
Can I ask you,

625
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,510
since [inaudible] you found your outlet.
You said you're putting you finding just

626
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,960
good.
Something good?

627
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,130
Yeah.
Have you.

628
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,610
I'm just a question since you've been
putting it out there and have you

629
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:18,060
noticed this more and more is coming
back or it's like,

630
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,730
Eh,
I'm noticing it more always was there.

631
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:23,910
I just chose go the way to know.
These are just questions.

632
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,970
Well my right eye.
It still like if you read any bloody,

633
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,960
when you read this stuff in religious
books like saying the Bible is going to

634
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,290
become good and get to the point where
even being good,

635
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,150
you're not even doing it for that reason
anymore.

636
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,870
You've become detached from outcomes.
You know the.

637
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,630
In Buddhist terms,
you know like that you're,

638
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,200
you're no longer about fear and desire.
You no longer trying to just fulfill

639
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:47,920
yourself.
Right?

640
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,440
I'm not bloody there yet.
You know me,

641
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,790
even if I do something good like go a
homeless shelter and help out for the

642
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,100
day and all that sort of thing,
a little bit of the back of my mind is

643
00:29:57,101 --> 00:30:00,130
going to helping out at this homeless
shelter

644
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,220
and if someone went by and saw me
helping at the homeless shelter,

645
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,600
been really pleased.
Why is no one seeing me helping these

646
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,443
fucking ownership.

647
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,840
So I'm still a little bit looking for
rewards now that that's very hard.

648
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,760
But this is the thing is as well about
being a comedian is you can't get to

649
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,640
fucking sincere and earnest.
Do you stop being bloody funny.

650
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,430
You know what I mean?
But then you find that that when you

651
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,900
stuff that you really passionate about
and you really believe in because

652
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:31,750
comedy,
I think he's constantly ripping down

653
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:32,050
the,
you know,

654
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,780
you sort of set up a premise and then
you rip it down again.

655
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,820
I think comedy is the energy of
constantly going.

656
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,780
None of this is really.
No,

657
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,520
this is all bullshit.
It's all fucking bullshit.

658
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,190
So when you're sincere,
you please hold on,

659
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,150
hold on.
Stop it.

660
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,110
No,
this is serious.

661
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:47,230
That's more kids will care about them.
Once you do that,

662
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,330
be able to differentiate between your
forms of expression,

663
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:53,090
like your art form,
like a piece that you're creating and

664
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:56,630
you yourself as a person.
And sometimes I used to think when I was

665
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:57,464
younger,
man,

666
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,500
I can't be fucking around with
meditation or enlightenment because it's

667
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:03,020
going to ruin me.
All my favorite comedians were junkies

668
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:08,021
and crazy people like in and prior and
Hicks and crazy people and junkies.

669
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,910
You can't get enlightened.
You gotta you gotta just gotTa fucking

670
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,500
be a wild man.
That's how you get comedy.

671
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,880
I'm not so convinced anymore.
And I think the creating of these memes

672
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,420
and,
and these,

673
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:23,990
these characters that you can mock and
make fun of inside your act is a piece

674
00:31:23,991 --> 00:31:26,390
of art.
You're doing something just like a

675
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:30,440
painting doesn't make you a madman.
You could paint a Frazetta,

676
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,040
Conan the barbarian painting.
It doesn't make you a mass murderer.

677
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,440
You know what I'm saying?
It's like you're creating a piece of art

678
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,160
and sometimes the more points of view
that you've considered,

679
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,590
the more it enhances that work of art.

680
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,340
You raise a good point in that because
in certain sectors of the art world that

681
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:52,341
has always been accepted that you know,
erroneous Bosch triptych of hell don't

682
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:53,310
mean,
oh man,

683
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,800
this guy's fucking crazy.
You know,

684
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,970
they may have been,
I don't know or you know,

685
00:31:56,971 --> 00:31:59,040
but like when in hip hop,
you know,

686
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,910
like people talk about,
you know,

687
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
popping caps and whatnot.
It's taken a lot more literally and it.

688
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,030
And as a comedic persona like that,
he's gonna comedians get a lot,

689
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,890
but it British comedian as well.
There's a few sort of like comedians,

690
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,010
myself,
a Scottish comedian called Frankie Boyle

691
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,070
like that when people are very shocking,
like you know,

692
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,190
like,
like you can,

693
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,650
I can tell sometimes that comics are
saying things to detonate territory's of

694
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,590
consciousness.
Fuck you knew because it might get

695
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:29,120
lucky.
Wakes you up.

696
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,940
Bill Hicks did that a lot.
I think he would say things.

697
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,780
You go whoa,
steady and then these smacked you in the

698
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:36,630
mouth and then he's like,
he gently tells you that it's just the

699
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:37,930
ride or wherever it is,
you know,

700
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:39,590
like now that you've got you where wants
you.

701
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,950
But people like I think we live in a
culture now that's very prohibitive

702
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,930
about where we go with those kind of
idea.

703
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:52,040
So people are very quick.
I've myself been on the receiving end of

704
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:57,030
a lot of like what I want to say
judgment and I'm not fucking joking but

705
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:57,770
don't.

706
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,730
That's also because we live in this new
media world of social interaction,

707
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:05,900
this new social media world where
anybody can chime in at any point in

708
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,880
time and it's the first time ever that
that's happened.

709
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,640
Yeah,
you might be right,

710
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:14,050
but a friend of mine in England made a
documentary about what has happened to

711
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:16,000
the idea of the great man,
you know,

712
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,500
like in American literature,
like,

713
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:20,170
you know,
Saul Bellow Philip Roth or like,

714
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:21,520
you know,
Mohammed Ali,

715
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,560
uh,
rest in peace like that.

716
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,430
Nowadays,
people don't rise to that position

717
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:32,380
anymore because there's thousands of
Lilliputians pulling them down as soon

718
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:35,020
as there is above the parapet and no
one's allowed to.

719
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,590
Yeah,
yeah.

720
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,401
People will be,
oh,

721
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:38,860
well Martin Luther King had affairs on
Malcolm x.

722
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:40,090
He was inside.
He done this,

723
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:40,600
that,
and the other.

724
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,080
You know,
like,

725
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,310
it's like the,
the.

726
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,070
Yeah,
I,

727
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,700
there were so many good things that have
come from social media.

728
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:46,810
So many good things,
you know,

729
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:49,270
the possibility of communication,
that connection and instantaneous,

730
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
all those things.
This is wonderful,

731
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:53,650
but it does all,
all things in the end become an

732
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:56,230
expression of the dominant
consciousness,

733
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:57,700
you know,
and if people are doubtful,

734
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:00,010
cynical,
president mystic in that,

735
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,890
the Palette that she ends up on the
canvas,

736
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,380
it also might be a case of,
you know,

737
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:08,950
everybody's always worried about wealth
inequality in this world.

738
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,560
There's also a possibility of
consciousness,

739
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:15,520
inequality and that these people that
have grown up with shitty parents and

740
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:20,080
shitty neighborhoods,
they feel left out by even your ability

741
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,900
to seek peace and altruism.
Like,

742
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:25,060
who are you this guy?
Why are you so lucky?

743
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,910
You're financially fortunate.
You have beautiful genes.

744
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:30,120
You're handsome,
you have a wonderful magazine,

745
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,160
fucking magazine shop.
I go get your face.

746
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,430
I mean I love you dude,
but come on,

747
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,780
Bang and started off this motherfucker.
And so why is he so happy?

748
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:40,780
Why is he allowed to have this happiness
come to him so easily?

749
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:43,900
So there's anger at that.
The same kind of anger that you would

750
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:47,170
get at the elite upper class,
like the billionaires in the one

751
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,470
percenters of the world.
People will also look at a person like

752
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,200
you and like there's a consciousness
inequality,

753
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:55,390
there's a,
there's also a starting point.

754
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,660
Inequality,
you know,

755
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,120
you know,
I'm sure you,

756
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:00,740
like you were saying you were insecure
when you're young and it was difficult

757
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:04,300
than I certainly was and Jim and I knew
each other when we're young and insecure

758
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,580
and starting out as comics.
We've been friends forever,

759
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,300
but that,
that sort of this,

760
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,870
this experience where you are,
you now and people look at that and

761
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:14,890
they're upset that,
well,

762
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:18,310
why is this guy have so much?
Why is this guy in this place where you

763
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:22,330
can so conveniently search for truth
where I have to pay my fucking bills,

764
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,540
student loans,
and I'm in a Shitty neighborhood and my

765
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,960
kids are sick and my wife account,
you know,

766
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,940
this is this.
And then they get on twitter and the

767
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:32,080
like,
fuck you,

768
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,820
you fucking cunt.
I hope your ponytail chokes you and your

769
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:37,970
right.

770
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,530
Well,
it never will because I'll put it into a

771
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:44,240
button.
I can actually understand that level of

772
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:46,100
discontentment because to be honest,
I,

773
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,950
you know,
I'm subject to jealousy and envy myself.

774
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:52,180
I spot it when it comes up,
when I sort of feel myself go,

775
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,540
oh,
why is that not me?

776
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,490
I should be having that.
But now I try to.

777
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,620
I try not to justify feeling shit.
Know as soon as I start feeling bad,

778
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,780
I don't think,
well this is why I feel bad and I'd like

779
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:05,950
to stay feeling bad if I try and go,
hold on a minute that I,

780
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,890
if I,
if you believe that you know,

781
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,030
the external world is an illusion that
it's temporary,

782
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:14,920
it's transient and real is your deep
connection to your inner self and you

783
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:17,990
can express that myriad ways and we're
here to after this experience as an

784
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:21,230
animal and I'm fascinated by the
numerous ways that you are into doing it

785
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:23,990
and it's something that I really want to
learn more about,

786
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,790
you know,
loads of the stuff that goes on on your

787
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,320
show,
but like,

788
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,550
yeah,
I can,

789
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,910
I can well appreciate people sort of
seeing a.

790
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,340
yeah.
Particularly as the way it's presented,

791
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,180
seen me on the like on television
thinking,

792
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,490
fuck that guy,
fuck that guy because they don't

793
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:40,700
automatically know where I came from or
what I had to do to get here,

794
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,370
or the fact that I get here and take.
Hold on a minute.

795
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:47,420
This isn't why full.
It will be almost as soon as I got those

796
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,141
things.
I was like,

797
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:50,260
this isn't real.
If you can't make yourself,

798
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,210
you know,
like the,

799
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,800
I don't want to be poor again.
I'll be straight about that because I

800
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,870
hate it.
It is pretty frightening,

801
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,040
but like it's.
You cannot resolve those inner issues.

802
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:04,160
I now know that empirically for a fact.
I'm really lucky and that's why I'm so

803
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:07,310
fascinated by the addiction model and
that's why I'm reluctant to smash my

804
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,020
mind's piece of DMT though.
It does sound fun.

805
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,750
I would really,
really love to do it on pier pussy.

806
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,390
I'll do it
for you.

807
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,440
Say I'm in
is because I know I've tried fame,

808
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:21,440
I've tried money,
I tried drugs,

809
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:23,840
I tried sex.
I tried all of those things to make

810
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:27,860
myself feel better and oddly none of
them have worked.

811
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,040
None of them have worked.
I'm not.

812
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:29,691
Oh,
poor me.

813
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:31,740
Poor me.
What is fucking refugee crisis?

814
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,370
You just about your experience.
Yeah.

815
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:38,240
Yeah,
and I would like what I am now thinking

816
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,350
Joe is what is the Mo they say that,
you know,

817
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,690
happiness is where,
what the world needs meets what you have

818
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,190
to offer,
where we can meet,

819
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,540
well needs,
meet what you have to offer,

820
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:50,330
and I think God is there a way that I
can communicate some of the things that

821
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:54,260
I have learned about connecting,
about letting go of my floors,

822
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,550
taking responsibility for the problems
that I am creating,

823
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,330
you know,
like is there anything about that that I

824
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:02,660
can convey kind of conveyed hopefully as
we were in a comedic and accessible way

825
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:06,230
and that sort of like where my focus is
beginning to fall now I'm assuming

826
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:09,640
that's what you're already doing.
I'm attempting.

827
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,040
I mean everybody.
I think everybody is trying to better

828
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,140
themselves as attempting some form of
that,

829
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,810
but it's also what you're dealing with
when you're talking about the criticism

830
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:18,910
of you.
They're trying to define you based on

831
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:23,230
one interview or one,
one article or one thing that you said

832
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:25,470
in response to one piece of current
events,

833
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:29,800
so it's real quote mining a lot of times
in a lot of ways.

834
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:33,090
Looking to have a more concentrated form
of that,

835
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,200
that jealous expression we were talking
about like fine,

836
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,110
like it's gotta be something about this
guy I don't like.

837
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,930
That's it.
I don't like how he went on Fox News and

838
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:42,820
mocked America.
Hey,

839
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,600
you mocking the journalism.
Yeah.

840
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,830
You think you're better than these
people that are here and telling the

841
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:48,320
truth.
Well,

842
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,310
I think the way that works for me is
that that is a thing that is called

843
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:52,510
confirmation bias,
isn't it?

844
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,600
You've already feeling something inside
yourself and then you'll sort of

845
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,590
unconsciously you're scanning data to
get confirmation of like.

846
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:04,480
So if I feel insecure because you're
super good at MMA and have black bolts

847
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:05,820
in Jujitsu,
I like,

848
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,670
instead of dealing with my own feeling
of fuck,

849
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,930
if this becomes a fire,
I'm not going to have to deal with it.

850
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,330
I would rather go,
wow,

851
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,460
this guy's like,
I'll find something to complete the had

852
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:20,290
advantages that I didn't have if I had
this I would've been like in.

853
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,780
But,
but really the feeling is in me,

854
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,750
and this is what might personal
experience of actually getting clean

855
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,810
from drugs has taught me,
is that,

856
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,560
you know,
what other people think about me is none

857
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:32,860
of my business and it's something that's
happening in their own consciousness and

858
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:36,310
they're always looking for some
coordinates upon which to project those

859
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:38,080
feelings.
And I know that because I fucking knew

860
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:40,210
it when I,
if I start getting jealous about,

861
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,640
you know,
super awesome,

862
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,710
super successful guy or someone who's
super good at fighting or whatever,

863
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,140
that's I'm dealing with something inside
myself.

864
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:50,350
So now I try not to bring that shit to
the world and trying to go.

865
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,981
Right?
Russell,

866
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:52,840
you bet.
Deal with this feeling of inadequacy or

867
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,510
this feeling of jealousy or this feeling
of insecurity because what was just

868
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,820
going to ruin your experience of being
human instead of going,

869
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:00,100
no,
the problem is this guy or that guy or

870
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:01,630
this person having a successful podcast.

871
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,840
I tried to go,
none of Russell connect with yourself,

872
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,570
you know,
I'm trying not to blame the outside

873
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,710
world for my shit and yeah,
these are really complicated thoughts

874
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:16,711
that we have and in many ways we're
almost a victim of this constant need to

875
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:21,880
evolve like the body and the brain is
set up to constantly be comparing

876
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,370
ourselves to others and to feed off of
each other,

877
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:27,880
whether it's through jealousy or
inspiration to try to achieve higher and

878
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:32,140
higher levels of competency at anything,
to develop more social credibility,

879
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,940
to develop more clout in the community,
to,

880
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,280
to feel better about your own existence.
It's almost like what we're dealing with

881
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:44,281
is some sort of a programming that is
constantly set up to innovate and to

882
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,300
continue to get better and better at
everything.

883
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:48,790
So yeah,
if I see you in some movie,

884
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:49,690
am I.
where Am I?

885
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,520
How come I'm not in these fucking
movies?

886
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,030
I don't even get these auditions.
I need a farmland manager.

887
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,110
These ideas,
they.

888
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,290
They motivate movement,
they motivate momentum and yes you could

889
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,870
use them or not using,
but we don't.

890
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,490
We don't know how to handle them and no
one's telling us in.

891
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:07,360
Our parents didn't tell us and their
parents didn't tell them shit.

892
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:13,370
Back to the slavery.
We're all just tribal and at the end of

893
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,960
the day,
what you supposed to do is help others.

894
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,110
There's no better feeling in the world
then encouraging another human to live

895
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:26,190
right and they live right.
Those are moments you remember live good

896
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,900
judge,
and your Dick Sucked and the lyrics

897
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,130
while you're pouring champagne on both
of you.

898
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,160
Oh No,
that is relaxing

899
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,593
background

900
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,570
check.
That's quicker.

901
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,680
If you can't get a learjet
debate,

902
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,560
I am going to take that out of your
mouth.

903
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,140
You,
you mean a good point because what

904
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:50,240
you're doing right there is how
biological imperatives,

905
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:55,130
wherever that force was,
that made us divide from one cell to two

906
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:57,620
cells to 10 sales,
to the frog,

907
00:41:57,621 --> 00:42:01,090
to Malmo,
to cities to woolies and wonders.

908
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,360
That falls,
as you say,

909
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,740
still in us now,
these,

910
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,480
these imperatives to grow,
that's the,

911
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,150
you know that as a you sign an agent,
but as if you're living in a tribal

912
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,920
society,
it's a necessary function,

913
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:12,340
but what's happened to our species?
Because you know that father,

914
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,340
that cliche you are what you eat.
You know what it means.

915
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,030
If you eat shit food,
you'll be shit and I hundred percent

916
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,930
agree with that,
but on a,

917
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,520
on a different,
in a different way.

918
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:20,180
You are what you eat.

919
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,300
If you look at what we eat now,
we mono cultural foods.

920
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:27,710
You know like we're in a suedes endless
fields of wheat across again.

921
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,870
Got It.
Drove what state would that have been?

922
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,780
Drove fruit,
like there's one of your crazy Iowa,

923
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,430
Nebraska,
Nebraska,

924
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,740
nothing,
but it was like the whole country was

925
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:38,390
made of it.
Just know what else is there.

926
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,800
Go on Jesus.
Oh,

927
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:42,090
I love that guy.
Now he's guilty,

928
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,770
but do you understand what he was
saying?

929
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,450
The May.
The main thing that I think he was

930
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:48,530
saying was,
don't be gay.

931
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,590
That's what I like,
so

932
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,130
just be cool.
He said

933
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,013
what?
He said,

934
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,440
yeah,
a lot of people have missed the point,

935
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:02,470
but this big cool thing,
it's done again.

936
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,480
It's focused down on not big guy,
and then of course the way that the meat

937
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,690
is consumed,
endless apa towards and slaughter houses

938
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:18,620
have condensed animals not consumed as
they would be tribally picked off here

939
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,570
and there even once a week.
I'm a vegetarian myself,

940
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:23,480
but you know,
so we have fields full of wheat.

941
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Abbotts was full of meat and we
ourselves are similarly what we eat.

942
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:32,420
We have become cells of energy trapped
in cities.

943
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,560
Not Free to be tribal beings anymore.
We've become so disconnected from what

944
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:41,240
it's supposed to be to be this primate
that now these biological imperative,

945
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,910
the desire to procreate,
the desire to have status,

946
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,460
that the,
the desire to even get high,

947
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,730
all these things have become permutate
it because they're no longer anchored in

948
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:51,530
the reality for which we were design.

949
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,010
I imagine your position where you are in
a completely unique position,

950
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,940
even in the Western world,
you become a media superstar.

951
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:03,180
You become a movie star.
He becomes someone when you show up,

952
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:06,370
people have cameras and you walk and
they take photos of you.

953
00:44:06,371 --> 00:44:08,130
You get out of a car and everyone
cheers.

954
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:13,131
It becomes this really unusual event
when you just arrived somewhere.

955
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:18,350
So it sets you up for an incredibly high
dose of this sort of toxic celebrity

956
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:23,130
feeling that you have to sort of
navigate and you have to navigate it

957
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:26,610
based on the other people that have
mostly unsuccessfully navigated it

958
00:44:26,611 --> 00:44:30,210
before you start and think about how
many fucking movie stars wind up in a

959
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:34,020
pool their own or you know,
covered in whatever the fuck they're

960
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:34,970
doing it.
I mean,

961
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,740
it's a,
it's a large number of famous people

962
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,460
wind up fucking it all up,
but they can't handle it anymore.

963
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,350
They go,
he's ledger or a million different ways,

964
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,380
you know,
pills are just fucking implosion or

965
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:49,200
whatever the fuck it is.
Would you like to feed my giraffe?

966
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,150
This is the podcast for you.
Start losing your mind

967
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,240
in the van.
For anyone that's listening to this

968
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:58,610
podcast,
just because I'm on it and I can't

969
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:01,320
imagine there's very many of you.
There's a reference there to a giraffe

970
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:02,470
that even I'm struggling.

971
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,600
It's.
I just think that your unique

972
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,990
perspective and it's a very unique
perspective because not a lot of people

973
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:14,400
get to become movie stars,
is it's something that the average

974
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:18,750
person,
they are trying to put it into

975
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,940
perspective where they can grasp the
amount of pressure and the weird way

976
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,670
that you have to interface with the
world where people worship you and

977
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,620
everywhere you go people love you and
you don't even know them.

978
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,970
That's a very strange thing.

979
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,400
This is the thing.
We have to think of problems.

980
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,640
I think in terms of their essence,
not of their scale,

981
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,310
you see like because if you like how I
stopped myself,

982
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:40,830
like,
you know,

983
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,970
when I was more immersed in Hollywood
and fame and stuff,

984
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:45,770
I like,
it isn't like you walk in a room and

985
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,230
like when I was single and a lots of
attention from women,

986
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,160
obviously that that's a short circuit
that because you do tend to fulfill that

987
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:52,630
one.
You said,

988
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,020
Oh my God,
I'm able to have sex with.

989
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,760
Awesome.
Let's dig sense.

990
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:57,000
All of a sudden they want,
you know,

991
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,970
how did that happen?
That was amazing.

992
00:45:58,971 --> 00:46:01,310
It was like,
it was hurting of the natural process.

993
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,500
Matrix is broken.
Oh my God.

994
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,650
I'm fucking.
Yeah,

995
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,900
I lost my wonder why you're an addict.
It's normal,

996
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,600
but every look it's called pussy is
awesome.

997
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,860
That is a difficult problem.
To overwhelmed.

998
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,900
It's impossible.
It's impossible to avoid the pool.

999
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,130
I mean,
you talking about the gravity of

1000
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:20,810
Jupiter,
it's sucks and asteroids.

1001
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,550
I mean,
that's what it is.

1002
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,760
It's just too goddamn strong.
The compulsion to breed and the

1003
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:29,420
compulsion to be special so that you can
breed more than anyone else and you can

1004
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:31,730
have the choice.
That's what your DNA calls,

1005
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,980
but can we overcome our nature?
You have,

1006
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,500
you have.
You have a

1007
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,310
podcast I've ever been in my life.
What you're doing,

1008
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:45,800
you've decided to step away from all the
bullshit,

1009
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:50,801
move away from Hollywood and sort of
take a break while you can financially

1010
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:54,620
and you can with your position in life
and just relax and get a look at this

1011
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,820
because it don't look at it from afar.

1012
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,330
Maybe the ego thing of like people
giving you those attention.

1013
00:46:58,331 --> 00:46:59,130
Why used to.
Oh,

1014
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,540
like quite quickly after.
Like I used to get a lot of fame

1015
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:03,880
attention.
I would think if someone else more

1016
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:06,790
famous than me came in,
then all these attention would go there.

1017
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,730
So what is it really well is it really
is not it.

1018
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,470
I can't feed on that and even if I don't
have that,

1019
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,810
even if I don't literally have the
experience of being of basking in a

1020
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:19,870
spotlight and then Justin timberlake
walking in and seeing the light

1021
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:23,110
disappear from my face and being
punished once again into the shadows of

1022
00:47:23,111 --> 00:47:25,540
my youth.
Even if I don't have to actually have

1023
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,060
that experience,
I know that when I get home,

1024
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:31,780
I'm still just that none of it is real
that you can't.

1025
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,550
There's no nutrition in it.
There's nothing we ended.

1026
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,530
You can't get any.

1027
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,363
It's not like,
oh,

1028
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,740
this,
this amount of fame hasn't worked.

1029
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:42,820
I'll try and get even more famous is
because the essence is the thing.

1030
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:47,650
The essence is the thing is to try to
connect what I am doing or what you are

1031
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:52,480
doing or what one is doing to something
that is connected that feels beautiful

1032
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,550
to you,
that fills nutritional to you and that.

1033
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:58,450
For me that is really,
really odd because it's very hard to

1034
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:01,270
enjoy those pat on the back things.
Particularly if you know,

1035
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:03,340
like if you felt inadequate and insecure
in Adelaide,

1036
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,320
it's very hard to break off of that
track course and I'll feel lucky,

1037
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:09,820
but it's not something that it's not
over for me.

1038
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:12,400
If feel.
I feel lucky to be awakening from that

1039
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:14,230
thing.
I feel lucky to be awakening for her,

1040
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:16,510
but it's not over for me.
I still feel it.

1041
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,740
You know?
I still feel if someone,

1042
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,230
if another English committee,
if Ricky Gervais' came in,

1043
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,220
now I'd have to go.
Right.

1044
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:21,680
Okay.
Ricky,

1045
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,760
JCC,
Sacha Baron Cohen.

1046
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,230
Right now this is happening now.
I'm aware that in this moment I have a

1047
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,630
cache of being the only English person
in the West was,

1048
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:32,630
but it's not.
You know,

1049
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,900
if those are the things I'm using a prop
up my identity,

1050
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:35,560
I'm fucked.

1051
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,290
But you being aware of those facts,
aware of the fact that you're constantly

1052
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,420
struggling in this is what's going to
help you.

1053
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,190
I mean,
it's not like you can avoid the,

1054
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,530
the sound of the.
What are the harpies one of those things

1055
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:52,400
and pull the sirens that call the boats
into the rocks.

1056
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,590
Like it's,
it's,

1057
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,180
it's compelling.
It's absolutely compelling,

1058
00:48:56,181 --> 00:48:59,000
but you understand what it is now so you
don't have to do it.

1059
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,370
You don't have to gravitate towards it.
Like you know you can.

1060
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:05,300
You know that if you just went and got a
bunch of hookers and some coke and hold

1061
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:07,480
yourself up in a hotel room,
there'd be some moments.

1062
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:09,920
It'd be pretty God damn good about that,
but they're also,

1063
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:14,240
there'd be the repercussions,
the fact that you've slid back towards

1064
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:15,380
addiction,
the problem,

1065
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,590
so you avoid it.
You know the pool is always going to be

1066
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,690
there,
especially when the girls have big tits

1067
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:24,740
and little waist bigger ashes and put a
secret.

1068
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,013
Yes.
Yes.

1069
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,970
It's a very difficult.
That's why.

1070
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:31,390
That's why I live in the abstinence
model that's.

1071
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,820
I tried to press those buttons because
that's stuff is,

1072
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,040
you know,
you can't miss route the cage.

1073
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,740
Don't wake that guy up.
Leave him alone like hulk in it.

1074
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:40,560
Don't make me angry.
Learned Lot and whenever I agree,

1075
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,240
just let me be a little hole.

1076
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,720
Yeah,
just let me chill.

1077
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,980
Yeah,
I mean look,

1078
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:49,750
as we've gone over your navigating some
waters that very few people get to go

1079
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:51,160
through and there's no books written
about it.

1080
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:55,270
No one has gone through what you've done
and achieved some sort of a yogic state

1081
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:58,690
of enlightenment where they've sort of
expressed it to everybody else and said,

1082
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:00,070
this is,
this is the roadmap.

1083
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:00,940
This is the path

1084
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,720
I have to.
I have to just say,

1085
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,750
just knowing some addicts to me,
what you're doing is more powerful than

1086
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:10,970
when you were the ultimate ultimate
star.

1087
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,850
Because I'm telling this guy sometimes.
I mean,

1088
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:17,090
we all feel that way.
I'll get really far for a little bit.

1089
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:17,780
I'll go,
you know,

1090
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,230
I can't believe that guy.
I'm trying to do this,

1091
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,820
and that guy,
he's,

1092
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,400
I think he's 15 years now and he'll turn
to me.

1093
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,210
Go,
Jim,

1094
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,430
I've been to your house,
have so much more.

1095
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,700
You have so much more in your life.
You don't want.

1096
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,080
Trust me.
You don't want that.

1097
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,660
It's a struggle,
but when he says that,

1098
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:40,661
those statements are so powerful to make
as he can see that that vanity and

1099
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:44,560
wanting to be.
That's why I said the draft,

1100
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,520
because that defines my success.
You know,

1101
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,440
success with I board the draft shipped
here.

1102
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:53,250
I'm faithful.
That shit is worse than heroin.

1103
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,140
It's worse than her.
I can't imagine his ladder was.

1104
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:02,880
Is it was.
Was still is up here in a similar way

1105
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,810
here.
That's a lot to live.

1106
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,860
I don't know.
I tip my hat to you,

1107
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,370
but you would go through a tornado,
but he's done it.

1108
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,680
You've done in a similar way as well in
some his love,

1109
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,880
his level,
but Jim was on Saturday night live is

1110
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:18,500
one of the best comedians in the
country,

1111
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,840
is one of the best standup comics in the
world.

1112
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:24,170
Really fucking crushes.
He's so God damn funny,

1113
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,260
but he decided we'd been friends
forever.

1114
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,850
He decided a long time ago,
you know what?

1115
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,260
Fuck this.
I'm going to live in New Jersey.

1116
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,540
I'm going to do gigs and I'm not going
to worry about nothing.

1117
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:36,110
I'm just going to have a good time and
perform and not worry about fame at all.

1118
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,680
I'm just going to step the fuck away and
just work on my act.

1119
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:42,020
Work on performing,
having a good time of trying to enjoy my

1120
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:46,040
life and that's a very admirable thing
to what you've done is a very admirable

1121
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:48,890
thing and a lot of ways I can.
But when you first walked in here,

1122
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:50,480
you just kind of mentioned that and you
said,

1123
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:51,470
um,
suburbanized.

1124
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:56,490
I'm suburbanized you said that a couple
times and indicated domestic kid.

1125
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:58,310
I'm sorry.
You said domesticated.

1126
00:51:58,311 --> 00:51:59,660
Don't have suburbs in England.
No,

1127
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:03,170
you have the country and not that
domesticated pit fall.

1128
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,460
To me it's more,
it's more you get more a gratitude out

1129
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,610
of it and the end of your days,
those are the moment you can remember

1130
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:15,070
those little moments whether it was
your,

1131
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,780
your friend or whatever.
There's nothing wrong with that world

1132
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,430
and you can always come back one
possibility.

1133
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,830
That's the problem though.
I warned my wife.

1134
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,820
Tell like,
listen,

1135
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,730
kids got a couple of years kids around
in there and I tell them,

1136
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,760
don't get fuck pregnant man up 20 years
from going ape shit and I will have that

1137
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:36,350
right to go ape shit.
I watched my father,

1138
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:40,790
World War Two vet go into 18 years old
and I watched them go,

1139
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,520
I'm just going to go ape shit.
I don't give a shit about anything

1140
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:44,960
anymore.
Um,

1141
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,620
so what you're doing is to me that's I'm
cheering,

1142
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,400
cheering,
cheer you on.

1143
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,170
Big Time.
And I know this is Corny,

1144
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:54,110
but I saw you on a couple of interviews
soon as you were.

1145
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,560
I mean you were,
you were all over the place and I could

1146
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:00,420
see.
I can see you in that room trying to

1147
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:04,370
find who you were while everyone else
was trying to throw out a completely

1148
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:05,640
different character.
I,

1149
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,870
maybe I'm crazy and I'm going right now,
but I,

1150
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,290
I would see that.
I'm like,

1151
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,710
oh,
well you had the awareness to say this

1152
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:15,470
is all weird.
It feel weird.

1153
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,690
It's the weirdest way.
Haired.

1154
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,140
How could it not be weird?
You're a movie star.

1155
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:22,220
It's creepy.
He's in a very unusual experience

1156
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:25,860
because it's like you were saying about
going back to and sort of saying that,

1157
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:26,040
right?

1158
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,700
What I'm going to do is my job,
I'm going to do comedy and I do the

1159
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:31,560
comedy to get the money to pay for the
food,

1160
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:34,350
to feed my family,
to take care of my life and I love doing

1161
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:37,350
it and I can bring joy to people.
They're like,

1162
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:37,980
I,
I,

1163
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,610
if I'm honest about myself,
I always had the ingredients for

1164
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,300
obsessive behavior.
I was because like the more I look at

1165
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:47,800
it,
I was trying to resolve something.

1166
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:50,880
I've thought if I get there,
then I'll be worth something.

1167
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,730
I can get that thing and they know when
I got there thought,

1168
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,030
hold on,
this isn't eight reeve and real.

1169
00:53:57,031 --> 00:54:00,470
It doesn't feel right to me.
It doesn't feel right and that's not

1170
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:00,750
like,
you know,

1171
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,940
there are people sort of I think very
high profile,

1172
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:05,890
high level people that are making big
contributions.

1173
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,390
Can you sweep away all of mainstream
culture?

1174
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:13,040
Can you say the sole function of pop
culture is to keep people but wilderness

1175
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,640
and distracted and intoxicated.
While the political elite in conjunction

1176
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,820
with the corporate powers can saps the
energy of the great and powerful people

1177
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:25,200
of this planet?
Yes.

1178
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:28,470
You can,
but like I do think that that's a

1179
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:32,220
conscious decision by the cultural elite
or is that a conscious decision by the

1180
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:36,760
people to avoid reality itself and be
distracted by Goofy television?

1181
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:42,060
It must've been.
It must be sort of both components must

1182
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:44,610
be both,
but like you said,

1183
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,210
implied or said even earlier,
we are still evolving.

1184
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:53,190
Evolution is still happening.
It's not over easy and like so what I

1185
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:58,310
feel like it's what I feel like is at
what information can we impart,

1186
00:54:58,471 --> 00:54:59,304
how can we,
you know,

1187
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,430
this is extremely successful as I said
before,

1188
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,000
cultural artifact.
You can just keep pumping alternative

1189
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,230
ideas in people's head.

1190
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,240
If people start to hear it again and
again,

1191
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,140
you're being lied to about civilization.
It's been brought to older.

1192
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,770
You're being lied to about the nature of
consciousness.

1193
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:15,150
You're being lied to about your options.
You know,

1194
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:17,060
like on a very simple level.
I've had got,

1195
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,810
as you,
I'm sure I've gathered quite a lot of

1196
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,860
therapy over the course of my life and
as a result of their substance misuse,

1197
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,020
addictions,
and then just out of ongoing bloody

1198
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,230
curiosity.
And I say,

1199
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:30,630
the function of therapy is to increase
your choices in life because none of us

1200
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,330
lives in reality.
Anyone who's bloodied and the empty,

1201
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,760
we'll know we don't live in reality.
We live in a narrow,

1202
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,900
tiny bandwidth of reality.
So if you just live in a model of

1203
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:41,250
reality,
not reality itself,

1204
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:44,160
then you should take responsibility for
remodeling your reality,

1205
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:45,660
particularly the not bloody api in it.

1206
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,120
You can change it,
you can change your consciousness.

1207
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,160
And for me at the moment that means
quite mundane things.

1208
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:52,890
It means that when I arrive here and my
suitcases don't arrive,

1209
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,760
I'll have the choices of do I now become
account and make people's lives fucking

1210
00:55:56,761 --> 00:55:59,070
miserable?
Or do I just accept the cases are not

1211
00:55:59,071 --> 00:55:59,790
here.
This is,

1212
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,490
this is the reality.
Or when I arrive at the airport and I

1213
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:05,550
ain't got my green card,
but I really miss the flight like all,

1214
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,620
all of these,
I just thought,

1215
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,820
oh,
this is happening right now.

1216
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:11,490
The only choice I have in that moment is
the choice of whether or not to stop

1217
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:12,750
being a dick.
And,

1218
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,900
and I tried not to now and in the past I
was like,

1219
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,460
fuck you,
I'm excited.

1220
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,640
It is fairly well.
It's so easy to just get absorbed in it.

1221
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,090
My friend Tony Visa,
this once.

1222
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,160
I know I've repeated this on the podcast
before,

1223
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,880
but my friend Tony v C drive from,
you know Tony Vee,

1224
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,140
stand up comedian.
I don't think.

1225
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,640
Boston guy,
hilarious guy.

1226
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,490
He used to drive from New York to Boston
all the time,

1227
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,740
like almost every day.
He was constantly driving.

1228
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:38,590
It's a pain in the ass like two and a
half hours of two and a half hours back,

1229
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:40,180
whatever it is.
New York to Boston.

1230
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:41,670
And what does it thrive?
No,

1231
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,330
that's a good foreign like a pussy,
Schatz.

1232
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,870
Michael,
you had a lot of PBA cars are saying

1233
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,260
it's not that far for fucking hours.
What are you talking about?

1234
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,230
I would say three at the most.
Anyway,

1235
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,240
he drove,
he drove it all the time and,

1236
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:02,080
and he was talking about what he did was
he just went and zen and he said,

1237
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,420
this is what I'm doing now.
The way he dealt with it.

1238
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,340
He's like,
now I'm driving like there's no,

1239
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,320
there's no upset is known.
This is what I'm doing,

1240
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:11,380
I'm doing this and if the cars are all
stopped and we're all going five miles

1241
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:12,400
an hour,
this is what we're doing.

1242
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,440
Yes,
that's perfect.

1243
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:17,370
That is literally then isn't it?
That this is not to resist your reality

1244
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,280
and I don't think that means becoming
some doormat that people can walk all

1245
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:22,170
over,
but when you are in a traffic jam is the

1246
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:25,170
perfect example of a situation over
which you have no control in this

1247
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:27,630
moment.
You get an angry cannot influence or

1248
00:57:27,631 --> 00:57:30,600
determine that situation in any way and
then I think that if you can,

1249
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:34,140
once you've realized it on a mundane
level of traffic jam our far,

1250
00:57:34,141 --> 00:57:36,270
can you extrapolate that?
You know when someone goes,

1251
00:57:36,271 --> 00:57:37,980
I'm in love with someone else,
I'm leaving you.

1252
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,023
Oh,
okay.

1253
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,690
How long have you speak to that tolle?
Do you know that guy got tall,

1254
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:46,691
we wrote know he speaks like this.
Here's a German person Auntie so

1255
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:52,041
relaxed.
He can barely talk to some mistakes,

1256
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,800
some glitch in the matrix.
I managed to get his phone number right.

1257
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,753
Oh Geez.

1258
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,600
I have to ask you to stop calling me.
I'm changing my

1259
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,890
now,
but it was meant to be for one

1260
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:11,701
interview,
but then I thought,

1261
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:13,340
fuck me,
I've got access to this Buddhist guy.

1262
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,000
I'm going to tap.
It pisses me off.

1263
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:19,270
I call it go,
what do I know?

1264
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,290
You're lucky.
I've started to lot,

1265
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:27,030
but beyond
that there's nothing that can be done

1266
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:28,170
for you.
It was really.

1267
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,280
It was fascinating.
Told you because I was like,

1268
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:33,360
I was having a hard time with a woman
that was seen and am I going to do and

1269
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:34,530
she's done listening.
She's done that and he goes,

1270
00:58:34,531 --> 00:58:37,560
world,
perhaps you would resolve this conflict

1271
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:41,730
and you will become married and you will
have children and then both of you will

1272
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:43,470
die.
She was just like,

1273
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,140
you're just like.
Because he knows that actually you are.

1274
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,260
You're gonna die.
That's the end point really.

1275
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,500
So like an hour over wherever you invest
your energy,

1276
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:55,860
be fully well aware that at some point
is going to be really good.

1277
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,490
Yeah,
it might work out or death,

1278
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,020
but definitely death.
Death.

1279
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,670
How many hours does it take to get to
Boston?

1280
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,490
A up three hours,
40 minutes or so.

1281
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,320
So we're in the middle.
We're in the middle.

1282
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,300
It depends where you lead from the
middle and if you don't drive like my

1283
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:14,720
mother and father would make me aware
that we're going to be dead.

1284
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,210
How'd you man?
And my mom.

1285
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,160
My mom would always say,
I'm going to be dead one day,

1286
00:59:19,161 --> 00:59:20,150
so you need to this,
this,

1287
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:20,984
this and that.
And it would,

1288
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:22,603
it would.

1289
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,660
I couldn't handle that.
She made,

1290
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,750
I want to say I was still alive

1291
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,070
five to seven,
you know,

1292
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,780
five years old.
She introduced Jim to the concept of

1293
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:33,280
mortality,
five to seven.

1294
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,500
I was still struggling with a goldfish
concept that goldfish gone,

1295
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,393
oh,
don't worry.

1296
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,750
Isn't that a good idea?
To start those thoughts off?

1297
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,700
Really,
let's accept this and get over these

1298
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:45,230
goddamn things.
Let's figure out what the fuck.

1299
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:48,500
We're so terrified above that we have to
create a land in the clouds that were

1300
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,960
definitely all going to go to a meet up
after the fucking show,

1301
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:51,943
but that,
that,

1302
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,020
that put me in check of the whole thing,
get it.

1303
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:54,960
I got to say,
and it,

1304
00:59:54,961 --> 00:59:56,300
it,
it made me sob.

1305
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,480
Just the thought of where we going,
where are we going?

1306
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,990
What happens is just are we just,
is it just blackness like gluten and my

1307
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:06,410
and my father towards the end,
he just.

1308
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:07,740
Lily went,
yeah.

1309
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,970
He said your dad and that's.
I said,

1310
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:13,790
show goes on and it's simple as that.
Evelyn.

1311
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,410
Oh my God,
I forgot about that past

1312
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:17,650
blake.
I'm not down with that one.

1313
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,330
I mean like listen,
the cloud kingdom.

1314
01:00:19,331 --> 01:00:20,510
But the thing is Joe,
you know,

1315
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,350
before we moved to Oakland about your
dmt experiences in new said,

1316
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:26,340
it will be like a sort of a cave man
with a cran trying to draw,

1317
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,030
draw God right now,
even on campus or maybe very

1318
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,810
specifically said it.
You can rewind the podcast.

1319
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:33,350
You can listen to it again.
That's what Joe said,

1320
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,390
right?
I think you said your fingers were

1321
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:39,090
stubby.
I don't want to be in that particular.

1322
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,430
Right,
so like it when people talk about,

1323
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,790
you know,
when like,

1324
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,500
like you know,
the Kingdom of Heaven is within or you

1325
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:48,880
know,
in the afterlife there'll be 72 virgins.

1326
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,290
Me Personally,
I see these things,

1327
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:53,590
his metaphors.
It will be as if you will be in such a

1328
01:00:53,591 --> 01:00:57,100
blissful state when you are free of the
shackles of the material realm when you

1329
01:00:57,101 --> 01:00:58,600
are liberated from your body.

1330
01:00:59,020 --> 01:00:59,750
I spent,
oh,

1331
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,340
how's this is this isn't nothing sort of
makes me look good and maybe it makes me

1332
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:05,590
look sandwich.
I was doing one of my base of altruism.

1333
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:06,401
Never Day,
you know,

1334
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:08,050
like our doll out.
Bits of altruism.

1335
01:01:08,051 --> 01:01:10,690
I told you I already mentioned going to
a homeless place today if you're picking

1336
01:01:10,691 --> 01:01:11,830
it up.
I'm a pretty nice guy.

1337
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,300
I was at this other place that was a
like a adult learning difficulties

1338
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:17,134
place.
Right?

1339
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,690
And for me the term learning
difficulties was polite because these

1340
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:23,730
people were like,
you know,

1341
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,540
fucking seriously mentally ill.
I mean,

1342
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,560
I'm like,
you know what I mean?

1343
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:29,620
That was beautiful human beings and
everything,

1344
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:30,380
but like,
well anyway,

1345
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,690
there was not.
I had a really fantastic time there and

1346
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:34,990
of course it made me feel incredibly
grateful for my own life and all the

1347
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:37,660
things one would imagine that you'd feel
in such a situation most and now

1348
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,240
chatting to the people and one person
was like,

1349
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,820
people get very certificates for various
kinds of achievements,

1350
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:46,210
whether it was in the art art doing some
joins or whether it was doing some

1351
01:01:46,211 --> 01:01:47,044
cooking or whatever.

1352
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:51,730
And like I started to feel the impulse
of sort of a bit of patronizing this of

1353
01:01:51,731 --> 01:01:52,241
like,
oh,

1354
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,560
okay,
and that certificate.

1355
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:54,790
Oh yeah.
And then I for a minute,

1356
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,640
this ain't no fucking different from
someone who's doing a full year.

1357
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:00,550
I in religion,
in global politics really.

1358
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,230
I mean,
if you can imagine supreme

1359
01:02:02,231 --> 01:02:04,170
consciousness,
if you could imagine the realms

1360
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,120
experienced on dmt or the realms that
have been described with people that

1361
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:09,790
have dedicated themselves to meditation
or Kundalini of Datasat,

1362
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,780
cade themselves.
But you know,

1363
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,660
Terence Mckenna get into them,
super states of consciousness accessible

1364
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,410
to individuals and our birth right.
Some people say that our little

1365
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:19,560
achievements have I got myself a
Giraffe,

1366
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,230
for example,
a new car or the things that I'm proud

1367
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:25,620
of today.
We similarly over on this little

1368
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:29,400
pedestrian level in a lot with sweet
little darling things.

1369
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:34,380
Really with our material achievements,
with our accolades and awards and it,

1370
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,050
it changed my perspective of it,
of like bloody hell.

1371
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:39,280
The difference between me and someone
that's not in the.

1372
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:43,530
What would you consider being the normal
Straw of the mental health field?

1373
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,050
It's no real.
It's not that bloody different.

1374
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,110
Not In infinite space.
Not with Jupiter sucking in meet yours.

1375
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,550
Oh,
that shit going on right now.

1376
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,400
What's the difference between me and
someone that's,

1377
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:55,260
you know,
life is confined to sort of cooking

1378
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:58,110
projects.
It's not hugely significant except I'm

1379
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:01,170
not that good at cooking in a way there,
but I never got asked.

1380
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,790
Well,
it might not be hugely significant in

1381
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,470
your perspective when you look at the
infinite,

1382
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,920
but it's very significant in terms of
the two of you are relating to each

1383
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:13,450
other and trying to work this life out
and trying to be sort of a compatible

1384
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:15,760
try to communicate,
try to be friendly with each other and

1385
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:19,840
work out all the weird cultural
differences between everybody and try to

1386
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:22,900
get to the essence of what it means to
be a person and we're all going through

1387
01:03:22,901 --> 01:03:24,940
some weird sort of struggle.
No one escapes the struggle.

1388
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,790
Not even Johnny Depp.
Not even Johnny Depp.

1389
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:30,980
Even jade time,
believe in Johnny.

1390
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:36,100
Johnny Depp got dragged into the Golden
Triangle of pussy problems and he's in

1391
01:03:36,101 --> 01:03:37,720
there right now.
Oh really?

1392
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,620
Oh yeah.
You didn't care.

1393
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:41,500
He did the rock star.
Did this happen during the rock store?

1394
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,750
Didn't you hear this recently?
He's getting.

1395
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:47,590
His girlfriend said he beat her and he's
saying he's saying his girlfriend,

1396
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,470
his fucking Doug standups getting sued
because he wrote a whole article saying

1397
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:53,230
that he's really good friends with
Johnny Depp and Doug Stanhope wrote an

1398
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:57,400
article about how the woman is a been
blackmailing johnny and threatening him

1399
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:59,260
and he brought it up before the.

1400
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:02,860
The whole thing came out in the news
that she had certain demands.

1401
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:05,620
If you didn't reach UNOS,
who's fucking right and who's wrong?

1402
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,630
Correct.
But at the end of the day,

1403
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,490
you know,
whether Johnny telling them the truth or

1404
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:10,630
not,
but at the end of the day,

1405
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:14,020
even Johnny Depp can escape to fucking
pussy problems.

1406
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,210
The reality of the world,
you know,

1407
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:18,200
he's boring.
I said he's,

1408
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:21,130
I think for the first time in life he
said he would,

1409
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,680
you would see him with images of
rockstars and he loved.

1410
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,990
But now he's touring.
So he's doing what?

1411
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,390
Cooper and a.
But yes,

1412
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:31,720
he went on a rock tour.
It's like I'm telling you,

1413
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:34,420
it's cooper selling hot dogs in Arizona.
Not Dude,

1414
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,160
I'm telling you,
look it up there.

1415
01:04:36,161 --> 01:04:37,570
But they were like,
cause I get a name.

1416
01:04:37,571 --> 01:04:39,610
They stood a rock tour and I went,
Huh?

1417
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:42,610
Johnny Depp it.
And they did a lot of cities and maybe

1418
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:43,240
he's.

1419
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,430
Wow.
That's the one thing he didn't get out

1420
01:04:45,431 --> 01:04:48,010
of a system.
I don't even think that's it,

1421
01:04:48,011 --> 01:04:50,080
man.
I just think Johnny Depp is just being

1422
01:04:50,081 --> 01:04:52,150
Johnny Depp 70.
Good God damn time.

1423
01:04:52,151 --> 01:04:54,040
But like this all the time.
What's it called?

1424
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,340
The Hollywood vampires.
Vampires.

1425
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,770
Johnny Depp is the guitarist.
Wow.

1426
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:03,400
That's pretty bad ass.
That's Johnny Depp over there on the far

1427
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:06,340
right.
With a goofy hat or is it a if I left

1428
01:05:06,341 --> 01:05:07,180
with a goofy hat?
Yeah.

1429
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,620
Wow.
Good for him.

1430
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:10,930
Johnny Depp's live in a goddamn
exemplary life.

1431
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:13,480
And I think that's Joe Perry on the
right.

1432
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:17,230
That is Alice motherfucking cooper.
Look at that at all.

1433
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,980
He's been selling hot dogs and fucking
Arizona has some cooper dog or alice has

1434
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:31,000
dogs place.
He was a radio DJ in Phoenix too.

1435
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:33,160
He had a radio show.
He's addicted.

1436
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,740
He got to see.
He goes to movies and he only sees

1437
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:39,550
those.
He only sees the premieres and then he

1438
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:42,100
goes on the street.
People like this is the first time he

1439
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,060
sort of like hundreds of death.
It was a big difference between.

1440
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,520
Oh,
so you're trying to say that he isn't

1441
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:56,500
doing shows is this brought him to a
high heat and he pried it?

1442
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:57,880
No,
he's probably having a ball,

1443
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:01,150
but I'm not saying that this happened,
but maybe it could be that simple.

1444
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:02,630
He,
that's Ah,

1445
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,880
that's a big high boy.
I just stood on the stage.

1446
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:07,810
You'd go nuts.
I was like,

1447
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,570
the only time that you're allowed to
dress like that.

1448
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,200
You can't dress like that.
And really you have to go on stage to

1449
01:06:16,201 --> 01:06:17,140
dress up like that.
Go,

1450
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,160
go to those,
some of those photos.

1451
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,740
If you come over my house with the
fucking leather pants on and a shirt

1452
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:21,730
like that,
I'll fucking choke.

1453
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:24,670
You can't come in my house like that.
What are you doing man?

1454
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,670
Why are you dressing like you just came
over on a boat from Spain?

1455
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,920
Some Cell Toro risks being taken that
he's got laser on his wrists,

1456
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,270
but you can pull that off if you're in a
band.

1457
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,790
Look at him,
but he always dresses like that.

1458
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,350
It's like he's wearing his regular
clothes.

1459
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:49,000
Like for Johnny Depp.
He's wearing regular clothes,

1460
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:53,110
but he does have his sleeves rolled up
and see what I mean.

1461
01:06:53,111 --> 01:06:56,500
Sort of expectation for sure.
He's definitely working on that image.

1462
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,450
Do you think he must've hair up on
purpose?

1463
01:06:58,451 --> 01:07:00,010
Like not Masiya enough.
Come on,

1464
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:01,920
sit up a little more.
Spray.

1465
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,100
Listen there,
stick it up.

1466
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,040
Hey listen.
I know more power to them.

1467
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:09,960
I want to do that too.
Just wanting to go to Germany just like

1468
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,950
Ryan Paik I think can just go to
Germany.

1469
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,960
You'd probably just.
I could just do that too.

1470
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,410
Yeah.
There is no one wants to stage and

1471
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:20,830
entering gentlemen.
Him value freight to go it tied in lace

1472
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,940
if you choose that you would looking at
in,

1473
01:07:23,941 --> 01:07:24,630
in his.

1474
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:27,850
His situation is whether he's navigating
it successfully or not.

1475
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,940
He's definitely in a strange path of the
river.

1476
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,500
You know,
he's in a strange,

1477
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,970
really deep wide channel.
Would incredible rapids and he's riding

1478
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:40,210
on a fucking inner tube down the stretch
of river that nobody gets to ride.

1479
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:44,810
The Johnny Depp stretches like Tom
Cruise stretch or the Samuel Jackson

1480
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:45,251
stretch.
Like,

1481
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:47,740
whoa.
Like these motherfuckers can't go

1482
01:07:47,741 --> 01:07:48,610
anywhere.
Like,

1483
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:49,970
yeah,
Stan Hope told me.

1484
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:52,420
Hangs around with Johnny Depp and they
can't go anywhere.

1485
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:54,640
They have dudes with earpieces
everywhere.

1486
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,390
There's people constantly circling him,
making sure he's okay and he'll go into

1487
01:07:58,391 --> 01:08:00,430
a restaurant.
There's people that are guarding the

1488
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:01,780
doors.
They're watching the.

1489
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,730
They're making sure people don't go in
the room.

1490
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:07,510
It's very,
very different than even regular fame.

1491
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,620
He's in that pirates of the Caribbean
fame where it's just can't go anywhere.

1492
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:14,290
That's an expensive product,
bro.

1493
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,710
I need to protect that product.
Well,

1494
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,170
it's also,
he's super vulnerable,

1495
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:21,200
like people lose their fucking minds and
they're around a certain level of

1496
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:22,490
celebrity.
Does it?

1497
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,650
Tom Cruise,
Tom Cruise can't go to the movies.

1498
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:27,610
He's get it.
If you went to the movies,

1499
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,100
he would leave the movie theater and
people will be trying to grab him as he

1500
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:34,310
was walking in the theater just to touch
him and take pictures with them and it's

1501
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:36,140
not like you can't just interact with
people,

1502
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:36,640
right.

1503
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,850
Identify only Tom Cruise.
It's an intense experience.

1504
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,050
What was that like?
What'd you do?

1505
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:46,440
It was a film called rock of ages that
Baldwin,

1506
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,470
lots of freely,
freely famous people were in it and the

1507
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:55,471
monkey and the monkey when already where
there was no monkey in it and at some

1508
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:58,180
point Tom Cruise said there's going to
be a monkey in his film,

1509
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,880
and from that point there was a fucking
monkey in the film.

1510
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:04,930
Even Mass Ada monkey was in scenes that
Tom cruise weren't in one with me and

1511
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:08,860
the monkey was an asshole.
It was wearing a nappy that was tied on

1512
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:10,540
with electric tape.
It was very aggressive.

1513
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,600
It jumped off of the shoulder.
The guy that was meant to be looking

1514
01:09:13,601 --> 01:09:15,790
after the monkey,
the monkey had a trailer with five other

1515
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,800
monkeys in it.
It could fuck in its time off was

1516
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,980
getting the monkeys fucking contract.

1517
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,910
He wouldn't have to him.
You can say there's a scene with the

1518
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,590
monkey.
I didn't know acting at.

1519
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,380
All I'm doing is he's just a man
nervously looking at.

1520
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:33,400
I'm just thinking that thing down off
that shoulder at any point now.

1521
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,210
Fuck you up.
It could fuck.

1522
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:38,080
Well Thomas Tom Cruise.
He likes traveling king,

1523
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,520
you know,
like he's got many,

1524
01:09:39,521 --> 01:09:44,521
many trailers like and like so like you
know you arrive in a situation you think

1525
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,900
rock era.
My prejudices about Tom Cruise,

1526
01:09:46,901 --> 01:09:49,540
all the things I've read,
all the things I've heard go prejudice.

1527
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,760
Like we meet him,
he blasted me.

1528
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:55,990
We've searched affability and charm that
they melt it away.

1529
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:58,710
Ice cones.
Then the pure hate of the man.

1530
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,600
Sweetness.
You gave a lock on the sofa.

1531
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:03,010
It was my birthday.
During that film I got a big basket full

1532
01:10:03,011 --> 01:10:05,910
of black yoga related things and stuff
like that.

1533
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,740
They sort of fought for president.
You remember?

1534
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:08,680
You know,
shake your hand.

1535
01:10:08,681 --> 01:10:11,370
Remembers your name,
sort of remembers details about eggs.

1536
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,720
I could brief.
You mentioned you're on a or something

1537
01:10:13,721 --> 01:10:15,070
into compensation.
Next conversation.

1538
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:16,780
You mentioned that on A.
I went round.

1539
01:10:16,781 --> 01:10:19,090
His house for dinner was really,
really late because of that fucking

1540
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:20,560
monkey.
Actually it was playing up.

1541
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,530
A lucky was not working that day.
I went back,

1542
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,430
went mandy's affidavit,
said when he'd been married,

1543
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:27,010
Katie Holmes,
and there's that little famous Tom

1544
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,180
Cruise.
Siri Cruz was.

1545
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,030
They're all lined up.
I went there.

1546
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:32,650
I was very,
very late and they'd like the Ada wheat

1547
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,120
and he goes,
oh,

1548
01:10:34,121 --> 01:10:36,040
well do you want to still eat?
I went,

1549
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:36,401
yeah,
yeah,

1550
01:10:36,401 --> 01:10:38,730
no,
I wait and I had to sat like I'm sitting

1551
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:41,620
with you now.
Joe Opposite Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes

1552
01:10:41,621 --> 01:10:46,360
and the little dial in one.
I was fucking in spaghetti like and it's

1553
01:10:46,361 --> 01:10:49,680
as a complicated thing to eat
long,

1554
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:50,370
isn't it?

1555
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:53,320
I was telling me that a lady and the
tramp shoving that shit in and then the

1556
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:56,200
next course I think was the signer,
which was weird because that's to pass

1557
01:10:56,201 --> 01:10:58,110
the courses.
Then I think there was like sort of

1558
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,280
cupcakes and stuff involved all the way
through.

1559
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:03,400
It just sat opposite.
Tom Cruise silicon about communism,

1560
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,340
which I brought up as a topic,
which in retrospect was a mistake.

1561
01:11:06,341 --> 01:11:07,091
Why?
Well,

1562
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:10,930
because don't bring up communism because
I like what I said was our goes,

1563
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,070
well,
I'm down with fairness where I goes,

1564
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,801
you know,
communism.

1565
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:14,970
Yeah.
Surely it went a bit.

1566
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,940
It got a bit out of control.
No one's arguing with that.

1567
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,280
Went a bit hectic.
I'm not down with massacres.

1568
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:24,350
Genocides under one flag,
but fairness and justice I'm fully up

1569
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:26,580
for.
And Tom Cruise goes out.

1570
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,640
Data about that.
The communism.

1571
01:11:28,641 --> 01:11:28,990
Marco's.
Yeah.

1572
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:31,230
But Tom,
you were born with this thing.

1573
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,950
You've been born with this thing.
I guess that's like being born an Irish.

1574
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,711
The crap,
you know,

1575
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:36,900
like the thing that you've got that
drive or wherever,

1576
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:37,590
you know,
your,

1577
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:40,290
like people aren't like you.
I try to explain it to Tom,

1578
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:42,780
but uh,
it was hard for him to take me

1579
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:44,900
seriously.
Speaker eight,

1580
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:49,170
amateur.
But I had a good go of saying it's

1581
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,890
probably different to be Tom cruise than
other people.

1582
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,381
Yeah,
for sure.

1583
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:52,860
But what,
what,

1584
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,320
what was he saying?
That the communism is a bad idea.

1585
01:11:55,321 --> 01:11:56,520
And you were saying that,
you know,

1586
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:01,020
maybe sharing more would be a good idea.
Isn't it weird that communism is

1587
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:03,510
connected to dictatorships,
which is kind of the opposite of

1588
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:04,410
communism.
It really is.

1589
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:07,230
I think if anything,
as soon as people start to implement

1590
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,430
ideas,
it gets in fucking trouble,

1591
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:10,570
doesn't it?
Because people started.

1592
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:11,483
People put Lauer.

1593
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,001
Nicole.
Yeah,

1594
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:15,030
the power of course.
Because all of these political ideas and

1595
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,100
religious art is exposed to just be,
we're here,

1596
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,870
we're going to die,
or should we try and make it as nice as

1597
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:20,880
possible?
And like part of that is going to be not

1598
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:24,600
been out of order to each other and like
in a sort of like and buy all of them

1599
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,730
interface with our problems,
the problems.

1600
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:28,680
We have described those biological
mechanical drive.

1601
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:32,670
So I'm trying out a lot.
All I said is like the communism there

1602
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:34,860
is socialism and communism and
communism.

1603
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:39,810
That's different from the depiction of
communism that a lot of Americans and

1604
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:42,010
English people would have because we
were.

1605
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,280
We were on the other side of the Cold
War.

1606
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:46,080
So we got a very,
very negative impact.

1607
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,080
And of course that was a version of
communism.

1608
01:12:48,081 --> 01:12:50,580
It was pretty fucking brutal in places
as is capitalism,

1609
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:51,120
you know.

1610
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,830
So I'm sort of like trying to kick
around these.

1611
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:53,431
I was saying like,
yeah,

1612
01:12:53,431 --> 01:12:56,940
but really all communism is,
is a sort of a version of Christianity

1613
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,350
in that it's saying we are all brothers
here and all of us have riots and we

1614
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:03,450
should be trying to build a society
where we love each other.

1615
01:13:03,451 --> 01:13:04,750
That's sort of what he's saying,
you know,

1616
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:05,281
like,
you know,

1617
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:08,400
where it goes wrong is it doesn't allow
room for individualism and the many

1618
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:11,910
myriad distinctions between different
human beings by one concentrate on that,

1619
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:15,960
but that's not really communism or that
it's really more of dictatorships.

1620
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,000
That was dictatorship.
So you can dress it up.

1621
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:18,841
It won't because like,
yeah,

1622
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:19,541
that's the.
Yeah.

1623
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:20,311
Um,
I mean like,

1624
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:21,780
you know,
I'm not a scholar in communism,

1625
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:24,240
otherwise I'm going to do a degree in
religion and global politics.

1626
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,700
And for me,
I'm going to spend the next three years

1627
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:27,000
doing it.

1628
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,100
Part time you,
you have to pop in a day and that week.

1629
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:31,290
And actually have not done it yet.
Go go for the interview next week.

1630
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:33,210
I'm hoping they're going to let me in.
Just on the basis of.

1631
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,090
C'Mon.
Let me in the fucking Tele.

1632
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,770
Give us a break.
Anyway,

1633
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:39,450
so I'm there anyway,
but my point,

1634
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,470
my point I was trying to make is that
things get convoluted and complicated

1635
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:44,220
by,
you know,

1636
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,190
bureaucracy,
ideology and demagoguery.

1637
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:52,340
But ultimately we're just meant to be
sharing and sort as bloody community.

1638
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,920
Really.
The dictatorship aspect of it is almost

1639
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:58,170
like,
it's almost like that same inescapable

1640
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:02,070
drive that causes someone to want to be
the monkey with the five monkeys did a

1641
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:05,100
good fucking time.
There's only so long going,

1642
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,750
I'm going to be the monkey.
That's fucking fine.

1643
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:09,510
Wherever it's like any sort of religious
extremism,

1644
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:12,030
there's always some guy at the end of it
go and I'm going to

1645
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,490
be fucking five monkeys in my trailer
and then that person's ruining it for

1646
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:17,310
the rest of us.
Because like whenever you see like about

1647
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,970
religious coal in it,
you know,

1648
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,740
I've started a religious cult,
you know,

1649
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:23,530
we all live here together and we grow
around vegetables.

1650
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:24,400
Everything's organic.
Yeah.

1651
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:25,480
Alright.
That's lovely mate.

1652
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,950
Oh,
you fucking everyone.

1653
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:29,790
Oh,
I done against that a little bit.

1654
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:30,640
Yeah,
a little bit.

1655
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:34,690
I've got a monkey trailer.
Everybody else's wives.

1656
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:35,953
Yeah.
That's.

1657
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,520
That's one of those weird,
inescapable things about being a person

1658
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:42,340
who did these.
These drives that you have to figure out

1659
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:45,370
how to hold them together.
I think communism would work.

1660
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,630
Look,
if this was a community,

1661
01:14:46,631 --> 01:14:48,580
if we,
if we were the only four people on an

1662
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:49,560
island,
just us four,

1663
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,980
we would be communists.
We would all just get together and we

1664
01:14:52,981 --> 01:14:54,640
would talk like,
how do you guys want to handle this?

1665
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,710
Like what do we do?
How do we gather this?

1666
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,900
I'm pulling off.
Yeah.

1667
01:14:58,901 --> 01:14:59,660
Hey,
I'm,

1668
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,690
I'm pretty good at climbing trees under
where the coconuts are.

1669
01:15:01,691 --> 01:15:02,291
Okay,
cool.

1670
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:06,550
And we'd figure it out.
Share poems cause only provide those,

1671
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,680
but we will lose our share.
Right?

1672
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:10,510
And if we didn't,
we'd have to have a conversation.

1673
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:11,830
We'd have to say,
hey joe,

1674
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:14,830
you're not fucking digging enough holes
or you don't catch enough fish.

1675
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:16,600
We gotta we gotta work this out
together.

1676
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:20,140
So we all contributed in equal amount.
You can't be lazy and exist off the

1677
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,840
fruits of your brothers and sisters.
Labor.

1678
01:15:21,841 --> 01:15:23,260
It's really good.
It's all contribute.

1679
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:25,280
What's difference between that and being
tribal?

1680
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:26,700
It's the same thing.
Same thing.

1681
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:30,430
Have you heard this thing?
The inner chimpanzee societies,

1682
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:33,390
they have about 75 chimps.
Ryan,

1683
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:37,480
once it gets to about eight or nine a
things get edgy and they normally break

1684
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:42,481
off and go a breakaway chimp community
because this is getting too heavy over

1685
01:15:42,561 --> 01:15:45,940
here and so the assumption is that we,
as you know,

1686
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,500
great apes ourselves similarly should be
living in manageable communities.

1687
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,470
We serve over stimulate new exposure.
You know,

1688
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:57,540
when you were sort of joking about like
the power of women and femininity,

1689
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:00,070
you're not meant to be exposed to that
kind of stuff.

1690
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:03,520
You're not meant to meet that exposed to
that kind of imagery that is present in

1691
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:05,620
pornography.
You don't mean to be exposed to that

1692
01:16:05,621 --> 01:16:07,540
kind of that kind of variety.
Women to be like,

1693
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,230
there's 50 or 60 of us.
Alright,

1694
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,420
these people,
good warriors.

1695
01:16:10,421 --> 01:16:12,680
These people are good fishermen.
These people look at it.

1696
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,700
I mean mysticism,
you know,

1697
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,650
you find little roles in it,
but again,

1698
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:21,100
since we've lived in this mono culture
where people are like little cells,

1699
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,840
batteries,
all sort of stacked up together in

1700
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:25,600
cities and suburbs.
Then like how do you access that we're

1701
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:27,550
not having an authentic human
experience,

1702
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:30,340
so that's why there's so much.
So what do I want to say?

1703
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,470
Disease,
what's an authentic human experience,

1704
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:35,000
but it's a very new one.
It's a very different thing and I've,

1705
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,300
I've tried to figure out what it is
we're actually doing,

1706
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,510
but it seems to me that everything is
getting more and more connected.

1707
01:16:40,511 --> 01:16:42,260
Right?
So what we're doing when these cities is

1708
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:46,570
we're connecting 20 million people into
this massive buildings and then we're

1709
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:49,180
connecting them all with the Internet.
So they weren't connecting those 20

1710
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,750
million people with 10 million people in
this state and 5 million people in that

1711
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:53,480
state.
And we're,

1712
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:58,240
we're all becoming one sort of weird
gigantic group that's very,

1713
01:16:58,241 --> 01:17:03,100
very dissimilar from the original tribal
groups that allowed one alpha male to

1714
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:05,770
run things.
One Alpha female community.

1715
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:07,480
Everybody knowing and understanding each
other.

1716
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,370
And when you,
when you talk like archeologists

1717
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,740
and have you ever read sex at dawn?
Dr Chris Ryan,

1718
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,580
really interesting book,
but what he maintains is that this idea,

1719
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:20,120
even of monogamy that didn't exist in
these tribal cultures,

1720
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:24,420
they shared sexuality like everybody's
swapped around and people banged

1721
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:27,980
everybody and that's one of the reasons
why they stayed intimate is that they

1722
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:31,040
all probably were polyamorous,
polyamorous,

1723
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,920
and they didn't understand they will
steal.

1724
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,880
It speaks to our nature because we don't
want to be monogamous.

1725
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:41,330
It's a struggle.
But the polyamorous thing also speaks to

1726
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:44,750
this idea that before we understood
genetics and we understood DNA,

1727
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,300
we didn't know whose children they were.
So if you had a child,

1728
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:50,810
if a woman had a child and I fucked her
and you fucked her and you fucked her,

1729
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:52,610
we'll assume it's our kid.
We don't.

1730
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:54,140
No one knows.
They didn't understand it.

1731
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:57,640
They didn't know once.
It will mail and clues along the way.

1732
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:00,200
For sure.
Definitely people get it.

1733
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,280
They figured it out after a while that
kids struggling a little paypal.

1734
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,410
But that's a weird thing too,
is how children maintain some sort of

1735
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:13,610
talent traits that their parents have.
Like there's things that get passed on

1736
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:17,620
through children to,
through DNA of obsessive behaviors come

1737
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:21,920
like a desire to grow and learn.
People like have kids that are very

1738
01:18:21,921 --> 01:18:26,450
similar in personality that seemed to be
like inherent to the child that seems to

1739
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:28,340
come through the DNA.
If it wouldn't,

1740
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,790
wouldn't that be a little bit to have
the kid that's only knows growing up and

1741
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,310
he's,
if he's watching maybe a parent that's

1742
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:38,390
obsessive,
he's either going to not be in that or

1743
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,910
I'm going to be.
I'm sure it's possible.

1744
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,300
It's totally possible.
But there's also like a pattern that

1745
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:45,200
they follow.
Like um,

1746
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:48,230
my middle daughter is obsessed with
things.

1747
01:18:48,231 --> 01:18:50,840
She gets obsessed with things.
Like she's read six Harry Potter books.

1748
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:52,460
She's eight.
She's keeps reading them.

1749
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:55,190
She'll read hours and hours every night.
And then she also wants to talk about

1750
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:56,990
Harry Potter.
She's all fucking totally.

1751
01:18:56,991 --> 01:18:59,360
Harry Potter it out.
Like all day long she will explain

1752
01:18:59,361 --> 01:18:59,780
something,
man.

1753
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:00,920
I'm like,
is that Harry Potter thing?

1754
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:01,760
She was like,
yes it is.

1755
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,260
And then she'll,
she'll,

1756
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:06,380
she's just obsessed with Harry Potter or
gymnastics or whatever the fuck it is.

1757
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,170
She's very much like me.
When she gets something,

1758
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,550
she just doing cartwheels in the living
room all day long and fucking backhand

1759
01:19:12,551 --> 01:19:13,460
springs.
She never stops.

1760
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:17,600
She's just obsessed and she gets on
these things and just ride them out and

1761
01:19:17,601 --> 01:19:20,810
she doesn't even necessarily know that
that's how I am.

1762
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,440
I don't think she sees that because I'm
not like that when I'm around her.

1763
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:26,840
Really.
So you observing her and it's the same

1764
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:27,501
extent.
Oh Wow.

1765
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:31,520
She's got my eyes.
You can see she's exhibiting traits.

1766
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,440
She's not been taught.

1767
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,660
They're very extreme.
It's very extreme.

1768
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:36,770
It's not like a,
Oh,

1769
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:40,250
it's similar because my youngest
daughter is just silly.

1770
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,810
She's not like that at all.
She's,

1771
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,330
she's not obsessive at all.
She just a fun little kid.

1772
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,910
But the middle one is kind of fucking
crazy.

1773
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,803
Does that.
How does that,

1774
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,550
does that make you feel like different
type of connection?

1775
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:53,730
No,
no,

1776
01:19:53,731 --> 01:19:54,380
no,
no,

1777
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:54,921
no,
no.

1778
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:57,680
This is the connection with all of them.
That's interesting thing about having

1779
01:19:57,681 --> 01:19:59,330
children.
The connection with all of them is just

1780
01:19:59,331 --> 01:20:01,680
so spectacular.
It's not a,

1781
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,490
there's not like I connect with this one
more than that one,

1782
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:06,600
connect with all of them.
But um,

1783
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,550
it's interesting to observe your own
bizarre personality traits manifesting

1784
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:13,680
themselves almost in a genetic level.
Kid.

1785
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,610
Yeah.
I,

1786
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:16,623
I,
uh,

1787
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,020
my middle one's like that.
My middle one is identical twin.

1788
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,660
Me and I sometimes I like it.

1789
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:23,620
Sometimes I love it and sometimes they
go,

1790
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,690
oh,
I like that.

1791
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:27,300
How old is she?
She's 14.

1792
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:29,820
So she's really blossoming.
But you know what?

1793
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:32,730
The one that does all the gymnastics and
all that.

1794
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:36,870
I noticed too with kids,
they express happiness in different

1795
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:38,070
ways.
My oldest one,

1796
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:41,040
the only time I know she's truly happy
and she's 17 now,

1797
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,080
is when she's bouncing,
singing,

1798
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,110
doing a cartwheel outside.
She kind of instrument.

1799
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,300
That's when she's silent.
I go,

1800
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,080
Oh man,
something's up.

1801
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:52,950
This kid's been silenced or turned dad.
So expressive.

1802
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,330
You know,
also when you think about it,

1803
01:20:54,331 --> 01:20:57,090
like who,
who's like more expressive than you,

1804
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:01,190
like you're this like joyful guy who was
always get this crazy laugh and you

1805
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,120
know,
by now at 14,

1806
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:07,080
she's super aware that you play these
places all over the world.

1807
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:09,150
People come to see you and laugh.
I mean,

1808
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:10,750
that's got to be bizarre to what does it
mean?

1809
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:11,810
What does your dad do for a living?
Oh,

1810
01:21:11,811 --> 01:21:14,070
I fixed the pipes.
What about your dad just talks shit in

1811
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:15,570
front of people and they left their dick
off.

1812
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,730
You know,
it's a very bizarre thing for a kid to

1813
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:18,211
go,
whoa,

1814
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:18,631
Whoa,
whoa.

1815
01:21:18,631 --> 01:21:20,580
You can do that too,
right?

1816
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:23,040
You know,
and they see that and then you know,

1817
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:26,730
and also I'm sure you're not restrictive
in how they express themselves.

1818
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:30,090
You probably want them to have fun and
laugh and joke around a lot.

1819
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:30,900
Yeah.
I mean,

1820
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,810
so that gets encouraged and then I think
happiness,

1821
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,690
like self reflection and all these other
things,

1822
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:37,653
these,
it's a,

1823
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:40,020
these are muscles and you can work on
those muscles.

1824
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,230
You know,
you can,

1825
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:42,120
you can develop them.

1826
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,740
I think you're absolutely right about
that.

1827
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:44,250
I,
I,

1828
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:44,940
they,
it,

1829
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,100
I've been using these circuits,
leather,

1830
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,530
if you login,
how it must be neurologically.

1831
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,210
Of course I'm speculating about
neurology,

1832
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:53,540
which is probably not something that
someone who knows nothing about you,

1833
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:57,030
none of us do.
So we'll just follow you on

1834
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,560
the uh,
the,

1835
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:01,650
you know,
if you're continually activate in

1836
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:03,960
certain neurological pathways or
creating relationships,

1837
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,810
synaptic relationships,
then that,

1838
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,320
that's going to fire up more readily.
I mean,

1839
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:09,510
I notice it with some of these new
things I'm doing,

1840
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:12,750
like initially when people were
explaining stuff about getting out of

1841
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,260
off guard and lighten how even to
shuffle on the floor,

1842
01:22:16,261 --> 01:22:17,100
you know,
that shrimp is.

1843
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:19,640
I said I ain't ever going to be.
I do this sooner.

1844
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,960
So flat.
It seems like it's making its way

1845
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,920
behaviorally into a different aspect of
my consciousness.

1846
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:29,700
And I suppose if there's like in a wind
to happiness or misery or addiction,

1847
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,800
if you're continually living in that
circuit,

1848
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:32,710
like,
like,

1849
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,280
you know,
people talk about programming I feel

1850
01:22:35,281 --> 01:22:36,870
like,
but when I'm aware of my programming,

1851
01:22:36,871 --> 01:22:38,910
is there certain things that if people
say them to me,

1852
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:41,240
I can't help the reaction that I have,
you know,

1853
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,720
obvious ones,
a citizen.

1854
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,170
If I'm exposed to certain sexual images,
Bang,

1855
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:45,560
Bang,
Bang,

1856
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,550
Bang,
I feel all those feelings before I make

1857
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:49,770
any decisions.
If someone makes me feel insecure or say

1858
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:52,260
something,
we'll have to really watch that moment

1859
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:55,800
before because otherwise before now I've
gone down a path of behavior and I think

1860
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:59,760
that what the perhaps what we can do on
an individual level is learn.

1861
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:02,310
And this is not hard for people are
living in total fucking crisis and

1862
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,550
dreadful poverty in the.
You said before,

1863
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:06,760
I'm personally,
I'm in a privileged position where I can

1864
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,160
begin to bring my consciousness to those
kinds of things,

1865
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,920
right?
I want to live on that circuit.

1866
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:14,230
Now.
I don't want to always have Nikki

1867
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:14,781
judgments.
I,

1868
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,020
I'm always want to feel fearful when
these moments,

1869
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:21,940
I want to learn to plow that
neurological pathway so that it's easier

1870
01:23:21,941 --> 01:23:25,540
for me to stay there,
that you know programming is necessary

1871
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:28,330
and like if you're not living on a
program that you've taken control of

1872
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:30,340
individually,
you're living on someone else's program,

1873
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:32,020
you're living on that program that's out
there,

1874
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:36,760
that constant bombardment of negativity
and fear and anxiety and division and

1875
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:39,940
you're different from paypal and you're
not good enough and by this otherwise

1876
01:23:39,941 --> 01:23:41,170
you're not going to be good enough.

1877
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:44,560
You know that you're going to need
pretty strong defenses.

1878
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,850
I think that's why with the diminished
role of religion in our life with the

1879
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:52,360
diminished role of sort of political
ideologies that we can trust.

1880
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:57,280
What are people supposed to do about
being alive and not feeling good or who

1881
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:58,360
do you go to now

1882
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,730
doing it?
I think you were part of it.

1883
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,650
I think there's a lot of other people
that are doing it too.

1884
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:05,770
It's like you're trying to reexamine the
patterns that you're stuck in and how

1885
01:24:05,771 --> 01:24:08,440
many of these patterns that you or I or
Jim or anybody here,

1886
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:12,100
it's created for themselves.
You've created a lot of your own prison

1887
01:24:12,101 --> 01:24:14,950
bars and that's a really common thing
with people.

1888
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:18,280
You know,
these whatever defenses that you've put

1889
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:20,500
up,
whatever the patterns that you've

1890
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:24,760
instinctively followed because of
jealousy or fear of inadequacy or any

1891
01:24:24,761 --> 01:24:27,650
weird feelings,
you've set these neurological patterns

1892
01:24:27,651 --> 01:24:29,860
and they're very difficult to break once
you've set them yourself.

1893
01:24:29,861 --> 01:24:33,310
It's almost like you've built your own
prison and now you're complaining about

1894
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:33,710
it.

1895
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,480
Yes,
I agree with this.

1896
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,810
Now that,
do you think we could introduce to that,

1897
01:24:37,811 --> 01:24:39,210
uh,
kind of a compassion because,

1898
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,280
you know,
when we're earlier on,

1899
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,410
we're talking about like we can
understand people who sort of jealousy

1900
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,330
or irritation like people being famous
or rich because I,

1901
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,950
there's no doubt there's too much
inequality,

1902
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,010
this,
too much injustice.

1903
01:24:49,011 --> 01:24:50,990
It's not something that can really be
questioned.

1904
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:53,960
And so when,
what I'm trying to do is bring bloody

1905
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,820
compassion and tolerance to places where
I find it odd today someone was like,

1906
01:24:58,821 --> 01:25:00,500
you know,
I told you I didn't bring no club.

1907
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,300
I left my suitcase,
I fucked up,

1908
01:25:02,301 --> 01:25:03,950
you know,
so it's going in the shop and this is

1909
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,320
gonna.
This is a problem of great privilege.

1910
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:10,690
I went along to a pretty cool shop in
Los Angeles and their security fellow at

1911
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,820
goes shopping open yet.
Then he recognized me and he goes,

1912
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:14,930
oh no,
no,

1913
01:25:14,931 --> 01:25:16,260
no,
their shop is open.

1914
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:16,661
Right?
And the.

1915
01:25:16,661 --> 01:25:17,210
And I was like,
oh,

1916
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:19,250
thank you mate.
And I felt all special for a moment.

1917
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:22,160
Then we got to the doorway to shop and
the guy that was inside the shop,

1918
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,040
he,
I don't know,

1919
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,680
he's having a bad day or whatever.
And he goes,

1920
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,281
oh,
you know,

1921
01:25:25,281 --> 01:25:26,420
maybe you can't come in.
Right?

1922
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,730
And I made it for you.
Fucking like the reaction.

1923
01:25:28,731 --> 01:25:33,110
I feel like rage actually.
And in the security guy to his eternal

1924
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:35,530
credit overrode the guy in the right
now.

1925
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:36,690
And just let him in,
let him in,

1926
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,470
in Laos got in the shop.
And I felt sort of like I felt better

1927
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,170
about myself in that moment.
Like,

1928
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:43,250
I'm so special,
I'm allowed.

1929
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:47,450
It had so many little things sort of
triggered in me in that sort of short

1930
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,700
momentary interaction and feeling of
like,

1931
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,440
oh great.
The security guy recognizes me.

1932
01:25:51,441 --> 01:25:52,131
Oh No,
this guy,

1933
01:25:52,131 --> 01:25:53,780
they let me in.
And it's very hard for me actually.

1934
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:56,790
It says I'm still in my mind judging
that guy that they wouldn't let me in

1935
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,680
and around in my consciousness fucking
pumps.

1936
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:04,160
You still have an argument in your head,
should say

1937
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,190
that,
that would have destroyed him.

1938
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:12,160
That guy
told the perfect thing like a silver

1939
01:26:13,611 --> 01:26:15,710
bullet and then you get there.
And he goes,

1940
01:26:15,711 --> 01:26:18,050
hey man,
I'm really sorry if I was rude earlier,

1941
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:18,830
I just,
uh,

1942
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:21,840
my girlfriend broke up with the perfect
thing.

1943
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,800
And then you will go to
support guys working retail girlfriends.

1944
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:32,120
Fucking some football player.
Poor bastard,

1945
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:36,560
right?
Does your mom is too?

1946
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:38,840
Are you going to club and you're so
fucking rude.

1947
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:43,130
I thought in my mad success I'd reached
to the point where I can walk to a place

1948
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,050
in the city.
You're not allowed in here and I turn

1949
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:47,110
around,
I'm going fucking,

1950
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,540
I'm going to buy this fucking place and
then I'm going to fire.

1951
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:54,350
That's how fucking work.
That's what Tom Cruise does.

1952
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:57,120
So Tom,
the new

1953
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,740
place said a lot of admin just to
maximize net.

1954
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,560
You've got to go for.
All right.

1955
01:27:03,561 --> 01:27:05,350
Okay.
The surveyors are coming on Monday

1956
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:06,650
gauge,
right?

1957
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:11,120
Jesus Christ.
50 people coming to check right now.

1958
01:27:11,121 --> 01:27:13,660
Could you bring a.
suddenly we can't bring in Dave because

1959
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:16,980
he's a chemotherapy session.
Can we might have some weird laws or who

1960
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:18,110
you could fire and not foreign.

1961
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,090
Imagine now you buy the building.
This fuck has to keep working for you.

1962
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,750
Oh my God.
Now you're stuck with him and then he

1963
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:33,830
sues you for discrimination or
harassment or something like that.

1964
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:36,770
Dave was missing a tone when I tried to
sack him.

1965
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:38,840
That was a misstep.
Wasn't mistake in retrospect.

1966
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:42,140
So did anybody from the Tom Cruise camp
try to convert?

1967
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:44,530
You know,
one might even the remote is the effort

1968
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:49,120
to convert me.
I couldn't have made it more clear that

1969
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:54,130
was desperately in need of an ideology
gets funded.

1970
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:57,660
It was something to believe in some
structure,

1971
01:27:57,661 --> 01:28:01,860
so just for Fuck Sake,
give me that dialectics book,

1972
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:03,050
whatever it's called.
Yeah,

1973
01:28:03,051 --> 01:28:04,180
there should be a way.
Right.

1974
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,800
I was not interested.
It's like Joe,

1975
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,150
I felt.
I thought they felt that I would ruin so

1976
01:28:08,151 --> 01:28:09,530
until the tree.
And they did.

1977
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,450
They did.
They didn't.

1978
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:15,640
There was no invitation,
but no one said,

1979
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,690
come on mate,
you need a biff l,

1980
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:18,740
Ron Hubbard in your life.

1981
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:20,240
There was no,
no interest.

1982
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,820
They might have been an expansionist
religion.

1983
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:25,170
No one up at all,
and if ever there was a candidate for a

1984
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:27,590
religion,
I think they tread very carefully on

1985
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:30,170
those waters.
You have to start asking questions

1986
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:34,130
yourself
or there's certain levels.

1987
01:28:34,131 --> 01:28:38,210
Perhaps this is also possibly where they
don't necessarily really want anybody

1988
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,780
fucking thought,
no,

1989
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:42,620
I didn't qualify.
I'm going to that fucking slippery

1990
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:44,280
center.
I'm going to kick the bloody door and

1991
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:45,560
say,
come on.

1992
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:49,400
I think type.
My mother had been burned too many times

1993
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,230
up.
They're very careful about who they

1994
01:28:51,231 --> 01:28:52,570
allow in,
who they don't allow,

1995
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,310
and I would imagine that pillorying of
science,

1996
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:57,900
I'm always feel sorry for me.
Well,

1997
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,030
they're just trying their hardest to
make up a religion.

1998
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:01,591
I mean,
I don't know.

1999
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:03,180
I just see going clear.
Yeah,

2000
01:29:03,181 --> 01:29:05,040
that was.
You'll stop feeling sorry for him.

2001
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,360
When you watch going clear,
you like,

2002
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:10,160
what in the fuck?
I like that Guy Paul Haggis who went

2003
01:29:10,161 --> 01:29:11,640
like when they showed him,
right?

2004
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:14,460
This is your scripts.
He was like,

2005
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,730
he looked around for the outcome and
this is the test right to people.

2006
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,180
If you believe in this,
they go,

2007
01:29:19,181 --> 01:29:20,130
no,
you fucking market.

2008
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:22,140
That's not the real thing.
You immediate get out.

2009
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,280
Well,
he was a madman.

2010
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:25,590
I mean l Ron Hubbard,
whether or not he's correct about

2011
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:30,240
scientology wrote more fiction than any
person that's ever lived.

2012
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:34,830
Even if that was his only qualification,
he was just making stuff and making

2013
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:37,590
stuff up and then he wrote this and no
red flags.

2014
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,720
No one,
no one goes,

2015
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:42,630
hey,
maybe made this up to no fucking chance.

2016
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:46,110
On Monday is in Guinness.
World Records for making shit up on

2017
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:48,240
Tuesdays he starts to religion and no
one goes,

2018
01:29:48,241 --> 01:29:50,550
is this connected to Monday's activity
in any way?

2019
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,830
Not only that,
just a chronic liar.

2020
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:55,530
Just his whole life was just full of
shit.

2021
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:56,280
Oh.
So I didn't like.

2022
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,900
He's rubbery wet lips like Ronald
Mcdonald mouth.

2023
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:04,350
It was a little bit of a global sort of
like sort of wet slobbery guy on those

2024
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:06,360
fucking cruise ships dressing people up.
I mean,

2025
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,940
I'm not a big fan of dudes with captains
outfits on him and

2026
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:15,660
what he did,
he was in the navy and he did command

2027
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:18,010
ships apparently.
But he was apparently a pretty good at

2028
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,310
that shit.
He was removed from his duty.

2029
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:23,520
But the point is after he got out
decided I'm still rocking this captain's

2030
01:30:23,521 --> 01:30:25,620
outfit go,
fuck.

2031
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:30,120
They will believe anything's how I
crossed me.

2032
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:33,540
I got a boat,
I'm going to make some shit up and I'll

2033
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:38,541
have them for quite a and make a good
business of watch me areas.

2034
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,710
Yeah.
I skipper madman,

2035
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,750
look it at fascinating and the liquid
around the mouth,

2036
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:46,860
I suppose people that are scientologists
was say,

2037
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:50,210
this is our religion and uh,
you're taking the piss out of our

2038
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:50,690
region.

2039
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:55,550
It's an ideology that is also a very
positive one in the sense that it's

2040
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:59,570
dedicated towards self improvement.
And eliminating all these psychological

2041
01:30:59,571 --> 01:31:03,410
barriers that are holding you back and
in that way people find a lot of benefit

2042
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:06,650
in being a part of that religion and I
think when they find a lot of benefit

2043
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:09,770
and being a part of it,
then you know they can justify all the

2044
01:31:09,771 --> 01:31:12,980
other nonsense and just sort of ignore
it because what l Ron Hubbard,

2045
01:31:12,981 --> 01:31:17,720
according to the going clear book,
Lawrence Krauss Book was trying to do

2046
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,540
with self medicate,
would he?

2047
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:23,120
He had a lot of psychological issues
himself and he was trying to cure his

2048
01:31:23,121 --> 01:31:28,121
own issues and in using these methods to
cure his own religion or the zone,

2049
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:32,300
his own issues,
he translated them into a religion.

2050
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:35,870
Like this was a big part of what
scientology initially was,

2051
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,850
was his own attempts to self diagnose
and treat his own psychological

2052
01:31:40,851 --> 01:31:41,440
ailments.

2053
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,730
Quite a good idea really works really
well.

2054
01:31:45,731 --> 01:31:49,500
And there are so I suppose people there,
it's working for all right.

2055
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:53,170
Like a quote I heard,
I'd like to be quick to see where

2056
01:31:53,171 --> 01:31:54,550
religious people are,
right?

2057
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,470
You know,
it's all really August where religious

2058
01:31:56,471 --> 01:31:59,440
people are wrong because we sort of hear
about it on news,

2059
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:00,020
but like

2060
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,600
w we're religious people are right,
you know,

2061
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:04,960
sort of togetherness,
selfless nurse relationship with a

2062
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:09,340
deeper self acceptance of death and the
possibility of transcendence of the

2063
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,640
human primal self.
Those things are all really beautiful

2064
01:32:12,641 --> 01:32:15,670
ideas that they've kind of lost their
way in a science,

2065
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,580
a science,
you know,

2066
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,740
that term.
Scientism,

2067
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,620
the idea that sort of science has got
into territories that science can really

2068
01:32:20,621 --> 01:32:23,530
handle because we come to a judging full
stop at certain points.

2069
01:32:23,531 --> 01:32:25,690
You know,
like what happened on the Tuesday before

2070
01:32:25,691 --> 01:32:26,830
the Big Bang,
you know,

2071
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:30,920
serialism
materialism,

2072
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,330
individualism

2073
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,690
are hard things to overcome.
If like,

2074
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:36,491
if,
if people,

2075
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:38,800
if we are,
if we have as our dominant mindset,

2076
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:40,990
I'm only gonna believe shit that I can
prove.

2077
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:44,470
Then you are just an individual and you
may as well just.

2078
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:49,130
Why not just spend your life fuck as
many people as you can and accumulating

2079
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:51,550
as much material as you can because
nothing exists.

2080
01:32:51,551 --> 01:32:52,840
Unless you can see it,
measure it,

2081
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:54,760
why it contain it and fuck it.
You know,

2082
01:32:54,761 --> 01:32:58,660
if that is the dominant belief system,
which was sort of materialism,

2083
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,370
consumerism,
capitalism,

2084
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:03,790
I think all dovetail on that premise.
This is all real.

2085
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:09,580
That's how you can have the,
the chronic ecological disrespect is

2086
01:33:09,581 --> 01:33:12,820
because it really doesn't matter what
happens after you're dead.

2087
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:13,391
There you go,
well,

2088
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:16,780
what about my fucking children?
Even just not a practical level of

2089
01:33:16,781 --> 01:33:19,930
called live on this fucking pebble in
infinite space.

2090
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:21,490
But if you're just like,
well,

2091
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,790
not really thought about that in a sort
of an inability to accept,

2092
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:26,050
you know,
like certain.

2093
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:31,740
I know that you're sort of like a
wholesale by any dominant theory,

2094
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:34,450
but I think it's clear to me that
general,

2095
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:36,130
well,
I believe in on an individual level and

2096
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:37,600
on a cultural level,
if something is possible,

2097
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:40,090
you should be trying to fucking do it.
So as soon as people realize,

2098
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,520
hold on a minute,
that's having a negative impact,

2099
01:33:42,521 --> 01:33:44,560
or hey,
this is a better way of using our

2100
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:46,000
resources.
Now utilities,

2101
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:48,670
soon as you realize it,
you should be moving towards it.

2102
01:33:48,671 --> 01:33:51,610
They say wisdom is acting on knowledge.
Once you recognize,

2103
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:53,480
oh,
fossil fuels are running out so right

2104
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:55,840
fucking hell,
we'd better start working on the basis

2105
01:33:55,841 --> 01:33:58,060
that we're fucked.
We better start looking at alternative

2106
01:33:58,061 --> 01:34:00,670
energy sources.
We're looking at different alliances

2107
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:04,480
like knowing those things and not doing
them.

2108
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,120
It makes me very,
very uneasy because it makes me think

2109
01:34:07,121 --> 01:34:11,770
who benefits from ignoring this stuff?
Who's running this show?

2110
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:14,590
If he's having all of the.
It's creating all this rage,

2111
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:17,290
all this unease,
all this fear in your country and in my

2112
01:34:17,291 --> 01:34:22,170
country now times of great,
great disease and uncertainty for people

2113
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:27,180
really looking for something and know
that these institutions are just saying,

2114
01:34:27,611 --> 01:34:30,520
just united carry on.
There's no sort of alternative.

2115
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:33,820
No one's going to let you know is going
to see himself as part of a religious

2116
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:37,450
community in the same way or so.
One of the dead ideologies of the last

2117
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:41,830
century and meanwhile we're in this sort
of peculiar style of looming crisis.

2118
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:43,810
It feels kind of fucking mad

2119
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,130
in a state of looming crisis,
but to unpack this whole thing,

2120
01:34:47,131 --> 01:34:50,910
you started off with this idea of what
happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang

2121
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,080
and how science can't really answer that
well,

2122
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:56,880
they can't answer it yet.
Like the problem is once they gather

2123
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,480
data,
it might be 100 years now or a thousand

2124
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,140
years from now.
They can say,

2125
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:02,210
Oh,
well here we've done the calculations

2126
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:05,930
and we understand now that it's an
infinite cycle of birth and death and

2127
01:35:05,931 --> 01:35:09,440
the universe is constantly expanding
contracting and this is the process that

2128
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:12,020
we're a part of.
It's infinite and it's never started.

2129
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:14,480
It is never ending and it goes on and on
and on.

2130
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:16,020
I think you'll probably bloody right
mate.

2131
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:21,100
I like that idea that you just espoused
is in 5,000 year old fucking document

2132
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,830
called the upanishads.
Those ideas,

2133
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:28,000
those ideas are there already.
So when we fucked off religion a hundred

2134
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,020
years ago because it was causing too
much,

2135
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,480
you know our sake,
we got.

2136
01:35:31,481 --> 01:35:34,470
We kicked out of some of the ideas that
are only now just being

2137
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,271
discovered.
Right?

2138
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:37,970
But those ideas are just to be
contemplated right now and to be

2139
01:35:37,971 --> 01:35:40,340
considered.
Whereas science is trying to find

2140
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:44,300
definitive evidence that they do or
don't represent the reality of our

2141
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:46,010
timeline.
And once they do,

2142
01:35:46,011 --> 01:35:48,710
then there'll be able to talk about it.
But right now what they're doing is

2143
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:51,800
they're examining the evidence that the
big bang exists and what could have

2144
01:35:51,801 --> 01:35:53,270
possibly caused that.
Yeah,

2145
01:35:53,271 --> 01:35:54,070
that's right.
Yeah.

2146
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,950
See what,
where what,

2147
01:35:55,150 --> 01:36:00,150
what my difficulty is is that there are.
That is when any ideology behaves

2148
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:07,920
dogmatically and prohibitively prevent,
prevent further exploration,

2149
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,240
like whatever that would like.
What kind of.

2150
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:12,730
What's an example of it?
The nature of consciousness.

2151
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:17,660
No one knows why consciousness impact
matter in the way it does in the sub

2152
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:19,470
quantum world.
Now we can't fucking.

2153
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:21,370
We've come to a point where it's like,
oh fuck.

2154
01:36:21,371 --> 01:36:22,690
Like you know,
like if you were like that,

2155
01:36:22,691 --> 01:36:25,050
the,
the famous double Slit Theory and

2156
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:28,730
observed particle behaves differently
like the end of the park.

2157
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:31,390
One way you can change it.
It's the central nature depending on

2158
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:32,530
where he's been obsessed

2159
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:36,060
presented though when it's been
explained to me by people actually

2160
01:36:36,061 --> 01:36:38,700
understand it.
What it really is is that we're

2161
01:36:38,701 --> 01:36:41,850
measuring these particles and in the act
of measuring,

2162
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:46,020
you're changing the results because
you're using something to measure it.

2163
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,690
Yes,
yes,

2164
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:51,840
but it gets represented as all this woo
woo craziness,

2165
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,720
but what?
What I think is interesting,

2166
01:36:54,721 --> 01:36:57,540
Joe,
is somewhere between this woo craziness

2167
01:36:57,870 --> 01:37:01,170
and they're kind of a flat,
mundane,

2168
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:02,490
low.
This is life.

2169
01:37:02,491 --> 01:37:03,420
You're born,
you die,

2170
01:37:03,421 --> 01:37:05,790
you eat food.
Shit comes out your ass old territory,

2171
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:10,791
somewhere in there is a mystery that
they're behind your eyes buying Jimbo,

2172
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:14,340
Jamie's eyes and my eyes.
There is a constant.

2173
01:37:14,341 --> 01:37:16,410
There is this consciousness,
there is this awareness.

2174
01:37:16,411 --> 01:37:20,670
There's this inexplicably experience
that you've add on dmt experiences that

2175
01:37:20,671 --> 01:37:25,671
I've had through yoga and through lsd.
That suggests to me that consciousness

2176
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:30,030
itself is the dominant force.
Consciousness is not just one more

2177
01:37:30,031 --> 01:37:33,480
phenomena is the seat of all phenomena
and when people are saying,

2178
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:34,350
oh,
there's this thing,

2179
01:37:34,351 --> 01:37:36,600
that's God.
What they are saying is there is an

2180
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:40,800
absolute consciousness and all is
contained within it all matter at some

2181
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:43,620
point has come from consciousness.
These realms,

2182
01:37:43,621 --> 01:37:46,920
they're experienced true psychedelic or
extreme extreme,

2183
01:37:46,921 --> 01:37:48,690
you know,
personal experiments like if cryogenic

2184
01:37:48,691 --> 01:37:53,590
things or your flotation tanks all
suggest a phenomenon beyond the

2185
01:37:53,591 --> 01:37:54,870
individual consciousness.

2186
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:59,130
They something else say and the very
fact that you know that it's in for the

2187
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,590
consciousness,
even by the process of measuring,

2188
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,890
even by the process of measuring is
influencing and impacting rally.

2189
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:05,700
I don't think that,
you know,

2190
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,550
I'm not taking that to the extreme.
I know what you mean.

2191
01:38:07,551 --> 01:38:08,311
Make some people go,
oh,

2192
01:38:08,311 --> 01:38:11,640
that means your mind can control shit.
And when I think it means that,

2193
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:15,720
it means that reality is only reality.
When you look at it,

2194
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:18,550
that's what it's kind of getting towards
a bloody good book.

2195
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:22,650
I reckon your listeners will be banging
into his Kumbaya centuries in by a man

2196
01:38:22,651 --> 01:38:27,480
called Robert Lanza who he did the best
breakdown I've ever read of that double

2197
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:29,790
slit experiment and,
and have the,

2198
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,301
the,
the,

2199
01:38:30,301 --> 01:38:30,960
the,
you know,

2200
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,470
made me understand for the first time
that reality is happening within your

2201
01:38:34,471 --> 01:38:37,350
own consciousness.
It's not an external phenomena at all

2202
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:39,630
that you know,
like he explained it very wisely.

2203
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,480
I could understand of like,
he went,

2204
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:44,340
you know,
you sort of think I'm totally mundane.

2205
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:46,440
He went like,
you know the experience of going in your

2206
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:48,120
kitchen in the nine,
turning the light on.

2207
01:38:48,121 --> 01:38:51,000
Is your kitchen fridge still there when
you go back downstairs?

2208
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:53,520
He goes,
well I guess when you do go into your

2209
01:38:53,521 --> 01:38:56,160
kitchen and turn the light on,
he goes to your Foa on parcels of

2210
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:57,150
photons.
Come down,

2211
01:38:57,151 --> 01:38:59,890
I'd interact with the optic nerve.
They have a trans law.

2212
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,140
They invert it in your consciousness
that you know,

2213
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:04,350
so whatever it is,
what's in your kitchen when you're not

2214
01:39:04,351 --> 01:39:06,930
looking at it,
it ain't the same as when you are

2215
01:39:06,931 --> 01:39:10,590
looking at is an interpretive reality.
And one of the ways that I've sort of

2216
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:13,290
reduced this down for my own simple
understanding is this,

2217
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:16,080
that if none of us had a sense of smell,
if you didn't,

2218
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:17,040
I'd been Jamie didn't.

2219
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:20,010
And then how would the concept of smell
makes sense?

2220
01:39:20,011 --> 01:39:22,590
How would you go out with a pint and
this bike and with none of us would have

2221
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:25,710
the instrument to receive it.
So that whole thing will be off the

2222
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:29,010
agenda.
So I think that there are streams of

2223
01:39:29,011 --> 01:39:32,580
energy streams of data for which we do
not have the instruments to receive,

2224
01:39:32,581 --> 01:39:36,180
so we totally discount it because we
simply don't have the instruments to

2225
01:39:36,181 --> 01:39:38,570
receive it.
And I said once in my standup,

2226
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:41,460
as a matter of fact,
like my cat doesn't know there's an

2227
01:39:41,461 --> 01:39:44,370
internet,
the internet does not enter the realm of

2228
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:46,350
my cats consciousness,
but the fucking internet is out there.

2229
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,880
We're out here.
Having with these fucking experiences

2230
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:51,060
and like all those realms that we're
experiencing in these various sort of

2231
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:55,470
psychedelic states or however they
achieved is an indication to me there's

2232
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:56,304
another reality now.

2233
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:58,860
Where does that become fucking relevant
to what we're talking about?

2234
01:39:58,861 --> 01:39:59,760
For me,
where it does,

2235
01:39:59,761 --> 01:40:04,410
he's one of the continual ideas that
keeps reemerging to connect us back to

2236
01:40:04,411 --> 01:40:07,950
where we were with Joe Campbell at the
beginning is there is this fucking sense

2237
01:40:07,951 --> 01:40:11,850
of oneness and believing ourselves to be
individual and believing that the

2238
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:16,220
dominant thing in our lives to be
material that fucks us up because people

2239
01:40:16,221 --> 01:40:20,760
will kill each other over that material
and once we realized no with the true

2240
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:24,030
thing about us is the consciousness is
the inner self.

2241
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:25,320
That's the roofing they we're all out
here.

2242
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:27,000
We're all in the game.
We're going to do shit and we're all

2243
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:30,570
gonna make mistakes,
but that's not have the material idea as

2244
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:34,200
the dominant social idea because
everyone's agreed with that.

2245
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:35,810
Whether they're communist or capitalist
of fascist,

2246
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:39,300
wherever everyone's saying now the main
thing is they ship this out here and

2247
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:42,320
it's like that connects to those primal
drives because we know that if that's

2248
01:40:42,321 --> 01:40:44,640
happening to your sexual drive,
you can never have enough pussy.

2249
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:47,640
If that gets into your state test drive,
you can never have enough status and

2250
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:48,510
power,
you know,

2251
01:40:48,511 --> 01:40:50,580
so like we're all going to still feel
those things.

2252
01:40:50,581 --> 01:40:52,620
I'm still going to be a camp 25 times a
day,

2253
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:55,660
but it'd be nice if the cultural
ambiance was,

2254
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:56,421
oh,
I don't know who,

2255
01:40:56,421 --> 01:40:58,600
Russell,
you'll be back to your normal self in a

2256
01:40:58,601 --> 01:41:01,630
minute of feeling that we're all one and
we're all connected.

2257
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:02,201
Not,
yeah,

2258
01:41:02,201 --> 01:41:04,100
well of course I'd feel right that you
know,

2259
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:06,250
like that.
And that's what frightens me about the

2260
01:41:06,251 --> 01:41:10,750
culture of our countries at the moment
is it's endorsing the worst aspects of

2261
01:41:10,751 --> 01:41:14,380
our nature.
It's acculturating the worst aspects of

2262
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:17,050
our nature instead of the best aspects
of our nature and that for me then I'm

2263
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:19,990
fucking difference between left and
right in the current political sphere

2264
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:21,880
because they're all making the same
argument.

2265
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:24,580
They're all saying come and live out
here in the material world.

2266
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:27,840
Yeah.
It seems to me that the material world

2267
01:41:27,841 --> 01:41:32,160
and this idea that we should be
accumulating possessions and status and

2268
01:41:32,161 --> 01:41:35,790
all these different things is universal.
It almost seems like it's a natural

2269
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:40,791
progression from ancient tribal
civilization life to this weird city

2270
01:41:40,891 --> 01:41:43,680
life,
to this integration of electronics and

2271
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:47,190
our life in this symbiotic relationship
that we have two computers and the

2272
01:41:47,191 --> 01:41:51,030
Internet and information itself.
It seems like this is one of the things

2273
01:41:51,031 --> 01:41:53,220
that drives.
That is this desire for material

2274
01:41:53,221 --> 01:41:55,440
possessions.
Because when you have a desire for

2275
01:41:55,441 --> 01:41:58,650
material possessions and ensures that
you're going to continue to innovate and

2276
01:41:58,651 --> 01:42:01,200
come up with newer and greater and
better because you always want to keep

2277
01:42:01,201 --> 01:42:03,300
up with the Joneses.
You always want to have the newest tesla

2278
01:42:03,301 --> 01:42:06,480
because it goes zero to 60 in two
seconds and you want to have the coolest

2279
01:42:06,481 --> 01:42:09,240
fucking house with the biggest TV and
the fastest internet and all those

2280
01:42:09,241 --> 01:42:13,560
things sort of compound this
technological innovation cycle that

2281
01:42:13,561 --> 01:42:14,250
we're on.

2282
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:18,480
So my thought has been for a long time
that what we are is some sort of

2283
01:42:18,481 --> 01:42:22,800
electronic caterpillar that's going to
give birth some artificial life and that

2284
01:42:22,801 --> 01:42:25,980
all of our desire for material
possessions and status and all these

2285
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:30,981
different things is really just us
pushing forth this electronic agenda and

2286
01:42:31,381 --> 01:42:35,910
that this innovation and the
construction of artificial intelligence

2287
01:42:35,911 --> 01:42:39,570
that's inevitable is eventually going to
be the next stage of life and that weird

2288
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:44,571
like huddling ourselves up in this sort
of civilization cocoon and that boom out

2289
01:42:44,911 --> 01:42:48,450
of that cocoon is gonna pop.
Some sort of a god being and that this

2290
01:42:48,451 --> 01:42:51,110
is what we're here for and this is what
we've been doing since we're monkeys

2291
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:54,300
flinging shit at each other and flipping
over cow patties,

2292
01:42:54,301 --> 01:42:57,870
looking for mushrooms.
That we are a part of a process.

2293
01:42:57,990 --> 01:43:02,520
And then if you look at it objectively,
all these traps that you or I or Tom

2294
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:05,760
Cruise or Jim breuer been caught up in
when whether it's traps of Eagle or

2295
01:43:05,761 --> 01:43:06,330
jealousy.

2296
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:08,460
All these things sort of ensure
movement.

2297
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:11,430
They insure movement,
ensure interactivity,

2298
01:43:11,431 --> 01:43:15,330
and that is going to ensure innovation
and progress and competition.

2299
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:17,460
And all those things that even we look
at it,

2300
01:43:17,461 --> 01:43:18,540
we go,
this is so pointless,

2301
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:22,350
this is so foolish.
So but yet it's so incredibly prevalent.

2302
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:25,380
Not Glorifying it or saying it's
definitely the way to go,

2303
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:27,750
but objective Lee,
if you weren't a human and you're

2304
01:43:27,751 --> 01:43:29,910
stepping outside of this thing,
looking at it from a distance,

2305
01:43:29,911 --> 01:43:32,670
you're like,
these fuckers are making something they

2306
01:43:32,671 --> 01:43:34,260
might not even know they're making
something,

2307
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:35,560
but they're making.
I understand

2308
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:39,520
that the same way that bees or ants may
will be aware of their hive

2309
01:43:39,521 --> 01:43:41,230
consciousness and the and the common
drive.

2310
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,350
But where I disagree with you,
Joe,

2311
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:49,220
is that you see the end point as being
the materialization of a super

2312
01:43:49,221 --> 01:43:54,221
consciousness through technology.
I see the end point is being a

2313
01:43:54,351 --> 01:43:58,360
realization amongst us as a species.
Now I know that they're both could be

2314
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:00,430
both and there is no.
There isn't a reason to,

2315
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:02,210
you know,
we all just another fucking,

2316
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:03,980
oh we just another species on this
planet.

2317
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:05,660
Oh,
we will know better than dogs and cows

2318
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:06,580
and monkeys.
I don't,

2319
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:06,880
I,
I,

2320
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:07,713
you know,

2321
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:11,430
we are.
If the sun that heats us up as a

2322
01:44:11,431 --> 01:44:13,710
lifespan,
where are their inventions as well?

2323
01:44:13,711 --> 01:44:17,190
The cats and the monkeys.
That's I'm fucking invented being cute.

2324
01:44:17,191 --> 01:44:19,830
I mean they're so real dollar in your
lap.

2325
01:44:19,831 --> 01:44:21,340
You pet them.
They like it.

2326
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:24,090
They need to contribute.
They're contributing.

2327
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,470
Take the dog for a walk.
You come up with ideas.

2328
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:29,930
You're not spelling.
I'll do love my dog,

2329
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:33,720
but hold on.
But my.

2330
01:44:33,721 --> 01:44:35,390
What was my.
What was my point in that?

2331
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,860
Well,
I think you want to pump the brakes.

2332
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:39,540
What you're saying is we should pump the
brakes.

2333
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:42,340
We should pump the brakes of this
possession in this.

2334
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:45,750
This idea that we're trying to
accomplish these great things by

2335
01:44:45,751 --> 01:44:49,530
accumulating things and status and it's
all bullshit and it's really about

2336
01:44:49,531 --> 01:44:50,670
consciousness more than anything.

2337
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:51,730
In fact,
Bill Hicks,

2338
01:44:51,731 --> 01:44:53,350
I think already said it when he said
that,

2339
01:44:53,351 --> 01:44:55,290
you know,
that we can be explored.

2340
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:58,520
We can explore space in an hour together
in peace.

2341
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:02,260
That that idea that if we look to our
common drives,

2342
01:45:02,261 --> 01:45:03,580
it's like ended up at Hancock all the
time.

2343
01:45:03,581 --> 01:45:05,840
I've heard him on your show saying like
that.

2344
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:09,640
Know what really what's happened is a
bias towards a particular aspect of our

2345
01:45:09,641 --> 01:45:12,500
own consciousness,
the problem solving brain and let you

2346
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,850
know that those drives are amazing.
Those drugs they're trying to get

2347
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:18,100
somewhere.
Technology is amazing.

2348
01:45:18,101 --> 01:45:19,970
We would like you to at the very fact
that people in bloody here is,

2349
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:22,360
I don't understand any event.
It's fucking wonderful,

2350
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:27,510
but the dominant idea behind it,
one of profit that dominating idea and

2351
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:32,500
the profit in itself is not necessarily
negative but profit at all cost,

2352
01:45:32,501 --> 01:45:35,950
profit at any cost.
So really I'm not saying we should as a

2353
01:45:35,951 --> 01:45:38,590
species fucking slow down and dressing
fell and fucking,

2354
01:45:38,591 --> 01:45:39,770
you know,
like grab and vegetables.

2355
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,980
It's funny now I want human beings to be
glorious,

2356
01:45:41,981 --> 01:45:44,770
but what I'm saying is that our bias
towards this one particular item,

2357
01:45:44,790 --> 01:45:47,350
materialistic idea,
is preventing us from realizing that

2358
01:45:47,351 --> 01:45:50,050
glory because part of our consciousness
has been ignored.

2359
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,460
Yes,
but you from the time you want to say

2360
01:45:54,461 --> 01:45:55,500
yes,
but no,

2361
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:56,403
no,
no,

2362
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:00,970
I think we all agree on that and I hate
to dumb it.

2363
01:46:00,971 --> 01:46:04,300
I'm dumb.
So dumb it down and I go back to pink

2364
01:46:04,301 --> 01:46:07,690
floyd.
We don't need no education.

2365
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:12,730
It all we all aware you don't have a
chance where you check your back is

2366
01:46:12,731 --> 01:46:17,731
against the wall from the time you come
out of the womb because you're saturated

2367
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:22,300
with false images.
You're saturated in our society.

2368
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:27,880
God is money and success and there is no
soul.

2369
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,760
They're in a too.
It takes people like you and I to go

2370
01:46:30,761 --> 01:46:33,520
there and go,
there's nothing doesn't fucking matter

2371
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:38,640
because it's so oversaturated.
That's why the Kardashians are huge and

2372
01:46:38,981 --> 01:46:43,981
this person's huge and because it's
almost laughable because the more you

2373
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:47,230
put it out there,
the harder they have to hit them on

2374
01:46:47,231 --> 01:46:48,400
their cell phones.
Well,

2375
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:50,040
here's phones.
The kids

2376
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,460
are going to be on a 24 slash seven.
It just,

2377
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,420
it's massive overload.
It's the more your brain goes this way,

2378
01:46:57,421 --> 01:47:00,460
the more they go,
well,

2379
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,090
we're not designed for this amount of
information coming in and that's for

2380
01:47:03,091 --> 01:47:05,280
sure.
Now we're not designed to be connected

2381
01:47:05,281 --> 01:47:07,110
with 7 billion people all over the
world.

2382
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:10,350
We're not designed to seeing a camera
placed on someone that doesn't have

2383
01:47:10,351 --> 01:47:12,240
anything good to say.
Interesting.

2384
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:12,640
Said,
oh,

2385
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:15,780
but they're constantly on camera and
they're editing it in a way that you're

2386
01:47:15,781 --> 01:47:18,570
short attention span is sort of
connected to this thing because every 15

2387
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:21,720
seconds of given you a new camera angle,
and that's by design.

2388
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:25,050
It's like an interface.
They figured out how to do these reality

2389
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:28,350
shows where they edit the show,
so like a music video where you're

2390
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:31,950
constantly changing the angle so you're
constantly stimulated.

2391
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:37,050
If you just had Kim Kardashians sitting
across the table from her mom and they

2392
01:47:37,051 --> 01:47:39,870
were just sitting there for like three
hours talking like a podcast,

2393
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:44,220
you would want a fucking mediator to
come from Jupiter and slam right into

2394
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:49,050
that God damn house and this now stop
this before it spreads.

2395
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:53,010
What are they doing?
But if you keep them going back and

2396
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:55,680
forth and then you cut to a single of
them by themselves.

2397
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,420
Bitching about,
my mom has always been about blah,

2398
01:47:57,421 --> 01:47:57,930
blah,
blah,

2399
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,310
and then go back to her.
Well,

2400
01:47:59,311 --> 01:48:02,510
she thinks that she can do this,
and then what am I shooting was,

2401
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,271
wow,
look at that.

2402
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:08,271
Watch premier cameras and constant
changing of angles and it's constant

2403
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:12,510
fucking introducing of a new thing to
pay attention to.

2404
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,620
I'm sorry,
on a stupid small note on a tiny,

2405
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:20,790
tiny note of how powerful and how far my
oldest daughter and I,

2406
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:24,120
I hate to admit it,
she sat there and her lips.

2407
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:26,190
She came in the room and I told it 20
times,

2408
01:48:26,191 --> 01:48:28,380
don't do that.
She saw something on the Internet,

2409
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,680
sticking her lips in the bottle and it
blows her lips up and for three days and

2410
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:36,570
everyone's doing it and who wasn't?
That was mad at her.

2411
01:48:36,571 --> 01:48:37,950
I went,
wow,

2412
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:41,700
this is how many my kids part of that
banana land.

2413
01:48:41,701 --> 01:48:44,160
It's just,
it's almost like they're laughing at us

2414
01:48:44,161 --> 01:48:45,760
now.
We couldn't make them do.

2415
01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:52,580
No one's pulling those strings.
We're pulling strings.

2416
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,040
It's a visual.
Oh,

2417
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:57,860
I see it and that's what I want to be.
Right?

2418
01:48:57,870 --> 01:49:01,020
Look at that image.
I know how many women want them in like

2419
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:03,750
that shot into the Ras,
so they look like Kim Kardashian.

2420
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:08,010
There's like a whole trend where women
are waist training where they're wearing

2421
01:49:08,011 --> 01:49:11,700
these corsets and tightening down there
fucking organs and then they're having

2422
01:49:11,701 --> 01:49:15,270
fat shoved into their ass.
They're extracting fat from areas of

2423
01:49:15,271 --> 01:49:20,271
their body and then reintroducing it
into their ass in order to develop this

2424
01:49:20,701 --> 01:49:24,720
round ridiculous thing that looks like
you're wearing a fucking diaper to be

2425
01:49:24,721 --> 01:49:29,460
relevant in to,
to imitate the same way.

2426
01:49:29,461 --> 01:49:31,800
You know,
the Siri women have fucking plates in

2427
01:49:31,801 --> 01:49:34,590
their lips were imitating patterns that
we see.

2428
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,480
They don't necessarily have to make
sense,

2429
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:40,890
but we're this weird animal that's sort
of imitates what our surroundings are.

2430
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,010
We imitate our atmosphere and some
strange way and we can.

2431
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:47,020
We can sort of create our own hell that
we,

2432
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:50,650
you know,
we reproduce this thing around us that's

2433
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:53,410
not just unsuccessful.
It's so unsatisfying.

2434
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,160
It's weird.
It's depressing and we do the Goddamn

2435
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:59,800
same thing.
We've become too good adaptations of

2436
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:02,580
mutate state and that's what was trying
to say earlier with the.

2437
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:05,950
They influences the paradigm,
the template that we're moving towards

2438
01:50:05,951 --> 01:50:08,890
these two predicated on the material to
the point where yeah,

2439
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,540
it's ludicrous.
Things I think like you joined the

2440
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:14,170
comparison between the neck things and
hearing things in the condition that

2441
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:19,330
that power that we're harnessing all
seems to center around innovation when

2442
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:25,321
we're pursuing material possessions,
when we're pursuing physical items,

2443
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:29,350
we're not talking about like vintage
things like I'm really into handmade

2444
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:33,370
things.
I love a handmade bag or handmade knife.

2445
01:50:33,371 --> 01:50:35,590
I love the idea that someone created
something,

2446
01:50:35,591 --> 01:50:38,410
crafted something,
but those things are the same.

2447
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:41,480
Like if you buy a knife that some guy
made hammering in a,

2448
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:45,070
you know,
one of those vats of fucking fire and

2449
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:46,091
Bang,
Bang,

2450
01:50:46,091 --> 01:50:46,630
Bang,
you're dead.

2451
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:48,940
He's doing it the same way.
People have done it for hundreds if not

2452
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,060
thousands of years.
There's something fascinating about that

2453
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:56,050
and interesting about that,
but in terms of like progression and

2454
01:50:56,051 --> 01:50:58,240
innovation,
it's like you can't compete with these

2455
01:50:58,241 --> 01:51:00,580
God damn laptops or phones or any of
these things.

2456
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:03,820
Those things are,
they're getting better and better at

2457
01:51:03,821 --> 01:51:07,540
this staggering exponential rate and at
the end of that line,

2458
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,860
see this.
If you've,

2459
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:11,140
if you extrapolate,
if you look at it from a distance,

2460
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:15,580
you pull yourself away from culture and
civilization and look down what is this

2461
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:17,650
super being called,
the human race?

2462
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:21,760
What is the super organism doing,
which creating better and better things?

2463
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:22,990
Well,
why is it doing that?

2464
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,960
Why is it ignoring the very ocean that
surrounds it?

2465
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:29,380
Why is it sucking all the fish out of
the ocean and shitting all the fucking

2466
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:34,180
dirt and dust up into the air,
but ignoring that while concentrating on

2467
01:51:34,181 --> 01:51:37,840
the possession and the innovation of all
these electronic gadgets?

2468
01:51:37,841 --> 01:51:39,280
Well,
it's got to be something to do with

2469
01:51:39,281 --> 01:51:41,710
that.
It's like a pole and Mckenna used to

2470
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:46,711
call it an attractor that we're being
pulled towards some future attract or

2471
01:51:46,751 --> 01:51:51,070
some singularity event.
Some moment that we are creating,

2472
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:55,240
whether we're aware of it or not,
but that part of all of our ridiculous

2473
01:51:55,241 --> 01:52:00,241
behavior in terms of our ego and our
drive for success and attention and love

2474
01:52:00,761 --> 01:52:03,400
and affection,
all of these different things is really

2475
01:52:03,401 --> 01:52:07,410
sort of pushing this innovation further
and further and quicker and quicker and

2476
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:10,450
it's extremely interesting idea what it
feels thinking when you're saying that.

2477
01:52:10,451 --> 01:52:11,810
It's like,
oh,

2478
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:16,530
every time that's happening,
the creativity you'll put where all of

2479
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:20,290
these things before the exact same
things exist in this unrealized realm,

2480
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:23,750
will play over,
refer to as the realm of ideas that

2481
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:27,460
there's an idealized form of all things
before they are realized in the material

2482
01:52:27,461 --> 01:52:29,440
world.
Like someone designing a knife has to

2483
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:33,100
consciously conceive of the knife before
bringing it into the material world.

2484
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:37,780
That there's this constant need to pull
from this unrealized like whenever I see

2485
01:52:37,781 --> 01:52:39,230
babies now,
I wanted to get him.

2486
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:42,800
Where were you?
What was your countries?

2487
01:52:42,801 --> 01:52:46,070
That's telling me what it's like to
hopefully still am

2488
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,600
friendly with David Lynch,
the film maker,

2489
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:50,720
and he told me that a friend of his over
were outside their kids' nursery and

2490
01:52:50,721 --> 01:52:53,390
they had a three year old kid in a six
month year old,

2491
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:57,520
can't don't say years after my six month
old kid and they heard the free route

2492
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:59,030
go.
The six month kid,

2493
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:03,320
I need you to tell me about heaven again
because I'm beginning to forget

2494
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:08,000
David Lynch.
I blew my mind.

2495
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:12,700
Where is consciousness before I forget.
Oh,

2496
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:15,030
as a person,
and Jim,

2497
01:53:15,031 --> 01:53:17,220
you can back me up on this.
As a person who has kids,

2498
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:22,400
one of the most bizarre aspects of child
raising is that when you have them in

2499
01:53:22,651 --> 01:53:25,650
their babies,
these moments when they're little and

2500
01:53:25,651 --> 01:53:26,401
tiny,
you think,

2501
01:53:26,401 --> 01:53:29,370
I will never gonna forget this.
This is the most powerful moment of my

2502
01:53:29,371 --> 01:53:30,870
life.
This is amazing.

2503
01:53:30,871 --> 01:53:33,270
Being around them when they're so little
and their first words,

2504
01:53:33,271 --> 01:53:35,550
they're talking to you,
but you fucking forget it.

2505
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,640
You forget it all because you know them
as the them.

2506
01:53:38,641 --> 01:53:41,820
They are now at six or at eight or at 10
or at 14,

2507
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:45,960
and those incredibly powerful moment you
forget,

2508
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:50,100
but meanwhile you're.
You remember some cut you off in traffic

2509
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:53,460
14 years ago and you're like,
I should have kicked out fucking guys as

2510
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:56,460
I saw him at the red light and I didn't
get out of my car and it haunts me to

2511
01:53:56,461 --> 01:53:59,580
this day on a drag him out of his car
and feed him his fucking teeth.

2512
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:03,180
You remember that,
but you won't remember your daughter

2513
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:08,240
being to dancing to some music that's on
television and everybody laughing and

2514
01:54:09,421 --> 01:54:11,070
cheering along.
You have to see it.

2515
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:14,240
You have to look at a fucking video that
you saved on your iphone and watch it

2516
01:54:14,241 --> 01:54:15,090
and you go,
oh yeah,

2517
01:54:15,091 --> 01:54:16,800
that's right.
Oh my God,

2518
01:54:16,801 --> 01:54:21,150
what an amazing moment.
Somehow or another almost like dreams,

2519
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:26,360
those ideas are erased from the
accessible memory in some strange way or

2520
01:54:26,461 --> 01:54:29,450
many of them are.
So when you hear a three year old st do

2521
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:33,120
a six month,
that is fucking crazy because it makes

2522
01:54:33,121 --> 01:54:35,480
you wonder,
is that one of them?

2523
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:37,920
Because that's one of the properties of
DMT by the way in which is the

2524
01:54:37,921 --> 01:54:39,660
psychedelic that's created by your own
brain.

2525
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:45,240
One of the major properties of that
dream is how profound the visions are.

2526
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:48,780
Incredibly powerful,
but then they slip through your hands.

2527
01:54:48,810 --> 01:54:50,520
They are gone.
They're gone.

2528
01:54:50,521 --> 01:54:53,310
Just like a dream.
When you wake up from a dream and you

2529
01:54:53,311 --> 01:54:56,550
try to explain it to somebody,
you have a very small window.

2530
01:54:56,551 --> 01:54:56,660
Will

2531
01:54:56,660 --> 01:55:00,380
you explain that dream
consciousness?

2532
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:02,270
Yeah.
There's powerful moments.

2533
01:55:02,271 --> 01:55:03,850
Does eraser?
Yes,

2534
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:08,750
but there's also a powerful,
really good moments that I've had with

2535
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:11,950
each one of my kids and I can literally
at of all the monster.

2536
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,340
I said,
I don't remember this.

2537
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,450
You still let them in the museum of your
mind.

2538
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:20,240
I have forgotten most,
but there's a handful that I remember.

2539
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:21,530
Well,
I say if it was yesterday,

2540
01:55:21,531 --> 01:55:26,531
that was on a deeper spiritual conscious
level where we just locked eyes and it

2541
01:55:27,681 --> 01:55:30,620
was a moment and we just knew everything
about each other.

2542
01:55:30,621 --> 01:55:31,700
That Mo,
I can't.

2543
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:36,200
Maybe I wanted that moment,
but that's how it felt and I can count

2544
01:55:36,201 --> 01:55:39,170
that with each one of my kids.
Where I always go back to going,

2545
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:41,930
wow,
I really know who you really are and I'm

2546
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,660
trying to get you back to that.
Does it make sense?

2547
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,980
Does I think that we have an accessible
database,

2548
01:55:46,981 --> 01:55:49,080
we have a hard drive,
we have a certain amount of space and

2549
01:55:49,081 --> 01:55:52,910
that's been proven when it comes to how
many people you can know and keeping

2550
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:55,620
your life.
They say that you could keep about 150

2551
01:55:55,621 --> 01:56:00,621
people in your life and you can sort of
remember these people and you can you

2552
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:05,580
hold these people,
but once you go past 1:50 it gets

2553
01:56:05,581 --> 01:56:08,550
fucking slippery as shit and you must
experience that because you're

2554
01:56:08,551 --> 01:56:11,580
constantly meeting people and people
know who you are and you don't remember

2555
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:14,340
them and after awhile you can go nice to
meet you and they go.

2556
01:56:14,341 --> 01:56:15,830
We already met.
We met three years ago.

2557
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:16,913
Oh,
I forgot.

2558
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:19,440
Yeah.
I cannot maintain this many connections.

2559
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:23,190
The same basis drive issue.
It's a literal hard drive issue.

2560
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:26,760
I forget what is the fucking.
I know that it's not bodes laws the size

2561
01:56:26,761 --> 01:56:27,594
of planets.

2562
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:29,550
It's A.
I forget the principal,

2563
01:56:29,551 --> 01:56:31,650
but the principal is a 100 or whatever
the word is.

2564
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:35,220
It's 150 people and you keep those
hundred 50 people in your head and

2565
01:56:35,221 --> 01:56:36,960
that's it.
It correlates to what we were talking

2566
01:56:36,961 --> 01:56:40,270
about with chimpanzees and anthropology,
that there is a,

2567
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,410
there isn't an ideal size for a
community before it becomes a disease to

2568
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:46,540
know to deal with,
but those things you were talking about,

2569
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:50,160
your children.
There are like a transcendent moment.

2570
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:51,300
Dunbar's number.
That's it.

2571
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,920
Cool.
Try and like you're talking about

2572
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:55,980
moments where it didn't matter that your
individual way and that's individual,

2573
01:56:55,981 --> 01:56:57,990
be that there's a clear connection that
something.

2574
01:56:57,991 --> 01:57:02,610
Parsley is between us and it was.
It was overpowering and beautiful just

2575
01:57:02,611 --> 01:57:06,480
for that moment and that keeps me going
in certain moments of time,

2576
01:57:06,481 --> 01:57:11,070
even though I'm 15 years later in 20,
I I know know could describe it to me.

2577
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:16,430
I just know that on some level that can
be broken down I'm sure to sort of oxy

2578
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:19,070
toast in and like,
oh,

2579
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,490
this is the shoreline was triggered by
that.

2580
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:23,700
There is a sort of a mechanical or
material component to even the most

2581
01:57:23,701 --> 01:57:26,730
beautiful experiences of a sunset away,
whatever it is,

2582
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:28,500
but my.
But to return to what you were saying

2583
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,620
before of like how we have five or
negative information,

2584
01:57:31,621 --> 01:57:34,980
there's a clear evolutionary bias for
like negative information has to be

2585
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:36,820
stored because you know he's not a
career.

2586
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:38,280
Is that line you better.
You know what I mean?

2587
01:57:39,070 --> 01:57:40,300
You're fucked.
If it's alliance.

2588
01:57:40,710 --> 01:57:43,560
Negative information does have like
priority,

2589
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:48,120
but what were you saying about like sort
of this continued technological

2590
01:57:48,121 --> 01:57:49,140
evolution?
What I.

2591
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:53,130
What I think is that there's an
imperative to have a comparable

2592
01:57:53,131 --> 01:57:58,120
spiritual evolution revolution and that
can occur is like the mortar.

2593
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:00,690
I meditate and spent time doing that
sort of stuff.

2594
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,810
It gives me a more of an awareness of
the kind of phenomenon you're talking

2595
01:58:03,811 --> 01:58:05,650
about,
about the positive things and I'm like,

2596
01:58:05,651 --> 01:58:06,451
you know about,
oh my God,

2597
01:58:06,451 --> 01:58:09,660
I must hold this moment in my heart.
The moment where my dog done now or the

2598
01:58:09,661 --> 01:58:11,190
moment I found out my girlfriend was
pregnant.

2599
01:58:11,191 --> 01:58:15,210
Don't fucking let this go this.
Go make this part of who you are as a

2600
01:58:15,211 --> 01:58:19,440
character and try to prioritize it over
negative things or when someone hurts,

2601
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,281
you know,
and,

2602
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:24,990
and I think that one has more
determination over that more or 40 over

2603
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:27,930
that if you have meditation as part of
Your Life,

2604
01:58:27,931 --> 01:58:31,310
if you have a spiritual component to it.
And that was when I was a teenager and

2605
01:58:31,311 --> 01:58:33,570
noticed that my mates were all the time.
It's like,

2606
01:58:33,571 --> 01:58:35,520
you know,
I'd hang out with my mates were smoking

2607
01:58:35,521 --> 01:58:36,330
loads to draw.

2608
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:37,830
Then we get in the car,
we go out,

2609
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:40,410
they go to work.
My mate would lucky worked in a car

2610
01:58:40,411 --> 01:58:43,480
factory and then he would go and work
doors to insecurity and I fought this

2611
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:46,460
guy.
Never ever is like Justin.

2612
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:47,950
Yeah.
He's never still,

2613
01:58:47,951 --> 01:58:50,320
he's never in reflection is always
engaged with some extent,

2614
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:52,600
for as a really lovely guy.
As a matter of fact he was.

2615
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:55,750
But like I,
I became aware then,

2616
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:58,870
but that's myself,
that I was part of my addiction was

2617
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:04,080
these uncontrolled drives always want in
something approval sex that I was unable

2618
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:06,820
to be still.
And being so unlike so many fucking

2619
01:59:06,821 --> 01:59:07,631
things like,
you know,

2620
01:59:07,631 --> 01:59:09,880
like I'm not Christian,
but it's so many things,

2621
01:59:09,881 --> 01:59:11,040
biblical things like,
uh,

2622
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:13,030
you know,
the Kingdom of Heaven is spread upon the

2623
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:15,460
earth,
but man sees it not the Kingdom of

2624
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:18,400
Heaven is within.
Be still and know that I am God,

2625
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:19,010
you know,
like,

2626
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:20,040
you know,
sort of like for me,

2627
01:59:20,041 --> 01:59:22,930
all that fuzzy fucking rapture,
cloud kingdom bullshit.

2628
01:59:22,930 --> 01:59:23,321
You know,
that,

2629
01:59:23,321 --> 01:59:24,490
you know,
that's no use to anybody.

2630
01:59:24,491 --> 01:59:26,440
But when people are saying to you,
it's in there,

2631
01:59:26,441 --> 01:59:28,390
it's in there.
Is there already,

2632
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:29,740
you know,
like there is no,

2633
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:32,950
of course we are also living in a
material world and I'm a material girl.

2634
01:59:32,951 --> 01:59:37,951
So because we can't drop the drive to
continue to create these great

2635
01:59:38,201 --> 01:59:42,880
achievements as a species.
But a part of it has got to be you learn

2636
01:59:42,881 --> 01:59:44,980
how to conduct yourself,
learn how to connect your emotions,

2637
01:59:45,070 --> 01:59:48,940
learn how to store positive experiences,
and learn how to let go of negative

2638
01:59:48,941 --> 01:59:49,440
ones.
You know,

2639
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,460
if that,
if that day originality with people.

2640
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:52,570
Yeah,
we've all got our paths,

2641
01:59:52,571 --> 01:59:55,270
everyone.
We've all got our individual attributes

2642
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:56,290
and skills.
Like you said,

2643
01:59:56,291 --> 01:59:58,270
if we were on communism,
the island,

2644
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,850
you know,
you need people like to people to be

2645
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:03,250
realizing what is their part of the
divine,

2646
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:06,250
what is the little part of you that's
trying to realize itself,

2647
02:00:06,251 --> 02:00:08,020
but life's kept fucking knocking you
back in.

2648
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:11,500
The systems kept breaking you down and
you've not got to realize that thing

2649
02:00:11,501 --> 02:00:15,290
that you can feel like a tree.
You're trying to grow into your.

2650
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,470
That's the.
That's the part of it I think can only

2651
02:00:17,471 --> 02:00:20,740
happen as part of a spiritual evolution
and I think you can even.

2652
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:23,710
You can only get the ticket to the
spiritual evolution if you learn to deal

2653
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:26,770
with this fucking Matt stimulating
bullshit that we're jacked up on.

2654
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:28,230
What's what you said,
meditate.

2655
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:30,430
You turn it all off.
It's really hard.

2656
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:35,020
I got turn it all off,
nothing and your mind will have a chance

2657
02:00:35,021 --> 02:00:38,170
to grow.
I also think that that's where the

2658
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:42,940
compelling feeling to gravitate towards
that comes from a dissatisfaction with

2659
02:00:42,941 --> 02:00:45,580
the material world,
dissatisfaction with this idea of

2660
02:00:45,581 --> 02:00:49,150
possessions and that there is some sort
of a weird ebb and flow and a Yin and

2661
02:00:49,151 --> 02:00:54,130
Yang to the world and sometimes you have
to see the fucking disastrous effects of

2662
02:00:54,131 --> 02:00:59,131
just giving in to material possessions
and the compelling feeling of wanting

2663
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:03,550
attention and nonsense and just
gathering up items and living in the

2664
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:04,270
biggest house.

2665
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:08,470
You have to almost feel the emptiness of
that to gravitate towards a spiritual

2666
02:01:08,471 --> 02:01:11,410
approach and I think that's one of the
reasons why those things are there.

2667
02:01:11,411 --> 02:01:13,840
It's almost like people do horrible
things.

2668
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:17,650
Like sometimes I feel like horrible
things when they're manifested by the

2669
02:01:17,651 --> 02:01:19,210
human race.
They sort of,

2670
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:20,010
they,
they,

2671
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:22,690
they,
they can give birth to a lot of positive

2672
02:01:22,691 --> 02:01:26,740
reactions because people don't ever want
to be like that and they see that and

2673
02:01:26,741 --> 02:01:26,981
they go,
well,

2674
02:01:26,981 --> 02:01:29,470
this is definitely not the way to go
because we're kind of all going through

2675
02:01:29,471 --> 02:01:32,200
it together.
One of the things about the human mind

2676
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:36,280
and the human experience like being a
conscious human is we assume that we're

2677
02:01:36,281 --> 02:01:38,400
this static thing.
Meanwhile we're,

2678
02:01:38,401 --> 02:01:40,040
we're very well aware that evolution

2679
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,840
exists all throughout the natural world
and we're also aware,

2680
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:47,120
well aware that we've only really been
this thing for like what a half,

2681
02:01:47,121 --> 02:01:50,570
a million quarter of a million years.
It's not been that long that you could

2682
02:01:50,571 --> 02:01:54,860
go back and find a,
an ancient human and they look like you

2683
02:01:54,861 --> 02:01:57,500
could put it in your clothes and put it
in a movie theater and we wouldn't freak

2684
02:01:57,501 --> 02:01:59,090
out.
It's not that long.

2685
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:02,930
It's a short amount of time.
So if you think about the fact that we

2686
02:02:02,931 --> 02:02:06,800
know that these animals and these,
these things are constantly evolving and

2687
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:10,310
changing and adapting all around us,
why would we assume that we're in some

2688
02:02:10,311 --> 02:02:11,840
sort of a static state?
Why?

2689
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:16,940
I think that our own gravitation towards
material possessions in our own use of

2690
02:02:18,021 --> 02:02:22,220
this new form of interacting with each
other through social media and the

2691
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:24,890
Internet and and movies and all those
things are new.

2692
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:28,370
We have to understand that mass media is
fucking knew as shit.

2693
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:31,450
All of it.
Newspapers are new as fuck everything.

2694
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:35,030
Everything's a couple hundred years old.
The oldest shit is a couple hundred

2695
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:35,900
years old,
photographs,

2696
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,150
couple hundred years old.
We're dealing with really,

2697
02:02:38,151 --> 02:02:40,910
really,
really new influences on the mind and

2698
02:02:40,911 --> 02:02:45,911
the mind is developing and expanding and
reacting to all these new things and

2699
02:02:47,061 --> 02:02:50,450
sometimes it reacts in a very negative
way like it gravitates towards the

2700
02:02:50,451 --> 02:02:54,230
Kardashians and it goes towards fucking
possessions and it wants the shiniest

2701
02:02:54,231 --> 02:02:57,530
new thing to show everybody that you've
arrived and it's.

2702
02:02:57,610 --> 02:03:02,610
It's a part of a cog in unconscious cog
in this machine that's just producing

2703
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:07,880
new items and then sometimes there's a
guy like you who sees that and goes,

2704
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:11,390
there is no soul to that.
I'm going to jump in the fucking lake

2705
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:14,690
near these royals house and I'm going to
experience what it's like to freeze my

2706
02:03:14,691 --> 02:03:18,170
dick off and I'm going to carve a new
path and I'm going to separate and I'm

2707
02:03:18,171 --> 02:03:21,470
going to try domesticity and I'm going
to try abstinence and I'm going to try

2708
02:03:21,471 --> 02:03:26,471
to find some sort of a new way of
addressing my dissatisfaction with the

2709
02:03:26,481 --> 02:03:30,230
current state of the world that I find
myself in that that was fucking good.

2710
02:03:30,230 --> 02:03:32,120
Rent.
I needed a date.

2711
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:33,800
It was.
It was.

2712
02:03:33,801 --> 02:03:36,740
I mean
it does that,

2713
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:38,540
but there's a part of that and all of
us.

2714
02:03:38,541 --> 02:03:40,040
We're all just going,
this ain't it?

2715
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:41,480
Maybe this is.
It does it in it.

2716
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,220
Maybe it's yoga,
maybe it's scientology.

2717
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:44,960
Maybe it's being a moonie.
Maybe it's this.

2718
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:47,630
Maybe it's that.
Maybe it's maybe this fucking chick is

2719
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:49,840
holding me back.
I need a goddamn divorce,

2720
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:53,270
but the fuck away from me.
I know I'm going to wear a captain's

2721
02:03:53,271 --> 02:03:55,820
outfit now.
Find some chick lives by the beach.

2722
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:01,070
Go to the captain's outfit.
We wanted to live out of my car and

2723
02:04:01,071 --> 02:04:03,230
travel around the world.
I'm going to put a bed in the back seat

2724
02:04:03,231 --> 02:04:06,290
and you know,
it's like this fax faction which has

2725
02:04:06,291 --> 02:04:11,291
been happening forever.
Just go right through there.

2726
02:04:11,441 --> 02:04:12,470
Yeah,
right through that door for

2727
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:16,010
that.
Can I do it time?

2728
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:20,120
I was trying to be a man.
I mean for me to be in another room.

2729
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:24,590
They ain't got used lots of voices.
We drank three waters.

2730
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:28,250
I've drank two in one and I got to Piss
like a horse and I can hold this shit in

2731
02:04:28,251 --> 02:04:32,570
for another day
so it takes a strong bladder to do a

2732
02:04:32,571 --> 02:04:33,404
podcast.
Jim,

2733
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:36,080
by the way,
I should just say what we're doing this.

2734
02:04:36,081 --> 02:04:38,880
One of the reasons why I really got into
on a podcast,

2735
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:42,450
there's a bunch of them,
a opie and anthony were a big one,

2736
02:04:42,451 --> 02:04:44,790
but you're fucking show was a big one
man.

2737
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:47,970
When I did your show and we did it at
that joke place,

2738
02:04:47,971 --> 02:04:50,400
that joke place on Ventura Boulevard
member.

2739
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:54,720
You were in La and you were in town and
I had done your show like calling in

2740
02:04:54,721 --> 02:04:55,890
before,
but I'd never like.

2741
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:56,970
We've never done together.
I was like,

2742
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,940
this is so fucking fun.
Just hanging.

2743
02:05:00,050 --> 02:05:03,560
Well,
what I loved about that one too is you.

2744
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:07,180
It what that thing allowed me to do is
believe,

2745
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:08,620
believing,
not thought provoking.

2746
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:13,010
Let other people to one that to me,
one of the greatest moments ever was you

2747
02:05:13,011 --> 02:05:17,750
called in and we wrote,
we were all sitting there and I fuck

2748
02:05:17,830 --> 02:05:20,150
you.
Went into this whole thing of these are

2749
02:05:20,151 --> 02:05:25,040
the Times of truth and this and that and
I think you spoke for 45 minutes

2750
02:05:25,041 --> 02:05:27,490
straight and I just kept looking.
Everyone going,

2751
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:30,290
don't just let them go.
This is,

2752
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:32,120
this is,
this is fascinating.

2753
02:05:32,121 --> 02:05:34,550
Let him go,
where else can you have this?

2754
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:40,030
And one of my guys made like this whole
pink floyd music and he put it on the

2755
02:05:40,161 --> 02:05:40,821
air.
I said,

2756
02:05:40,821 --> 02:05:44,100
you've got to get that in the Internet
and I think I remember calling your

2757
02:05:44,150 --> 02:05:48,560
telling you go and show this is.
That was the most fascinating thing ever

2758
02:05:48,561 --> 02:05:49,394
heard in my life.

2759
02:05:50,270 --> 02:05:52,670
So I thought I was going to die,
but it doesn't.

2760
02:05:52,940 --> 02:05:57,940
I'm sure you are,
but you never were allowed to even think

2761
02:05:58,161 --> 02:06:01,030
like that on radio.
And one of the things you said too,

2762
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:04,580
it's my favorite part was uh,
and again I end up fear in it because I

2763
02:06:04,581 --> 02:06:07,280
didn't want people thinking it was our
opening song,

2764
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:10,340
which just explained,
it was just four of us.

2765
02:06:10,341 --> 02:06:11,380
We came out to,
uh,

2766
02:06:11,390 --> 02:06:12,830
get musicians that you came and you're
like,

2767
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:15,230
drill.
That is the,

2768
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:19,040
that is the greatest theme song I've
ever heard in my life.

2769
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:20,210
And I was like,
really?

2770
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:21,770
Yeah.
What was you,

2771
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:25,610
what was me and the guys?
And we were just really just talking and

2772
02:06:25,611 --> 02:06:26,630
we've ripped it.
And I said,

2773
02:06:26,631 --> 02:06:28,730
don't even don't even change it.
Let's just do that.

2774
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,770
It was perfect.
It was real.

2775
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,650
Yes.
And then I knew I,

2776
02:06:34,070 --> 02:06:37,090
I knew when I heard you,
you,

2777
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:40,640
you have,
you need to be in this world.

2778
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:41,640
It's great to.
It's,

2779
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:46,100
it's great to have you in this world.
It's refreshing.

2780
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:48,740
It's thought provoking.
It's powerful.

2781
02:06:49,330 --> 02:06:50,240
It's.
I love it,

2782
02:06:50,241 --> 02:06:51,320
man.
I'm very,

2783
02:06:51,321 --> 02:06:53,150
very.
I love it.

2784
02:06:53,590 --> 02:06:53,981
Yeah.
Well,

2785
02:06:53,981 --> 02:06:54,820
I love it too,
man.

2786
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:58,840
It's a unique time that we can,
we can have something like this.

2787
02:06:58,841 --> 02:07:01,270
And when I was on your show,
I was like,

2788
02:07:01,271 --> 02:07:02,560
man,
I need to get one of these satellite

2789
02:07:02,561 --> 02:07:04,650
radio shows.
These are the shit I didn't know that

2790
02:07:04,651 --> 02:07:07,210
there was going to be an Internet
version of that where you don't have any

2791
02:07:07,211 --> 02:07:10,600
bosses and it reaches even more people.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

2792
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,500
Who's somehow or another,
a path has been carved through the

2793
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:17,680
information highways that people have
never been on before.

2794
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,890
It's only like 10 years old.
And through that path you reach

2795
02:07:20,891 --> 02:07:23,460
everybody and it's free.
Like it's,

2796
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:26,740
it violates all the ideas of capitalism.
You don't have to pay for it.

2797
02:07:26,741 --> 02:07:31,741
It's massively successful and there's a
500,000 of them and it lives forever,

2798
02:07:33,850 --> 02:07:34,900
forever,
forever.

2799
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:37,210
So people can constantly discover a.

2800
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:39,370
Did you allegedly.
Allegedly.

2801
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:40,091
I mean,
I'm.

2802
02:07:40,091 --> 02:07:43,580
What I'm saying is like,
we might not make it an asteroid hits

2803
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:48,400
whatever until that happens,
is be nice to know that someone that's

2804
02:07:48,401 --> 02:07:50,200
never even heard of you.
Oh yeah.

2805
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:53,860
In 20 years down the road they're going,
you need to listen to this conversation.

2806
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,950
You know,
Russell brand was in there and this day

2807
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,780
did he listened to that 20 years from
now they're going,

2808
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:00,280
you know,
that makes.

2809
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:03,460
That makes a lot of sense.
That's pretty awesome.

2810
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:06,160
This is the great part of social media.
Well,

2811
02:08:06,161 --> 02:08:08,610
the grapevine,
it's also that it's all free and that

2812
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:11,470
they're all available.
You can get 800 plus episodes of this

2813
02:08:11,471 --> 02:08:13,870
thing anytime you want it and when
things are free,

2814
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:18,280
you can be more honest and more
passionate about what you put out there

2815
02:08:18,281 --> 02:08:20,970
because no one's paying you to say,
well,

2816
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:23,500
did you ever get any pressure when you
were doing the satellite show that ever?

2817
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:24,750
Did anybody ever come to you and go
ahead,

2818
02:08:24,751 --> 02:08:25,261
Jim,
you know,

2819
02:08:25,261 --> 02:08:26,890
we're,
we listen to that show and you guys are.

2820
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:29,440
You got to tone it down.
Never.

2821
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:32,530
That's amazing.
Never say never.

2822
02:08:32,531 --> 02:08:33,161
Never,
never,

2823
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:34,900
never.
Because opie and Anthony got suspended a

2824
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:37,060
couple of times.
Even from satellite radio.

2825
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:40,270
They were getting A.
First of all,

2826
02:08:40,271 --> 02:08:42,400
they were getting a lot of commercial
money.

2827
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:43,690
Yup.
Yup.

2828
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:48,930
That's certainly where they rubbed the
wrong side of the madness.

2829
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:52,810
You know,
it was all over Fox News.

2830
02:08:52,811 --> 02:08:54,270
Look,
you go to,

2831
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,080
well,
they were kind of compromised in some

2832
02:08:56,081 --> 02:08:59,470
sort of a weird way whether they want it
to be or not because they were making a

2833
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:03,190
fuck load of money and as soon as a
company is paying you x amount of money

2834
02:09:03,191 --> 02:09:06,380
every year and they get upset about
something or they feel it,

2835
02:09:06,381 --> 02:09:09,550
feel like the Rav advertising revenue is
going to dry up because you guys said

2836
02:09:09,551 --> 02:09:12,070
something crazy like,
you remember when they had that homeless

2837
02:09:12,071 --> 02:09:15,070
guy on who said some crazy shit about
Condoleezza Rice?

2838
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,440
No.
Yeah,

2839
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:18,550
they,
they got suspended for like a year or

2840
02:09:18,551 --> 02:09:20,650
like a month or something like that.
They had,

2841
02:09:20,651 --> 02:09:21,870
uh,
some might be a week.

2842
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:23,730
I'm making up numbers.
They um,

2843
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:27,610
had some homeless guy on it came on and
said he wanted a rape Condoleeza Rice or

2844
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:28,860
something and they,
you know,

2845
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:31,840
like what the fuck.
And they just had some crazy guy off the

2846
02:09:31,841 --> 02:09:36,080
street and he talked to all kinds of
crazy nonsense and he left and you know,

2847
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:38,980
it's all alive.
So it's nothing you could do about it.

2848
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:40,240
This guy in the air,
I mean,

2849
02:09:40,241 --> 02:09:42,170
what the fuck are they going to do it
lp?

2850
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:44,320
Didn't say it.
Anthony didn't say Norton didn't say it,

2851
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:48,580
but because it was on their show,
they pulled the show and it was probably

2852
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:52,240
because of political pressure or pull up
pressure from the Bush administration.

2853
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:55,120
This is also coincidentally during the
time where,

2854
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:57,700
I mean Howard Stern,
it was just after the time of Howard

2855
02:09:57,701 --> 02:10:00,820
stern getting sued over and over again
by the government.

2856
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:03,520
Remember they would.
They would give these massive lawsuits

2857
02:10:03,521 --> 02:10:06,280
and that drove him to satellite radio.
Right,

2858
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:08,410
and even in satellite radio they weren't
safe,

2859
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:10,720
so even in satellite radio he moved to
satellite radio.

2860
02:10:10,721 --> 02:10:14,140
He moved to Sirius Xm at the time,
I think it was before the merge of

2861
02:10:14,141 --> 02:10:17,290
Sirius Xm or maybe right afterwards,
but either way they.

2862
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:21,730
They weren't free.
Even under the banner of this free thing

2863
02:10:21,731 --> 02:10:25,270
on satellite radio.
The political machine still had

2864
02:10:25,271 --> 02:10:26,800
influence.
Yeah.

2865
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:28,450
We'd never.
We never were told,

2866
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:30,670
don't say this amazing.
Don't do that.

2867
02:10:30,730 --> 02:10:33,410
Because you had some wild fucking shows
they would do.

2868
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:34,010
They would

2869
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,611
go,
hey,

2870
02:10:34,611 --> 02:10:37,340
lisinopril ratings time.
It looks good.

2871
02:10:37,341 --> 02:10:42,341
If you guys were to come up with a
biggie kind of entertaining show that

2872
02:10:42,430 --> 02:10:46,670
would like that we can get out there.
And the uh,

2873
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:49,700
did you get to choose guests?
Um,

2874
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:52,040
yeah.
They want to get.

2875
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:53,660
They weren't running to us.
Trust me.

2876
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:57,730
You get to veto anybody usually I
couldn't tell you who it was.

2877
02:10:57,731 --> 02:10:59,620
A million guys suck.
I don't know anything about this guy.

2878
02:10:59,630 --> 02:11:01,700
I want to talk to them.
What am I getting out of that?

2879
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:04,730
So they bring the politician.
I'm just going to be a dick.

2880
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:05,661
Yeah.
See,

2881
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:09,020
that's a beautiful thing about the time
that you were involved in it too because

2882
02:11:09,021 --> 02:11:11,870
you were involved in it.
Back when I was on fear factor because

2883
02:11:11,871 --> 02:11:14,390
the stunt guys fucking loved your show
man.

2884
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:16,850
There was a,
I had to do this thing where I got in

2885
02:11:16,851 --> 02:11:17,270
the truck.

2886
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:20,750
We had to drive to some location,
was hanging out with the stunt guys and

2887
02:11:20,751 --> 02:11:25,190
they were playing your show when it was
on raw dog and they loved it and they

2888
02:11:25,191 --> 02:11:26,001
were like,
dude,

2889
02:11:26,001 --> 02:11:30,620
brewers show is the fucking best.
And it was really wild and raw and I was

2890
02:11:30,621 --> 02:11:33,230
like,
you maybe couldn't even do that today.

2891
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:37,550
Well those are my best friends growing
up and my best friends was Jimmy Shaka

2892
02:11:37,551 --> 02:11:41,960
who was deep and we would have these
conversations for hours.

2893
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:46,100
And it really bothered me that there was
no outlet for this anywhere.

2894
02:11:46,101 --> 02:11:49,430
You had to be a freak or widow,
a hippie or or whatever.

2895
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:54,230
And then I had another best friend on
there who works for Fedex.

2896
02:11:54,231 --> 02:11:56,390
He was,
he had the blue collar.

2897
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:59,780
He stuck in that blue collar
neighborhood.

2898
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:05,150
Little Ray says,
but he won't really just two years and

2899
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:06,680
and the nucleus.

2900
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:10,460
And then you had core Yeley who's just,
he'll say whatever he was,

2901
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:13,370
he'll,
he'll just go and say whatever and do

2902
02:12:13,371 --> 02:12:16,280
whatever.
So it was great to have all these

2903
02:12:16,281 --> 02:12:18,530
different views,
honest views.

2904
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:21,770
And if some days we just fit in.
The big rule was no news,

2905
02:12:22,010 --> 02:12:25,100
no pop culture.
If you bring pop culture on the show,

2906
02:12:25,101 --> 02:12:28,370
your route with were antipop culture.
You're out,

2907
02:12:28,371 --> 02:12:30,080
you're fired.
Get that name,

2908
02:12:30,081 --> 02:12:32,270
your band forever.
Less beautiful.

2909
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:34,270
And a lot of ways.
But it was saying too,

2910
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:38,530
it's just as a hang.
I was trying to get it back to tribal is

2911
02:12:38,531 --> 02:12:41,300
whatever.
At the end of the day isn't some of the

2912
02:12:41,301 --> 02:12:45,440
best times you have conversations like
these or when you're with the people you

2913
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:47,650
trust the most.
That could be the kid you grew up with.

2914
02:12:47,651 --> 02:12:48,940
It could be.
Can Be anyone,

2915
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:51,950
a family member,
someone you just met and you're just

2916
02:12:51,951 --> 02:12:53,210
hanging out at the end of the night.

2917
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:55,610
You don't care if this one's dylan or
that window.

2918
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:58,370
You're just hanging out.
There's a fire,

2919
02:12:58,371 --> 02:12:59,390
you're talking.
At the end of the day,

2920
02:12:59,391 --> 02:13:01,280
it's all the same shit.
What's out there?

2921
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:03,650
Who really knows?
What's this?

2922
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:07,160
Who really fucking knows?
Let's talk about and try to figure out

2923
02:13:07,161 --> 02:13:08,870
for three hours and what we get out of
it.

2924
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:13,280
Poor.
Really fucking know it's time for bed,

2925
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:16,460
but kids get now you have six hours,
but if feel great that you're all doing

2926
02:13:16,461 --> 02:13:19,490
it together.
You trust each other.

2927
02:13:19,590 --> 02:13:21,200
I'm not.
Am I crazy for saying this?

2928
02:13:21,201 --> 02:13:22,910
I might be.
He'll tell me,

2929
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:24,170
dude,
you fucking crazy.

2930
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:26,990
Why would you say that's stupid?
That's stupid.

2931
02:13:26,991 --> 02:13:31,890
Why is that stupid and just that that
was pretty with each other and

2932
02:13:32,030 --> 02:13:35,160
they make more sense that way.
If I trust you and your instincts in

2933
02:13:35,161 --> 02:13:37,230
your mind that I'll tell you something
that I believe in you,

2934
02:13:37,530 --> 02:13:39,000
you refused it and they'll go,
oh,

2935
02:13:39,001 --> 02:13:40,530
okay.
I have to consider his point of view

2936
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:43,380
because if I trust your point of view
and your point of view differs from

2937
02:13:43,381 --> 02:13:45,040
mine,
well how did he come to this conclusion

2938
02:13:45,041 --> 02:13:48,510
and why is it so different than my own?
And by absorbing a bunch of different

2939
02:13:48,511 --> 02:13:50,610
points of view like that,
it gives you a much more nuanced

2940
02:13:50,611 --> 02:13:53,460
perspective of this existence and you
have to be open.

2941
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:57,420
I'm not out to win the conversation on
just we're just here to learn from it

2942
02:13:57,421 --> 02:13:58,530
more.
That's important.

2943
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:00,680
People have to be open with that and I
think we're.

2944
02:14:00,681 --> 02:14:04,500
We've all been guilty of not being open
to that before wanting to be right,

2945
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:07,380
but it's important to not just embrace
being wrong,

2946
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:09,870
but try to understand why you were
wrong.

2947
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:13,620
Trying to understand like what it was
and not be connected in some weird ego

2948
02:14:13,621 --> 02:14:17,100
way to your ideas.
It's hard to get just a joe fuck yeah,

2949
02:14:17,101 --> 02:14:18,900
but it's like all those other things
that we're talking about.

2950
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:21,360
I mean like you saying that you have
this,

2951
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:26,100
this,
this gravitation towards a expelling all

2952
02:14:26,101 --> 02:14:29,550
of these ridiculous notions that
everybody is just sort of accepted as

2953
02:14:29,551 --> 02:14:32,940
fact and truth and trying to connect
with a much more spiritual as well.

2954
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:36,480
That means you've got to think about and
it's got to be a conscious thing and the

2955
02:14:36,481 --> 02:14:41,481
same thing with not holding onto your
ideas and not being married to them and

2956
02:14:41,551 --> 02:14:45,720
not not being invested in being correct
or incorrect,

2957
02:14:45,721 --> 02:14:49,170
but just sort of accepting them as just
ideas and be able to go,

2958
02:14:49,171 --> 02:14:50,010
yeah,
I think you're right.

2959
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:52,380
Why was I thinking that?
And that's hard for people to do.

2960
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:57,500
I know this is stupid,
but I saw a statement was in someone

2961
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:01,650
went and it was a tourist spot,
but I pass the tourist spot and went in

2962
02:15:01,651 --> 02:15:02,484
the house

2963
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:06,410
and there was a statement in there and I
know it just.

2964
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:08,790
It's simple,
but it just blew my mind.

2965
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:13,810
It said one person could change the
whole world for a better as long as they

2966
02:15:14,911 --> 02:15:19,911
don't give a damn who gets that credit
and that and I,

2967
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:22,830
and I thought like,
if you really don't,

2968
02:15:22,831 --> 02:15:26,280
if you just want to sit back,
you just want to see things better and

2969
02:15:26,281 --> 02:15:29,940
you really can change for the better,
but you don't have to worry about going,

2970
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:33,210
you know,
so and so said that or someone so set

2971
02:15:33,211 --> 02:15:36,420
that up was so and so did that because
now you're doing it for different

2972
02:15:36,421 --> 02:15:37,254
reasons.

2973
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:40,510
Yeah.
I never had that before.

2974
02:15:40,511 --> 02:15:44,660
I'd never heard that before until like
yesterday I saw like I saw that quote

2975
02:15:44,661 --> 02:15:45,080
intimate.
It can.

2976
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:50,080
That's a problem that I continually have
to almost ideas.

2977
02:15:51,071 --> 02:15:55,090
And that's,
I think part of what's excellent about

2978
02:15:55,091 --> 02:16:00,091
this medium and particularly the way
it's been executed by you look,

2979
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:03,700
is that it's,
it's discourse,

2980
02:16:03,790 --> 02:16:04,930
you know,
let these kind of things.

2981
02:16:04,931 --> 02:16:05,590
Not really,
you know,

2982
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:09,000
like you said,
the fast moving fast cut sound bite tv,

2983
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:12,490
just bombarding with an artillery of
mostly erroneous information.

2984
02:16:12,491 --> 02:16:14,860
You don't get to people here.
People our,

2985
02:16:14,861 --> 02:16:18,850
after our talk in examining this
guarding as you said,

2986
02:16:18,851 --> 02:16:21,190
who really knows and returning to that
point,

2987
02:16:21,191 --> 02:16:23,560
it's sort of,
it's sort of encouraging because I've

2988
02:16:23,561 --> 02:16:24,910
had like,
you know,

2989
02:16:24,911 --> 02:16:27,760
like as I like,
I've always felt like an I don't like

2990
02:16:27,761 --> 02:16:30,190
agree with like a bill o'reilly

2991
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:32,890
or Sean Hannity or those guys.
I've always kind fall apart.

2992
02:16:32,930 --> 02:16:35,080
I think they were right if I hung out
with.

2993
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,660
There's something about Bill O'Reilly
Camacho carve.

2994
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:39,690
Oh,
come on.

2995
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:42,580
Like I think,
I think he was kind of okay.

2996
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,940
I think you would joke around with them
and you guys probably start laughing

2997
02:16:45,941 --> 02:16:48,610
about some things and that's kind of a
reassuring thing,

2998
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:52,060
isn't it?
And to not be kind of like once you get

2999
02:16:52,061 --> 02:16:54,310
a Ta,
like I think that's what's kind of ugly

3000
02:16:54,311 --> 02:16:58,780
about both liberalism and neoliberalism
is you can see it as people just forcing

3001
02:16:58,781 --> 02:17:02,230
their idea and they've lost touch with.
And I do it all the fucking time.

3002
02:17:02,231 --> 02:17:03,940
Yeah.
Let's start with what is it that we're

3003
02:17:03,941 --> 02:17:06,610
genuinely here for.
And that thing you said of like you can

3004
02:17:06,611 --> 02:17:09,790
change the world if you know no one.
Like if you're willing to do,

3005
02:17:09,791 --> 02:17:11,320
if no one knowing about it,
that's like,

3006
02:17:11,350 --> 02:17:12,040
ah,
the,

3007
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,410
the,
the pangs I feel in my gut shows me how

3008
02:17:14,411 --> 02:17:16,930
much my ego is still involved in the
shit I do.

3009
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:19,150
Discourse.
I just saw it.

3010
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:23,470
I didn't say it,
but the lack of discourse,

3011
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:26,860
like what we were talking about being
one of the more important things about

3012
02:17:26,861 --> 02:17:29,260
podcasts or one of the best things about
podcasts.

3013
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:30,271
I mean,
I,

3014
02:17:30,271 --> 02:17:32,170
I'm,
I'm really hoping that that's the trend

3015
02:17:32,171 --> 02:17:34,060
of the future,
that people understand that there's,

3016
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:38,270
this might not be a right way or a wrong
way to do a lot of these things and that

3017
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:41,170
your point of view,
whether you strongly believe it or not

3018
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:43,570
might not really work for the way I see
the world.

3019
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:46,210
It doesn't mean that your right or I'm
wrong or it doesn't.

3020
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:48,730
It doesn't.
I mean there's some certain truths like,

3021
02:17:48,731 --> 02:17:49,630
Hey,
don't rape people.

3022
02:17:49,631 --> 02:17:50,500
Hey,
don't murder people.

3023
02:17:50,501 --> 02:17:53,620
Those things are obvious,
but there's some other things that

3024
02:17:53,621 --> 02:17:54,670
aren't obvious.
You know,

3025
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:55,630
there's other things.
Rob,

3026
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:57,910
not obvious,
like maybe you shouldn't hurt people's

3027
02:17:57,911 --> 02:17:58,240
feelings.

3028
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:00,760
Something.
Maybe you should them because what

3029
02:18:00,761 --> 02:18:03,100
they're doing is preposterous and in
hurting their feelings,

3030
02:18:03,101 --> 02:18:07,210
you actually elevate all of us to
realize the humor in their folly and I'm

3031
02:18:07,211 --> 02:18:09,940
a big fan of folly.
I enjoy human folly.

3032
02:18:09,941 --> 02:18:11,650
It's one of the things I enjoy most
about humans.

3033
02:18:11,651 --> 02:18:14,590
I'm the quickest to make fun of my own
self,

3034
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:17,680
so if I can't make fun of them,
what kind of a fucking goofy ass world

3035
02:18:17,681 --> 02:18:20,530
that we run and we run into some super
sensitive world where everyone's a

3036
02:18:20,531 --> 02:18:22,750
perfect snowflake and we can't shit on
them.

3037
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:24,910
Like nonsense.
You need humility.

3038
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:29,230
Humility is also.
Humor is really important to unpackage

3039
02:18:29,231 --> 02:18:32,680
things like because there was a lot of
things that are going on right now in

3040
02:18:32,681 --> 02:18:36,010
this world that are a little fucking
weird and one of the reasons why they're

3041
02:18:36,011 --> 02:18:39,010
weird is because humor hasn't had a
chance to dissect them.

3042
02:18:39,190 --> 02:18:43,510
Wow.
I think that A.

3043
02:18:43,510 --> 02:18:48,510
Please talking about comedy and he said
that people talk about like the people

3044
02:18:48,581 --> 02:18:52,300
are very and humor because they know
it's powerful and they often use the

3045
02:18:52,301 --> 02:18:53,890
idea that tell,
don't talk,

3046
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,030
don't,
don't joke around.

3047
02:18:55,031 --> 02:18:58,430
This is serious.
Supposed to joke around about things

3048
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:01,450
serious and he they have mistaken
seriousness for solemnity,

3049
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:03,460
you know,
there's no reason they want to be all

3050
02:19:03,461 --> 02:19:06,610
solid about stuff because they know it
prevents people that have got that

3051
02:19:06,611 --> 02:19:09,520
comedic switchblade from getting into
the argument.

3052
02:19:09,521 --> 02:19:13,890
We can exactly taking that seriously.
I'm not playing by those rules and

3053
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:18,780
they've also taken away your special
power special power habit.

3054
02:19:18,930 --> 02:19:21,010
This special power.
Both of you guys have it like they don't

3055
02:19:21,011 --> 02:19:24,310
have it,
so if you come in and you deflate their

3056
02:19:24,311 --> 02:19:26,220
argument with a quick switchblade,
oh,

3057
02:19:26,310 --> 02:19:28,100
a piece of shit while you're joking
around

3058
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:31,010
about something really important,
maybe your white privilege is showing.

3059
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:35,050
Maybe you should consider the fact that
your humor is offensive to people and

3060
02:19:35,110 --> 02:19:37,580
what you're doing.
It's bullshit and it's not helping.

3061
02:19:37,581 --> 02:19:40,660
It's very regressive.
Trying to

3062
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:47,530
stitch it into political.
One of the real problems with the left

3063
02:19:48,741 --> 02:19:52,400
and especially the regressive left and
the PR people that think that they're

3064
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:55,790
going to change things,
they're fucking unbelievably mean when

3065
02:19:55,791 --> 02:19:58,820
they're mocking the right.
Like you're talking about compassion,

3066
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:02,090
like I've seen some of the most,
the least compassion,

3067
02:20:02,091 --> 02:20:04,400
meanest,
angriest shit come out of people that

3068
02:20:04,401 --> 02:20:08,600
consider themselves to be liberal and
progressive and their ideas to close

3069
02:20:08,601 --> 02:20:12,650
down discourse where they're going to do
is going to shit on you and insult you

3070
02:20:12,651 --> 02:20:17,120
and then gang up and some sort of a
weird bully pulpit to attack all the

3071
02:20:17,121 --> 02:20:18,110
people that don't agree with them.

3072
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:21,000
We're not going involved in politics in
my country doing that thing.

3073
02:20:21,001 --> 02:20:26,001
The truth,
the most number of book as well called

3074
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:28,210
Revolution.
And in that book I talked about it.

3075
02:20:28,330 --> 02:20:32,310
It was basically a book those meant to
be for younger people and it was like,

3076
02:20:32,311 --> 02:20:35,280
this is my perspective on why I don't
believe in this stuff and why I believe

3077
02:20:35,281 --> 02:20:35,911
in this.
And it was really,

3078
02:20:35,911 --> 02:20:36,930
you know,
it was relatively simple.

3079
02:20:36,931 --> 02:20:39,330
And again,
I'm like a self taught person.

3080
02:20:39,331 --> 02:20:41,520
So it's not a book by fucking academic,
right?

3081
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:45,630
The worst vitriol and their worst
condemnation came from the kind of

3082
02:20:45,631 --> 02:20:49,830
newspapers and liberal organizations
that would think would be supportive of

3083
02:20:49,831 --> 02:20:51,900
such.
Like it's good that he's guy from the

3084
02:20:51,901 --> 02:20:55,260
world of popular entertainment who's not
a classically educated.

3085
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:56,970
It's trying to do that.
No,

3086
02:20:57,090 --> 02:20:59,610
they came in,
they came in like get the fuck out of

3087
02:20:59,660 --> 02:20:59,900
our

3088
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:03,270
territory.
Who Do you think

3089
02:21:03,810 --> 02:21:08,430
more than any kind of like a sort of
right wing organization that they almost

3090
02:21:08,431 --> 02:21:10,130
see it has gone wrong.
Jolly good.

3091
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:12,610
Yeah.
I was really like.

3092
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:14,340
I was very.
Some people that I thought might be

3093
02:21:14,341 --> 02:21:16,020
allies,
organizations I thought might be

3094
02:21:16,021 --> 02:21:18,180
encouraging.
We're very condemnatory.

3095
02:21:18,310 --> 02:21:20,020
Well,
you going to realize the what is the

3096
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:24,130
mechanism that they're distributing this
information with?

3097
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:27,160
You know what they're doing there.
They're writing their own stories.

3098
02:21:27,161 --> 02:21:31,510
They're promoting their own blogs.
They're doing their own radio shows and

3099
02:21:31,570 --> 02:21:34,450
in fact feeding their own ego like we
were talking about before,

3100
02:21:34,750 --> 02:21:38,230
that green monster of envy that sees
this fucking guy with beautiful bone

3101
02:21:38,231 --> 02:21:42,540
structure and the beautiful accent.
Now I'm philosophizing this piece of

3102
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:45,910
shit he had.
He had the wherewithal and the power to

3103
02:21:45,911 --> 02:21:49,910
go on a sexual rampage.
Chose to back off of it and realize like

3104
02:21:49,930 --> 02:21:52,270
all these fucking goddamn things he's
got going for him.

3105
02:21:52,271 --> 02:21:54,700
He's a fucking movie star.
Fuck this guy.

3106
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:58,150
Fuck this guy.
I'm telling him I'm tearing them down,

3107
02:21:58,151 --> 02:21:59,630
honey,
and he's sitting there with his pot

3108
02:21:59,631 --> 02:22:04,631
belly fucking taken his antidepressants
and tap tapping away mean shit on the

3109
02:22:04,830 --> 02:22:09,830
keyboard hoping and hoping that these
mean words hit your mind and they enter

3110
02:22:10,661 --> 02:22:13,510
into your consciousness and he can
affect you in some sort of a horrible

3111
02:22:13,511 --> 02:22:13,870
way.

3112
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:17,470
Oh God.
The lack of extreme lack of compassion

3113
02:22:17,471 --> 02:22:22,471
from some people on the left and the
green light to attack this fact that,

3114
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:24,730
oh,
here's this guy and I don't agree with

3115
02:22:24,731 --> 02:22:29,731
him and I think that what he's doing is
sexist and it's massage and nearest dick

3116
02:22:29,911 --> 02:22:32,450
and it's enabling and let's get them.
Well,

3117
02:22:32,451 --> 02:22:34,680
you got to fucking target right on his
back attack.

3118
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:36,570
Oh,
he's doing press.

3119
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:37,561
Oh,
well,

3120
02:22:37,561 --> 02:22:40,230
I'm going to be involved in this press.
I don't know.

3121
02:22:40,231 --> 02:22:45,231
Throw my hat into the ring as the
arbiter of intelligent ideas to dismay

3122
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:49,830
or dismantle rather all these fucking
stupid thoughts at this shit head with

3123
02:22:49,831 --> 02:22:52,280
his perfect bone structure and men bonds
pumping out.

3124
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,780
Fuck him.
Fuck him.

3125
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,650
Professional wrestling,
you know,

3126
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:58,420
professional wrestling.
Well,

3127
02:22:58,800 --> 02:22:59,580
people,
man,

3128
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:03,900
people jockeying for their own little
fucking shining moment in the darkness.

3129
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:05,300
Pizza Front.
See,

3130
02:23:05,301 --> 02:23:07,110
I go conspiracy pizza front,
right?

3131
02:23:07,111 --> 02:23:09,240
Here's what our magazines and bend.
So yours.

3132
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:12,130
Is it conspiracy?
It's just a thought.

3133
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:16,410
Why does it have to be cold conspiracy?
I think the word conspiracy is a

3134
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:21,411
conspiracy
conspiracy best at this through the

3135
02:23:26,911 --> 02:23:30,060
looking glass.
Now conspiracy in itself is a

3136
02:23:30,061 --> 02:23:32,070
conspiracy.
Him.

3137
02:23:32,071 --> 02:23:33,330
He's fucking shut it all down.

3138
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:37,030
Yeah.
Um,

3139
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:39,810
I mean there's definitely some real
conspiracies,

3140
02:23:39,930 --> 02:23:43,050
but uh,
I think that there's just an unnatural

3141
02:23:43,230 --> 02:23:47,040
emphasis of our natural inclination to
Shit on people that are doing better

3142
02:23:47,041 --> 02:23:49,020
than you are.
Shit on people that have something good

3143
02:23:49,021 --> 02:23:51,150
going on.
And also when you're writing a story

3144
02:23:51,151 --> 02:23:53,940
about something w,
how much fun is it running a story

3145
02:23:53,941 --> 02:23:58,890
that's positive and how much more
satisfying is it to unhappy people to

3146
02:23:58,891 --> 02:24:02,070
write a negative review about something
so much more exciting?

3147
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:05,700
It's much more fun.
I've seen people distort people's ideas

3148
02:24:05,701 --> 02:24:09,450
and really horrific ways because that's
the old way because the old way you

3149
02:24:09,451 --> 02:24:12,480
could write a blog about something or an
article in a magazine or whatever about

3150
02:24:12,481 --> 02:24:15,300
someone and distort it in horrible ways
and they really didn't have any

3151
02:24:15,301 --> 02:24:18,450
recourse,
but that old way doesn't really work

3152
02:24:18,451 --> 02:24:22,210
anymore because it's direct access
because of media like this.

3153
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,600
Sure.
So I'm thinking that I would like to

3154
02:24:24,601 --> 02:24:27,440
start a podcast.
I'm thinking you should definitely have

3155
02:24:27,441 --> 02:24:30,510
never done a podcast in my games.
They went in my country.

3156
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:32,340
Oh my gosh.
You can do it anywhere you go.

3157
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,680
Do whatever you want.
Yeah,

3158
02:24:33,740 --> 02:24:36,780
you can bring them whenever you want.
I might have done them in Australia.

3159
02:24:36,781 --> 02:24:37,780
I've done them all over the world.
You,

3160
02:24:37,781 --> 02:24:40,050
you do it anywhere you want.
All you have to have a phone.

3161
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:42,330
You do it into your iphone.
Exactly.

3162
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:45,570
I just talk on my phone.
I just talk on my phone.

3163
02:24:45,571 --> 02:24:46,560
I like it.
You dumping that.

3164
02:24:46,561 --> 02:24:48,840
You don't have to edit.
You know it's on your phone,

3165
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:50,880
your podcasts on your phone,
dude.

3166
02:24:50,881 --> 02:24:52,690
Your design,
your desire.

3167
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:54,330
You are.
And not only that,

3168
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:57,100
you don't even have to have a guest you
want,

3169
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:00,000
but you don't.
You could have a guest on if you want,

3170
02:25:00,001 --> 02:25:02,310
but like bill burrs,
one of the best podcasts in the world,

3171
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:04,680
and Bill Burgess rants,
unbelievable.

3172
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:07,620
He rants for like,
he'll just sit down for a fucking hour

3173
02:25:07,621 --> 02:25:10,140
and a half and just go off about this
and that.

3174
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:14,070
And it's a stream of consciousness.
So it goes from football to his wife or

3175
02:25:14,071 --> 02:25:17,490
his fucking dog and baking and his
internet socks and he's tired of

3176
02:25:17,610 --> 02:25:21,000
construction workers and his driveway is
a piece of shit and he just,

3177
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:22,850
he'll go on and on and on.
And you can do that too.

3178
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:25,390
What main things you've learned from
doing this?

3179
02:25:25,391 --> 02:25:26,650
What are the main things you think?
Right?

3180
02:25:26,651 --> 02:25:31,540
This is how you do a podcast.
One of the things that the rules,

3181
02:25:31,541 --> 02:25:33,910
the structures that you have learned,
man,

3182
02:25:34,340 --> 02:25:35,270
that's,
there's almost.

3183
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:40,000
I've learned so much.
I've learned how other people perceive

3184
02:25:40,001 --> 02:25:41,950
me.
I've learned how I perceive other

3185
02:25:41,951 --> 02:25:43,390
people.
I've learned what my,

3186
02:25:43,391 --> 02:25:45,640
maybe my own problems and perception
are.

3187
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:46,810
I've,
uh,

3188
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:49,060
I've sort of tried to examine as many
things as possible.

3189
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:51,790
It's a master course in human
interaction for me.

3190
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:55,460
That's what I've thought of it.
I mean I've had 800 plus podcasts where

3191
02:25:55,461 --> 02:25:58,120
I'm interacting with all sorts of
different people.

3192
02:25:58,121 --> 02:26:02,980
So it's um,
it's a fascinating way to understand how

3193
02:26:02,981 --> 02:26:07,981
people think and to just chunk data,
just chunk data about how people react

3194
02:26:08,021 --> 02:26:11,800
and talk and communicate.
How has it evolved from your original

3195
02:26:11,830 --> 02:26:15,130
vision of doing a hook costing to how it
is now?

3196
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:18,580
If you become more free with it?
Less formulated?

3197
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:20,860
Well,
I don't think it was ever formulated,

3198
02:26:20,861 --> 02:26:22,780
but I've been better at it.
I'm just better at it.

3199
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:24,880
But the,
when the podcast started out,

3200
02:26:24,881 --> 02:26:27,520
it was just,
I just wanted to figure out a way to do

3201
02:26:27,521 --> 02:26:32,521
something like something free where
you're just doing it with a camera or

3202
02:26:33,701 --> 02:26:36,700
you're responding to twitter questions
or to trying to out.

3203
02:26:36,730 --> 02:26:40,450
My thought was I've done a bunch of
radio shows everywhere I go everywhere I

3204
02:26:40,451 --> 02:26:41,860
go and promote a comedy gig.

3205
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:43,510
I do a morning show.
I had a great time.

3206
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:44,920
Gosh,
I would love to do one of those,

3207
02:26:45,010 --> 02:26:46,990
but that was so much fun.
I would love a radio show,

3208
02:26:46,991 --> 02:26:49,720
but I don't want a boss and that was
trying to figure out how the fuck can I

3209
02:26:49,721 --> 02:26:52,330
do this?
And then doing Jim's show and doing the

3210
02:26:52,331 --> 02:26:53,870
opiod,
Anthony Show opiod,

3211
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:56,650
not it was the greatest.
It was the greatest because when they

3212
02:26:56,651 --> 02:26:58,970
were together,
their show was a hang on.

3213
02:26:59,470 --> 02:27:01,660
If I could call Jim and I'd go,
Hey,

3214
02:27:01,661 --> 02:27:03,190
uh,
I'm doing opie and Anthony tomorrow

3215
02:27:03,191 --> 02:27:03,641
morning.
He's like,

3216
02:27:03,641 --> 02:27:04,660
fuck,
I'm doing it too.

3217
02:27:04,810 --> 02:27:05,371
Like,
oh,

3218
02:27:05,371 --> 02:27:07,660
it's going to be so much fun.
And we would see each other and get a

3219
02:27:07,661 --> 02:27:11,560
Bagel in the morning and high five and
go up there and just laugh.

3220
02:27:11,770 --> 02:27:13,660
Right.
And you're able to do your own thing.

3221
02:27:13,661 --> 02:27:15,130
No one's trying to out,
you know,

3222
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:15,520
it.

3223
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:18,490
It was.
That place taught me everything.

3224
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:22,300
I was hoping it was a hanging.
That was the original Shang.

3225
02:27:22,301 --> 02:27:23,710
I'd never heard anything like that.
Yeah,

3226
02:27:23,730 --> 02:27:26,260
it was the only radio show that was a
real hang where you go in there and

3227
02:27:26,261 --> 02:27:29,350
everyone's just hanging out.
And then Jim started doing his show,

3228
02:27:29,351 --> 02:27:31,300
which is very similar when I could get
to you,

3229
02:27:31,301 --> 02:27:32,560
you,
your show was a hang too.

3230
02:27:32,590 --> 02:27:34,750
It was a hand because I wanted that
model.

3231
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:38,710
I loved going into Opie and Anthony and
just sitting down and they're like,

3232
02:27:38,711 --> 02:27:41,080
what's up night?
You didn't have to be on.

3233
02:27:41,150 --> 02:27:41,621
Yeah,
they didn't.

3234
02:27:41,621 --> 02:27:44,940
Like if you did bits come in and do a
bit,

3235
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:46,540
a bit.
Don't do a bit.

3236
02:27:46,541 --> 02:27:47,610
Just talk.
Yeah.

3237
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:52,580
We want to know that that goes probably
what you went through to get where you

3238
02:27:52,581 --> 02:27:55,810
can say Russell authenticity about
being,

3239
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:59,130
trying to be in normal and being who you
are.

3240
02:27:59,190 --> 02:28:00,490
Yeah.
No imposing.

3241
02:28:00,510 --> 02:28:02,200
Like come in and write up in five
seconds.

3242
02:28:02,201 --> 02:28:05,120
We got lucky with all of those things
like having a boss and having structure

3243
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:10,140
and having that commercial interests
constantly and you're an intelligent

3244
02:28:10,361 --> 02:28:14,800
person and people like listening to the
real you and you don't get that

3245
02:28:14,801 --> 02:28:18,010
opportunity a whole lot.
They gave you that opportunity like,

3246
02:28:18,011 --> 02:28:19,420
Whoa,
this is a whole different.

3247
02:28:19,421 --> 02:28:22,460
I never knew this existed from this
person.

3248
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:26,300
I don't like this person's calm.
I'm sure people hate my book.

3249
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:29,900
And I thought,
but I like what he's like when he talks

3250
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:32,030
real,
so that opens up,

3251
02:28:32,390 --> 02:28:34,340
it opens up the opportunity for all of
that.

3252
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:36,980
It was,
it was going to say it was like a

3253
02:28:36,981 --> 02:28:38,240
revolution.
It was pretty.

3254
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:41,330
It was pretty intense and I can see what
you mean.

3255
02:28:41,331 --> 02:28:45,300
That that was sort of pop the transition
and how it actually works as well.

3256
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:49,140
Like someone that someone that was so
pi.

3257
02:28:49,530 --> 02:28:52,730
He is absolutely the original.
He's absolutely,

3258
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,130
he's the first.
He's the most important guy in the

3259
02:28:55,131 --> 02:28:59,600
history of radio because he was the
first guy that got arrested or a find

3260
02:28:59,601 --> 02:29:02,930
rather he got in some serious legal
problems because of the things that he

3261
02:29:02,931 --> 02:29:06,580
was saying on the air and kept doing it.
And he was the original guy,

3262
02:29:06,630 --> 02:29:11,630
just be blatantly honest.
And he was the first real reality show.

3263
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:15,350
He'd call his wife,
call.

3264
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:17,810
Oh the guys working on the light.
Let me talk to him.

3265
02:29:17,930 --> 02:29:19,700
Let me talk to the.
He said like he's getting took,

3266
02:29:19,890 --> 02:29:23,300
I want to talk to.
And he did all this on regular radio,

3267
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:26,060
right when no one was doing that and
everybody was playing music.

3268
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:27,910
So they were all.
They would have like these little things

3269
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:30,710
they would do and then they would play a
song and he had to do that in the

3270
02:29:30,710 --> 02:29:31,290
beginning.

3271
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:33,500
Songs,
he would make his humor in between the

3272
02:29:33,501 --> 02:29:35,780
songs but eventually was like,
fuck these songs,

3273
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:39,050
I'm just gonna I'm just going to be me
and have a good time and talk shit.

3274
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:42,290
And he figured out how to do it.
He was more rigid and structured.

3275
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:44,690
Whereas opie and Anthony,
when they would have guests on,

3276
02:29:44,691 --> 02:29:47,480
like,
like brewer and I would be on maybe

3277
02:29:47,481 --> 02:29:50,400
burwood beyond or some other people
would beyond and we'd all beyond

3278
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:54,260
together and would just go in there and
we'd hang out and it was literally like,

3279
02:29:54,261 --> 02:29:56,410
the time would fly so fast.
We.

3280
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:59,150
It wasn't a matter of not having enough
content.

3281
02:29:59,151 --> 02:30:01,370
It was like too much content,
not enough time.

3282
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:04,470
And Howard didn't have that.
It was almost like they wouldn't.

3283
02:30:04,850 --> 02:30:08,670
Howard didn't have that opportunity at
the time or he just came out in a

3284
02:30:08,671 --> 02:30:12,200
different way.
And then once he went to the Internet,

3285
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:17,590
I think that blew up to another hole at
blew him up to and everyone said,

3286
02:30:17,721 --> 02:30:18,150
hi,
you know,

3287
02:30:18,150 --> 02:30:18,650
where's he now?

3288
02:30:18,650 --> 02:30:22,190
I think he's 10 times,
hundred times bigger and more powerful.

3289
02:30:22,191 --> 02:30:25,100
And it became a.
He evolved in terms of content or do you

3290
02:30:25,101 --> 02:30:27,020
mean every for me,
everything,

3291
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:29,240
everything.
Conversation thought.

3292
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:31,160
Well,
as soon as things get on the Internet,

3293
02:30:31,161 --> 02:30:34,610
then they can spread freely.
So the merit of the conversation.

3294
02:30:34,611 --> 02:30:36,590
What's interesting about the
conversation?

3295
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:39,860
Then it just gets passed around and as
soon as things just get passed around

3296
02:30:39,861 --> 02:30:41,040
like that,
then someone calls him,

3297
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:43,160
Oh my God,
you got to hear Jim Brewer who was on

3298
02:30:43,161 --> 02:30:44,360
Howard Stern.
Holy Shit.

3299
02:30:44,361 --> 02:30:45,290
Is it funny?
If you heard it,

3300
02:30:45,291 --> 02:30:47,480
you got link and they send you a link.
And Bam.

3301
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:50,150
And the beautiful thing about podcasts
is someone can tell me,

3302
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:51,920
dude,
Russell's got a podcast.

3303
02:30:51,921 --> 02:30:52,820
You've got to check it out.
Oh,

3304
02:30:52,821 --> 02:30:55,190
let me check it out.
And then you go on your itunes to nap

3305
02:30:55,191 --> 02:30:56,220
and you go run.

3306
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:59,630
There is Bam.
And then you're playing it like in

3307
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:02,030
seconds you're in your car and you're
playing it and it's free.

3308
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:04,430
And now if I just discovered you,
I'm going to go.

3309
02:31:04,431 --> 02:31:05,800
I want to hear more.
I want to hear.

3310
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:08,660
Oh you got to listen to like one of his
first ones where he wasn't even ready.

3311
02:31:08,750 --> 02:31:11,450
He know what he was doing.
You gotta listen where it went from here

3312
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:12,770
to here.
Yeah.

3313
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:14,750
Once they're in,
they're in.

3314
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:16,190
They love you.
They know you.

3315
02:31:16,191 --> 02:31:20,670
They feel like they're all exposed will
if you add that you liked were hard or

3316
02:31:20,671 --> 02:31:21,290
like,
you know,

3317
02:31:21,290 --> 02:31:22,770
like see,
because you've not got bosses or

3318
02:31:22,771 --> 02:31:24,390
anything.
Was there ever times you are going to.

3319
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:27,040
We should never read that guy on that
was a mistake.

3320
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:30,090
A couple minor ones.
Nothing serious.

3321
02:31:31,650 --> 02:31:35,400
Just weird conversations where you just
kinda learn better about how to handle

3322
02:31:35,401 --> 02:31:36,234
those moments.

3323
02:31:36,450 --> 02:31:37,283
It's,
it's a,

3324
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:39,900
it's almost like you're learning on the
job,

3325
02:31:39,930 --> 02:31:41,910
right?
It's like I never did a radio show

3326
02:31:41,911 --> 02:31:46,320
before.
I never spoke open as a form of

3327
02:31:46,321 --> 02:31:47,880
entertainment.
Not Arrogant.

3328
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:50,040
Not just to think that you should be
able to speak.

3329
02:31:50,041 --> 02:31:51,050
I mean,
of course everyone should be able to

3330
02:31:51,051 --> 02:31:52,860
speak,
but the fact that you think that your

3331
02:31:52,861 --> 02:31:56,050
words are so interesting that other
people are gonna listen to them and

3332
02:31:56,051 --> 02:31:58,140
they're going to,
instead of talking to themselves,

3333
02:31:58,141 --> 02:32:00,390
they can just listen to your talking.
Why the fuck would they do that?

3334
02:32:00,391 --> 02:32:01,960
They're not even there.
You know,

3335
02:32:01,961 --> 02:32:04,820
like it's not like someone's right in
front of you and you're talking to me

3336
02:32:04,830 --> 02:32:06,290
trying to be polite so you'll let them
talk.

3337
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:07,100
No,
you're,

3338
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:09,840
you're,
you're downloading their shit so you can

3339
02:32:09,841 --> 02:32:12,030
listen to them talk and then you're not
gonna talk while they're talking.

3340
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:12,630
Like what?

3341
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:13,880
This is madness,
right?

3342
02:32:14,010 --> 02:32:17,700
So in learning how to broad broadcast in
air quotes,

3343
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:20,550
learning how to do that,
you kind of learning by,

3344
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:23,850
by feedback and also by listening
yourself and listening to other people's

3345
02:32:23,851 --> 02:32:26,310
podcasts,
you'll see other things that great on

3346
02:32:26,311 --> 02:32:30,480
you about what other people do.
Like talking over people.

3347
02:32:30,481 --> 02:32:31,830
That's a big one.
We all do it,

3348
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:34,650
which we all shouldn't,
but we all have an idea that we want to

3349
02:32:34,651 --> 02:32:36,930
get out and we don't know when to do it
and it's hard to figure out because

3350
02:32:36,931 --> 02:32:39,180
we're all free ball and when to jump in
and when not to.

3351
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:42,000
Also,
some people don't listen to the things

3352
02:32:42,001 --> 02:32:44,550
that other people say.
They just wait for their turn to talk.

3353
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,190
That is a real issue.
That's a giant issue because then you

3354
02:32:47,191 --> 02:32:49,200
ask them about what you just said and
they're like,

3355
02:32:49,201 --> 02:32:50,034
I wasn't listening.

3356
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:53,440
Like how can you not be listening when
we're talking like this is okay.

3357
02:32:53,441 --> 02:32:54,750
They will.
Then now we're not really having a

3358
02:32:54,751 --> 02:32:57,840
conversation.
We're just exchanging rants,

3359
02:32:58,040 --> 02:33:00,540
you know,
and I'm waiting for you to get your

3360
02:33:00,541 --> 02:33:05,340
completely nonsequitor rant in and then
you're going to impress people with your

3361
02:33:05,341 --> 02:33:07,770
quotes and home,
which you know about this guy or that

3362
02:33:07,771 --> 02:33:09,780
guy.
And that's a real common thing is like

3363
02:33:09,781 --> 02:33:14,781
using it as an ego springboard instead
of looking at it in the podcast is

3364
02:33:14,821 --> 02:33:19,821
really essentially a piece of art in a
grandiose term,

3365
02:33:19,921 --> 02:33:22,200
but you're creating something and you
want to create it.

3366
02:33:22,201 --> 02:33:25,770
The best way you can and you could fuck
it up by being loud and stupid and

3367
02:33:25,771 --> 02:33:28,730
saying a bunch of dumb shit that doesn't
feel good to anybody here.

3368
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:32,580
Or You could say some cool shit that
when they listen to this podcast,

3369
02:33:32,581 --> 02:33:33,301
after it's over,
they go,

3370
02:33:33,301 --> 02:33:36,240
fuck at Russell brand,
said something that's going to change

3371
02:33:36,241 --> 02:33:39,030
the way I look at the rest of my fucking
life and that's,

3372
02:33:39,170 --> 02:33:40,410
that's possible.

3373
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:44,250
And that's one of the bases entirely.
Like do you think then this is entirely

3374
02:33:44,251 --> 02:33:49,050
authentic self that you don't like?
Stuff that you withhold when you're in

3375
02:33:49,051 --> 02:33:51,030
this situation?
Because I've come from more conventional

3376
02:33:51,031 --> 02:33:54,720
media and information about loved ones.
That's it.

3377
02:33:54,810 --> 02:33:55,531
That's it.
I don't,

3378
02:33:55,531 --> 02:33:57,870
I don't know anything.
I don't want to hurt any.

3379
02:33:57,871 --> 02:34:01,350
I don't want anybody of anybody else's
feelings get hurt or you know,

3380
02:34:01,351 --> 02:34:05,610
things along those lines.
But I've made those mistakes smart just

3381
02:34:07,100 --> 02:34:09,140
because it's funny.
It's a funny team there.

3382
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:10,950
Yeah.
It's not their choice,

3383
02:34:11,010 --> 02:34:11,940
you know,
so you have to,

3384
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:14,660
you have to withhold certain things and
you know,

3385
02:34:14,860 --> 02:34:16,680
some people just want to be private
people.

3386
02:34:16,681 --> 02:34:18,700
They don't want to have any part of your
fucking parade.

3387
02:34:18,701 --> 02:34:21,880
You weirdo out there talking to the
world everyday.

3388
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:26,560
Have you had any.
Have you had any negative consequences

3389
02:34:26,561 --> 02:34:28,560
as a result of it?

3390
02:34:28,590 --> 02:34:30,700
Because you have to work in other
industries and all of that.

3391
02:34:30,701 --> 02:34:34,360
It's only positive.
I don't give a fuck,

3392
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:38,110
so it doesn't really matter.
If you have fuck you money,

3393
02:34:38,111 --> 02:34:40,300
you don't say fuck you,
you're wasting fuck you money.

3394
02:34:40,810 --> 02:34:44,380
So if I have some real thoughts and I
don't express them because I'm worried

3395
02:34:44,381 --> 02:34:47,080
about job opportunities like I'm already
in prison,

3396
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:50,410
whether I like it or not.
If there's something important that I

3397
02:34:50,411 --> 02:34:53,460
have to say and then the jobs that you
do get or the employment opportunities

3398
02:34:53,461 --> 02:34:56,500
that you do get,
they'll be looking for your authentic

3399
02:34:56,501 --> 02:35:00,460
self and let's say it's some like the
same sort of situation with some crazy

3400
02:35:00,461 --> 02:35:02,330
woman likes to take some guy and change
them all.

3401
02:35:02,350 --> 02:35:04,940
He's a fixer upper like they're not.
They're not going to grab you and go,

3402
02:35:04,970 --> 02:35:07,380
this Russell brand's talking a lot of
crazy revolution.

3403
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:10,810
Once we get them in the network,
I'm in a nice suit.

3404
02:35:11,650 --> 02:35:14,110
He's gonna.
He's gonna be the best talk show host

3405
02:35:14,111 --> 02:35:16,030
ever.
He's the future Jimmy Fallon.

3406
02:35:16,270 --> 02:35:18,170
And at the end of the day,
yes.

3407
02:35:18,210 --> 02:35:20,200
If it comes to entertainment,
your number.

3408
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:22,660
So does he matter what you say?
They believe it or not.

3409
02:35:22,661 --> 02:35:23,910
Believe it and you get these people.
Don't.

3410
02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:26,560
Doesn't matter.
I think we should put him in this movie

3411
02:35:26,561 --> 02:35:31,561
because he's worth this much and think
of will make this much this many people

3412
02:35:32,420 --> 02:35:35,920
automatically buy tickets because his
following is interview.

3413
02:35:35,970 --> 02:35:39,640
You almost start controlling your own
destiny that happened as a result.

3414
02:35:40,610 --> 02:35:42,710
Things happen to you.
Awful.

3415
02:35:43,860 --> 02:35:48,250
I don't.
Well what do you mean not having someone

3416
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:50,760
gone?
Why don't we put fucking Joe Rogan in

3417
02:35:50,761 --> 02:35:53,500
this action movie?
You got fucking massive,

3418
02:35:54,130 --> 02:35:54,990
but I don't.
I don't.

3419
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:58,510
I'm not interested in doing anything.
I'm interested in doing less things.

3420
02:35:58,570 --> 02:36:02,020
I'm not interested in anything new.
I don't want to do any movies.

3421
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:04,480
I like doing stuff that has nothing to
do with work.

3422
02:36:04,481 --> 02:36:06,760
Like I like doing yoga and I like doing
archery.

3423
02:36:06,761 --> 02:36:09,740
I like writing comedy.
I like performing standup.

3424
02:36:09,810 --> 02:36:13,210
I liked to on podcasts I like,
I like just doing stuff.

3425
02:36:13,211 --> 02:36:15,880
I don't want to do someone else's stuff,
you know,

3426
02:36:15,881 --> 02:36:19,540
some movie came along and it was really
interesting and for whatever reason it

3427
02:36:19,541 --> 02:36:21,220
was a short amount of time.
I would have to work,

3428
02:36:21,250 --> 02:36:23,650
I would consider it,
but I've passed on a lot of stuff.

3429
02:36:23,651 --> 02:36:26,690
I just don't have any interest in it.
He's taking control of your life through

3430
02:36:26,691 --> 02:36:27,310
this.
Yeah.

3431
02:36:27,310 --> 02:36:31,340
Well I've been doing what I actually
want to do instead of when you know,

3432
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:36,450
and Jim and I were in a pilot for the
very first TV show that I did in 1993

3433
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:39,640
and we've been friends for longer before
that,

3434
02:36:39,670 --> 02:36:40,630
way long before that.

3435
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:45,440
But you,
you come here and you think I've now I'm

3436
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:47,620
going to do this project.
Oh boy.

3437
02:36:47,621 --> 02:36:50,800
I'm in.
I'm on a TV show and you and then you

3438
02:36:50,801 --> 02:36:51,840
get on the TV,
show you up.

3439
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:53,650
You know what?
I don't even like this that much.

3440
02:36:53,980 --> 02:36:55,060
I liked doing.
Stand up.

3441
02:36:55,061 --> 02:36:57,190
Why am I doing this?
You're doing this because they keep

3442
02:36:57,191 --> 02:36:58,120
coming to you like,
Hey,

3443
02:36:58,121 --> 02:37:00,610
we've got a game show and they're gonna
eat animal dicks and you're going to

3444
02:37:00,611 --> 02:37:02,630
shoot them out of a rocket.
What do you know?

3445
02:37:02,750 --> 02:37:03,460
Like,
I'm in,

3446
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:04,780
it's on TV.
I'm in.

3447
02:37:04,810 --> 02:37:07,080
That's what I'm here for,
and the money is real fucking good.

3448
02:37:07,150 --> 02:37:08,440
You do it after a while and you go,
hey,

3449
02:37:08,441 --> 02:37:10,180
you know what?
That's not what I enjoy doing.

3450
02:37:10,181 --> 02:37:12,130
What do I actually enjoy doing?
Well,

3451
02:37:12,131 --> 02:37:14,500
I'm just trying to do the things I enjoy
doing.

3452
02:37:14,710 --> 02:37:15,680
What I enjoy doing.

3453
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:18,140
I like doing podcasts.
I like doing standup.

3454
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:21,590
I like and doing all those
extracurricular things that I do,

3455
02:37:21,660 --> 02:37:25,430
the things that I do that are just
interested in life and then I don't want

3456
02:37:25,431 --> 02:37:28,940
to differentiate between interests that
I do for financial gain or interest to

3457
02:37:28,941 --> 02:37:32,960
it that I do for mental exercises or for
spiritual growth or whatever.

3458
02:37:32,961 --> 02:37:35,000
I just want to do things that I enjoy
doing.

3459
02:37:35,090 --> 02:37:36,320
That's really important,
isn't it?

3460
02:37:36,321 --> 02:37:40,490
You guys sound fair enough and so many
people don't have that kind of freedom

3461
02:37:40,491 --> 02:37:42,500
creatively on any level.
The freedom of it.

3462
02:37:42,501 --> 02:37:46,520
I just want the that should be part of
more people's experience of life.

3463
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:50,480
I'm happy doing this.
It makes me like.

3464
02:37:50,481 --> 02:37:53,660
It's really beautiful to hear that,
that what you're led by his joy because

3465
02:37:53,661 --> 02:37:56,120
that is another Joseph Campbell thing.
Follow your bliss.

3466
02:37:56,150 --> 02:37:58,220
Find the thing that you're connected to
and follow it,

3467
02:37:58,460 --> 02:38:00,330
and when I think of how many times in my
life I've got,

3468
02:38:00,350 --> 02:38:03,620
I've lived out other people's ideas as
you say,

3469
02:38:03,621 --> 02:38:03,951
like,
Oh,

3470
02:38:03,951 --> 02:38:04,590
right now this is.

3471
02:38:04,590 --> 02:38:05,810
Hold on a minute.
This is what I'm.

3472
02:38:06,250 --> 02:38:07,490
This is what I'm supposed to do.
Like again,

3473
02:38:07,491 --> 02:38:09,680
like Bill Hicks says,
they just look at my money.

3474
02:38:09,681 --> 02:38:13,880
This has to be real to be real because
you're bombarded with it and then you

3475
02:38:13,970 --> 02:38:15,440
realize,
oh my God,

3476
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:18,830
so if you are lucky enough to get to a
position where you can just do things

3477
02:38:18,831 --> 02:38:20,240
that you enjoy,
but how do you.

3478
02:38:20,241 --> 02:38:24,380
Do you think that idea that you've
applied to your own creative lives can

3479
02:38:24,381 --> 02:38:28,490
be applied?
If you're fucking living a normal life

3480
02:38:28,491 --> 02:38:30,890
and you're trapped in a job that you
don't fucking like,

3481
02:38:31,160 --> 02:38:33,080
how do you think you'd get out of that
situation?

3482
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:37,910
It's like everything else,
it takes small baby steps to move out,

3483
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:39,980
you know,
you've got to move towards that

3484
02:38:39,981 --> 02:38:42,080
direction.
You have to have an absolute game plan

3485
02:38:42,081 --> 02:38:44,390
and you have to have an actual thing
that you enjoy doing.

3486
02:38:44,810 --> 02:38:47,770
Like say if you're some guy that's
trapped in some job but you know,

3487
02:38:47,850 --> 02:38:48,900
to bring up something we talked about
before,

3488
02:38:48,901 --> 02:38:51,980
what you enjoy making homemade knives
and you think you're like,

3489
02:38:51,981 --> 02:38:53,690
you know,
I would love to just be able to make

3490
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:57,210
arts and crafts to be able to create
something that people bond,

3491
02:38:57,211 --> 02:39:01,820
maybe pottery or something along those
lines that really feel like spiritually

3492
02:39:01,821 --> 02:39:06,190
and creatively satisfying to me.
To be able to express myself in it,

3493
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:09,800
an art form that to do that for a living
would be amazing.

3494
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:13,190
And there's a lot of people that start
off in regular jobs and they figure out

3495
02:39:13,191 --> 02:39:17,000
a way to get to that place and it's not
easy and people will fucking bitch and

3496
02:39:17,001 --> 02:39:19,070
Moan at you and tell you how not easy it
is.

3497
02:39:19,071 --> 02:39:21,230
And Yeah,
you're saying it's making it seem like

3498
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:22,520
it's easy.
It's not easy.

3499
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:26,060
A lot of us have problems and we got
mortgages and children and I need a

3500
02:39:26,061 --> 02:39:30,290
healthcare packaging.
Everybody has resistance.

3501
02:39:30,291 --> 02:39:32,900
There's always resistance to anything
that you're trying to achieve in life

3502
02:39:32,901 --> 02:39:35,030
and everybody's set up might be
different.

3503
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:38,960
Everybody's needs and requirements might
be different.

3504
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:42,680
They're all different,
but if you find whatever the fuck it is

3505
02:39:42,770 --> 02:39:44,660
that you can do,
I guarantee you,

3506
02:39:44,661 --> 02:39:48,950
you have some time in your day that you
can dedicate towards making that a

3507
02:39:48,951 --> 02:39:51,470
reality.
It's a matter of making that time a

3508
02:39:51,471 --> 02:39:55,610
priority to try to change your current
state of existence.

3509
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:57,050
How do you do it?
I don't know.

3510
02:39:57,051 --> 02:40:00,800
I don't know what your existence is and
I can't tell you anyway because what the

3511
02:40:00,801 --> 02:40:03,860
way I do things and the way you do
things is fucking totally different.

3512
02:40:03,861 --> 02:40:06,680
Everyone's going to do things different.
I'm a kamikaze person.

3513
02:40:06,681 --> 02:40:08,420
I'm like,
let's fucking cut ties,

3514
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:09,380
Polish,
shoot,

3515
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,213
let's go.

3516
02:40:10,280 --> 02:40:11,690
I'm like,
let's get outta here.

3517
02:40:11,691 --> 02:40:12,441
Let's quit.
You know?

3518
02:40:12,441 --> 02:40:13,560
Um,
but I've always like that.

3519
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:15,940
I've always been the burn the fucking
house down.

3520
02:40:15,970 --> 02:40:17,280
You got to make another one.
That's,

3521
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:20,430
that's my,
my thought has been just abandoned ship.

3522
02:40:20,431 --> 02:40:23,370
Let's get Outta here and find the
fucking new thing,

3523
02:40:23,371 --> 02:40:27,090
but you can't do that when you have a
wife and children and now luckily for me

3524
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:31,470
when I was young and taking crazy
chances and moving towards a career and

3525
02:40:31,471 --> 02:40:34,790
doing something I actually wanted to do,
I didn't have anybody else that I had

3526
02:40:34,810 --> 02:40:36,630
that counted on me.
Once you do,

3527
02:40:36,631 --> 02:40:39,900
it becomes much more difficult but not
insurmountable.

3528
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:43,140
It didn't completely dependent upon what
it is you're trying to achieve.

3529
02:40:43,141 --> 02:40:45,230
I like that we can start.
Good.

3530
02:40:45,550 --> 02:40:46,700
Well going to say like,
you know,

3531
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:47,543
sort of

3532
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:50,890
how do you bridge.
You aren't going to,

3533
02:40:50,930 --> 02:40:52,410
like I said,
that thing to Tom Cruise,

3534
02:40:52,411 --> 02:40:56,570
that time of being born with that drive,
being born with that knowledge of I'm

3535
02:40:56,580 --> 02:40:59,580
going to do this because I identify with
that crash and burn thing and it's been

3536
02:40:59,581 --> 02:41:01,560
problematic in my life with
relationships and stuff.

3537
02:41:02,430 --> 02:41:04,600
I've got a survival instinct in me and
it's like,

3538
02:41:04,830 --> 02:41:06,390
this is fucking mad.
I'm out.

3539
02:41:06,460 --> 02:41:08,160
Yeah,
but that's good.

3540
02:41:10,830 --> 02:41:13,230
How many people fucking stay and get
tortured

3541
02:41:14,770 --> 02:41:17,870
sophie when that hard tech comes finally
aren't going away from this con.

3542
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:22,910
Well,
I hope your head,

3543
02:41:24,690 --> 02:41:26,010
but if see my fingers,

3544
02:41:26,290 --> 02:41:30,380
I would like more people in the world.
Like it will be like Jesus for more

3545
02:41:30,381 --> 02:41:33,950
people to have that opportunity.
Like it makes me sad so that people will

3546
02:41:33,951 --> 02:41:35,480
be listening to this thinking I fucking
won.

3547
02:41:35,481 --> 02:41:37,850
Now I want to make my fucking art and
craft knives.

3548
02:41:37,851 --> 02:41:38,930
I wanted it like that.
If you,

3549
02:41:38,931 --> 02:41:40,700
if you've not got place for that in your
life,

3550
02:41:40,701 --> 02:41:42,170
then you will,
like you were saying when you were in

3551
02:41:42,171 --> 02:41:44,520
prison,
you have your fucking fucked anyway and

3552
02:41:44,521 --> 02:41:47,550
let you know and there are certain
systemic changes that could be bought

3553
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:50,120
back that would mean that more people
would have that opportunity.

3554
02:41:50,121 --> 02:41:51,270
That's the other thing that makes me
sad.

3555
02:41:51,271 --> 02:41:52,370
Systemic changes.
Well,

3556
02:41:52,371 --> 02:41:53,081
I mean he's,
he's.

3557
02:41:53,081 --> 02:41:57,530
But if we didn't have a culture that was
entirely dominated by one economic idea,

3558
02:41:57,710 --> 02:42:00,170
that more people would be able to sit
around making art and crafts,

3559
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:02,280
not the finger of the things that keep
coming up again and again.

3560
02:42:02,290 --> 02:42:04,310
This conversation,
people should live in small tribes.

3561
02:42:04,340 --> 02:42:04,700
I mean,
right?

3562
02:42:04,700 --> 02:42:07,040
So why the fuck are we not trying to do
that shit now?

3563
02:42:07,041 --> 02:42:08,980
Why are we not going to like,
you know why we don't go in,

3564
02:42:09,140 --> 02:42:11,470
right?
Let's try another word for tribes.

3565
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:15,110
Soviet and people did ever go
terribly,

3566
02:42:15,111 --> 02:42:16,610
terribly wrong,
but what I'm saying,

3567
02:42:16,611 --> 02:42:18,890
they start doing these kind of ideas.
I mean,

3568
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:20,360
look,
now I'd be like,

3569
02:42:20,361 --> 02:42:21,430
I wonder if that's that,
you know,

3570
02:42:21,570 --> 02:42:24,200
that's the template.
What's the next level of this is like,

3571
02:42:24,201 --> 02:42:26,150
right,
but let's try and work on that.

3572
02:42:26,151 --> 02:42:29,840
Then they try and bring some of these
ideas like you have as an individual,

3573
02:42:30,110 --> 02:42:34,310
like can this be collectivized?
Can this be brought forward so that more

3574
02:42:34,311 --> 02:42:35,300
people like,
you know,

3575
02:42:35,510 --> 02:42:37,340
do you take that leap of faith that fuck
me,

3576
02:42:37,341 --> 02:42:39,890
if we do get hundred 50 people together,
of course it's going to be problems,

3577
02:42:39,930 --> 02:42:41,510
challenges,
problems and fucking challenges.

3578
02:42:41,511 --> 02:42:44,990
Now we're not competing with perfection.
We compete with a defunct system that's

3579
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:48,260
really causing a great deal of
negativity and problems.

3580
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:51,590
What would happen if people did start to
try and create alternatives are to what

3581
02:42:51,591 --> 02:42:53,000
happened?
You'd be killed.

3582
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:54,630
No,
I don't think.

3583
02:42:54,630 --> 02:42:57,750
You don't think so?
No code right out.

3584
02:42:57,751 --> 02:42:59,050
If you end right,
we're setting up a system,

3585
02:42:59,070 --> 02:43:01,850
hundred 50 people where this is our new
podcast experiment.

3586
02:43:01,851 --> 02:43:03,260
We're setting up a utopia.

3587
02:43:03,470 --> 02:43:07,380
Only when you become a threat and you
have to become a threat financially or

3588
02:43:07,381 --> 02:43:10,380
you have to become a threat militarily.
One of the things about these fucking

3589
02:43:10,381 --> 02:43:14,470
Waco type,
they always gathered guns did fuck

3590
02:43:14,471 --> 02:43:15,840
everybody's wives and they have a

3591
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:19,890
pile of ammunition.
Then you become a threat,

3592
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:22,320
David.
What's the stockpile of guns in the

3593
02:43:22,321 --> 02:43:23,670
fucking?
Everyone's saying,

3594
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:25,470
oh,
I just focused on Jesus,

3595
02:43:25,770 --> 02:43:27,930
so Jesus rose,
right?

3596
02:43:28,050 --> 02:43:30,960
Once you become a threat,
and that's the only way violence is the

3597
02:43:30,961 --> 02:43:35,961
only real threat
to expound on those ideas and spread

3598
02:43:36,811 --> 02:43:39,720
those ideas.
It's controversial,

3599
02:43:39,780 --> 02:43:41,880
but I don't think anybody looks at it
and says,

3600
02:43:41,881 --> 02:43:43,830
you know what?
This motherfucker is going to take money

3601
02:43:43,831 --> 02:43:47,010
out of my bank account.
I think people were so engrossed in

3602
02:43:47,011 --> 02:43:51,360
their own life and their own progress,
their own path of conquering.

3603
02:43:51,660 --> 02:43:55,020
I don't think they think about it that
way unless you crossed them and unless

3604
02:43:55,021 --> 02:43:55,831
you.
Like you say,

3605
02:43:55,831 --> 02:43:57,720
you know what,
God dammit this Rupert Murdoch is

3606
02:43:57,721 --> 02:44:00,270
fucking up the world.
That I'm going to expose him and I'm

3607
02:44:00,271 --> 02:44:02,370
going to let the world.
Then you've created an issue.

3608
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:07,560
Then you've gone into battle with a man
with unfathomable resources that tried.

3609
02:44:08,530 --> 02:44:13,530
That
didn't work out.

3610
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:21,540
Done
bloody sick of all this.

3611
02:44:25,801 --> 02:44:27,180
You see his wife,
he's got a hot wife.

3612
02:44:27,210 --> 02:44:28,043
Cool.
CIS.

3613
02:44:28,110 --> 02:44:30,120
Amazing.
I love how stereotypes just play

3614
02:44:30,121 --> 02:44:32,820
themselves out over and over and over.
Donald Trump's wife.

3615
02:44:32,821 --> 02:44:36,900
I go,
that's what I like to see the same thing

3616
02:44:36,901 --> 02:44:38,610
over and over again.
Tapping.

3617
02:44:38,611 --> 02:44:39,690
I'm in pain.
I got to pee.

3618
02:44:39,750 --> 02:44:41,100
Go ahead man.
No worries.

3619
02:44:41,510 --> 02:44:42,550
Yeah,
I think.

3620
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:43,950
I think we,
you know,

3621
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:47,550
one of the things Mckenna said that
always resonated with me is that so many

3622
02:44:47,551 --> 02:44:52,050
people do the man's work for the man and
they're so worried about the

3623
02:44:52,051 --> 02:44:55,170
repercussions of being free or
expressing themselves or discussing

3624
02:44:55,171 --> 02:44:57,840
psychedelics.
They do the man's work for the man

3625
02:44:58,830 --> 02:45:03,830
by not by being scared and shackling
themselves and expressing yourself in a

3626
02:45:04,651 --> 02:45:06,480
way that makes sense.
You know,

3627
02:45:06,481 --> 02:45:09,960
like I think one of the things that's
most interesting about Mckenna's

3628
02:45:09,961 --> 02:45:13,470
lectures where he was in sort of the
infancy of the Internet where you did a

3629
02:45:13,471 --> 02:45:16,850
lot of them is he expressed himself in
a,

3630
02:45:16,940 --> 02:45:20,220
in a way that's kind of really similar
to like podcasts rants,

3631
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:23,760
but way before their time.
He was doing it in front of these groups

3632
02:45:23,761 --> 02:45:26,880
of people and someone recorded it so he
would have these meetings,

3633
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:29,760
you know,
that people come to hear him speak and

3634
02:45:29,761 --> 02:45:31,010
he would have these meetings and he
would,

3635
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:34,290
a lot of times you would open up the
room for questions and he would just

3636
02:45:34,410 --> 02:45:38,520
sort of rant and you know,
he's a consummate consumer of cannabis,

3637
02:45:38,700 --> 02:45:42,690
so he's high as fuck.
And he's having these bizarre

3638
02:45:42,691 --> 02:45:45,720
conversations,
these rants rigs exploring these ideas

3639
02:45:45,721 --> 02:45:48,990
and he got better and better and better
at them all throughout these rants.

3640
02:45:48,991 --> 02:45:52,860
And when he's doing these,
he's essentially doing a podcast.

3641
02:45:52,861 --> 02:45:54,210
It takes a long time to hear.

3642
02:45:54,990 --> 02:45:57,600
He was.
Do you think of him just sort of a

3643
02:45:57,660 --> 02:46:00,410
modern secular profit?
Because if you sort of like,

3644
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:03,720
if you've been into the comedy of Bill
Hicks and then you listen to terrence

3645
02:46:03,721 --> 02:46:04,530
Mckenna,
you can see like,

3646
02:46:04,530 --> 02:46:07,230
oh fuck,
he's clearly influenced.

3647
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:10,400
The.
I found out about Mckenna

3648
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:15,020
was to Hicks bit [inaudible] Hicks had
this bit about what he,

3649
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:19,700
he said what Terence Mckenna would
describe as a heroic dose of mushrooms.

3650
02:46:20,030 --> 02:46:21,440
So I was like,
who the fuck is Terence Mckenna?

3651
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:22,820
And this was,
you know,

3652
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:28,000
the nineties when I heard this.
So I had seen Hicks live a couple times

3653
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:29,780
for three or four times I guess in
Boston.

3654
02:46:30,290 --> 02:46:31,760
And um,
what was that?

3655
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:33,800
It was amazing.
First Time I saw him,

3656
02:46:33,890 --> 02:46:38,890
it was an accident.
First Time I saw him I went to see some

3657
02:46:39,411 --> 02:46:44,411
comedians that were like local Boston
guys and Hicks had come in from out of

3658
02:46:45,921 --> 02:46:50,210
town and I don't know if he was supposed
to be there the next night or what it

3659
02:46:50,211 --> 02:46:51,560
was,
but no one was there to see him.

3660
02:46:51,740 --> 02:46:56,740
They didn't know who he was.
And he went up on stage and was just so

3661
02:46:58,371 --> 02:47:00,950
weird.
And he was doing this bit about tiffany

3662
02:47:00,951 --> 02:47:02,210
meeting Jimmy Hendrix.

3663
02:47:02,210 --> 02:47:03,590
At the mall,
you know,

3664
02:47:03,591 --> 02:47:05,710
that uh,
like this music that they're promoting

3665
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:08,200
is pop culture,
bullshit music and,

3666
02:47:08,870 --> 02:47:12,260
and he was at the comedy connection in
Boston.

3667
02:47:12,261 --> 02:47:15,290
I saw him think I saw him there first
and I saw him at Nick's and a couple

3668
02:47:15,291 --> 02:47:17,030
other places.
But uh,

3669
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:18,950
he was,
he was doing some new thing.

3670
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:19,551
I was like,
okay,

3671
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:23,060
this is a new kind of comedy.
This is like Sam Kinison,

3672
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:28,300
but with much more of an emphasis on the
realization that the patterns were all

3673
02:47:29,721 --> 02:47:34,670
falling into whether it's pop culture
patterns or at these things are actually

3674
02:47:34,671 --> 02:47:38,060
detrimental that these things are,
they're foolish way to approach this

3675
02:47:38,061 --> 02:47:40,010
world.
This world is incredibly complex and we

3676
02:47:40,011 --> 02:47:42,410
could all look at it together.
And I was like,

3677
02:47:42,411 --> 02:47:42,711
well,
this is,

3678
02:47:42,711 --> 02:47:46,540
this is a new kind of comedy.
How is he going down in the booth?

3679
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:48,350
Really good and really bad.

3680
02:47:48,410 --> 02:47:53,060
I saw him bomb horribly,
but bomb with grace that I've never

3681
02:47:53,061 --> 02:47:54,550
achieved.
He,

3682
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:57,080
he bombed.
He didn't give a fuck about bombing.

3683
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,800
I've never been able to do that.
He,

3684
02:47:58,820 --> 02:48:01,790
he bombed like a guy who almost knew the
future,

3685
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:04,940
knew he was going to have some sort of
an impact on the culture and knew that

3686
02:48:04,941 --> 02:48:09,290
this was just a footnote in that
incredibly impactful experience on the

3687
02:48:09,291 --> 02:48:12,440
art form of standup comedy and also knew
that eventually he'd find his own

3688
02:48:12,441 --> 02:48:14,090
audience,
which he did not have at the time

3689
02:48:14,450 --> 02:48:17,990
because he was at a small comedy club.
Nick's comedy stop in Boston,

3690
02:48:17,991 --> 02:48:20,650
which is a couple hundred people.
And um,

3691
02:48:20,810 --> 02:48:23,360
there was a guy who went on before him
who was a real hack,

3692
02:48:23,630 --> 02:48:25,450
nice guy,
but just hacky,

3693
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:28,610
hacky bullshit cop donut jokes,
that kind of shit.

3694
02:48:28,990 --> 02:48:30,530
Just everything you've already heard
before.

3695
02:48:30,531 --> 02:48:32,360
Nothing original.
And he was killing,

3696
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:33,940
killing with others.

3697
02:48:33,940 --> 02:48:37,160
Simple stupid shit.
And then Hicks went on afterwards with

3698
02:48:37,161 --> 02:48:40,190
this,
like really bizarre interpretation of

3699
02:48:40,191 --> 02:48:42,920
modern civilization ever is like,
fuck this guy.

3700
02:48:43,310 --> 02:48:46,710
And people were getting up and leaving
in droves and uh,

3701
02:48:46,940 --> 02:48:50,300
kept going through the whole thing.
And me and Greg Fitzsimmons was there

3702
02:48:50,301 --> 02:48:52,210
and a bunch of other comedians watching
them bomb.

3703
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:55,520
We were laughing our asses off.
So he was playing to the back of the

3704
02:48:55,521 --> 02:48:57,380
room,
the comedians that were still there

3705
02:48:57,381 --> 02:48:59,690
laughing.
We're laughing hard and support,

3706
02:48:59,990 --> 02:49:03,650
but people are getting up and giant
chunks and leaving at the end of the

3707
02:49:03,650 --> 02:49:04,400
show,
you know,

3708
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:09,240
the show was whittled down from like 250
people to like 40 people in 15 or 20

3709
02:49:09,241 --> 02:49:11,550
comics.
That was all that was left and we were

3710
02:49:11,580 --> 02:49:14,340
howling laughing and he got offstage.
Like nothing happened.

3711
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:17,670
He would not compromise.
Who's an interesting guy.

3712
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:20,970
So then go on and then that's it.
That's what he kicks you off into the

3713
02:49:21,150 --> 02:49:21,983
Mckenna realm.

3714
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:22,570
Yeah,
he,

3715
02:49:22,570 --> 02:49:25,380
he's one introduced me to Mckenna by
that joke.

3716
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:30,120
Just by saying that.
And then in hearing Hicks's references,

3717
02:49:30,570 --> 02:49:31,351
you know,
he was,

3718
02:49:31,351 --> 02:49:34,200
there was a few other guys that he sort
of referenced their ideas.

3719
02:49:34,201 --> 02:49:37,290
Like Noam Chomsky was another one.
Like one of the things that Hicks was

3720
02:49:37,291 --> 02:49:41,910
famous for saying was actually a chomsky
line was that about the Iraq war,

3721
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:45,030
that it's only really in a war when two
armies are fighting,

3722
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:46,111
you know.
And that was,

3723
02:49:46,111 --> 02:49:47,450
like I said,
direct Chmielowski quote.

3724
02:49:47,550 --> 02:49:49,650
It is,
and it's a hicks.

3725
02:49:50,160 --> 02:49:51,000
Well He,
you know,

3726
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:52,810
it's not,
I don't want,

3727
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:55,620
I don't want to say it's plagiarism
because I bet if you asked him,

3728
02:49:55,621 --> 02:49:57,000
he would tell you it's a noam chomsky
quote,

3729
02:49:57,001 --> 02:50:01,740
but he was introducing that concept and
that idea to these people through the

3730
02:50:02,010 --> 02:50:06,510
world of standup comedy and then from
there he expanded on that with all of

3731
02:50:06,511 --> 02:50:10,380
his material about the Iraq war and the
all the new weapons that they're doing

3732
02:50:10,381 --> 02:50:12,360
and forming equipment.

3733
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:15,380
I'm starting that shame bit.
Yeah.

3734
02:50:15,381 --> 02:50:18,410
So.
And I think you give him that because

3735
02:50:18,470 --> 02:50:22,800
it's so like the stuff he was doing was
so innovative and incredible and funny.

3736
02:50:22,810 --> 02:50:25,590
Lucky.
Like I sort of say you look to and say

3737
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:28,100
you said Kennison or lenny bruce before
that,

3738
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:31,810
like
what I've experienced of them and I'm

3739
02:50:31,820 --> 02:50:36,230
not by any means and authority.
He did like Bill Hicks did make it more

3740
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:39,170
densely humorous.
Maybe not when you see him live on that,

3741
02:50:39,171 --> 02:50:41,290
but by the time he was recording
specialist and stuff.

3742
02:50:41,291 --> 02:50:42,830
Sure.
I also live A.

3743
02:50:42,860 --> 02:50:46,820
I've always thought that Bill Hicks was
extremely refined and honed.

3744
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:48,110
What was neat.
It's like,

3745
02:50:48,111 --> 02:50:50,630
you know,
like you can see incarnations of the

3746
02:50:50,631 --> 02:50:54,770
same content many,
many times with him where he,

3747
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:57,770
at least in the stuff that I saw because
I've only ever seen him know,

3748
02:50:57,860 --> 02:50:59,540
recorded.
He wasn't going out.

3749
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:02,270
He wasn't like doing lots of spontaneity
and lots of luck.

3750
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:06,680
It was like they were like beautiful,
very articular pieces of.

3751
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:09,150
Yeah.
And sometimes they didn't even make

3752
02:51:09,151 --> 02:51:10,110
people laugh.
You know,

3753
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:14,460
I watched it with his girl I was dating
at the time in like 19 or 23 ish,

3754
02:51:14,670 --> 02:51:16,050
something like that.
And she was like,

3755
02:51:16,051 --> 02:51:18,240
yeah,
he's not really funny,

3756
02:51:18,241 --> 02:51:20,730
but he's really fascinating to listen
to.

3757
02:51:20,790 --> 02:51:23,820
Like she didn't find like some of the
things he was saying were funny,

3758
02:51:24,060 --> 02:51:27,390
but I think that was also the revelation
show which you filmed in London,

3759
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:31,620
which was one of those weird shows where
you're doing an hbo special and you have

3760
02:51:31,621 --> 02:51:36,621
one show ready go and there's some weird
pressure that's involved with that and

3761
02:51:36,781 --> 02:51:41,760
it doesn't necessarily always come off
loose and like the feeling that you see

3762
02:51:41,761 --> 02:51:46,170
him when he's at a club where he's
expressing himself in a much more

3763
02:51:46,290 --> 02:51:47,160
freeway.

3764
02:51:47,710 --> 02:51:51,340
I felt that he's a lot of his comedy as
high points.

3765
02:51:51,341 --> 02:51:55,390
Of course he's content came from his
ability to do characterization that you

3766
02:51:55,480 --> 02:51:57,600
do like a sort of a long bit that used
to like,

3767
02:51:57,610 --> 02:51:59,530
oh my God,
this guy is just hitting me with data.

3768
02:51:59,710 --> 02:52:02,770
But like when he died,
oh believe God created a in one day.

3769
02:52:02,950 --> 02:52:03,783
But those things,

3770
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:09,470
it looks like he rushed it.
Rafiki doesn't let you off and then.

3771
02:52:11,290 --> 02:52:12,650
And then as well that the thing that
we're good.

3772
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:15,400
I think that revelations was the first
thing that I ever saw of.

3773
02:52:15,401 --> 02:52:20,401
He's like when I was like was a kid,
but when he does the market in France,

3774
02:52:20,951 --> 02:52:22,950
you know,
like in one advertising mock and Kudos,

3775
02:52:23,230 --> 02:52:23,950
I couldn't,
you know,

3776
02:52:23,950 --> 02:52:27,490
I couldn't believe his sincerity.
I couldn't believe that someone would

3777
02:52:27,491 --> 02:52:30,160
hit you with that much heart.
Quit putting a dollar sign and every

3778
02:52:30,161 --> 02:52:32,740
damn thing on this planet.
But something like that.

3779
02:52:32,870 --> 02:52:36,130
Some of it.
So that was from the heart,

3780
02:52:36,131 --> 02:52:36,964
Huh?

3781
02:52:37,960 --> 02:52:39,370
Resonated.
Whenever someone,

3782
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:41,620
something resonates and stays.
I mean,

3783
02:52:41,700 --> 02:52:43,990
it's also,
there's so much mythology involved in

3784
02:52:43,991 --> 02:52:47,950
him now because he's passed on and he
died young and we always sit back and

3785
02:52:47,951 --> 02:52:48,880
wonder like,
what would it be?

3786
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:53,390
I liked that guy was alive today.
He didn't have the outlet then where

3787
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:56,500
that's again,
now you can go back and look at a guy

3788
02:52:56,501 --> 02:53:00,670
like that because it's there and back
then you weren't ready to handle that.

3789
02:53:01,210 --> 02:53:03,040
Who's talking like,
I'm coming to comedy club.

3790
02:53:03,041 --> 02:53:04,780
I want to.
I want to laugh.

3791
02:53:04,830 --> 02:53:09,830
Yeah.
I to think tonight will Hicks Hicks was,

3792
02:53:10,530 --> 02:53:12,610
you know,
I don't know what you're saying.

3793
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:16,110
So kennison opened the door for him
because he was one of the outlaws and

3794
02:53:16,111 --> 02:53:18,660
Kennison had a lot of bits that were
like that,

3795
02:53:18,661 --> 02:53:23,580
but they were more humor based than
point of view based like he had points

3796
02:53:23,581 --> 02:53:25,260
of view.
But the point of view had to be really

3797
02:53:25,261 --> 02:53:28,140
funny.
Whereas Hicks had a lot of points of

3798
02:53:28,141 --> 02:53:30,090
view.
There's like there's gotta be a way to

3799
02:53:30,091 --> 02:53:34,080
introduce these ideas into people in the
form of standup comedy that maybe not

3800
02:53:34,081 --> 02:53:36,210
even aren't that funny but are very
important.

3801
02:53:36,630 --> 02:53:38,430
Whereas Kennison was,
everything was,

3802
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:43,470
I mean he had some ridiculously funny
bits and he did it in this totally

3803
02:53:43,471 --> 02:53:48,090
unapologetic way that I think Hicks kind
of absorbed and when I first saw Hicks

3804
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:50,730
is one of the things he had a lot of
Kennison in him,

3805
02:53:50,970 --> 02:53:55,970
like we all have influences and when
we're starting out we like to hear other

3806
02:53:56,701 --> 02:53:59,820
comedians that you really love come out
of your own mouth,

3807
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:04,880
almost like with the intonations and the
inflections and you almost kind of mimic

3808
02:54:05,011 --> 02:54:06,330
them in your delivery.

3809
02:54:06,690 --> 02:54:09,480
And Hicks did a lot of that.
When I first saw him,

3810
02:54:09,481 --> 02:54:12,990
he was doing a lot of Kennison and it
was interesting.

3811
02:54:12,991 --> 02:54:15,300
It was like this guy is clearly
influenced and.

3812
02:54:15,301 --> 02:54:16,000
Well,
one of the.

3813
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:17,850
Okay.
You don't know whether or not he was

3814
02:54:17,851 --> 02:54:20,180
influenced by Kinesin or kinison was
influenced by Hex,

3815
02:54:20,190 --> 02:54:22,530
but most likely it's probably a little
bit of both,

3816
02:54:22,531 --> 02:54:26,820
but more Kennison than anything because
Kennison was much more successful

3817
02:54:26,850 --> 02:54:30,240
earlier on,
like several years before Hicks really

3818
02:54:30,241 --> 02:54:34,290
took off and was revolutionary.
When Kennison came on the scene.

3819
02:54:34,291 --> 02:54:38,520
He was completely revolutionary.
So I think him taking Hicks with him,

3820
02:54:38,670 --> 02:54:40,410
you know,
because they were a part of that Houston

3821
02:54:40,411 --> 02:54:43,290
group that originally expanded and then
came to la.

3822
02:54:43,650 --> 02:54:47,820
I think he just showed that there's,
there's just some unbilled undeniable

3823
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:51,270
power and being that controversial but
on point

3824
02:54:51,910 --> 02:54:56,270
what startup is one of the original
American art form,

3825
02:54:56,271 --> 02:54:58,670
isn't it?
It's like there is precedent prior to

3826
02:54:58,671 --> 02:55:01,370
America.
Proprietor being in the United States

3827
02:55:01,371 --> 02:55:04,150
was not like that art form exist in the
same way.

3828
02:55:04,170 --> 02:55:07,550
Let's go gestures or just as Rava or
music call.

3829
02:55:07,551 --> 02:55:09,590
It didn't exist in that kind of way.
And in a,

3830
02:55:09,770 --> 02:55:14,150
in a manner like it's a very.
Podcasting is very natural medium for a

3831
02:55:14,151 --> 02:55:17,240
comedian because it grants you that long
form because I've always thought like

3832
02:55:17,241 --> 02:55:17,841
the,
you know,

3833
02:55:17,841 --> 02:55:20,390
the,
the more it can be that the more

3834
02:55:20,391 --> 02:55:22,670
truthful you are and the more articulate
become,

3835
02:55:22,671 --> 02:55:25,130
the more you reduce your audience.
You know,

3836
02:55:25,131 --> 02:55:29,360
when you think of like he liked hitting
up rooms have 2,500 people or 5,000,

3837
02:55:29,370 --> 02:55:30,770
you know,
arena gigs.

3838
02:55:31,010 --> 02:55:34,880
Like if you want to go in the white in
there with fucking Noam Chomsky,

3839
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:39,260
bloody quotes
finished.

3840
02:55:39,460 --> 02:55:40,610
Exactly.
Yeah.

3841
02:55:40,611 --> 02:55:44,030
You got to have some way to connect
those things with humor bound.

3842
02:55:44,030 --> 02:55:46,940
Almost like scaffolding in between
ideas.

3843
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:47,953
Yeah.
Yeah,

3844
02:55:48,140 --> 02:55:50,210
because you've got that.
That's the thing I think about sort of

3845
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:53,690
like keeping the ball above a certain
level and in a way this medium,

3846
02:55:53,691 --> 02:55:55,340
your are relief that,
that you are allowed.

3847
02:55:55,350 --> 02:55:56,183
It's like,
oh,

3848
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:58,980
sit back for awhile.
Listen for ages.

3849
02:55:59,050 --> 02:56:00,020
But they,
the,

3850
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:03,500
the aspect of comedy that I think is so
important of authenticity,

3851
02:56:03,501 --> 02:56:05,320
you know when people,
when you are a startup comic,

3852
02:56:05,330 --> 02:56:05,991
people go,
Oh,

3853
02:56:05,991 --> 02:56:08,030
you got to find your voice.
You got to find your authenticity in

3854
02:56:08,031 --> 02:56:12,430
like you were saying that you hear the
musicality of Comedians you admire in

3855
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:15,910
your voice that like when you're doing
five minutes or or 10,

3856
02:56:16,390 --> 02:56:18,500
it's extremely difficult,
isn't it?

3857
02:56:18,501 --> 02:56:23,210
To become robust enough with that.
But here I guess you get to really

3858
02:56:23,211 --> 02:56:27,800
explore what you are authentically in a
kind of a long safe form,

3859
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:28,980
especially 10 minutes.

3860
02:56:28,980 --> 02:56:31,260
That's those,
those little short sets you do it.

3861
02:56:31,261 --> 02:56:32,140
So those are just,
you know,

3862
02:56:32,170 --> 02:56:34,400
me,
you can get a bid out or a series of

3863
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:38,270
funny things that you can say,
but as far as like any real depth and

3864
02:56:38,271 --> 02:56:41,510
part of what comes out that's really
funny is like if you watch someone like

3865
02:56:41,511 --> 02:56:44,440
Jim,
part of like what his comedy is like,

3866
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:47,060
you'll understand after you see him for
15 or 20 minutes,

3867
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:50,540
this is how he makes fun of things.
This is his personality.

3868
02:56:50,541 --> 02:56:54,770
So you kind of get his vibe and then
another subject comes up and you're

3869
02:56:54,771 --> 02:56:57,290
laughing before he even starts talking
about it because you're kind of

3870
02:56:57,560 --> 02:57:00,350
following where he's going to take this.
Yeah.

3871
02:57:00,351 --> 02:57:03,280
You've signed up to.
I'll enjoy this now.

3872
02:57:03,390 --> 02:57:05,000
Yeah.
You're tuned into his perspective.

3873
02:57:05,270 --> 02:57:07,510
Kinison was a huge influence.
Yeah.

3874
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:09,020
I loved Kennison.

3875
02:57:11,710 --> 02:57:15,010
He was the hands down and he was
revolutionary.

3876
02:57:15,011 --> 02:57:16,990
It was like seeing Metallica for the
first time.

3877
02:57:17,020 --> 02:57:20,500
Like what would lead the way these
people reacting?

3878
02:57:20,770 --> 02:57:22,600
I never saw a,
uh,

3879
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:25,990
an audience of comedy audience.
He made them.

3880
02:57:27,370 --> 02:57:31,380
He made them almost want to go in a
marsh pit and to,

3881
02:57:31,420 --> 02:57:32,081
to.
No,

3882
02:57:32,081 --> 02:57:37,081
I don't think Carlin would dance around
being Catholic and and kind of expose

3883
02:57:39,041 --> 02:57:43,840
things but not.
I mean Kennison comes out and he just in

3884
02:57:43,841 --> 02:57:45,590
a biblical way,
I thought it.

3885
02:57:45,940 --> 02:57:49,030
My mom tried to make me go to church and
it made me a good person.

3886
02:57:49,330 --> 02:57:54,330
I learned more about biblical to and
just how common sense wise listening to

3887
02:57:55,061 --> 02:57:57,200
him.
He made me think about it.

3888
02:57:57,201 --> 02:57:59,620
He come out and yet Jesus was never
married.

3889
02:57:59,621 --> 02:58:04,621
No wife is going to buy the and he'd go
into this whole thing about he leaves on

3890
02:58:04,951 --> 02:58:06,840
a Fridays with 10 of his friends.

3891
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:09,570
His wife has passed.
Know where's the,

3892
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:12,480
where's all those losers that call
themselves disciples?

3893
02:58:12,481 --> 02:58:14,790
Everyone that says I believe,
I believe we put up feed.

3894
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:20,460
I had sat down with hopefully do the
common sense of this is why doesn't

3895
02:58:21,241 --> 02:58:22,920
anyone talk about the common sense of
this?

3896
02:58:23,130 --> 02:58:27,360
He just put it balls out there.
He can get away with it because he was a

3897
02:58:27,361 --> 02:58:31,770
preacher and he knew the Bible.
He knew everything about it and he would

3898
02:58:31,771 --> 02:58:36,510
sit there and he comes home on Monday,
looks like shit is dirt all over his

3899
02:58:36,511 --> 02:58:41,150
face and he sees his cross out on the
lawn and she's like way Mr

3900
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:46,240
as well.
Another one I was dad

3901
02:58:47,850 --> 02:58:49,920
decomposer.
I'm in the spiritual world.

3902
02:58:49,940 --> 02:58:52,240
I got to get back a sheet.
I don't know where I began,

3903
02:58:52,770 --> 02:58:54,720
and then he went on this whole thing
about,

3904
02:58:54,721 --> 02:58:57,360
oh,
they doctored this whole last supper.

3905
02:58:57,480 --> 02:59:01,320
Jesus me,
am I gonna am I gonna betray you?

3906
02:59:01,620 --> 02:59:02,680
And he'd say,
Oh,

3907
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:04,550
sock my dad,
you know,

3908
02:59:04,770 --> 02:59:05,610
fuck you.
I

3909
02:59:07,970 --> 02:59:09,780
will say drink of this blood.
And

3910
02:59:11,640 --> 02:59:14,010
just the common,
just he may,

3911
02:59:14,040 --> 02:59:17,870
he dumbed it down to an made me really
think about that one.

3912
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:19,650
Yeah.
This is also,

3913
02:59:19,651 --> 02:59:22,440
like we said about Metallica,
the force of his delivery.

3914
02:59:22,570 --> 02:59:23,970
Yes.
Unprecedented.

3915
02:59:23,971 --> 02:59:26,460
And no one had yelled out punchlines
before.

3916
02:59:26,461 --> 02:59:27,900
The way he did it.
He married?

3917
02:59:28,030 --> 02:59:30,930
Yeah.
You were married and I hung back to you.

3918
02:59:30,980 --> 02:59:32,010
Good.
Remember this face.

3919
02:59:33,810 --> 02:59:36,330
No one,
no one came at you like that,

3920
02:59:36,331 --> 02:59:38,240
but it was.
It was more than shtick.

3921
02:59:38,280 --> 02:59:42,030
It was freaking hilarious and it made a
lot of sense whenever,

3922
02:59:42,270 --> 02:59:44,250
whatever.
Who did talk about the devil,

3923
02:59:44,460 --> 02:59:48,360
the devil coming down teaching you.
It was,

3924
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:50,910
it was sick.
I remember her talking about,

3925
02:59:51,450 --> 02:59:53,440
well,
you said becoming famous because you're

3926
02:59:53,560 --> 02:59:57,360
fucking heart is you finished your show.
He trying to stay marriage.

3927
02:59:57,390 --> 03:00:00,200
It comes up in Australia.
No,

3928
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:01,330
ever.
No.

3929
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:03,860
Two fingers in your as and me and my
friends are,

3930
03:00:03,861 --> 03:00:04,694
well,
fuck,

3931
03:00:04,770 --> 03:00:06,940
fuck you to your can even fog and breath
in.

3932
03:00:06,941 --> 03:00:08,960
Then he'd go home to your wife.
No one will ever know or like,

3933
03:00:09,300 --> 03:00:09,931
uh,
you know,

3934
03:00:09,931 --> 03:00:10,500
uh,
you know,

3935
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:12,870
I've married,
she's on her period and we're going,

3936
03:00:12,871 --> 03:00:14,310
we're in the middle of a really
difficult time,

3937
03:00:14,311 --> 03:00:16,580
but thank you.
Thanks.

3938
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:21,250
Yeah,
he's,

3939
03:00:21,780 --> 03:00:23,680
he's a real wild man.
He was like,

3940
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:26,340
he introduced rock and roll
sensibilities to cry.

3941
03:00:27,210 --> 03:00:29,910
That's what I was attracted to.
That whole rock,

3942
03:00:30,150 --> 03:00:32,430
crazy loud energy.
Well,

3943
03:00:32,431 --> 03:00:34,800
he was also so different than everything
else at the time,

3944
03:00:34,801 --> 03:00:37,050
which was like the roll your sleeves up,
you know?

3945
03:00:37,051 --> 03:00:38,610
Did she ever notice,
you know,

3946
03:00:38,611 --> 03:00:41,130
ever noticed how come when you get a cup
of coffee?

3947
03:00:41,131 --> 03:00:44,280
There were no,
there was this sort of observational

3948
03:00:44,281 --> 03:00:48,130
comedy boom back then and he came along,
which is roaring monster.

3949
03:00:50,110 --> 03:00:54,270
His first bit ever on tv ever I think
was the African,

3950
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:58,290
which was huge here,
like you please help these poor children

3951
03:00:58,590 --> 03:00:59,860
help these children

3952
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:05,100
and he comes out and he's gone and I'm
sick and tired of seeing these

3953
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:07,810
commercials when I try to make you feel
guilty.

3954
03:01:08,020 --> 03:01:12,590
You're sitting there watching how can
you sit there and your air condition

3955
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:16,210
heat covered full,
a full kind of sick,

3956
03:01:16,211 --> 03:01:19,540
fuck God.
Give him a dollar and then he goes into

3957
03:01:19,541 --> 03:01:21,820
the whole thing.
Don't send them another thing.

3958
03:01:22,180 --> 03:01:25,660
They live in fucking don't send them
money.

3959
03:01:25,750 --> 03:01:29,860
So someone like me going to go there.
I've come here,

3960
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:34,000
we came here 500 miles and we realized
we wouldn't have to travel this far.

3961
03:01:34,090 --> 03:01:34,923
People

3962
03:01:36,950 --> 03:01:41,950
taste it,
but it's going to be 100 years from now.

3963
03:01:43,050 --> 03:01:47,420
Fucking sand deserts in America too,
which is don't live in hall.

3964
03:01:48,500 --> 03:01:50,170
Chad's got the drive

3965
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:55,380
and what was one of the best examples of
like,

3966
03:01:55,381 --> 03:01:57,630
people always like,
this is a fucking trend now,

3967
03:01:57,631 --> 03:02:01,200
but good comedy should always punch up a
comedy shows,

3968
03:02:01,250 --> 03:02:03,120
punch out bullshit.
Bullshit,

3969
03:02:03,270 --> 03:02:04,590
bullshit.
Nonsense.

3970
03:02:04,591 --> 03:02:08,850
Comedy should be comedy.
It's just like rap music or fucking

3971
03:02:08,851 --> 03:02:10,770
gangster movies.
It's indecipherable.

3972
03:02:10,771 --> 03:02:13,140
You cannot decide what's funny,
what's not funny,

3973
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:15,350
and that is one of the best examples of
it.

3974
03:02:15,360 --> 03:02:17,520
That African bit,
Ugh,

3975
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:20,100
huge change.
My like he.

3976
03:02:20,490 --> 03:02:21,620
It's simple.
It's funny,

3977
03:02:21,621 --> 03:02:23,610
it's a real,
it's a real topic.

3978
03:02:23,790 --> 03:02:26,070
And I actually sat there and thought it
went,

3979
03:02:26,430 --> 03:02:29,460
why don't,
why are they living in a fucking desert?

3980
03:02:29,470 --> 03:02:30,830
A retarded,
like what's,

3981
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:32,790
why can't they move?
This is stupid.

3982
03:02:32,791 --> 03:02:34,170
I don't get this.
Why don't you help them?

3983
03:02:34,171 --> 03:02:36,260
You're right next to him.
Don't feed them yet,

3984
03:02:37,450 --> 03:02:38,283
right?

3985
03:02:38,750 --> 03:02:40,990
Goddamn blanket.
It's not ready yet.

3986
03:02:41,030 --> 03:02:46,030
We skied is
such a great bit and again,

3987
03:02:47,090 --> 03:02:50,330
a great bit if it.
If someone did it in 2016,

3988
03:02:50,750 --> 03:02:55,750
but in the 84 revolutionary yeah,
85 maybe.

3989
03:02:57,620 --> 03:03:00,560
Maybe it'd be fucking revolutionary.

3990
03:03:00,680 --> 03:03:03,440
It's releasing you from the sanctimony.
There's two.

3991
03:03:03,441 --> 03:03:06,110
So much sanctum into your way down and
you know,

3992
03:03:06,140 --> 03:03:09,150
able to have an authentic reaction.
There's so much of yourself that you are

3993
03:03:09,151 --> 03:03:13,760
oppressing and it takes him and you see
that again through tend to architects

3994
03:03:13,761 --> 03:03:15,050
conversation.
We add that there.

3995
03:03:15,060 --> 03:03:17,720
Trickster,
the role of the tricks that I like that

3996
03:03:17,721 --> 03:03:22,190
comes up in native American meth is like
a coyote or the rave and or they say

3997
03:03:22,191 --> 03:03:26,330
that like even Christ is a tricks there
in moments in the bottle of these people

3998
03:03:26,720 --> 03:03:28,430
that I am,
that's not reality anymore,

3999
03:03:28,570 --> 03:03:30,870
other than that's a tricks the function
to go like,

4000
03:03:30,950 --> 03:03:33,170
you know,
you know that there's a prescribed way

4001
03:03:33,171 --> 03:03:35,810
that you're supposed to respond to that,
uh,

4002
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:38,120
African commercial.
Well look,

4003
03:03:38,121 --> 03:03:41,720
there's this alternative way of
responding to it and to present it

4004
03:03:41,721 --> 03:03:44,770
comedically,
so freed me.

4005
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:48,070
You freed me from reality is like an
unchanging.

4006
03:03:48,130 --> 03:03:49,240
And you know what's interesting about
him?

4007
03:03:49,241 --> 03:03:51,400
Did you ever read his brother's book?
Brother Sam.

4008
03:03:52,300 --> 03:03:54,520
His brother wrote a great book of Mine,
Sam,

4009
03:03:54,640 --> 03:03:59,640
and one of the things that he said is
Sam's like emergence of who he is.

4010
03:03:59,671 --> 03:04:02,810
He came out of a car accident.
He got hit by a truck when he was a

4011
03:04:02,811 --> 03:04:05,420
little kid and it changed his
personality,

4012
03:04:05,421 --> 03:04:10,370
radically hit a serious head injury.
You got knocked the fuck out and came

4013
03:04:10,371 --> 03:04:12,440
back fearless,
and that's a.

4014
03:04:12,441 --> 03:04:14,990
that's a common thing.
Impulsiveness,

4015
03:04:15,020 --> 03:04:18,770
fearlessness and rage.
These are con,

4016
03:04:18,860 --> 03:04:21,470
the constant themes that come out of
head trauma,

4017
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:25,070
so it's interesting like one of the most
important figures in the history of

4018
03:04:25,071 --> 03:04:29,270
standup comedy might have literally been
birthed because of trauma,

4019
03:04:29,450 --> 03:04:33,050
like physical brain trauma that's barely
and I never heard the

4020
03:04:35,240 --> 03:04:38,420
brain damaged pioneer for that head
injury.

4021
03:04:38,920 --> 03:04:40,340
Same would never have been discussed.

4022
03:04:40,360 --> 03:04:44,240
City was a different person like before
that he was like quiet and shy and a

4023
03:04:44,241 --> 03:04:47,030
normal kid and then Bam,
he gets hit by a car,

4024
03:04:47,031 --> 03:04:48,710
fucked up,
put in the hospital.

4025
03:04:48,711 --> 03:04:51,890
The whole deal comes out of that.
He doesn't give a fuck.

4026
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,260
He just tastes deaths.
I don't think that's it.

4027
03:04:54,330 --> 03:04:56,640
I still think it's a steal because a
pretty chat,

4028
03:04:56,930 --> 03:04:57,763
right?
Yeah.

4029
03:04:57,980 --> 03:04:59,990
Like what the fuck's he doing?
Good.

4030
03:04:59,991 --> 03:05:03,050
I had trauma drew in the moment,
but it was.

4031
03:05:03,170 --> 03:05:05,880
That was how we deliver
up

4032
03:05:07,390 --> 03:05:11,270
Jesus.
He had this explosive dynamic delivery

4033
03:05:11,630 --> 03:05:15,380
and I mean I don't want to attribute all
of it to to the head trauma because

4034
03:05:15,381 --> 03:05:18,370
obviously there was some genius
involvement is creativity.

4035
03:05:18,450 --> 03:05:19,990
You definitely blew my I.
I'm.

4036
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:20,511
No,
no,

4037
03:05:20,511 --> 03:05:20,781
no,
no.

4038
03:05:20,781 --> 03:05:22,310
It's not.
It's not a negative thing.

4039
03:05:23,400 --> 03:05:23,890
Look,
I've.

4040
03:05:23,890 --> 03:05:27,770
I've dealt with a lot of brain trauma
because I know a lot of people that have

4041
03:05:27,771 --> 03:05:29,930
gotten fucked up from fighting.

4042
03:05:30,170 --> 03:05:32,450
You know,
it's there's a real thing that happens

4043
03:05:32,451 --> 03:05:34,850
to people and you,
you hear about all the time when they do

4044
03:05:34,851 --> 03:05:38,550
these shows on nfl players who become
explosive and they,

4045
03:05:38,551 --> 03:05:42,890
they get crazy and impulsive and they
get very violent and some of that has to

4046
03:05:42,891 --> 03:05:45,710
do with repeated trauma to the head.
Well,

4047
03:05:45,711 --> 03:05:48,440
just one event,
one car accident,

4048
03:05:48,470 --> 03:05:52,790
one thing like that can literally change
your personality because it's a very

4049
03:05:52,791 --> 03:05:57,200
fragile dynamic of synapses and
personality.

4050
03:05:57,500 --> 03:06:02,500
Neurochemicals.
The brain's actual like the flow of

4051
03:06:02,751 --> 03:06:07,160
chemicals of neurochemistry and the
physical body itself and the way your

4052
03:06:07,161 --> 03:06:11,030
personality manifests itself.
All those things are directly connected

4053
03:06:11,240 --> 03:06:15,890
and an event like what happened to Sam
Kennison literally reshaped in art form.

4054
03:06:16,670 --> 03:06:18,320
Well,
about 10 people to get head trauma and

4055
03:06:18,321 --> 03:06:21,200
suddenly can speak perfect French.
Have you seen them on the Internet a

4056
03:06:21,480 --> 03:06:22,460
lot?
Yeah.

4057
03:06:22,461 --> 03:06:24,070
They knocked over the nuts.

4058
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:27,320
Come back with perfect French.
It's a common phenomenon and it can be

4059
03:06:27,321 --> 03:06:29,540
checked out online anytime.
Is that true?

4060
03:06:30,130 --> 03:06:33,170
They get really good at math.
They only speak French.

4061
03:06:33,171 --> 03:06:37,900
Does someone have to teach them from
mice with the risk little head trauma.

4062
03:06:38,390 --> 03:06:40,550
The downside is you've said he might
come back to the stream and the

4063
03:06:40,551 --> 03:06:42,650
aggressive or you might have a headache
forever.

4064
03:06:42,860 --> 03:06:46,040
It's also possible to set a lot easier
and quicker.

4065
03:06:46,041 --> 03:06:49,430
It's much quicker satisfaction and
getting them stupid books.

4066
03:06:49,490 --> 03:06:50,960
I don't have patience for them.
Books,

4067
03:06:50,961 --> 03:06:53,320
foreign accent syndrome.
Accent.

4068

4069
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:58,740
be a foreign accent.
Chinese teacher stroke.

4070
03:06:58,870 --> 03:07:00,150
Speaking English.
What about that?

4071
03:07:01,390 --> 03:07:02,910
How about that?
But it's the daily mail.

4072
03:07:02,940 --> 03:07:04,980
They might have just made that up.
So we'll click on it right now.

4073
03:07:06,480 --> 03:07:08,360
Motherfuckers,
um,

4074
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:11,220
I dunno because I do know we have to end
this though.

4075
03:07:11,221 --> 03:07:16,221
Unfortunately
checking for 23 hours and 20 minutes.

4076
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:21,050
I don't think I'm going to adjust to the
girlfriend.

4077
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:23,070
And stuff,
and be a normal person.

4078
03:07:23,220 --> 03:07:26,220
You're going to have to continue to keep
doing podcasts.

4079
03:07:26,221 --> 03:07:28,200
It's four slash 20.
What time do we come in here?

4080
03:07:28,370 --> 03:07:30,900
Jim and I had been here since 10:00 AM.
Five hours.

4081
03:07:31,530 --> 03:07:32,420
Six hours.
Yeah.

4082
03:07:32,490 --> 03:07:35,010
You and I've been doing this for six
calls to

4083
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:41,130
listen.
Then if you're ever in here again,

4084
03:07:41,131 --> 03:07:42,570
you've got an open invitation.
Of course.

4085
03:07:42,571 --> 03:07:45,510
You know you have an open invitation
anytime,

4086
03:07:45,511 --> 03:07:46,050
man,
please.

4087
03:07:46,050 --> 03:07:47,780
We've got to do this more often and
really.

4088
03:07:48,450 --> 03:07:49,340
Thanks man.
Alright,

4089
03:07:49,350 --> 03:07:50,700
you fucks.
That's it.

4090
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:53,700
I hope you enjoyed it.
My mind.

4091
03:07:54,680 --> 03:07:55,710
Wow.
That was.
