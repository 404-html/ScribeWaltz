1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,080
Three,
two,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,050
one.
John Ronson.

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,150
Welcome back Joe.
It's good to be back.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,010
Good to see you again.
Very good to be back.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,790
What's happening,
man?

6
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,920
How you been?
I've been good.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,410
A floating around this neighborhood.
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:21,411
I've spent a year on porn sets,
research,

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,960
research.
It did,

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,970
it was a lot.
My wife did say to me once a twisty 

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:27,970
really liked you really have to go to 
another.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,680
Uh,
it,

13
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,750
uh,
I've just,

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,930
I've just finished making a series for 
audible called the butterfly effect and 

15
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,761
the flap of the butterfly's wings,
which I'm tracing throughout the series 

16
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:44,511
is um,
is this young man called Fabian who's 

17
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:49,191
like a tech nerd in Brussels and he has 
the idea to get rich from giving the 

18
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:52,620
world free porn.
So free streaming porn.

19
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:56,280
So the series is about the kind of tech 
takeover of porn in the valley.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,430
I know that that's the real.

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,410
Oh No,
this one's everywhere.

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:01,830
Yeah,
no,

23
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:03,480
that was bad.
That was back in the day that I was like

24
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:08,481
in the nineties.
So Fabian Fabian gave the world pornhub 

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,750
and fiction.
No,

26
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:11,160
no,
this is,

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,430
this is so true.
So.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Okay,
I'll let me go back.

29
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,330
So in the nineties,
this kid called Fabian Fabian Tillman as

30
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,490
a young boy in Brussels,
like a tech nerd,

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,890
uh,
would let go and compuserve and swap 

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,951
porn and so get porn for free like that,
which is how people got for back in the 

33
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,810
nineties.
Um,

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,390
and then he had like a sort of Eureka 
moment,

35
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:40,950
which is I can,
I can give the world youtube for porn.

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Right?
So he brought up this fledgling company 

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,580
in Montreal called uh,
um,

38
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,770
it was called Mansef at the time.
It was run by these two brothers up in 

39
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,140
Montreal and they had just invented 
Pornhub,

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,860
uh,
Fabian bought a porn hub and then kind 

41
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,890
of overnight singlehandedly took over 
the valley.

42
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,440
The,
it's an extraordinary story.

43
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,820
This massive flow of money went from 
where we are now in the valley,

44
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,330
a community of people who were making 
pretty good money from porn.

45
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,920
The money just load into Fabian's 
pocket,

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,370
uh,
because what Fabian did was,

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,500
um,
well look,

48
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:27,501
if you're,
if you're a porn star and you go to a 

49
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:27,900
bank and say,
can I have a checking account?

50
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,900
You see a porn star or porn stir upon,
well,

51
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,910
I said a porn star,
but actually there aren't really many 

52
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,541
porn stars anymore.
If you're a poor person and you go to a 

53
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,440
bank and he say,
can I have a checking account?

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,820
The bank manager will usually say no 
because you're in porn,

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,550
which means your disreputable.
Really?

56
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,890
Yes.
People,

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,360
people like story.
I've written about this a lot about how 

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,360
they found it really hard to get 
mortgages.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,031
How did they find it?
Hard to get checking accounts with 

60
00:02:59,031 --> 00:02:59,031
checking accounts.
That seems unlikely.

61
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:00,100
I mean I would.
That may be mortgages.

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,620
They would think that your business is 
fairly unstable.

63
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:05,500
That kind of makes sense as far as 
investments are concerned

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,540
and also the idea that other people have
the customers might not like the idea 

65
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:14,940
that are high street bank is being 
shared with somebody who's in bone.

66
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,940
Really?
Yes.

67
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,500
Go reputational risk.
Wow.

68
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,920
That seems really dumb to me.
Doesn't make any sense at all.

69
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,250
Right?
Well,

70
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,330
sure.
Um,

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,080
but Fabian was making money from running
a site that doubt in the,

72
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,920
in,
in piracy.

73
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,980
So the funds would upload pole and 
illegally onto pornhub.

74
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,540
So Fabian was running this site that was
failed with pirated content.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Uh,
Fabian went to a bank to say I want to 

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,510
expand,
but because he wasn't extensively a poor

77
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,560
person,
he was a tech person who was deemed to 

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,970
be respectable.
This bank gave him a $362,000,000

79
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,320
loan to expand,
uh,

80
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,110
to build an empire based in part on the 
handling of stolen porn.

81
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,530
So we went to the valley who will,
who already kind of paranoid that all 

82
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,940
poor and was being stolen and put up 
onto pornhub and he bought up all the 

83
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,530
loads of companies that cut price 
because the companies were like 

84
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:20,530
panicking.
I wanted to sell.

85
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,370
I'm certainly fabian just single 
handedly,

86
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,770
like took her for porn.
Um,

87
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,610
so I wanted,
and nobody cares about that.

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Nobody was thinking about the 
consequences of that because Fabian was 

89
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,810
given the world what they wanted to.
It's risk free porn.

90
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,400
Um,
but I was really curious to know level,

91
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,250
but when it comes to let me know.

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,700
Pause there.
You said no one cares about it.

93
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,380
No,
but a lot of people did.

94
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,381
It was a huge issue and there was a lot 
of like moral debate around weapons 

95
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,560
stopping poem,
you know,

96
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,880
there's a lot of the girls that were in 
porn that were really pissed off because

97
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,740
they weren't making any money anymore 
and they were,

98
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:58,741
there was a lot of social media posts 
about it imploring people to stop using 

99
00:04:58,741 --> 00:04:59,530
these sites,
which no one listened to.

100
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,330
Exactly.
People cat pulled and consumers didn't.

101
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,420
Well it was a,
it was an interesting tech,

102
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,340
like a moral tech debate that was going 
on for awhile.

103
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,610
But the debate is lost.
I mean,

104
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:13,550
there was a,
um,

105
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,060
it's really interesting because there 
was a guy who lived down the street from

106
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:21,061
me and he was a big time porn producer 
and I actually knew him from my Jujitsu 

107
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,420
class and he was a real high role in 
sort of character.

108
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:30,421
Like he always had this beautiful 
Mercedes Benz and he wore these really 

109
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:33,961
big watches,
a lot of fancy clothes and he was just 

110
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:38,070
making just tons of money and he had 
this beautiful house and he was just 

111
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,680
this baller character.
And then it all dried up,

112
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,870
dried up quick.
Yeah.

113
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,300
It went well.
Went into lost his house.

114
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,440
His house got repossessed.

115
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,530
Yeah.
And Fabian got so rich because of this,

116
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,770
because the money went from the orphans 
pocket into Fabian's pocket.

117
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,610
Fabian got so rich that how's he rich 
off of free streaming.

118
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,160
So the ads,
it was partly because of ads,

119
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,070
but partly because he brought up the 
paid sites as well.

120
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,430
So you know,
because the paid sites were like 

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,430
panicking because they were losing all 
their money to piracy.

122
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,300
Bought up everything.
So we brought up the competition.

123
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:16,301
He bought it redtube youporn.
So he bought up all the competition to 

124
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:19,490
Pornhub,
but he also bought loads of paid sites.

125
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,620
Be like playboy TV.
So your friend got so poor that his 

126
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,331
house got repossessed.
Fabian got so rich that he installed in 

127
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:31,601
his house and aquarium.
That was so big that it diver had to 

128
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,190
come every week and dive in and clean 
the coral reef.

129
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,920
You know,
you're doing well when you get your 

130
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:41,920
diver.

131
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:41,920
That's weird.
Yeah.

132
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,030
So yeah,
you're right.

133
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:49,031
Porn people cared a lot,
but the outside world didn't care 

134
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:52,751
because you know,
the outside world doesn't care where 

135
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:52,751
music's getting pirated.
So they show this powder.

136
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:53,480
Carolyn,
it's porn.

137
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,510
Well,
they care a little bit about the music 

138
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,041
thing,
but the porn thing got almost no 

139
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,261
traction in when the porn industry is 
essentially for the most part collapsed 

140
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,450
or at least there was a massive amount 
of loss.

141
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,780
There was no talk about like some sort 
of a bail out or anything silly like 

142
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:10,780
that.
I was like,

143
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,810
no,
that is gone.

144
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,050
Right.
Like many other industries were bailed 

145
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,050
out.
And when you look at that are smaller,

146
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,460
right?
When you look at their headquarters up 

147
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,460
in Montreal or the company that owned 
pole,

148
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,650
now it's not poorly.
It's techie.

149
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,020
So your work.
And Fabian actually said to me,

150
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,810
quite tellingly,
he said yes.

151
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,430
He said it was amazing.
You wouldn't even know that we will have

152
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,370
input unless you went to the wrong 
floor.

153
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,340
Now he seems like a guy who's well aware
of his crime.

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,540
Yeah,
I mean Fabian say if it wasn't me,

155
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,480
it,
it'd be somebody else.

156
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,790
What does that mean?
Um,

157
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,410
and it sounds like a good thing to say 
after you kill somebody.

158
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,450
I did say,
um,

159
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,270
it's progress,
he'd call it progress,

160
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
but it's,
he's a criminal.

161
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,110
I mean it's essentially he's lucky that 
he's dealing in pirated stuff,

162
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,190
right?
The one time Fabian got annoyed with me.

163
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,280
He was quite game like I wanted to,
I wanted to interview him and then I 

164
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,791
wanted to travel to the valley to look 
at the consequences and untraced 

165
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:13,331
consequence through to consequence.
Like where would I end up if I just 

166
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:14,480
because I think people don't think about
consequences on the Internet that much.

167
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,560
They want to just,
you know,

168
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,870
destroy somebody and then carry on with 
their day.

169
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,350
So I wanted to tell a story about 
consequences that the only time Fabian 

170
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,070
got annoyed with me was when,
um,

171
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,020
either me or Mike Quasar director said 
to him,

172
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,560
you know,
you uploaded pirated porn.

173
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,370
And he said,
no,

174
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:34,040
I didn't.
I've never uploaded pirated porn.

175
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,430
I offer a surface in which of the people
can upload pirated poured.

176
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,650
And if they tell us to take it down,
we'll take it down.

177
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,870
Which is they have to find it,
they have to find it,

178
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,810
and also there's so much fucking 
freeport and I'm pulling that.

179
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,270
It's like cutting down the forest with a
butter knife.

180
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,670
It's impossible to.
You can,

181
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,930
you can say take down my partner Paul,
and they'll say okay.

182
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:02,931
So he found.
But then there's like a million other 

183
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:03,810
people's report up there anyway yet.

184
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,740
So actually it's funny.
I don't,

185
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
by the way,
what I'm about to say shouldn't be 

186
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,400
construed as me saying that I think that
Fabian is a psychopath because I don't.

187
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,400
But that thing about not taking 
responsibility for your own actions.

188
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:19,401
I just remembered,
I wrote a book a few years ago about 

189
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,111
psychopaths called the psychopath test 
and a psychopathic trait is that like if

190
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,750
somebody killed somebody in a bar,
they would say,

191
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,450
well it's his fault for looking at me.
Funny.

192
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
So failure to accept responsibility for 
our own actions is one of the 20 items 

193
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,180
on the psychopath.
Jack,

194
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,740
do you think it is a psychopath or do 
you think it's some sort of a con?

195
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Convenient neglecting have certain 
responsibility for what happened?

196
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,160
He did.
I don't think Fabian,

197
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:49,161
that was very much a tangential thing 
because I don't think Fabian is a 

198
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:49,161
psychopath at all,
but um,

199
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,350
I think that tech people have created a 
sort of a moral bubble around 

200
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,410
themselves.

201
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,330
I talked to the head of a porn hub's Mo 
bow division.

202
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,560
So if you've ever watched his called 
Brandon,

203
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,190
if you've ever watched a porn hub on 
your mobile,

204
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:09,430
you have brandon to thank and I said to 
brandon,

205
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Brandon said like,
we never like 99 percent of pornhub 

206
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,890
employees never set foot on a porn set.
And he said,

207
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:19,380
that's good because you know,
we're designing,

208
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,080
you know,
with search engine people were,

209
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,440
you know,
we don't want to say it would be a,

210
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:27,000
it would be sort of unpleasant to set 
foot there would be sort of intimidating

211
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,520
and unpleasant.
And I said,

212
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,610
well maybe,
maybe it would've been good if more porn

213
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,620
hub people did set foot on porn sets 
because you would be able to see the 

214
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,840
negative consequences of your business 
plan.

215
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,260
And Brendan went their livelihood,
which again is a very tacky thing to 

216
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:43,800
say,
right?

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,680
Because it's all about,
it's all about progress,

218
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,080
their livelihood.
Yeah.

219
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,320
What does it mean by that?
Like,

220
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,330
okay,
now you want to talk about their 

221
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:54,330
livelihood,
their livelihood people.

222
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,700
Yeah.
But I mean they're essentially like a 

223
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:57,700
content provider that's not paying for 
any content.

224
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,580
Yeah.
And um,

225
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,350
yeah.
So,

226
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,470
uh,
yeah,

227
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:07,830
I just remembered a guy called David 
lowery who's a WHO's a,

228
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:09,600
um,
uh,

229
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,170
he's,
he's interested in kind of piracy issue 

230
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,170
in,
in music.

231
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,040
And he said when we look back on the 
dystopian movies of the 19 thirties 

232
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,730
where machines will take over like 
metropolis or something like the moral 

233
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,600
of the film that the climax of the film 
is when the people,

234
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,480
the humans,
a defeat say,

235
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:30,840
you know,
I,

236
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,180
we're not going to live in a world run 
by machines.

237
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:36,240
We're going to defeat the machines and 
human morality or takeover.

238
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,060
But now that machines are ruling the 
world,

239
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,170
instead of us defeating the machines,
we are adapting our morality to fit in 

240
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:50,310
with the machines capability.
So because it is easy to pirate,

241
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,610
instead of saying let's not pirate,
we're just adapting a morality and 

242
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:55,610
saying,

243
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:55,610
oh,
okay.

244
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,120
And we can watch pirated porn.
It's kind of,

245
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
yeah,
but it's not as simple as pirating 

246
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,200
because pirating is what everybody does 
on,

247
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,350
you know,
when,

248
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:06,010
when they're sharing it through message 
boards or what have you,

249
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,040
that's sort of pirating right when 
they're uploading it to these websites 

250
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,931
and servers and stuff.
But what he's doing is massively 

251
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:19,621
profiting off of other people's work.
It's a little bit of a more of a gray 

252
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:20,140
area.
Yeah,

253
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,960
I'd say so.
He's not even gray,

254
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,730
Kinda dark when

255
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,730
he certainly profited hugely from other 
people pirating their favorite porn 

256
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,560
films onto his side because he had been 
sued.

257
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,140
Uh,
he got into,

258
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,930
he got arrested for tax evasion.
Uh,

259
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,150
and that's how we got out of the 
business eventually.

260
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:42,060
But I think that woke up,
that old got solved.

261
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm not sure if he ever got sued because
if somebody says to him,

262
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,330
if somebody said to him,
like,

263
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,490
take down my,
my,

264
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,260
you know,
bad babysitters.

265
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,680
Volume two is mine.
I say that because I was actually on the

266
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:55,020
set of bad babysitters volume two.
Uh,

267
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,220
he'd say,
oh,

268
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:56,670
sure.
Yeah,

269
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:57,480
sorry,
of course.

270
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,730
And it would go down,
but then maybe somebody else will put it

271
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:04,731
up later that day or you know,
and it didn't matter because everything 

272
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:04,731
else was very,
uh,

273
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,950
I tell you one amazing consequences of 
all of this though.

274
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,520
Um,
so what I wanted to do in this order for

275
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:15,000
series a butterfly effect was to kind of
trace the consequences of this,

276
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,270
know what was the tornadoes that were 
being created on one amazing consequence

277
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,930
is like Fabian surrounded himself with a
tech wizards.

278
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,190
Let people who knew how the Internet 
worked,

279
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,840
including a lot of search engine people.
So instead of making porn films like 

280
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:37,630
they made in the nineties,
um,

281
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,890
this porn director,
Mike Quasar said to me that the first 

282
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,760
film he ever made back in the nineties 
was called women of influence.

283
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,710
Now all the poem films have to be easily
searchable.

284
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:54,711
It's,
it's like a kind of arms race of search 

285
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,781
engine optimization.
Like to get yourself up the google 

286
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:56,781
rankings.
Uh,

287
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,910
so all the porn films in the valley 
aren't called women of influence because

288
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,690
how do you search for that?
They're there.

289
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,870
They basically see what the most popular
search terms and then make films based 

290
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,851
on that.
So Mike Quasar was telling me this on 

291
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:10,851
the set of the film he was shooting that
day,

292
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:15,020
which was stepdaughter cheerleader orgy.
So I said,

293
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,550
so I said to just is just around the 
corner.

294
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,950
So I said to Mike,
so there,

295
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,040
because I thought about light women of 
influence versus stepdaughter 

296
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,361
cheerleader orgy a look.
I haven't seen women of influence.

297
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:35,391
So for all I know the moral of women of 
influences that women shouldn't have 

298
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:39,141
influenced,
but my guess is that women have 

299
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:39,141
influence is more kind of holistic 
poured,

300
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:40,650
filmed and stepdaughter cheerleader 
orgy.

301
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,980
So I said to Mike,
are there any people in the valley who 

302
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,631
like,
can't get work because they're just not 

303
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:51,970
a keyword?
And my one,

304
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,110
yeah,
like every asshole porn actress now 

305
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:02,141
between the ages of 23 and 29 can't get 
work because they're not a teen and 

306
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,861
they're not a MILF.
They're like in this sort of fallow 

307
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:12,611
periods between teen and MILF when 
they're just attractive and just 

308
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,980
attractive isn't a searchable term.
So if you're not a teen and you're not a

309
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:20,981
MILF,
if you're like a 26 year old adult film 

310
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:20,981
actress,
you can't get work.

311
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:22,640
You just have to lie.
Well,

312
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,160
I said to Mike,
what do you do?

313
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:27,100
Do you just like sit there until you 
become a MILF?

314
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,460
Become employable again.
The answers they have to find other ways

315
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:36,461
to make money.
So escorting is going through the roof 

316
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:36,461
and in the Valley A.
Yeah,

317
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:40,771
because of the tech,
because people like Fabian because of 

318
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:40,771
the tech takeover of porn.
Escorting is going through the roof.

319
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:45,020
But also another thing that's going 
through the roof is this kind of weirdly

320
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,230
adorable world of bespoke porn.

321
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,760
Yeah.
And that's what the article will.

322
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,210
What was the,
uh,

323
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,900
publication who published that article 
with The Guardian?

324
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:57,100
I did like a written version of one of 
the episodes of the show.

325
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,270
I just stumbled upon it,
you know,

326
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,730
knowing that you going to be here.
I didn't even know you wrote it.

327
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:03,830
I was reading it and as I was reading I 
was like,

328
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:04,460
oh,
John wrote,

329
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:08,180
this is what an amazing did you know 
about this world?

330
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,610
Know on your ride in Portland,
here in the valley.

331
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:17,611
So yeah,
it's a pretty fascinating and explain 

332
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,921
what it is.
Like people literally will request some 

333
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:24,551
of the most bizarre things and these 
people will make custom films based on 

334
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,240
their weird kinks

335
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,350
just for them,
like a team of professional porn people 

336
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,340
because the valley suffering so much 
because of pornhub and so on.

337
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,610
We'll make an entire porn film just for 
you

338
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,260
now.
How much does something like this cost?

339
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:43,261
Like say if you want to make a film 
about girls when mutant Ninja turtle 

340
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,760
outfits who kit guys in the balls,
like that's entirely possible,

341
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:47,450
right?
Yeah.

342
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,130
Oh yeah.
Anything's possible.

343
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,430
But that sounds like something that 
might actually sell at the yet.

344
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,550
Oh yeah.
They got like a couple of thousand 

345
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:57,550
dollars.
That's it.

346
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:57,590
Yeah.
A couple grand.

347
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,120
Yeah.
Wow.

348
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Uh,
I got so obsessed with the world of 

349
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,941
bespoke porn because it was such a 
fascinating window into people's inner 

350
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,820
lives.
Like one of the first ones I saw was,

351
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,910
um,
was a condiments video,

352
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,950
ketchup and relish and stuff like that.
So it's a,

353
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,310
it's a woman sitting in a,
in a,

354
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in a,
like a child's paddling pool and out of 

355
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,880
shots.
What are the bespoke porn producers is 

356
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,090
pouring industrial sized tubs of 
condiments on her head,

357
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:34,860
like ketchup,
mustard and what's.

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,130
And the woman's like tried to,
you know,

359
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,390
she's being,
she's engaged.

360
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,060
So she's going,
oh,

361
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,910
it's so cold and slimy stuff.
Anyway,

362
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:46,110
the guy who commissioned this video,
the producers knew one thing about him.

363
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,590
He's a restauranteur who with continents
every day.

364
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,150
How weird and has to,
you know,

365
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,670
presumably for situations like that 
happening in this restaurant.

366
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,350
So he just sits around thinking like as 
customers sitting down a lot,

367
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,670
I like the score to her with some 
mayonnaise.

368
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,590
Just lather up with cash or maybe it's 
stress,

369
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,600
maybe it's like,
oh my God,

370
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,800
if this type of mayonnaise for 
something,

371
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,610
we'll go,
fuck.

372
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,840
We get sued.
Yeah.

373
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,860
With doom.
Didn't like that'd be like cleaning 

374
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:21,860
pill.
I,

375
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,040
maybe it's like maybe his release says 
to do this.

376
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,350
Um,
wow.

377
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,750
Another one was a Norwegian man,
um,

378
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,540
has spent 40 years amassing of valuable 
stamp collection on his bespoke porn 

379
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:43,461
film.
Was descent his stamp collection to the 

380
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:46,641
valley with three naked porn women would
destroy his stamp collection.

381
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,330
Whoa.
Yes.

382
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,790
Baker,
that's a steal from it.

383
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,270
I'm A.
Yeah.

384
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,190
How much does the stamp collection 
worth?

385
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,260
Well,
lot.

386
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,900
Well it turns out because we managed to 
track down stamps,

387
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:05,901
man,
and he talked to us off to a lot of 

388
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:05,950
persuasion.
Uh,

389
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,000
and he's got 10 books of stamps.
Um,

390
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:14,001
once a year he sends one to accustom 
woodsy.

391
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
So that's his thing.
Yeah,

392
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:21,201
it turns out it's because he grew up in 
Iceland where stamp collecting was a 

393
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,480
popular hobby at the time in like the 
seventies and the eighties.

394
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,780
A stamp collecting was big.
So,

395
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,900
uh,
he became like an obsessive stamp 

396
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:32,900
collector.
The stamp shop owners would say,

397
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,861
Oh,
if you buy this standards can be very 

398
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:37,830
valuable in 20 years.
But then came the internet and it killed

399
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:42,831
off the stump.
Is it killed off stamp collecting as a 

400
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:42,831
hoppy light?
Yeah.

401
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:46,220
Nerds apparently felt like other other 
things to be interested in.

402
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:51,221
And you know,
the thrill of the chase just wasn't 

403
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:51,221
there anymore.
Like you can easily pack.

404
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:51,420
Yeah.
So anyway,

405
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,710
so his stamps lost all of their value.
The stamp stores closed down,

406
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,820
that kind of collegial atmosphere of 
fellow stamp collectors just vanished.

407
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,800
Uh,
he began to like,

408
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,100
you know,
regret his life choices of like spending

409
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,930
all that time and money collecting 
stamps.

410
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,200
He began to feel depressed and isolated.
So he went to a CSI Chi atrust who told 

411
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,090
them that stamp collecting is 
ridiculous,

412
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:20,091
hoppy because it isolates him.
So now he pays porn people to destroy 

413
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:27,231
his stamps.
The psychiatrist told them that a hobby 

414
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:27,231
is ridiculous.
Yep.

415
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:29,940
According to him,
I'm not ever talked to the psychiatrist,

416
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,170
but according to him,
yeah,

417
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:33,450
he said that stamp collecting is a 
ridiculous hobby.

418
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,300
That seems like a ridiculous thing for a
psychologist to say.

419
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,380
Sounds.
Yeah.

420
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,990
Bad Psychology.
Enjoys it.

421
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:40,950
Yeah.
If you're,

422
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,360
if you have all your ducks in a row and 
everything is firing on all cylinders,

423
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:50,361
but you really truly enjoy stamps poos 
who's to tell you there's something 

424
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:51,160
wrong with that?
Well,

425
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:51,730
the only.
I mean,

426
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,110
one good thing that came out of it was,
um,

427
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,040
he really enriched the imaginations of 
the people in the valley.

428
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,590
And also my imagination too,
I mean stamps man,

429
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,260
because all the custom producers talk,
you know,

430
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,580
and stamps man with such a mystery to 
them all.

431
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,880
So you know,
so at least he destroys the stamps now 

432
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,970
in a way that's beneficial to him.
Was so intriguing.

433
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,920
Yeah.
Isn't it amazing?

434
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,360
But it's all weird,
right?

435
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,670
Well it's also quite sad.
We,

436
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:26,671
I'm Dan and Rhiana and who made one of 
the stamps videos called us just as we 

437
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:31,501
were finishing our series and rhiannon 
was in tears and they just had a request

438
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,740
and the request was for a guy,
a guy wanted a porn woman to sit cross 

439
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:42,430
legged on the floor,
fully clothed and say into the camera,

440
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,600
you are loved.
Things may be bad now,

441
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:50,800
but they won't always be.
And suicide is not the answer.

442
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,230
Yeah.
So then they,

443
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,160
they felt,
fuck,

444
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:59,161
what do we do?
So they told him they'd make the video 

445
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:00,040
for him and they could shoot it really 
soon.

446
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,590
And he didn't,
he didn't respond.

447
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,780
So they made it anyway.

448
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,530
And we were there to record it.
And uh,

449
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,440
and it was very,
it made me realize just how kind of 

450
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,190
delightful the bespoke porn world is 
because they were so eager to,

451
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,490
to help this guy.
Did he jumps off?

452
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,830
We don't know.
They made the video for him.

453
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,260
Uh,
the woman,

454
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,020
the porn star,
Riley was saying into the camera,

455
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:31,520
you know,
I have thought about dying too,

456
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,480
but I came out of that hole,
you know,

457
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:37,240
and I came back stronger and now I can 
see all the good in the world.

458
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:42,241
And Riley was crying and Rihanna and the
producer was crying and they sent the 

459
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:45,700
video to the guy and we don't know,
you know,

460
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:50,701
it's interesting.
There's quite a few porn stars on 

461
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:50,950
twitter that have,
you know,

462
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,400
are really like kind of motivational 
twitter feeds.

463
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,670
Like they say nice things.
They say positive things.

464
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,000
So those,
they seem like healthy people and if you

465
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:05,680
separate the fact that they have sex on 
film for a living,

466
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,980
take that out of the mix.
And what you have is like,

467
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,720
looks like your average person who's 
trying to do better in this world and is

468
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:18,190
sharing positive things that they find.
It gives them inspiration and moves them

469
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:20,050
along in a certain way.
And,

470
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:25,590
but then you add the sex thing,
and for whatever reason we have this 

471
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,510
weird hangup about sex.
It's because we're all fucked up.

472
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,790
I,
I talked to this girl called Dakota,

473
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,720
who was part of a radical honesty group 
and radical honesty.

474
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:37,820
Have you come across rabbit?
No,

475
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,310
I don't think so.
You would love it.

476
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:42,450
I might be in one own and no,
it can I take a radical honest.

477
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Okay.
Were the first time I ever heard about 

478
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,460
radical honesty.

479
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,280
Um,
my friend's Starlee kine at the 

480
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,050
podcaster who went on a radical honesty 
group.

481
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:53,360
And one of the things you have to do run
a podcast.

482
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,430
Yeah.
She does a podcast called mystery show.

483
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,860
She used to be on this American life 
anyway.

484
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,460
So she went to a radical honesty group.
Uh,

485
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,320
we have to be radically honest to each 
other.

486
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:07,160
So at how it starts,
I've been touring as well.

487
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,340
It starts with everybody's sitting in a 
circle and they have to confess to the 

488
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:17,180
room a secret about themselves that 
they've never told anyone.

489
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,690
So the one that started,
went to the first guy said,

490
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,720
uh,
my secret is that I haven't paid taxes 

491
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,710
in 10 years.
And so everyone went,

492
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,270
oh,
and then the next guy said,

493
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,210
my secret is that I killed a man.
Yet he said I was in a truck.

494
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I was driving a truck and I kicked the 
passenger out of the truck and he fell 

495
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:48,941
onto the road and he got run over and I 
got away with it and nobody,

496
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:51,650
you know,
nobody knows that it was murder.

497
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:57,290
So then the next person in the circle,
when will my,

498
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:02,291
uh,
my secrets so disappointing compared to 

499
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:02,291
that,
uh,

500
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,610
she said,
I suppose I can tell you that I have sex

501
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,490
with my cat.
So then the,

502
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,510
um,
murderer kind of put his hand up and 

503
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:12,690
said,
disgusting.

504
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,080
Now,
so can I add somebody decent?

505
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,920
Could I add to my who should be sharing 
with you,

506
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,190
saw the officer.
He said,

507
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
could I add something to my secret?
He said,

508
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:24,530
um,
I also have sex with my cat.

509
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,420
So anyway,
yeah,

510
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,490
one upper.
Yeah.

511
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:29,190
He had to,
like,

512
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,070
he had to be the best secret in the 
room.

513
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,770
Here might be a bullshit artist.
It's possible.

514
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,300
That's part of the problem with those.
Yeah.

515
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,460
I should say,
by the way,

516
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:42,461
I met Brad Blanton,
the guy who runs these radical honesty 

517
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:45,581
groups,
and I asked him whether Starley story 

518
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:45,581
was true,
uh,

519
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:45,890
and he said yes.

520
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,450
That's the way she described that 
circle.

521
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:49,110
This is what happened.
But,

522
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,180
so I was at this radical honesty group 
in this church school in New Orleans,

523
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:58,810
and this girl called Dakota said that 
her secret was that she was,

524
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,930
she's this young church girl.
She said her secret was actually watched

525
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:05,660
porn.
So I said,

526
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,850
what did you watch?
You Watch it on?

527
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:08,730
And she said,
hub,

528
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,680
of course,
this is how,

529
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,380
like every child in the world learns 
about sex these days.

530
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,950
And I said,
did you ever get so into it that you 

531
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:17,950
would like learn their names?
You'd say,

532
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:17,950
Oh,
there's James Dean.

533
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,920
And she said,
no,

534
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:19,220
no,
no.

535
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:20,360
She kind of laughed.
And she said,

536
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,430
no,
I never learned their names.

537
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,940
It's like when you kill a deer,
you don't name it because then you can't

538
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:30,941
eat it.
So this is what the poor people are up 

539
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:30,941
against.

540
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:30,941
Right.
It's this shame of,

541
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:33,410
of the,
of the viewer is like in,

542
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,830
in that hypocrisy lies,
exploitation,

543
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:41,150
which is why somebody like Fabian can 
come in and get a $300,000,000

544
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:46,151
loan and take over porn.
It's because we don't want to think 

545
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:46,440
about it because it makes us feel bad 
about ourselves.

546
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,140
But that sort of thing.
But her,

547
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,160
her issue is like church going plus 
female.

548
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,730
Whereas men,
they have very specific tastes and they 

549
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,080
tend to gravitate towards very specific 
porn stars.

550
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:06,081
Like one of the things that I've noticed
that really popular porn stars will have

551
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,830
like gigantic numbers on like social 
media,

552
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,860
twitter or instagram,
like upwards of a million and maybe more

553
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,380
like.
And so they obviously have a following,

554
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,790
you know?
Yeah.

555
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,270
You know,
you said that a lot of poem women on 

556
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,270
twitter,
kind of a positive.

557
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,840
And the interventional messages,
one of the reasons why that is,

558
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,150
I met this,
um,

559
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,520
porn woman called macy may who was like 
really depressed.

560
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,920
Another Fabian's consequences is that,
that kids grow up on,

561
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,760
on pornhub these days.
So there's no longer that kind of outlaw

562
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:46,761
status about coming to the valley to do 
porn that they used to be in like the 

563
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:46,910
eighties and nineties.
Now,

564
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:50,000
you know,
the valleys like flooded with women who,

565
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,760
who,
you know,

566
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,920
they turn 18,
they watch porn out,

567
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,180
they think that looks cool and then they
come to the valley and,

568
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,200
and a negative consequence to that is 
that they get work for like a couple of 

569
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,390
weeks and then,
you know,

570
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:05,391
there's loads more women off the bus and
so the producers don't need to employ 

571
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:09,051
them anymore.
So there's a massive turnaround to get 

572
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:10,290
work for a few weeks and then it's over.
So I met this woman called macy May,

573
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:14,280
who was in that funk lack.
She came in May throughout May.

574
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:19,281
She was working,
I met her in July and the worker just 

575
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:19,281
dried up,
uh,

576
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,490
and she,
she was like venting on twitter and,

577
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:27,120
but then she stopped venting and then 
all of her tweets were like,

578
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,380
I'm so happy.

579
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,180
It's such a beautiful day.
And I said,

580
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:32,040
why did you stop venting on twitter?
And she said,

581
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:37,041
well,
a bunch of porn producers told me it 

582
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:37,041
looked bad for my brand.
Um,

583
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,640
that,
you know,

584
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:43,641
they don't,
they don't want us sort of miserable 

585
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:44,730
poor person saying I'm not getting work 
today.

586
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,340
They want to pull person who says,
here's a picture of my butt.

587
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,750
Uh,
and isn't that unhealthy right there?

588
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:55,080
This is what we've turn twitter into.
We've turned into this thing where we're

589
00:28:55,081 --> 00:29:00,000
not allowed to be ourselves or to tell 
the truth about ourselves.

590
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,860
Well,
in this particular example maybe,

591
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,530
but I mean,
I think it's an inherently,

592
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,340
for whatever reason,
in,

593
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,800
in my estimation and many others,
a depressing business.

594
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,260
Yeah.
And I don't know why.

595
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,300
I mean,
for a lot of people,

596
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:18,270
the idea of young girl going into porn 
is depressing.

597
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,130
You know,
like I have daughters.

598
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,580
Your idea of my daughter's going into 
porn is very depressing.

599
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,430
No,
but I've met porn stars and seem nice.

600
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,530
They seem happy.
So I mean,

601
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,860
but why is it that it's.
Everybody wants to have sex,

602
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,790
but if you have sex on film.
Yeah.

603
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,220
And everybody gets to wash the shame.
Yeah.

604
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,130
Yeah.
It's weird.

605
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,700
It's a weird side effect of our 
civilizations.

606
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,910
The shame coming in from,
from the outside looking in.

607
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:50,911
There's no shame when I was on the set 
of stepdaughter cheerleader orgy,

608
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,660
which was quite close to where we are 
now,

609
00:29:55,661 --> 00:30:00,580
probably like a mile away from here,
but up in the hills and um,

610
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,230
it was a kind of familial bubble.
Like everyone must be nice to each other

611
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,300
and was happy.
But Mike,

612
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,330
the director needed to get an 
establishing shots if the cheerleaders 

613
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,230
arriving home from cheerleader practice.
So we went outside.

614
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,530
They were wearing their cheerleader 
outfits and some teenagers had caught 

615
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,950
onto what was happening at a porn film 
was being shot,

616
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,970
like up on a nearby hill.
And they were like cat calling and 

617
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,760
hissing and sort of mocking these girls.
And for the first time,

618
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,890
not just the girls,
but the camera man,

619
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,920
the director,
everybody suddenly felt like self 

620
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:34,920
conscious and the girls were like,
you know,

621
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,260
sort of try to put guys.
So until the mocking outside is came 

622
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,150
along,
it was healthy and shame free.

623
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,640
But as soon as an outsider started 
hissing at them,

624
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:47,780
it became shameful.
And I think that's,

625
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,040
that's,
that's poor.

626
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:54,041
And for you,
like most of the problems that poor 

627
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,590
people face,
a stigma from the outside,

628
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,400
not from the community itself,
which tends to be quite respectful.

629
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,070
And the people that were mocking them,
first of all,

630
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:08,071
they're young teenagers and second of 
all they're probably thinking of it in 

631
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,240
terms of like,
almost like their online.

632
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

633
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,620
I mean like one of the things about 
online is there's no consequences for 

634
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,740
what you're saying.
And then people have no problem shitting

635
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:19,510
on people.
We couldn't see them.

636
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,940
We could only hear them.
I was looking,

637
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:27,050
looking up and I couldn't say them 
because they were up on like a rich 

638
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,790
about the house.
Uh,

639
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,520
yes.
So just almost like being anonymous.

640
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

641
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,400
I mean,
anonymous people online,

642
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,420
it's,
the behavior is very bizarre because 

643
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,660
like sometimes I'll see people's 
comments,

644
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:45,550
whether it's to me or to somebody else 
and they're so fucking vicious and nasty

645
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,580
over nothing over,
nothing over nothing.

646
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,990
Yeah.
You know,

647
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,280
someone's movie that they did or some 
album that they did or whatever it was.

648
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,280
And she,
uh,

649
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,590
shitting all over every aspect of their 
purse just almost,

650
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:02,530
just to try to get them to hurt the way 
they're hurting,

651
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,450
you know,
that's almost what it seems like.

652
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:08,770
It's like you're just like super angry,
bitter person.

653
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:13,330
It's just life is just throwing rocks at
them everywhere they go and every chance

654
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,950
they get throw rock back.
They do.

655
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,670
Yeah.
That,

656
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,990
that random even song.
I,

657
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,330
I just want you to hit like I do.
Yeah,

658
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:21,860
I'd say there's certainly an element to 
that.

659
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:24,740
There's also an element of what the 
right call.

660
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,200
What was that phrase that the use all 
the time,

661
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,530
a virtue signaling,
which I don't like using that phrase 

662
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,160
because it's so been kind of adopted by 
this sort of,

663
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,630
you know,
white nationalists,

664
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,970
but that's.
But it exists actually.

665
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,050
Signaling is absolutely real.
I see it all the time.

666
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:44,180
I say it all the time.
It's usually like really,

667
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:49,181
really weak men know,
like trying really hard to court the 

668
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:52,550
favor of women and they're not 
attractive and they're not desirable.

669
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,770
And so they try really hard to be 
allies.

670
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:00,010
And the last time I was here I,
I just don't feel that as it was out of 

671
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,360
my public shaming book coming out.
Oh yeah.

672
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,370
And like a sort of small group of people
decided to sort of try this group.

673
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,670
Yeah.
Wrong thing.

674
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,750
You were guilty of wrong thing.
Yeah.

675
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,920
I just read a story this morning in 
voucher about the young adult world 

676
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,210
where this book came out called,
um,

677
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,610
what's it called?
Like the light.

678
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,060
Let me see if I can find it.
Um,

679
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,530
called the black witch and it said it's 
a liberal book as a young adult book 

680
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,380
that's a liberal book is a progressive 
book,

681
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,650
but it contains a racist characters.
So a blogger took some of the quotes 

682
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:42,230
that the racist characters set in the 
book.

683
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,650
This voucher article quote certainly in 
took them out of context,

684
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,800
page one,
six three.

685
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,310
The celts are not a pure race like us.
They're more accepting of into marriage 

686
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,540
and because of this they're hopelessly 
mixed.

687
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,000
So that's a quote from the book.
And then the blog wrote underneath.

688
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,090
Yes.
You read that with your own two eyes.

689
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,930
This is one of the times my jaw drops in
horror and I had to walk away from this 

690
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,460
book.
So then how noble.

691
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,940
So then like hundreds and hundreds of 
people like pounding on the book and 

692
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,640
then Kirk gave this book or a good 
review.

693
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,730
And then people pounding on circus 
circus.

694
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,850
Circus is like this industry is that 
when you write a book,

695
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,190
one of the first review to get us from 
Kirkus.

696
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:27,740
It's like it's an industrial,
that word K I r,

697
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:29,050
K u s.
okay.

698
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,630
And if you get like a start because she 
feels like a big deal.

699
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,810
And um,
so they piled in on curriculum for 

700
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,321
giving it a good review.
But I noticed two things happened as 

701
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,100
result of this.
One was actually,

702
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:46,220
it didn't seem to affect the book's 
success.

703
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,850
Uh,
the book is doing well,

704
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,730
like on Amazon and people actually read 
the book,

705
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,250
I'm offended by it and the same thing 
happened with my book.

706
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:57,251
So you've been publicly shamed,
like the cat of people trying to turn 

707
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:57,251
against the book.
It didn't.

708
00:34:57,251 --> 00:35:02,090
Well,
the numbers are so small numbers of 

709
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,810
twats that are actually out there 
beating the bushes for this stuff.

710
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,390
When you're talking about,
you know,

711
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,520
2000 people or whatever,
or 100 maybe even very vocal and if 

712
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,060
there's anyone particularly upset at 
you,

713
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,210
it might just be there's,
there's many instances where people were

714
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:18,860
attacked by one person and that person 
assumes multiple identities online,

715
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:24,190
an out of body.
Mine was dealing with someone who was 

716
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,190
doing that.
Yeah.

717
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,190
It's just,
it's real common.

718
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,240
Like they're just,
for whatever reason,

719
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:31,241
just single you out.
Or maybe you wrote something that you 

720
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:32,060
know,
they found personally offensive or.

721
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,390
But the thing that drives me crazy about
that,

722
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,250
about this taking out of context,

723
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:43,250
this character who's a racist character 
is we were talking about fiction and 

724
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:48,891
fiction.
If you can't portray realistic humans 

725
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:53,270
mean there are racist,
but how come you're allowed to make a 

726
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,310
fictional character about a murderer or 
about,

727
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,460
you know,
some sort of a Nazi type character or 

728
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,000
something along those lines.
Like how come that's okay.

729
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,540
I mean these are like,
you know,

730
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,220
these are kind of young kids because 
this is the why a world and I,

731
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,800
I,
you know,

732
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,350
why a young adult type of publishing and
you know,

733
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,000
they're not thinking it through.
They're there,

734
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,550
they're not thinking,
they're just seeing an opportunity to be

735
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,630
outraged.
You know,

736
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:23,631
that,
you know the expression recreational 

737
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:23,631
outrage.

738
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:24,290
Yeah.
And so,

739
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,480
but the other thing that happened as a 
result of their.

740
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:29,720
So the book itself apparently isn't 
being particularly negatively affected,

741
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:32,030
even though the,
the outrage was,

742
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,670
was huge.
Probably helps it possibly.

743
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:39,380
But I'm the journalists from this 
vulture article interview publishers who

744
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:44,381
basically a stagnant.
We're telling our authors to get as 

745
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:45,350
having a chilling effect on,
on novels.

746
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:48,070
It's like,
don't put in like if,

747
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,080
if the authors white don't try and put 
in a person of color as a cat and it's 

748
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
just,
it's not worth it,

749
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:55,070
you know,
just don't do it.

750
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,120
So actually these new roles,
a new roles a few years,

751
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,700
I just wrote this,
um,

752
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,680
I've been writing movies lately and,
and um,

753
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,430
and I always try and put in characters 
of color and because I think,

754
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:11,900
okay,
you know,

755
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:16,190
maybe a director will kind of ignore it,
but if I put that into a screenplay,

756
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,540
then there's a good chance that a person
of color is going to get offered,

757
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,410
you know,
a role,

758
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,770
but now suddenly I'm being told like,
that's not,

759
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,330
that's not good.
I shouldn't do that.

760
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,510
Will you be told you're being told you 
shouldn't do that because you need to 

761
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,510
stay in your lane?
Yeah.

762
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,880
What?
I'm not been told it,

763
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:37,881
but I'm reading these articles where I 
read that novelists of being told this 

764
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:41,430
is a different situation.
You're not talking about an offensive 

765
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,430
character.
You should probably clarify that.

766
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,430
Oh yeah,
no,

767
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,590
of course.
No.

768
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,660
Well,
you're talking about is someone's 

769
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,170
telling you not to do or maybe you 
shouldn't do a person of color in your 

770
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,500
screenplay because that's not your 
place.

771
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,320
Yeah,
right.

772
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,810
It's been told according to this 
voucher,

773
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:57,811
Roscoe,
that everyone today route isn't being 

774
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:57,811
told not to do it,
so.

775
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:57,811
No,
no,

776
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:59,160
of course not.
Like that's a different thing.

777
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,490
It could easily be misconstrued.
I didn't want to let anybody take you 

778
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:04,490
out of context there.
Right?

779
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,160
Yeah,
no,

780
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:07,980
of course.
And that feels like have a new role.

781
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,990
It is,
yeah.

782
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,320
Well it's just,
again,

783
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,310
it's,
it's just the left is turning on itself.

784
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,700
I mean there are people that are turning
on them so there you cannot be 

785
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,421
progressive enough.
There was no one out there that's 

786
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:25,431
progressive enough and so there's always
gonna be someone to find some fault in 

787
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:29,271
something that you do,
particularly if you're doing fiction 

788
00:38:29,271 --> 00:38:32,220
that portrays a realistic scenarios that
could easily exist in any city,

789
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,870
in any,
you know,

790
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,580
civilization on earth.
Yeah.

791
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,960
And I noticed when,
when,

792
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,580
you know,
because I was covering all of this for a

793
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,930
couple of years,
months writing,

794
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:45,931
so you've been publicly shamed and I,
and I noticed that every time somebody 

795
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:47,290
like justine sacco got kinda got,
got on the Internet,

796
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,370
um,
Breitbart and info wars,

797
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,660
Molly Annapolis,
Paul Joseph Watson,

798
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,550
Alex Jones,
you know,

799
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:56,860
they would propagandize the hell out of 
this stuff.

800
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:59,560
And this was in the runup to trump 
getting elected.

801
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,560
And I can't help thinking that the left 
eating itself is part of the reason why 

802
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,720
we've got trump now really fucked up for
sure.

803
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:12,721
They became unreasonable when there's a 
meme that's going out there that I've 

804
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:17,941
seen on many,
many different places on instagram and 

805
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:21,090
twitter and stuff.
It says this kind of shit is why I got 

806
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,031
elected.
And it's trump like pointing at the 

807
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:24,031
camera.
I think it's true.

808
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,940
It's 100 percent true.
People were fed up,

809
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,110
they're fed up and they,
you know,

810
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,300
they didn't realize what the 
consequences are.

811
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,390
You know,
what's really fascinating is I saw this 

812
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,401
article today where it was talking about
America was on cnn about Americans,

813
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,110
like in general,
like everyone pulled,

814
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,160
does not like the fact that trump tweets
or some crazy number people to think 

815
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,331
that he should stop tweeting.
But one of the things that got him 

816
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:54,400
elected is the fact that he tweets said 
people enjoyed it.

817
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,500
Like,
here's a guy who fighting back and he's,

818
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:02,501
he's not,
he's not scared to hit back with 

819
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,731
personal insults.
And like we'd never seen that before 

820
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:06,190
from someone running for president.
Like this was stunning.

821
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,170
Yeah.
You know,

822
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,030
but then he became president.
Everybody's like,

823
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:15,031
well,
he'll surely let that go once he's in 

824
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:15,820
the office because that's not 
presidential.

825
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,420
But he used the expression,
you know,

826
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,470
I,
I forget the expression,

827
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,780
but something like,
it's modern presidential.

828
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,770
Yeah.

829
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Yeah.
I remember the very first book I ever 

830
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,620
did for seed been purposely saying there
was this woman in front row,

831
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,600
uh,
this kind of elderly lady.

832
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:39,601
This was the book shop Santa Cruz.
And she was like pointedly shaking her 

833
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:43,300
head and disagreements with everything 
that I was saying.

834
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,190
And then when it came to the q and a,
I said,

835
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,480
I haven't got any questions that she 
went.

836
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,580
She said,
uh,

837
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,180
I said,
okay.

838
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,820
I just said if you play,
she said,

839
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:56,821
if you play with the twitter toy that 
it's your fault if you get what I'm,

840
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,630
what I said to him was like,
you know,

841
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,570
it's influences beyond twitter.
Twitter is,

842
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,790
twitter is infecting the culture and 
it's an infected everything.

843
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,780
What the Gan on twitter,
new type of discourse and the new way of

844
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:17,740
seeing each other infected politics,
culture,

845
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,650
the mainstream media.
It's affected everything in the same way

846
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:25,651
that I wonder where the Fabian fs sort 
of feels a bit guilty about some of the 

847
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,330
consequences of his business plan.
I wonder whether some of the,

848
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:33,331
uh,
twitter executives ever feel guilty 

849
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:33,380
about what they've done.
Well,

850
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,190
they certainly

851
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,650
feel like they have some sort of 
responsibility,

852
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:38,960
which is why their silencing certain 
people.

853
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:41,540
And I don't know if shadow banning is 
real,

854
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:46,541
but there's,
there's all this talk of people being 

855
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,810
shadow band and then a lot of people 
have had their accounts suspended.

856
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,900
Yeah.
I said they got doing a bit of stuff 

857
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:52,900
now.
I was a member,

858
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:52,900
um,
mechanism.

859
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,240
They,
uh,

860
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,100
Westboro Baptist Church Mckee who's a 
friend of mine and she,

861
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,020
Oh,
she came on your show.

862
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,100
She was amazing.
She's so great.

863
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Fascinating that someone who came from 
such a horrible regressive environment 

864
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,200
became this fascinating,
really intelligent,

865
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:11,120
really well-spoken,
sensitive person.

866
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,310
And I think Meghan would say if she was 
sitting there because I kind of said 

867
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,630
that at one time and she said it sort of
goes to show that,

868
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,430
you know,
full,

869
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,350
full,
that sort of hateful beliefs.

870
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,070
My parents were good parents,
like they gave me this positive stuff as

871
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:25,880
well as the nicotine.

872
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,140
Wow.
That amazing.

873
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:28,770
She can't even talk to them anymore.
Yeah.

874
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,120
But they won't talk to her.
Talk to her.

875
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,220
I think she went up to them at a,
a picture of David Bowie's memorials.

876
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,700
I,
they wouldn't talk.

877
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,480
They wouldn't look her in the eye.
And anyway,

878
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,450
she was on the phone to twitter one time
she told me,

879
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,830
uh,
because they love it.

880
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:48,770
I mean,
twitter love that because she hadn't,

881
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,570
she sort of got talked into liberals on 
twitter and that's,

882
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,220
that's what persuaded or perhaps if the 
Westboro Baptist church.

883
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,380
So for twitter,
that's like the best story in the world.

884
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:02,650
So she was talking to Theresa,
she told me and they wanted her to do a 

885
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:02,650
talk and she said,
Oh,

886
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,250
you should do a talk as well.
Jon Ronson.

887
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,940
And she said,
she said twitter went quiet and phone.

888
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,460
So they're upset at you and they're 
upset.

889
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:13,010
It may for basically pointing out what,
uh,

890
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,520
you know,
how will total is crawling towards the 

891
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:18,520
gun on twitter,
but you know,

892
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,310
that it's not all people.

893
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,940
What you're see,
you're pointing out some of the issues 

894
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,760
that many other people have seen.
This is not what you don't think.

895
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:27,320
What you're saying is controversial at 
all.

896
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:29,230
You're just astute.
I don't think so that,

897
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:34,231
that story about,
about justine sacco a few years ago and 

898
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:34,231
about how,
you know,

899
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:36,200
the woman who tweeted going to Africa,
hope I don't get aids,

900
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:37,400
just kidding.
I'm white.

901
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:40,680
And then when she was pregnant,
when she was asleep on the plane,

902
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:43,190
you know,
thinking she'd made a smart cut of south

903
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:47,590
park joke around privilege,
like everyone united to choose,

904
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,940
fired,
fired by the time she landed.

905
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:51,350
Yeah.
And you know,

906
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:56,351
um,
everyone from like misogynistic troves 

907
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:59,000
through to social justice people all 
united to destroy this urban,

908
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,600
you know,
she upset everyone for um,

909
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,160
and uh,
yeah,

910
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:09,161
so that,
I think that story became pretty 

911
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:10,961
powerful at the time.
And I think it probably back to 

912
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:10,961
twitter's business for a while.
People got too scared to go into it.

913
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:14,840
So I think that's a drop their business 
off at all.

914
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,460
I think it did.
I think,

915
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,810
I think people started to think that it 
may have recovered now,

916
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,420
but I think people started to think,
fuck,

917
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:24,590
if twitter is not fun,
you know,

918
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:29,591
what's,
what's the point of the Justine Sacco 

919
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:32,220
one racist joke that she got fired for,
you think that really had an overall

920
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,350
effect on twitter use?
Well,

921
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:39,351
what happened was I,
my book got extracted in the New York 

922
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:39,390
Times did,
was that story.

923
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:43,060
And that story kind of went crazy viral.
Um,

924
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,850
it really spoke,
it kind of spoke to people.

925
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,620
It's like Duh,
like deep fears,

926
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,540
that story.
Well,

927
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,010
deep fears.
They might get drunk and pop a Xanax and

928
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:54,920
say something really stupid.
Did the same shit,

929
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,970
wake up in Africa fired.
Yeah,

930
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,060
exactly.
And I think that that kind of public 

931
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,250
effected twitter,
I think it did.

932
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:05,040
I think they need to relax.
I think all that stuff just makes people

933
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:08,520
interested and then it makes more people
sign up and I just,

934
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:09,690
I don't know,
boy,

935
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:12,630
I don't see that at all.
If they were upset at you over that,

936
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,570
that's pretty preposterous.
I wonder,

937
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,750
I've given.
I gave talks at facebook and Google,

938
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,650
but they won't give you a talk going on,
but I'm curious.

939
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:27,650
I'm curious for their orwellian council 
and maybe they'll go over every word 

940
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
you're about to say.
Allow what is their trust and verify 

941
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,210
council,
what the fuck is that called?

942
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,540
Where they have all,
they have some people on that are that 

943
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:38,880
are ridiculous.
Social Justice Warriors,

944
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,390
proven attention whores.
People that are dishonest.

945
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,420
They're just not,
they're not honest people and they're a 

946
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,661
part of this whole thing where their 
business is getting attention and being 

947
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:52,380
a victim and and exploring it to the nth
degree.

948
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:52,950
I mean,
that's,

949
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,960
that's a bunch of people that are on 
that thing.

950
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's what they do.
I do think like if you're gonna address 

951
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,920
harassment on social media,
you have to accept that it comes from 

952
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,640
both sides and the right to the left.
It comes from the left to the right.

953
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,790
It comes to misogynists feminists that 
comes from feminist.

954
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,810
You also have to define what is 
harassment and what is criticism.

955
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,020
Now,
if you have ideas in the open 

956
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,641
marketplace of ideas and you have ideas 
that people think are profoundly 

957
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:21,000
ridiculous,
they're allowed to mock your ideas.

958
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:26,030
That is not harassment.
I just think that that is someone 

959
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,840
shitting on you and you put yourself out
there.

960
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,160
I mean,
especially someone whose hook.

961
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,280
You're not.
These people,

962
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:34,290
a lot of them,
they're not singers,

963
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,440
they're not authors,
they're not musicians,

964
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,060
they're not comics.
They're not.

965
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,750
They're not producing anything other 
than their words.

966
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,020
Right?
So if someone doesn't like your words 

967
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,230
and they shit on your words like that,
what else do you expect?

968
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Yeah,
I noticed that there was some kind of 

969
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
gaslighting going on on the left,
like,

970
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,430
like everyone would agree that sort of 
world that I come from,

971
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:04,431
not the Guardian and the left La.
Everyone would agree that if a gun of 

972
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,670
Bissell actionists sort of gang up on a 
particular feminist writer and basically

973
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,720
harassed until she goes flying every new
case,

974
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:13,770
that's,
that's bad and is bad.

975
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,210
It is yet.
Um,

976
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,330
but when the mirror image of that is 
happening,

977
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,260
people pretended as if people just 
pretend it's not happening.

978
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Right?
When someone goes after someone on the 

979
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,280
right,
even if it's a woman like,

980
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,681
you know,
a perfect example of that was no 

981
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,170
feminist stood up to defend Sarah 
Pailin.

982
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,560
Like there's no one.
I mean you never heard that when Bill 

983
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,770
Maher was calling her a cunt and all 
these different people were mocking her 

984
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,070
and no one was stepping up and saying,
hey,

985
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:44,110
that's a woman that's a mother.
You know,

986
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,940
it's someone's,
someone's mom,

987
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:50,941
like leave her alone.
Have some respect for women if you're a 

988
00:47:50,941 --> 00:47:53,380
woman and you're a conservative,
like you might as well be a monster man.

989
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,710
That was,
there was undoubtedly sort of cognitive 

990
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,680
dissonance,
like

991
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,370
when somebody's being harassed,
they don't want to then see themselves 

992
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:05,370
as,
as,

993
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,350
as doing the same thing to a group of 
people that they don't like.

994
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:13,660
Well,
it's very easy to come to think of 

995
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,580
someone who is opposed to your point of 
view or thinks of things completely 

996
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,721
different as another.
You don't even think of them as a 

997
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:19,721
person.
I noticed that happened to me,

998
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:20,630
you know,
I wanted to

999
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,340
said that they wanted to run a series of
articles about,

1000
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,720
um,
about bullying on the Internet and 

1001
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:29,720
wanted me to like,
you know,

1002
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:34,680
contribute to the series a.
and they said they wanted it to all be 

1003
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,070
about how women are being bullied by 
men.

1004
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,410
And I said,
um,

1005
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,540
you know,
I have no doubt that,

1006
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,680
that happens a lot and it's presumably 
disproportionate.

1007
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,890
Like women are bullied by men more than 
other groups have bullied.

1008
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,540
You know,
that could well be true,

1009
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:53,380
but if the series of article is only 
about women being bullied by Merlin,

1010
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:58,740
legitimize a certain types of bullying,
like when the left pile in on somebody 

1011
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,500
like just in soccer,
it's going to legitimize,

1012
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:04,501
you know,
what if it's that partial is going to 

1013
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:04,501
legitimize certain types of bullying.
And the editor,

1014
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:08,290
when I said that to her,
kind of rolled her eyes as if to say,

1015
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:10,860
well,
you would think that erm,

1016
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:11,710
well,
yeah,

1017
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,880
but you know,
it's true,

1018
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:13,580
it's true.
And,

1019
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:16,360
and you know,
the problem's not going to go until we.

1020
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,220
Yeah,
they're hypocrites.

1021
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,440
I mean that's essentially what's going 
on.

1022
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,970
So people don't want to be nice.
They,

1023
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,990
they think that there's power and 
shaming and they think.

1024
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:31,991
I mean I've,
I've had multiple conversations with 

1025
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:33,020
people online that think there is good 
in shaming people.

1026
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,230
I'm like,
what you saying that because you're 

1027
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,230
hiding behind a keyboard and it's a free
shot,

1028
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:41,000
but if you had to sit down with that 
person in front of them and talk to them

1029
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:44,660
face to face and feel the social 
consequences.

1030
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:49,750
Right.
It reminds me actually remember I was 

1031
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,641
telling you about what are the 
consequences that I look at in the best 

1032
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:54,791
of fly effect about the tech takeover of
port is that if you're a 25 year old 

1033
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,580
adult actress,
you can't get work now because you're in

1034
00:49:55,581 --> 00:49:58,580
this sort of hinterland between teen and
MILF.

1035
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,560
And I kept that.

1036
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,340
That's not just pawn,
that's the Internet.

1037
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:02,480
Like on social media,
you know,

1038
00:50:02,481 --> 00:50:05,090
if you're,
if you're kind of loud,

1039
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,480
aggressively authoritarian person on the
left or the loud aggressively 

1040
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,680
authoritarian person on the right,
you like the teen or the MILF like those

1041
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:15,950
of us in the middle of these people who 
are more interested in people talking to

1042
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:17,630
each other and,
and they don't,

1043
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,750
we don't want to like scream.
We want to listen to understand.

1044
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,900
We like the 25 year old adult film 
actress at work.

1045
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Well,
people don't like nuanced point of view 

1046
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:28,960
and they also like people that are 
willing

1047
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,650
to talk to anybody.
You know?

1048
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,660
I've had so many people call me some 
sort of a right wing monster and I'm 

1049
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:34,820
like,
well,

1050
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,400
let's go over what makes a right wing 
monster.

1051
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:37,820
W,
W,

1052
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:41,430
w what is right wing.
I support gay marriage support.

1053
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,190
Universal health care.
I'm absolutely in favor.

1054
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:51,191
If it could work,
I don't know if it would work of a 

1055
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:51,680
universal basic income.
Where does it,

1056
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,710
where do I become right wing?
Like what?

1057
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,700
Where does it go?
I'm anti war.

1058
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,520
Like where do I become right when?
Well,

1059
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,530
I don't think I can in politics as input
on everything now has to be kind of 

1060
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:06,551
keywords that Chabot,
so everybody has to fall into some sort 

1061
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:07,160
of nation and if you're not doing it 
yourself,

1062
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,960
then someone else is gonna do it for 
you.

1063
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,020
Yeah,
but even when you're saying that like 

1064
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,020
you don't,
that's not real.

1065
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,800
Like you don't have to.
You don't have to fall into those 

1066
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,781
categories.
It's just be easier for people to 

1067
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:19,781
categorize you.
If you did fall into those categories.

1068
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:24,610
I'm sure I have some points of view that
people would consider a conservative and

1069
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:30,551
I have many more points of view that 
most people would consider to be 

1070
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:31,220
liberal,
but it's very convenient,

1071
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,430
especially when you look like me and I 
looked like a meathead is easy to say 

1072
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:40,631
that I'm some meathead conservative or 
right wing or something along those 

1073
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:43,931
lines,
but I'm way more likely to vote for 

1074
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:46,310
someone on the left than I am for 
someone on the right because I think the

1075
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,660
people on the right,
jen in general are more suppressive.

1076
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,230
Especially socially and culturally and I
think that's where the real issues.

1077
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:57,090
Like when you look at like Obama did.
Yeah,

1078
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:57,650
on the right.

1079
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:03,100
When you look at what Obama did in 
office in terms of like what he did as 

1080
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,901
far as drones,
a freedom of the press and going on 

1081
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:10,670
after whistle blowers and got a lot of.
That was very right.

1082
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,700
Very right wing.
If you looked at in terms of like an 

1083
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,070
actual real consequences of him being 
the president,

1084
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,370
a lot of it was very right wing,
but when you look at in terms of like 

1085
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:25,240
support for gay marriage and you know,
in passing the affordable care act and 

1086
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:30,131
all these,
there's a lot of that stuff was very 

1087
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:31,991
left wing.
Now I don't know if the affordable care 

1088
00:52:31,991 --> 00:52:32,840
act was good because a lot of small 
businesses,

1089
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:38,170
the small doctors with small offices 
hated it and thought it was absolutely 

1090
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,041
horrible and it killed their business.
I don't know who's right about that 

1091
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:44,831
because I don't.
Obviously I don't have to deal with 

1092
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:44,831
that.

1093
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:45,710
It's a controversial subject,
but the idea behind it I liked.

1094
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,800
I liked the idea that we would have some
sort of universal healthcare because I 

1095
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,741
think the idea of someone being too poor
to get healthcare in this incredible 

1096
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:56,540
country,
like if we're going to pay for our taxes

1097
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58,830
are going to go to anything.
God Damn doesn't.

1098
00:52:58,831 --> 00:53:01,600
It shouldn't go to caring for our 
neighbors and our,

1099
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:06,601
our fellow humans.
Like that seems to me to be a no 

1100
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:06,601
brainer.
Yeah,

1101
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,900
and that's probably a pretty left wing 
idea why I got a ton of those,

1102
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:13,901
but,
but it's easy to call me a right winger 

1103
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:16,660
for whatever reason.
I find that fascinating that people do 

1104
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,861
not like us a nuanced approach or not.
Not only that,

1105
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:26,380
it's not that they don't like it is that
they find it extremely easy to 

1106
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:26,380
categorize

1107
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,790
you and so we're sort of a,
a negative caricature.

1108
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,870
Hmm.
Yeah.

1109
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,650
I've got a question.
I'm just like totally change the subject

1110
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,950
for a second.
Uh,

1111
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,480
we have Alex Jones a common cause I,
years ago snuck into Bohemian Grove with

1112
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:44,100
Alec and weird.
It was that,

1113
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,310
that was like the one he didn't like the
late nineties,

1114
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,280
early 2019.
You are with them on that.

1115
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:51,210
That's right.
Yeah,

1116
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,960
we talked about that the last time.
Yeah.

1117
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,610
Um,
but I,

1118
00:53:56,611 --> 00:53:58,470
I,
since I saw you last,

1119
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,280
I rekindled my relationship with Alex as
a means of trying to get inside the 

1120
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:07,890
trump world didn't go,
didn't go great.

1121
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,350
It didn't go well.
What happened that?

1122
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,280
Well,
what I think I heard Alex a little bit,

1123
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:15,330
although would you do.
I basically set allocation.

1124
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,780
Have political sway you told him that.
What?

1125
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:23,370
I wrote it in a story about him.
I went to the RNC and I sort of,

1126
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,300
you know,
got back in with Alex and spent a little

1127
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:32,301
bit of time hanging around with him and 
Roger Stone and so on and got really 

1128
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:35,751
interested in the kind of dynamics of 
how Alex and trevor communicate to each 

1129
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:39,651
other,
but I'm wondering if you've seen Alex 

1130
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,160
more recently than I have been my 
friends since 1998.

1131
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,500
Yeah.
I was at his custody trial not long ago.

1132
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:48,501
And you were brought up by my shirt.
He was smoking pot.

1133
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:53,490
Just testing it.
George Soros makes the weeds stronger.

1134
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,280
That's very steady.
He said that in this custody trial.

1135
00:54:56,281 --> 00:54:59,820
That's exactly what he said.
He said he tests it once a year just to.

1136
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:03,930
Because he's weird because he's always 
here when that happened.

1137
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,010
I mean,
come on man.

1138
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:15,050
What's really funny is we drank whiskey 
on the show too and no one gives a shit 

1139
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:15,150
about that.
It's way more destructive.

1140
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,400
It's the pot.
Whatever it is.

1141
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,320
Self reflective.
Yeah.

1142
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,980
Paranoia.
Inducing marijuana.

1143
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,020
It's a real problem,
but I,

1144
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:29,021
I now wonder,
so he says that trump called him just 

1145
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:32,031
after the election,
just thank him and I'm inclined to 

1146
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:33,480
believe that's true because I don't 
think that's the kind of thing that Alex

1147
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:38,481
would lie about,
but have you got any of you come to any 

1148
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:40,650
conclusion about whether there is a 
connection between Alex and trump now?

1149
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,140
Because I'm beginning to think maybe 
there just isn't anymore,

1150
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,600
but I could be wrong.
I've got a good question.

1151
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:46,740
I don't know.
I mean,

1152
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:51,741
first of all,
I don't see how trump can have a 

1153
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:54,531
connection with that many people.
I feel like the job of being the 

1154
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:57,240
president has got to be so insanely 
demanding.

1155
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,090
The idea that he likes.
He's taken a few moments out of his day.

1156
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:04,070
He's got his feet up on the chair with a
laptop and he's on infowars.com.

1157
00:56:04,071 --> 00:56:04,650
I was like,
God damn.

1158
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:09,651
I got to call it Alex and find out what 
the fuck's going on with this child 

1159
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:13,400
slavery thing on Mars.
You know where the slaves tell me where 

1160
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,240
we're on Mars.
I think it benefits everyone to think 

1161
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,450
that it's because it makes,
it makes trump look bad,

1162
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,730
so it benefits people on the left 
descending that Alex is a,

1163
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:29,050
is connected to trump.
It kind of benefits Alex.

1164
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:31,810
I think for people to think it too,
because grand dies is,

1165
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,230
it helps him in a way.
I mean it's like the people that.

1166
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,570
There's a bunch of people that enjoy 
Alex,

1167
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:42,571
right?
So some of them enjoy it for the 

1168
00:56:42,571 --> 00:56:44,050
theater.
There's a theater element of it all,

1169
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,910
you know,
I mean,

1170
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:47,210
and it's all doom and gloom and.

1171
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,940
Yeah.
And then some of it,

1172
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
some people enjoy because like Bohemian 
grove occasionally he's correct.

1173
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,820
Like Bohemian Grove was a real mind 
fuck.

1174
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:01,120
And you see all these super rich people 
wearing robes in effigy.

1175
00:57:01,121 --> 00:57:06,121
Yeah.
I was in the crowd with all the old men 

1176
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:06,760
of wealth in Dallas to freak you out.
And soon as people,

1177
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,480
one thing freaked me out.
I'm like,

1178
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,810
Alex came out of our Bohemian Grove 
Knight with a,

1179
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:17,910
with varying interpretation of your 
interpretation.

1180
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:22,230
My interpretation is basically with,
with one caveat caveat there,

1181
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,860
my interpretation was that it's just 
like fucking skull and bones.

1182
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,580
So those were all creepy,
right?

1183
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:35,581
Yeah.
And they want to devastate that just 

1184
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:35,581
seem to be amongst the American ruling 
elites,

1185
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:38,620
that does seem to be a proclivity for 
ritual.

1186
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:39,910
Um,
maybe,

1187
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,710
uh,
maybe monks of British elites as well.

1188
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:46,711
I'm not sure about that.
That's in itself psychologically 

1189
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:46,711
interesting.

1190
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:46,960
Think secrets too.
Right?

1191
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,100
So it's like,
why?

1192
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:53,101
So that is interesting.
Why even if the ritual at Bohemian 

1193
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:53,270
Grove,
I,

1194
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,130
I,
you know,

1195
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:59,131
and I would contend that country to alex
implied they weren't actually 

1196
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:01,080
sacrificing a child.
No,

1197
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,010
he didn't say they were sacrificing your
chart at some point.

1198
00:58:04,011 --> 00:58:05,350
And then this video.
Yeah,

1199
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,940
it couldn't be real,
be real.

1200
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:14,220
He probably was so jazzed up,
but they were actually dressed up like 

1201
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:14,740
monks.
He with the hoods and they have the mall

1202
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,670
of the,
our God,

1203
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,850
when he was actually there,
I mean that probably ramped up his love 

1204
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:23,650
of conspiracy a good solid three or 400 
percent.

1205
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,040
It was hilarious because you know,
we went in separately to to,

1206
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,740
because Alex got it into his head that 
maybe I was part of the Bohemian Grove 

1207
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,540
deep deep inside that I was like 
learning events seven.

1208
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:41,070
He would be the ones,
so he went in separately to be,

1209
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,430
he won't and fire the undergrowth and I 
went up to the drive in the driveway.

1210
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:50,430
I gave the security guy to cut a viral,
the world wave and then we went in 

1211
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:50,950
there.
Her Toyota do.

1212
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,620
Yeah.
Yeah,

1213
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,150
yeah.
Guys,

1214
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,170
so often the case.
Yeah.

1215
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,440
So the White House and then we saw Alex 
and Mike Hanson who was his producer at 

1216
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:04,540
the time,
walking like towards this and I was with

1217
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,570
this local lawyer who would,
who would we talked up with?

1218
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,380
And I was like,
um,

1219
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,350
Hey Alex,
Mike,

1220
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:12,880
how you doing?
They were like,

1221
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,030
keep walking as cameras and the chase.
This owl was everywhere.

1222
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,950
And then there's.
Yes,

1223
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,410
because we felt like the hours were 
cameras.

1224
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,750
They got it into their heads that the 
owls at Bohemian Grove,

1225
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:28,751
the,
our motifs that Bohemian Grove a was 

1226
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:30,350
indicative of the fact that it was like 
moloch the owl God,

1227
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,080
uh,
and it was like some sort of satanic.

1228
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:38,410
But actually I would say that the reason
why there's all those hours because I 

1229
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:41,390
saw like stuffed owls and display 
cabinets and so on.

1230
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,940
But I think it's like,
I think it's an owl sanctuary.

1231
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,560
So,
but anyway,

1232
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,320
but I want to put all this stuff done.
I mean,

1233
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,650
I presume it died of natural causes.
Shit.

1234
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,490
He fucking sanctuary if they kill it and
then stuff it.

1235
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,310
So it's sorta like a norman bates mom 
and psycho stuff.

1236
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:07,990
But what was odd that night was one 
thing that the artist moment,

1237
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:14,950
and this is where I will,
this is where my memory of the night 

1238
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,981
does tally with Alex's,
is that for whatever reason the people 

1239
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:21,650
in the crowd were really into this,
this ceremony.

1240
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,880
There was a sort of.
They were really fired up by it.

1241
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,860
Let say I remember this old guy walked 
up to me before it started and you first

1242
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,450
timer and I went,
yeah,

1243
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:33,110
I do.
Oh,

1244
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:34,050
you got to love it.
You're gonna.

1245
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,000
Love it.
Burn him,

1246
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,580
burn him or something,
something along those lines.

1247
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,790
Uh,
and,

1248
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:45,190
and it did make me think la.
And then I looked behind and there was 

1249
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,550
alex and Mike,
why died looking like they will ruin,

1250
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:50,630
know the belly of the beast.
And then there's all these old preppy 

1251
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:50,630
men.
Why died?

1252
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:54,750
Did they were really into it too.
I felt like the only sane person in the 

1253
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,010
entire redwood forest,
I was like,

1254
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:57,080
the only person who's thinking this is 
fucking ridiculous.

1255
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,580
It is ridiculous.
But,

1256
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,760
but they were into it.
It was that moment.

1257
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:03,350
It was that moment of revelation 
actually,

1258
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:07,310
that then led me to write the book that 
I wrote after that book,

1259
01:01:07,311 --> 01:01:09,350
which was the minister at goats,
which was about,

1260
01:01:09,351 --> 01:01:10,220
you know,
um,

1261
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,380
soldiers tried to kill goats just by 
staring at them because I remember like,

1262
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:18,380
um,
I remember thinking I was actually,

1263
01:01:18,381 --> 01:01:21,140
I was in Belfast,
I was giving a talk about my book then,

1264
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,420
which is where we talk about all of that
stuff.

1265
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:24,620
And it simply said,
okay,

1266
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:27,110
so I know what you think of it.
This woman in the audience said,

1267
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:32,111
I know what you think,
I know you think this is ridiculous and 

1268
01:01:32,111 --> 01:01:34,070
I know that Alex Jones thinks it's evil,
but what about the people in the crowd?

1269
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:39,071
What were they thinking about it?
And I thought that's a really good 

1270
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,111
question.
So that's what led me to write a book 

1271
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:41,240
about like a rational thoughts in 
powerful places,

1272
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:42,820
which is what led me to adminster guts.

1273
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:44,890
No,
when you,

1274
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,920
when you're there and you see that there
really is a giant stone owl and they 

1275
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:55,471
really do have this bundle of sticks and
they're burning and everyone really is 

1276
01:01:55,471 --> 01:01:56,140
wearing these robes.
Like,

1277
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:59,680
I mean you had a part of you how to be 
like,

1278
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:03,100
how many of these fucking things are 
going on that we have an infiltrated?

1279
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:06,400
Well that's true that there's a,
there's a photo over there.

1280
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:11,910
This is real.
I mean they really do have a giant owl 

1281
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:15,451
and they really do burn some sort of a 
sacrifice in front of this owl and 

1282
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:18,940
there's a speakers that are at one 
point,

1283
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,130
this is a lesser

1284
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:25,850
documented part of the ritual.
At one point there's a guy in leaf 

1285
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:30,981
covered later hosan appears in like a 
stage cutouts of the redwood tree and 

1286
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,620
start singing this kind of allergy to 
nature.

1287
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,460
Like,
oh,

1288
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,730
trees.
So leaves.

1289
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,800
So that's how it starts.
That's before the men in robes.

1290
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,920
Turnip.
So it's like some weird pagan nature 

1291
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,790
leach covered later.
Hose and Joe,

1292
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,800
how much would you give to be in one of 
those skull on bonds meetings?

1293
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:55,810
See if they actually like film each 
other's sucking Derek's or something 

1294
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,001
there.
There's something that goes on where 

1295
01:02:59,001 --> 01:02:59,001
they have like something over those 
guys.

1296
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:01,650
Supposedly that's like the the 
conspiracy theories.

1297
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,720
That's it makes them engage in gay sex.
I do believe these things happen for a 

1298
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,610
reason.
Like you know it's going to.

1299
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:11,310
Bones exists for a reason because they 
have something over you.

1300
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,790
It could be that or it could be just 
this weird sense,

1301
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:19,850
this weird sort of psychological need 
that people like Ivy League people feel 

1302
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:23,391
they need to like have a sense of 
superiority and we're meant to do that 

1303
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,380
is to kind of create these secret 
rituals to give them a sense of like,

1304
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,500
you know,
grand juror over the people if that's 

1305
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:30,500
possible.

1306
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,740
Now a guy like Alex Jones stumbles upon 
something like that or infiltrates it 

1307
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:37,251
and find out it is real.
I mean that is just a fine to such a and

1308
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,480
enormous,
enormous level.

1309
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,500
Yeah.
But Alex,

1310
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:45,501
but here's my,
my truck with Alex and all of this is 

1311
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:48,321
that it wasn't like the Alex.
all of their fucking crazy shit that we 

1312
01:03:48,321 --> 01:03:53,241
saw that night wasn't enough lucky hat 
to like turn it up to 11 of course.

1313
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:58,341
Yeah,
and imply that weird possibly witnessed 

1314
01:03:58,341 --> 01:03:58,620
an actual human sacrifice and of course,
but that standard,

1315
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:02,400
that standard Alex Jones one-on-one.
But it shouldn't be.

1316
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:05,310
It shouldn't be.
But I mean,

1317
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:10,470
I mean think about all of the 
exaggerations exaggerations that take 

1318
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,300
place in the media,
whether it's on the left or the right.

1319
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:14,550
There's a ramp and exaggerations.
Well,

1320
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:19,580
it's funny you should say that.
So did you watch Alex being interviewed 

1321
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:19,580
by Meghan Kelly?

1322
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:19,580
Yeah.
Well that may be like,

1323
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:24,561
you know,
they phoned me a couple of days before 

1324
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,661
the broadcast.
Meghan Kelly's people because they were 

1325
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:27,510
panicking to remember there was like a 
lot of criticism they were getting for,

1326
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:32,730
for having a on in the first place.
So they called me up and they basically 

1327
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:36,891
wanted me to give them as much evidence 
as I could prove that Alex and trump 

1328
01:04:36,891 --> 01:04:38,880
were aligned and they will talk to each 
other and so on.

1329
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,020
Called you.
Why?

1330
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:41,810
Because you went to Bohemian grow with 
them.

1331
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:46,850
I went to go pee,
then I also put out this little kindle 

1332
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:50,211
single last summer called the elephant 
in the room in which I'm trying to 

1333
01:04:50,211 --> 01:04:53,720
trace,
like the relationship between Alex and 

1334
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,440
trump didn't fire up street.
It's kind of in this interesting stuff.

1335
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:58,320
But um,
so I answered the questions as best as I

1336
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:01,140
could,
but I don't know that much about exactly

1337
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,120
how often trumping alex talk to each 
other,

1338
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:08,520
either had it or didn't really that 
interested in it as odd as it is.

1339
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,950
Like I have a very fucked up 
relationship with Alex in,

1340
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
in that and he's actually my friend and 
so when I see him it's like,

1341
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:18,010
what's up

1342
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,670
man?
What are you doing?

1343
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:20,710
I give him a hug and people go,
oh,

1344
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:23,020
he's a monster or how can you be friends
with them and this and that.

1345
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:24,910
And like,
I dunno,

1346
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,970
I just base it on my interactions with 
them.

1347
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,320
And what does he say?
Fucked up things.

1348
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:34,350
Yeah.
The most disturbing thing that I didn't 

1349
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,851
even know when he did the podcast,
I didn't know that he was sandy hook 

1350
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:35,851
denier.
Right.

1351
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:40,590
So apparently he's backed off that since
being confronted by the facts and,

1352
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,980
and there was a horrible article that I 
read about a father who was actually a 

1353
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,031
conspiracy theorist until his son was 
killed in Sandy Hook and then he got 

1354
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:55,891
death threats for lying and Zoom Info 
wars and that was so just so just so 

1355
01:05:57,551 --> 01:05:58,250
sad.
Yeah.

1356
01:05:58,251 --> 01:06:03,251
That's just so people look for fucking 
conspiracies and everything and I don't 

1357
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:05,560
know what it is.

1358
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,190
I have friends that have this issue.
I don't understand it.

1359
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:14,490
Things that could be easily explained.
They look for a conspiracy and it 

1360
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,150
happens in the news.
There's gotta be a different story.

1361
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:20,470
Like sometimes shit just happens and 
when that shit happens,

1362
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:25,471
the news has a story.
It doesn't always have to be some sort 

1363
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:28,891
of nefarious plot,
but these people also think that the 

1364
01:06:28,891 --> 01:06:29,600
government is filled with idiots.
Boy,

1365
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:34,620
I'm sorry you can't have it both ways.
You can't have a bunch of incompetent 

1366
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,371
fuck heads who pull off the perfect fake
world where everything you see is some 

1367
01:06:39,611 --> 01:06:44,560
sort of an elaborate played out scheme 
in order to manipulate you and d they're

1368
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:49,561
buying this are voting for that.
Like there's a weird inclination that 

1369
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:54,061
people have to not just,
not just some conspiracy theories but 

1370
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:57,730
almost everything to think everything 
and some part of some crazy plot.

1371
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:02,700
I'm not sure I understand it.
What you said about biases and untruths,

1372
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,920
like across the media on the left,
I'm reminded to be if the Meghan Kelly 

1373
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,940
thing,
so they phoned me up obviously in a bit 

1374
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,421
of a panic because they would get 
getting so much criticism and then they 

1375
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:16,770
react to the show like frantically,
just before,

1376
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,180
wherever he edited it.
What did they change?

1377
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,020
Well,
I don't know,

1378
01:07:20,021 --> 01:07:25,021
but what I do know is like you.
I saw the final product and the final 

1379
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:28,450
product was basically Meghan Kelly 
looking incredibly poised,

1380
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,110
saying you'll rung Alex,
you'll run about this,

1381
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:33,200
and then it would cut out.
It's good,

1382
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:37,180
but I didn't recover to Meghan so.
Oh they did.

1383
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:42,220
Was Alex that is most sweaty stuttery 
and then Meghan Kelly at her most poised

1384
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:45,250
to.
Perfect.

1385
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,380
What did you see or hear?
The Alex Jones,

1386
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:48,130
uh,
audio,

1387
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,780
the leaked audio that he released?

1388
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:54,780
Yes.
Were they were sort of buttering him up 

1389
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:54,780
and conning him?
Yeah,

1390
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,360
he was saying personally,
I was saying I don't,

1391
01:07:57,361 --> 01:08:00,130
I'm not here to make a hit piece.
I just want to know the real you.

1392
01:08:00,131 --> 01:08:02,880
And almost although they did get it so 
I,

1393
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:08,190
I wouldn't do what the original program 
would have been like because they felt 

1394
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,940
forced to buy him yet.
Well,

1395
01:08:09,941 --> 01:08:13,450
they felt forced by like the people 
pushing back against them doing it.

1396
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,780
Him A to then put out this Shitty,
you know,

1397
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:22,781
10 minutes.
Basically it was in Meghan Kelly's 

1398
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:22,781
corner.
I would have told her,

1399
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:24,230
first of all,
don't ever go to NBC.

1400
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,960
Listen,
here's the deal like you,

1401
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,970
you made your bones as an ice princess 
on this conservative network and do you 

1402
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,590
think they're just going to accept you 
at NBC?

1403
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,170
People are going to resent you.
They're going to hate you.

1404
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:41,300
Like you're the lady that chastise 
people for saying that Santa Claus 

1405
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,560
potentially wasn't white.
Remember that?

1406
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:44,060
I don't remember that.
Oh my God.

1407
01:08:44,061 --> 01:08:45,860
It was some thing where they were saying
there,

1408
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:50,980
there was people talking about Santa 
Claus being black and I'll never forget 

1409
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,720
it because she was on tv going,
you know Santa Claus is white.

1410
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:58,980
Like then I'm like,
what the fuck the fuck are you talking 

1411
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,040
about?
Santa Claus isn't real.

1412
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:04,041
You crazy bitch.
You can't say Santa Claus is white more 

1413
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,810
than you could say cat in the hat is 
red.

1414
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:09,770
They're not real things know.
You can decide that.

1415
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:12,860
You know like the cat in the hat in the 
book is always white.

1416
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:13,490
Okay.
Yeah,

1417
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:14,460
you're right.
Good point.

1418
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,970
But it is he black,
white.

1419
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:20,030
What does the cat in the hat?
He's got a hat is red and white.

1420
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:23,630
What color is he though?
I think he's black.

1421
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,320
Right?
Izzy?

1422
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,810
Okay.
All right.

1423
01:09:26,811 --> 01:09:31,811
It's not important,
but what's important is that like her 

1424
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:35,021
whole thing was being a spokesperson.
This ultra hot spokesperson for the 

1425
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:41,051
conservative movement,
but also being someone who's ruthlessly 

1426
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:43,721
smart and articulate and capable of 
shutting down these stammering liberals 

1427
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:47,420
that day or go and question her,
her narrative.

1428
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,180
Then all of a sudden she's on NBC like 
you can't do that.

1429
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:52,580
That's a terrible move.
Like they're not going to accept you.

1430
01:09:52,581 --> 01:09:57,581
This is not going to work in the ratings
have been horrendous and now she's free 

1431
01:09:57,581 --> 01:09:58,580
and now they pulled the show.
It pulled the show early,

1432
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,460
but it just goes to show like,
you know,

1433
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,520
we rightly attack people like Info laws 
for spreading,

1434
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,690
you know,
outright lies.

1435
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:13,750
Yes.
But we on the left like Megan Kelly 

1436
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,570
editing that segment to make it look 
like she was poised and perfect at all.

1437
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,140
Alex does this dominant sweat.
What's very hard,

1438
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:20,510
very hard sell.
Saying that Megan Kelly is on the left,

1439
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,390
which is on the left.
Now what I mean like the mainstream,

1440
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:27,440
the main that NBC.
So the mainstream has its own tricks.

1441
01:10:27,441 --> 01:10:31,400
It's like,
it's not an outright lie like Alex would

1442
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:33,290
do,
but that,

1443
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,820
you know,
pataky,

1444
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:36,870
selective editing,
it's its own.

1445
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:39,820
I would,
I would have imagined that that Julian,

1446
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,930
the interview between Alex and Megan 
Kelly,

1447
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,720
Alex would have said some things that 
would,

1448
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:46,490
you know,
eloquent or,

1449
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:49,370
or,
or sentence without a sweat.

1450
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:54,610
I'm sure its own.
Well here's also the problem and having 

1451
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:59,410
any sort of a conversation about any 
sort of difficult subject and stuffing 

1452
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:02,000
it into seven minutes or whatever it is.
It's ridiculous.

1453
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:04,730
Yeah.
It's an ancient way of communicating and

1454
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:08,330
now that we have the Internet and Alex 
is shown with his own show,

1455
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:13,360
you know,
that he can go and rant about something 

1456
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:13,360
and you know,
for 15 minutes,

1457
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,080
whatever it is,
like an with no limitations or 

1458
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,080
restrictions like that.

1459
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,510
It's,
it's a better way to communicate.

1460
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:23,660
And one of the things that I wanted to 
do when I had alex on the podcast is I 

1461
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,880
wanted people to see the Alex that I 
know because there's no other way to see

1462
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,620
him like that.
I wanted to get him drunk.

1463
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,410
I wanted to get them high and I wanted 
to have him talk.

1464
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,360
And my friend Eddie,
who's so in a conspiracy,

1465
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:39,380
he kind of fucked some of it because 
he's just so into chem trails and 

1466
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:43,491
proving the chem trails are real.
But it was good overall because it's 

1467
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:48,830
like he was.
Alex is so crazy that even eddie was 

1468
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,831
like,
what does a couple of moments where 

1469
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:51,831
Eddie turned to look at Alex?
He goes,

1470
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:56,001
what the fuck?
Like what he's talking about 

1471
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:56,001
interdimensional child molesters.
And it's.

1472
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:58,740
I wanted people to see him the way I see
it.

1473
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,200
He's a fun guy that I like hanging out 
with.

1474
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,510
Do I think that he has a lot of 
influence?

1475
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:08,511
Yeah.
Do I think he says things that he 

1476
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:08,511
definitely shouldn't say?
Of course.

1477
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:09,390
Especially the sandy hook stuff.
I mean,

1478
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:14,570
I think this inclination to always look 
towards conspiracy is dangerous.

1479
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,170
It's harmful.
Yeah.

1480
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:18,820
Yeah.
It's,

1481
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:19,530
it's,
it's,

1482
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:23,250
it's dangerous in that people are easily
led.

1483
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,100
And if you get people thinking that 
everything's a conspiracy,

1484
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:31,101
the real problem is they don't know what
the fuck a conspiracy actually is when 

1485
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:32,400
it's in front of them and it's real and 
there's a ton of them that are real.

1486
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,700
So when you call,
you're crying wolf around every corner 

1487
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:37,700
and then all of a sudden you turn a 
corner like,

1488
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,460
Holy Shit,
that's a real wolf.

1489
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:43,700
No one is listening.
So I agree that that's my frustration 

1490
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:47,721
with Alex too,
is that he has a conspiracy template on 

1491
01:12:47,721 --> 01:12:47,721
what?

1492
01:12:47,721 --> 01:12:51,590
For real world event happens.
He had shoe horns into this kind of 

1493
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,490
simplistic template.
Yeah,

1494
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,680
he's got some crazy ideas about Mars.
There's bay or no,

1495
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:01,120
was it the moon?
There's bases on the moon that they're 

1496
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,820
going to all the time.
Is that what he's saying?

1497
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,630
He's got some crazy moon thing.
Like he thinks that they.

1498
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,060
Well they went on the moon.
The problem is what they found up there,

1499
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:14,170
like he's got the goat spied to hybrid 
that he talks about is true though he 

1500
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:19,431
doesn't express it very well,
but I learnt in this measurement and 

1501
01:13:19,431 --> 01:13:21,000
Monistat soda those years ago that they 
really would like,

1502
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:25,520
um,
they really were a mixing up spy to silk

1503
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:27,780
with goat milk.
Here we go.

1504
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:32,490
Some kind of Alex Jones reveals the 
truth about animal human hybrids and the

1505
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,120
moon landing.

1506
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,720
The real problem.
Give us some.

1507
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,830
Give us some volume here because Alex,
uh,

1508
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,100
bleeding from your face left.
Yes.

1509
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:42,480
Oh,
we're scared.

1510
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:47,481
You're so mean.
It's like Kathy Griffin simulating 

1511
01:13:47,481 --> 01:13:49,110
murdering trump when trump says,
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1512
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,550
She was like,
how dare you,

1513
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,620
you broke me.
You talked me.

1514
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:55,540
I'm a victim of pause right then the 
run.

1515
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,510
I agree with him 100 percent on that.
I felt like that was so preposterous and

1516
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:03,480
I like Kathy as a person.
I've met her a 100 times.

1517
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,200
Kathy Griffin,
she's always sweet,

1518
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:11,530
but when she was saying that he's a 
bully and he broke me and I was like,

1519
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,770
oh my God,
you.

1520
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:17,860
She held up a photo of his headless body
that his children could have seen or it 

1521
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,800
is not as headless body.
His head separated from his body that 

1522
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:23,800
his children could have seen.

1523
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,300
Like,
is that like,

1524
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,570
what is that like,
that's,

1525
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:28,900
that's it's so effective.
It didn't.

1526
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,750
And then for her to say that he broke 
her,

1527
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:34,660
he's a bully.
Like all he did was say it was horrible.

1528
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:37,270
Yeah.
Like that he's targeting her.

1529
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:42,271
It's like this whole,
like professional victim thing that 

1530
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:44,230
people enjoy,
they enjoy,

1531
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:48,910
like taking on the role with such.
They have such energy.

1532
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:52,330
They put two being the victim.
It's just God,

1533
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:55,030
you shouldn't hold up pictures of 
people's heads.

1534
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,740
Okay.
If you don't like them.

1535
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:00,040
I mean,
especially like in this day and age when

1536
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:05,020
there's people that actually cut 
people's heads off and been show them on

1537
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:06,970
camera and me,
this is fucking crazy.

1538
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:08,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1539
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:09,460
You know,
by the way,

1540
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,990
speaking of cutting people's heads off 
and show them on camera,

1541
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:18,430
uh,
around the time that I was hanging out 

1542
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,541
with Alex at payment grove,
I was hanging out documenting this 

1543
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:24,631
Islamic militant Chordoma Mohammed who 
was the head of this group in Britain.

1544
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:29,791
Go download hydroone and a bunch of his 
people are the ones who like now drive 

1545
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:36,640
fans into pedestrians.
I'd a mixed all of the people with the 

1546
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:42,630
craziest and most pernicious idea is 
that I hung out with in the days rose to

1547
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:47,790
the top and I'm influenced their worlds.
So including.

1548
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,730
Yeah.
Well,

1549
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,660
you know,
Alex,

1550
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:51,730
I don't think Alex just have political 
sway.

1551
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,880
Well,
maybe he's right about these animal 

1552
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:56,880
human hybrid.
It's go back to that place.

1553
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,460
We need to find out what's happening on 
the moon.

1554
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,360
Did you turn off of it?
Go back to it.

1555
01:16:02,361 --> 01:16:02,920
What'd you do?

1556
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,880
I think around violence done so many 
death reporters.

1557
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,670
She broke me.
Looks like the day of the dead on CNN,

1558
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:22,120
just like Kathy Griffin.
I guess that's the look that sucker's 

1559
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,590
looking for and then they freak out and 
go.

1560
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:28,950
You called me irresponsible.
You said that I was a bad person.

1561
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:33,820
I've been crushed by you.
You're a bully.

1562
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,500
It's a bunch of corporate special 
interests that had their foot or their 

1563
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,500
knee on our neck and now they don't.
One hundred percent got us on the ground

1564
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,920
and they're just flipping out a bunch of
us.

1565
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:48,950
How the fuck fuck

1566
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:53,970
did he go from Kathy Griffin,
who's a comedian who did a gag that she 

1567
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,090
taught was going to get her attention to
backfire too.

1568
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:00,340
There are a bunch of corporate special 
interests who've had their knee on our 

1569
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:00,340
neck.
Like what?

1570
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:05,670
So how the fuck is Kathy Griffin and got
her knee and anybody's neck like she's 

1571
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:07,040
not a corporation.
She's not special interest.

1572
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:09,040
She's a fucking comic.
I know her.

1573
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:14,230
You can that conspiracy instantaneously.
You looking for the part where it talks 

1574
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:18,971
about the moon.
Look ahead and see what this human 

1575
01:17:18,971 --> 01:17:22,121
animal hybrid thing.
I agree with you that he has too much 

1576
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:26,291
influence over some people.
But I disagree in that.

1577
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:31,810
I don't think.
I don't think any of that should be 

1578
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:31,810
taken seriously.
Like what,

1579
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:33,140
what he just said should not be taken 
seriously.

1580
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,920
I mean,
none of this would matter if there 

1581
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,440
wasn't just the possibility that trump 
believes this stuff.

1582
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:42,560
Although I'll tell you what I would say 
last summer I was,

1583
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,700
when I was,
I've got this book,

1584
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,740
the elephant in the room,
try to trace that,

1585
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:47,330
just how it works.
Alex,

1586
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,320
buyer,
Roger Stone,

1587
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,030
meeting trump and,
and so on.

1588
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:55,390
I discovered one really interesting 
thing which is this is something that 

1589
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:57,821
Alex didn't like.
Alex did say to me when I was writing 

1590
01:17:57,821 --> 01:17:57,821
this book,
you could write whatever you want.

1591
01:17:57,821 --> 01:17:58,360
I don't care.
Um,

1592
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,590
but that turned out to not be entirely 
true.

1593
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:02,600
There were things that you did care 
about that I wrote.

1594
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:07,670
I'm,
one of them was a talked to Glenn Beck 

1595
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:11,360
and he told me to start this before 
trump was elected.

1596
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:16,660
He told me this story about how trump 
invited him to Mara Largo around the 

1597
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,890
time that trump was deciding to stand.

1598
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:23,500
And he phoned Glenn Beck even though 
they were both at Mara Lago.

1599
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,870
Um,
trump was in run one room and Glenn Beck

1600
01:18:26,871 --> 01:18:28,940
was in the other hand,
trump found Glenn Beck and said,

1601
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:31,450
I think you have like,
you know,

1602
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,680
you're so influential.
You are so great.

1603
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:34,610
You know,
you're great.

1604
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,360
You've got such influential can you can 
unite the tea party.

1605
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:40,520
And the mainstream Republicans in Glenn 
Beck thought,

1606
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:41,810
you know,
fuck you,

1607
01:18:41,811 --> 01:18:43,130
I know what you're doing here.
You know,

1608
01:18:43,131 --> 01:18:44,570
you're,
you're playing me.

1609
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:46,370
I've been down this road a million 
times.

1610
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:48,950
And then trump did the same thing to 
Alex.

1611
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,050
he phoned Alex and said,
you know,

1612
01:18:51,051 --> 01:18:53,090
you have so much influence.
Uh,

1613
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:58,091
you're so amazing.
And Alex bought it because according to 

1614
01:18:58,091 --> 01:18:59,310
Glenn Beck,
no,

1615
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,890
no.
I spoke to both of them.

1616
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,560
I mean,
you didn't speak to trump.

1617
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:08,740
I didn't speak to trump,
both Glenn Beck and Alex and I don't 

1618
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,400
know that Glen Book really did get the 
phone call from trump,

1619
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:15,401
right?
Well it was Glenn Beck told me that 

1620
01:19:15,401 --> 01:19:15,401
either

1621
01:19:15,401 --> 01:19:18,770
Glenn Beck has said some pretty 
ridiculous shit himself.

1622
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:23,890
It's true.
I only became a mormon at the age of 51.

1623
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:29,820
I only say I only ever read the book so,
um,

1624
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,270
but I do think that's convenient.
Like if it's right is convenient.

1625
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,710
It makes,
it makes it look interesting.

1626
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,490
Although,
well,

1627
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:40,520
I mean that's what Glen Beck told me.
I need a word for that store.

1628
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:43,760
I mean,
you don't really know what I mean.

1629
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:48,780
I come back to me that I believe that if
Donald trump called up Alex and said you

1630
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:52,310
were so influential and you're amazing 
and Alice will thank you,

1631
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:52,880
Mr.
President,

1632
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:54,350
we're gonna do our best to keep you in 
office.

1633
01:19:55,120 --> 01:20:00,120
Fight against the tyranny and all these 
fucking people out there that think 

1634
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,440
they're going to stop.
He's,

1635
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:03,030
he's,
I mean,

1636
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,730
that's who he is.
You know,

1637
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,470
you can get them riled up.
That's who he is.

1638
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:11,500
But I do.
I do think that Alex has a kind of bit 

1639
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,031
of a neophyte in,
in all of this because nobody had taken 

1640
01:20:14,031 --> 01:20:16,671
him that seriously before that nobody in
positions of power are taking them that 

1641
01:20:16,671 --> 01:20:17,010
seriously.
But here's the deal.

1642
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:22,740
I think trump played alex and Alex was 
played.

1643
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,050
You might be right,
but if,

1644
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:27,810
if trump turned on Alex and said,
uh,

1645
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:28,160
you know,
in,

1646
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,310
for awards is a bunch of losers,
much of this.

1647
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:35,311
Now Alex would,
he would turn it around again and he 

1648
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:38,750
would go after trump.
Like he,

1649
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:39,550
he would.
Oh,

1650
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:44,570
Alex is really smart.
Like Alex from the beginning set like 

1651
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:47,851
it.
I'm with trump until trump says 

1652
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:47,851
something,
you know,

1653
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:48,390
that I don't like it,
then I'll drop them like a hot potato.

1654
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,760
So Alex was very smart,
like Alex always gave him.

1655
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:53,850
He gave himself a sort of parachute and 
this relationship.

1656
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:58,850
So.
So I think trump played alex and Alex 

1657
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,690
was a bit too gullible and believed 
trump's slick talk.

1658
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:04,470
No,
but Alex was also smart and gave himself

1659
01:21:04,471 --> 01:21:07,740
and out whenever he wanted.
The out Alex's goddamned entertaining,

1660
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:11,580
like that alone is fucking entertaining,
especially for me a person.

1661
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:14,340
I'm not going to be influenced by these 
things that he says,

1662
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,760
but one thing that I have been 
influenced his bite him uncovering some 

1663
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,980
things that are real conspiracies,
one of them being agent provocateurs and

1664
01:21:23,981 --> 01:21:26,290
they use to disrupt peaceful protests.
Uh,

1665
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,050
this was something that I didn't know 
was a,

1666
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:33,030
was a standard tactic by the military 
and by certain politicians.

1667
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,240
And what they do is they will hire these
people.

1668
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:38,160
I don't know what branch of the 
military,

1669
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:41,250
what they do,
but they will hire these people and it's

1670
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:45,300
been confirmed by people that I know 
that are like special operators.

1671
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:51,210
They take these masked guys and say if 
they have some peaceful protest,

1672
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,940
the big one was the World Trade 
Organization.

1673
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:59,060
You remember that protest and these guys
with masks and government issued boots 

1674
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:01,800
came in,
started smashing windows,

1675
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:07,130
lighting things on fire and that gave 
them an excuse to come in and break up 

1676
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:11,691
this riot where it had been a peaceful 
protest where they couldn't stop the 

1677
01:22:11,691 --> 01:22:16,191
peaceful protest.
So now they break up these riots that 

1678
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:18,240
they've created themselves,
start arresting people left and right.

1679
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:22,980
Then they put up a no protest zone.
This is all documented.

1680
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:29,350
Did you just do some dance music music 
on and apparently.

1681
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:36,360
But see this is.
I mean he documented a.

1682
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:40,340
He documented this and has been 
documented by many people since then and

1683
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:45,380
and even in legitimate circles like a.
It was a big factor in the occupy Wall 

1684
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,920
Street movement.
The occupy Wall Street movement was 

1685
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,291
infiltrated Ad Nauseum by people from 
whatever branch of government,

1686
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,550
whoever the fuck they were.

1687
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,710
But yeah,
what they did was they,

1688
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,480
they cause chaos and then it gives me an
excuse to arrest them.

1689
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,800
And then in the World Trade Organization
thing,

1690
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:09,790
Alex detailed like with news reports,
independent news reports,

1691
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,210
how those people were not arrested and 
they were all negotiated,

1692
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:18,211
negotiated their freedom.
They all held up in a house somewhere 

1693
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:22,111
and then they got them out of there as 
soon as everybody kind of forgot about 

1694
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:25,561
it all,
and then they set up a no protest zone 

1695
01:23:25,561 --> 01:23:28,100
and the no protests.
Owen was fascinating because there's a 

1696
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,410
lot of people that disagreed with the 
policies of the World Trade Organization

1697
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:34,710
and these people were going to work with
a pin on a backpack or a jacket that 

1698
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,160
said dubby too,
and had a line through it.

1699
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:41,020
The police told them they could not go 
through with the pin on.

1700
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:46,170
They could not go to work with a pin on 
that had a line through the word WTO,

1701
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:47,560
like they opposed the WTO.

1702
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,840
This is a no protest zone.
Wow.

1703
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:54,990
That's Alex Jones showed that.
So as Wacky as he might be about alien 

1704
01:23:55,211 --> 01:24:00,211
babies are coming from another dimension
that here to steal your soul and make 

1705
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:01,000
you vote.
Libertarian like he,

1706
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:03,130
he,
he might be wrong about a lot of shit,

1707
01:24:03,131 --> 01:24:08,131
but he also,
he's got the balls to expose a lot of 

1708
01:24:08,131 --> 01:24:09,670
crazy shit that people didn't talk 
about.

1709
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:14,700
Yeah.
It reminds me of the time I went to 

1710
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,130
Arian nations just before it closed 
down.

1711
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,550
Remember Eddie nations?
What is it?

1712
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,980
Idaho.
Oh,

1713
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:20,420
they had that.
There was like near Boise or right?

1714
01:24:20,421 --> 01:24:22,100
Yeah,
a camp.

1715
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:22,960
Oh,
quarter lane.

1716
01:24:22,961 --> 01:24:24,490
That's what your leg.
Which is gorgeous.

1717
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:27,220
As crazy as that crazy lake up there.
They have.

1718
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,570
Yes.
Beautiful.

1719
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:33,600
So I was making a documentary about 
Randy Weaver about ruby rich spending

1720
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,930
lots of time with Randy's daughter 
Rachel,

1721
01:24:36,931 --> 01:24:38,210
who I liked a lot.
Anyway,

1722
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:43,910
part of the reason why the whole ruby 
rich escalation happened was because 

1723
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,210
randy wavered come to people.
A lot of people don't know that story,

1724
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,390
but I tell the story.
Yeah,

1725
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,610
okay.
So it was a family of white separatists,

1726
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:54,030
a rotten day,
and becky and their children,

1727
01:24:54,031 --> 01:24:59,031
Sarah and Rachel and a boy whose name 
I've forgotten people will be.

1728
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:06,510
It'll come to me anyway.
So they moved to Idaho early,

1729
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,340
you know,
early conspiracy theorists.

1730
01:25:08,341 --> 01:25:09,420
They moved to Idaho,
to a,

1731
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:13,380
to a cabin on top of a hill,
a place called Ruby Creek.

1732
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:19,250
Anyway,
Randy and Vicky used to go to area 

1733
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:19,950
nations for like their picnics and 
barbecues,

1734
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:23,150
but they weren't.
And this is a kind of pivotal points.

1735
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,940
They weren't as crazy as the people that
are heavy,

1736
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:28,860
heavier nations.
They weren't white supremacists,

1737
01:25:28,861 --> 01:25:31,590
but they were sort of fellow travelers 
but not quite as crazy.

1738
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:36,950
So any nations was infiltrated,
lack of white supremacist groups by lots

1739
01:25:37,771 --> 01:25:41,220
of federal agents and they saw randy and
thought they could work with them.

1740
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,710
So they said to around a,
you know,

1741
01:25:43,711 --> 01:25:46,380
will it be an informant for us?
And Randy said,

1742
01:25:46,381 --> 01:25:51,381
no.
So then they sent in this guy and asked 

1743
01:25:51,381 --> 01:25:54,561
randy to soar off a shotgun,
a quarter of an inch below the legal 

1744
01:25:54,561 --> 01:25:55,380
limit.
Uh,

1745
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:58,860
so randy sort of the shotgun for this 
guy.

1746
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:01,980
And then they said,
we're federal agents.

1747
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:07,010
You just committed a,
you're going to go to prison in less 

1748
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:11,451
shoe,
become an informant for us against area 

1749
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:13,691
nations.
And Randy being a kind of hot headed 

1750
01:26:13,691 --> 01:26:14,660
idiot,
said,

1751
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:15,800
no,
fuck off.

1752
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:18,230
I made a big show of saying no,
fuck off.

1753
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:23,500
So they went back to their cabins.
They went back to the cabin and a 

1754
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:27,860
warrant was issued for Randy's arrest 
and rented and turn up to court.

1755
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:31,700
So now the US marshals are like hiding 
in the bushes,

1756
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,340
looking at randy's cabin,
randy arms,

1757
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:36,200
his kids in his tiny little kids,
you know.

1758
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:39,110
So they're patrolling up and down 
outside the cabin with these guns.

1759
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:45,810
They were becoming increasingly paranoid
thinking they were being watched from 

1760
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:48,230
the bushes and they were being watched 
from the bushes,

1761
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,650
CCTV cameras in us marshals.
Anyway,

1762
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:56,651
one day the US marshals got too close to
the cabin and one of Randy's dogs 

1763
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:03,080
started barking.
And the kid,

1764
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,600
Randy's son came out.
Twelve year old kid.

1765
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:11,100
I'm look much younger.
Look like eight years old came out with 

1766
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,591
a gun and I'm gunfire happens that the 
US marshals shopped the little boy,

1767
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:23,860
nearly shot his arm off and he,
he turned around and tried to run back 

1768
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:27,410
to the cabin.
I'm shouting dad and the US Marshall's,

1769
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:32,900
um,
shot him in the back and killed him and 

1770
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,040
they killed the dog and one US Marshall 
was killed.

1771
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:39,430
And there's debate as to whether it was 
either the randy son or family friend or

1772
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:44,300
whether it was friendly fire or not.
Uh,

1773
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,850
so they got the son's body and put them 
in the,

1774
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:54,260
in the cabin.
And the next day this FBI sharp shooter 

1775
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:59,351
called alone Horror Yuchi turned up.
So the FBI surrounded the cabin.

1776
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,090
US Marshal had been killed.
Um,

1777
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:05,330
there were tanks,
there were hundreds of troops,

1778
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:10,720
this was like in the Clinton nineties 
when the Cold War was kind of dying and 

1779
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,960
they needed a new enemy.
And so the new enemy that week was Randy

1780
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,960
Weaver and his family.
So Vicky Weaver with holding their baby 

1781
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,980
Alicia,
but in the doorway of the cabin,

1782
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:27,620
um,
and the sharp shooter shot Vicky to the 

1783
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:32,441
face and then they,
they pulled Vicky's body into the cabin 

1784
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:33,930
and a,
on a,

1785
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:39,260
um,
randy was shot as well but survived 

1786
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,670
under siege and she would have lasted 
about two weeks of the kids inside the 

1787
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:47,720
cabin and the FBI outside of the cabin,
it ended up ending peacefully.

1788
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:53,450
Boger rights.
There was a bit kind of militia hero to 

1789
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:55,791
end up in,
sort of helped to stop it from 

1790
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:55,791
happening,
uh,

1791
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:55,791
to,
to,

1792
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:57,380
you know,
helped get randy out of the cabin.

1793
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,150
Um,
and in the end,

1794
01:28:59,151 --> 01:29:03,700
the daughters each got a million dollars
each compensation and um,

1795
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:08,990
and it all kind of faded away.
So I was making a documentary about all 

1796
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:08,990
of this,
uh,

1797
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:13,130
and I went to area nations because I 
thought I can just turn up and say I'm 

1798
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,280
friends with Andy Weaver and they'd let 
me in.

1799
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:19,580
So I turned up and immediately ordered 
these skinheads surrounded me and 

1800
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:24,231
started asking me what my genealogy was 
because they thought correctly the Euro 

1801
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:28,590
Ju Ju.
So I set a,

1802
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,960
what's my genealogy?
This,

1803
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:33,090
that was the word they use.
What's your genealogy?

1804
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,900
So I said,
uh,

1805
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:36,600
I said,
I'm Church of England.

1806
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:40,320
Uh,
I'm one of the Nazis.

1807
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:44,070
The area nations made a joke and said 
something like,

1808
01:29:44,071 --> 01:29:45,000
Oh,
Church of England,

1809
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,740
you're the guys who blog our beds.

1810
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:51,720
Some kind of joke and the skinheads sort
of drifted away from me and I'm,

1811
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:56,990
I,
I've always thought that the guy who 

1812
01:29:56,990 --> 01:30:00,470
alleviated the situation was maybe an 
undercover agent who was like calming 

1813
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,370
things down.
And so protecting me.

1814
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:06,360
So it's crossed my knowing how 
infiltrated those groups always are.

1815
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:11,390
Just like the video that you said,
knowing how infiltrated these groups 

1816
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:11,390
are,
do they know how infiltrated their,

1817
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:13,000
they must do?
Right.

1818
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,210
That's got to be so weird.
I know,

1819
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:18,260
I know they must do a because they were 
like,

1820
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,250
infiltrate it to fuck.
I mean all of them were.

1821
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:25,800
Well the.
That's one thing the federal government 

1822
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,131
does good to infiltrate the mob with was
getting people to wear wires.

1823
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:33,040
The good Adat yeah,
January in a wire or I forget where live

1824
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:36,240
there.
So I think,

1825
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:41,241
I think they protected me in that moment
when I could have had the shit kicked 

1826
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:41,241
out of me.

1827
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:41,241
You think so?
Yeah.

1828
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:43,020
I found out you were Jewish.
Yeah.

1829
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:48,110
Well,
because I am and I'm obviously fucking 

1830
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:48,110
Jewish.
No,

1831
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,090
not necessarily.
Do you think people don't know anything 

1832
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:51,090
and they think all English people of 
color.

1833
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:56,720
It was my own stupid fault.
I drove up the drive past all the signs 

1834
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,650
that said no Jews,
Jews turn back now as,

1835
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:03,740
as they surrounded me,
I did think to myself like if I get the 

1836
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:03,960
APP now,
it's my own stupid fault.

1837
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:08,340
So weird because it's a race and it's 
also religion.

1838
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,800
It's a weird one.
Yeah.

1839
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:13,220
No,
that's weird,

1840
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:14,340
right?
Yeah,

1841
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:17,670
because you're European,
but you're also Jewish,

1842
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:21,930
which is a religion.
So if you're a European atheist,

1843
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:24,390
are you still a Jew?
Yeah,

1844
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,220
well,
I mean I am basically,

1845
01:31:26,221 --> 01:31:28,380
I remember when I was to us with Elma 
bakary the,

1846
01:31:28,381 --> 01:31:30,190
uh,
Islamic fundamentalist and he,

1847
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,710
he outed me as a Jew.

1848
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:34,960
It is jihad training camp.
Yes.

1849
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:36,870
Bitch.
A place called Crawley,

1850
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,880
which is near Gatwick airport.
How rude.

1851
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,280
He said to me,
look at me with the infidel,

1852
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:46,281
John who is a Jew and it all went and I 
said,

1853
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:47,250
um,
I said,

1854
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,320
surely it's better to be a Jew than an 
atheist.

1855
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:50,850
And I heard someone in the crowd go,
no,

1856
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:54,000
it isn't.
The thing that really surprises me about

1857
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:59,001
that exchange is that I am an atheist.
So of all the places where I would 

1858
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:01,990
choose for the first time in my life to 
cut,

1859
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:06,991
to exert my Jewishness,
I could chose a fucking g had training 

1860
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:12,350
camp like wha what?
Self-Defeat you have second thoughts 

1861
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:16,081
about that one?
Were you in the midst of those people 

1862
01:32:16,081 --> 01:32:16,081
going,
what the fuck am I playing with here?

1863
01:32:16,081 --> 01:32:18,860
Yes.
Although quite quickly this,

1864
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:23,910
the tension dissipated and I remember 
like a bunch of these young radical 

1865
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:28,090
Islamists all started asking me like 
what it was like to be a Jew.

1866
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:30,790
They will like treating me like a kind 
of tropical fish.

1867
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:35,820
You would have babies to slug and I 
remember leaving that Jihad training 

1868
01:32:35,921 --> 01:32:40,921
camp that day thinking I'd done some 
sterling work in bringing together 

1869
01:32:41,051 --> 01:32:46,051
communities and you really believe that 
what I thought I believed it till like 

1870
01:32:46,051 --> 01:32:48,280
nine slash 11,
don't believe it anymore.

1871
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:53,520
I know most people were like,
people in that room at that scout hurt 

1872
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,920
went on to become suicide bombers and to
kill people and to drive fans into 

1873
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:04,800
people.
It was a different world before nine 

1874
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,230
slash 11 though.
The fear of jihadis was much,

1875
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:06,730
much,
much less prevalent.

1876
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:07,900
Yeah.
I made this funny.

1877
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:09,360
I made this film called talk to 
Martello.

1878
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:14,400
I spent a year with Omar Bakri and it 
was a kind of comic film about his 

1879
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,270
attempts to like,
you know,

1880
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:22,380
he said he wouldn't rest until we saw 
the flag of Islam flying over Downing 

1881
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:22,380
Street.

1882
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:26,520
So we made this sort of almost comic 
film about his sort of blundering 

1883
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:30,121
attempts to create like Sharia law in 
Britain and the joke of the film is at 

1884
01:33:30,121 --> 01:33:31,600
ice is never gonna work and it was kind 
of,

1885
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,460
you know,
some of his ideas were ridiculous.

1886
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:38,461
Like at one point he had these 5,000
black balloons carrying the call to war 

1887
01:33:39,361 --> 01:33:44,361
and these little,
like little leaflets like attached to 

1888
01:33:44,361 --> 01:33:44,530
these balloons,
uh,

1889
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:48,130
we'd like to slogans like Islam is the 
future of Britain and they were going to

1890
01:33:48,131 --> 01:33:50,950
like fly over London and La land 
wherever,

1891
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:54,150
but they hadn't properly calculated like
the,

1892
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:58,320
the weight ratio,
these fucking balloon let them off.

1893
01:33:58,350 --> 01:33:59,890
They go,
just like stayed on the floor.

1894
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:03,340
So all year they will like failing at 
doing everything.

1895
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,400
Uh,
but yeah,

1896
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:11,420
but len lye,
this is like 96 and then five years 

1897
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:11,650
later,
nine slash 11 happened.

1898
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:15,550
And now Omar's in prison in Beirut for 
inciting terrorism.

1899
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:18,610
And a lot of Omar's people became 
terrorists.

1900
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,140
True.
Jon Ronson,

1901
01:34:20,141 --> 01:34:22,610
you'd been around.
I've been around the block.

1902
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:27,770
I've seen some shift.
So when was the last time you were in 

1903
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:29,710
Alex's presence?
Uh,

1904
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,970
does texting count?
No.

1905
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:34,750
Have you been around him?
Yeah.

1906
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:35,950
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

1907
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:41,560
I was,
I went to visit her info wars last 

1908
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:41,560
summer.
Last August.

1909
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:46,320
And what did you think of him?
Like knowing him in the late nineties 

1910
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,300
when you guys wanted to Bohemian Grove 
together and knowing him now?

1911
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:54,690
Well,
I mean it's operation has expanded 

1912
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:54,690
massively.
Oh yeah,

1913
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:55,690
yeah.
When I knew Alex in the nineties,

1914
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,130
Info wars was a spare bedroom

1915
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:01,640
in his house with Choo Choo train 
wallpaper,

1916
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:07,300
trains at an empire strikes back poster.
It was Alex,

1917
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:11,780
Mike Hanson,
Alex's girlfriend.

1918
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,490
They always called a violet that have 
real name Kelly.

1919
01:35:17,010 --> 01:35:22,010
Um,
I said to her because I went to the 

1920
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:22,010
custody hearing for a couple of days.
Oh.

1921
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:25,601
So I saw them.
Then I went to the custody hearing 

1922
01:35:25,601 --> 01:35:27,401
because I was just curious and I said to
a lot the last time I saw the two of 

1923
01:35:27,401 --> 01:35:31,031
you,
you were like kissing and telling each 

1924
01:35:31,031 --> 01:35:33,401
other how much he loved each other.
And then like 16 years passes and it's 

1925
01:35:33,401 --> 01:35:35,450
the worst.
Like divorce at Texas has ever known.

1926
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:39,640
That's what divorce lawyers were saying,
like in the worst.

1927
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:44,710
Oh,
they just because we went national and 

1928
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:44,710
they just hated each other.
So much hate each other.

1929
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:46,730
So I say like,
yeah,

1930
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:51,790
I'm a.
Now Alex has got a staff of like 75 

1931
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:53,120
people,
uh,

1932
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,840
you know,
with like these giant Tiger's for his 

1933
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,420
supplement is male vitality supplements.

1934
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:04,510
Have you ever seen the video of when 
Joey Diaz and me are in our studio and 

1935
01:36:05,121 --> 01:36:10,121
Joey realizes that it's on the intranet,
so because it's on the Internet and he 

1936
01:36:10,221 --> 01:36:12,050
could say whatever he wants.
So we go,

1937
01:36:12,051 --> 01:36:14,590
we go live in our schools.
Uh,

1938
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:17,210
well actually from here on out,
we're on the Internet so you can kind of

1939
01:36:17,211 --> 01:36:18,980
say whatever you want,
but try to keep it clean.

1940
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:24,370
And the look of it for Joey Diaz,
it was like the cat who saw the canary 

1941
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:28,280
and realize that the cage was open and 
he was.

1942
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:32,000
So he's telling some story about 
smuggling weed through the airport.

1943
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:37,001
Listen to this,
listen to your bullshit congressmen or 

1944
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:39,731
your bullshit governor or even a 
bullshit presence as a political 

1945
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:42,800
resonance.
Same Shit because they give you every 

1946
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:42,800
four fucking years

1947
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,940
still vote for the fucking Momo.
And then you get mad about me saying the

1948
01:36:45,941 --> 01:36:50,941
word fuck with that.
Amadea was considered very solid points.

1949
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,480
Don't do.
I don't know.

1950
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:54,030
I know Joe,
you get it.

1951
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:59,400
But then just to let the American public
know that every four years they buy the 

1952
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,571
same shit they been buying for years at 
the same people with the articulation 

1953
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:09,390
and the holiday don't curse.
And they are Christians and they had a 

1954
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,091
family and these are the same people 
that shove it up your fucking ass every 

1955
01:37:12,091 --> 01:37:12,091
year.
The one thing that you'll get,

1956
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:14,980
I'll say fuck,
but I will not fuck around you.

1957
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,020
If I need something,
I'll ask you like a man.

1958
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:19,190
You're going to go fuck yourself.
You've cut.

1959
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,320
Hold on.
Hold on one second.

1960
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:20,850
Hey,
good job.

1961
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:22,520
Take a shuttle.
Joey Diaz.

1962
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:27,770
Facebook.
Check yourself before you wreck 

1963
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:27,770
yourself.
Big Dixon.

1964
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:29,430
Yes.
Get out of here.

1965
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,800
You're in trouble.
I'm powered fire.

1966
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:38,070
This is the.
I'm drawing a blank because that's the 

1967
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:38,070
most important.
Oh,

1968
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:38,070
okay.

1969
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:43,910
Hey,
he made a speech.

1970
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,340
He's a funny.
It's military lived.

1971
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:50,360
Do you think Alex had all solar?
This is great.

1972
01:37:50,361 --> 01:37:52,900
I have a good time without telling,
you know,

1973
01:37:52,901 --> 01:37:54,080
when I say all of this,
I mean,

1974
01:37:54,081 --> 01:37:59,081
do you think Alex,
the fact that the know that the 

1975
01:37:59,081 --> 01:37:59,160
spotlight is on them in a kind of 
unprecedented,

1976
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:05,280
famous like stressed out?
Honestly,

1977
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:09,240
I don't think he,
I've never met a guy in my life that has

1978
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:13,020
more teflon when it comes to stress.
Like I'm stressed out lately,

1979
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,330
but I go to the gym and feel fine,
had a cheeseburger,

1980
01:38:15,331 --> 01:38:18,030
probably shouldn't have that shit.
Try to stick to my diet.

1981
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:21,150
But it's hard when he's.
He doesn't give a fuck man.

1982
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:26,350
Like he's a weird guy.
Like he's got a very unusual 

1983
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:32,180
constitution.
You know what I bet did stress them out 

1984
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:32,180
though.
Uh,

1985
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:36,140
there was a couple of pending lawsuits 
like Chobani and Barney wasn't mean to 

1986
01:38:36,701 --> 01:38:37,470
body through yoga.

1987
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,650
People Buy Yogurt.
Yeah.

1988
01:38:40,651 --> 01:38:45,651
He got into trouble with Chobani because
he said they will like importing 

1989
01:38:45,651 --> 01:38:48,920
rapists.
Um,

1990
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:54,560
and of course he got into trouble with 
the pizza restaurant and I would bet me 

1991
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,090
pizza gate,
that Shit your info wars.

1992
01:38:57,091 --> 01:39:01,350
Alex Jones apologized for saying Shabani
supports migrant rapists.

1993
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:03,600
He didn't really say,
Oh,

1994
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:08,601
Jesus Christ,
he said me so fucking I would go into 

1995
01:39:08,601 --> 01:39:12,980
you that I would guarantee you that and 
the pizza gate stuff properly stressed 

1996
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:18,750
about because I think both of those were
risking his entire operation.

1997
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,130
Okay.
Let me tell you something.

1998
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:25,400
It might stress you out,
like if it was you and you were being 

1999
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:26,460
sued by Shabani,
you'd probably freaking out and be like,

2000
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,710
alright,
I've clearly made it horrible mistake.

2001
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,020
I need to come clean and I need to 
apologize.

2002
01:39:31,021 --> 01:39:36,021
I'm so paranoid that I freak out if I 
eat a Chibani guava and think I'm like,

2003
01:39:36,451 --> 01:39:41,451
fuck,
this is the most disgusting thing I've 

2004
01:39:41,451 --> 01:39:41,451
ever.

2005
01:39:41,451 --> 01:39:41,451
And I,
I my,

2006
01:39:41,451 --> 01:39:41,750
my,
my threshold for getting like,

2007
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:45,420
panicky and stressed out is very low.
That's incredible considering you are in

2008
01:39:45,421 --> 01:39:46,860
a jihadi camp.
Yeah,

2009
01:39:46,861 --> 01:39:47,610
I know.
I,

2010
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:52,650
I often wonder why I put myself.
Maybe that's why it's so compelling when

2011
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:55,170
you do.
Yeah.

2012
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:57,980
But Alex doesn't new,
right?

2013
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,070
No,
I know him,

2014
01:39:59,071 --> 01:39:59,700
man.
He's,

2015
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:02,500
he's a different dude.
You know,

2016
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:04,180
like he's got like,
there's,

2017
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:07,590
I don't agree with a lot of the stuff he
says,

2018
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,690
just like I don't agree with a lot of 
stuff my friend Eddie says,

2019
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,300
but I love the both of them.
It's,

2020
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,140
it's weird man.
And I get it.

2021
01:40:13,141 --> 01:40:18,141
I get people saying that he's got too 
much influence and he does know my take 

2022
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:22,140
is like if you really think there's 
fucking alien bases on the moon and that

2023
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:25,110
there's child slaves on Mars,
fucking shame on you.

2024
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:26,830
Shame on you.
You know,

2025
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:29,220
I think the deeper and the more crazy he
goes,

2026
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:34,090
the better his show is more.
I mean,

2027
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:37,500
I'm a bad person for that.
I don't think I am though.

2028
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:43,530
You come in wondering why I put myself 
in dangerous situations that would 

2029
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:45,560
really thinking about it a little bit.
Maybe.

2030
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,140
Maybe it's because people who have 
anxiety disorders,

2031
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:49,990
uh,
uh,

2032
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:53,010
quite good when it comes to actual

2033
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,770
difficult situations because we've 
rehearsed it so many times.

2034
01:40:56,771 --> 01:41:01,771
Like we panic unnecessarily so often the
when something really worth panicking 

2035
01:41:01,771 --> 01:41:03,280
comes along.
We actually handled it really well.

2036
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:04,060
Well,
let me ask you,

2037
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:09,230
has there ever been a situation where 
you were confronted with an idea and 

2038
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:09,230
you're like,
you know what,

2039
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,110
that one is too dangerous.
I'm not doing that.

2040
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:14,500
Yeah.
When I was writing the manifesto goats,

2041
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,020
uh,
the metastatic goats was about this kind

2042
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:22,021
of secret unit in the eighties of like 
soldiers who were trying to like walk 

2043
01:41:22,021 --> 01:41:24,700
through walls and visible and kills that
remote viewing as well.

2044
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:26,210
Remote viewing was that,
there was a,

2045
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:27,610
they were,
they were different,

2046
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:30,190
but there was an overlap.
I met a bunch of those guys,

2047
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:35,370
right.
I was doing that so far show right now 

2048
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,070
Joel mcmonagle and that day to remember 
their names.

2049
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:39,340
I met with him talking to me about how 
they found,

2050
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:44,550
you know,
various bad people using this weird 

2051
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,550
stuff.

2052
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,550
And I was like,
MMM,

2053
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:45,910
yeah.
Oh yeah,

2054
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:46,420
no,
I.

2055
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:50,320
So I met all of those people to remote 
viewing sounds like really exciting,

2056
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:53,860
but you know,
psychic spies in the military.

2057
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:58,861
But it turns out that actually their 
labs were quite shit because basically 

2058
01:41:58,861 --> 01:42:03,500
there's the fucking room or they try to 
like psychically sketch like 20th and 

2059
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,830
every one of them told me that,
um,

2060
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:09,220
because they were black up because they 
didn't officially exist,

2061
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:14,430
you have no coffee machine had to like 
bring them coffee into work every day 

2062
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:15,110
because they couldn't justify having 
also the,

2063
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:20,120
the,
the room that they have been was really 

2064
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:20,120
bad because they couldn't get it 
repaired because they didn't exist.

2065
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,180
Yeah.
Um,

2066
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:25,070
so their lives are quite shit.
So I tell her how I,

2067
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,730
how I came to this story.
So that was out.

2068
01:42:27,731 --> 01:42:30,400
This guy called Jim Schnabel had written
this book called remote viewers,

2069
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:31,260
which kind of,
you know,

2070
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:32,650
uncovered all of that stuff.

2071
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:37,870
And there was this magician called ray 
hyman who was like a skeptic.

2072
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:42,871
I think he's dead now.
The CIA brought him in to assess the 

2073
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:47,611
remote viewing program to see whether 
they should keep it going or close it 

2074
01:42:47,611 --> 01:42:48,510
down.
Um,

2075
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,560
and ray hyman said it was kind of 
nonsense.

2076
01:42:50,561 --> 01:42:53,920
And so that helped them.
The CIA close down the unit.

2077
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:57,670
So I met Ray hyman and I just happened 
to say to him,

2078
01:42:57,671 --> 01:42:59,920
it's like one of those questions that 
kind of changes your life.

2079
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:03,160
I said to him like,
so when you were like in the military,

2080
01:43:03,161 --> 01:43:05,530
like sniffing around with the remote 
view is,

2081
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:10,950
did you happen to notice anything else 
going on anywhere you went?

2082
01:43:11,231 --> 01:43:16,231
Yeah.
He said there was this general called 

2083
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:18,080
stubble bine who thought he could like 
burst clouds with his mind and there's 

2084
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:22,660
this kernel called Channon who thought 
that he could lie,

2085
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:26,020
you know,
train soldiers to like fast for a month.

2086
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:31,260
And so I had these two names,
stubble bone and Shannon and the whole 

2087
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:31,350
metastatic goat stuff,
which,

2088
01:43:31,351 --> 01:43:33,140
which wasn't out in the open all came 
out.

2089
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:38,160
It was amazing that they were trying to 
kill goats just by staring at them 

2090
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:38,370
[inaudible].
So yeah.

2091
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,670
So they had,
like,

2092
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:44,720
I've,
I met this guy who was that part of the 

2093
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,460
goat staying program and they had like,
this is all at Fort Bragg.

2094
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:50,910
Um,
I had a trip around Fort Bragg one time 

2095
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:53,670
and I to them like,
so where's Gottlieb?

2096
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:59,050
Otherwise,
you're not supposed to know about clap 

2097
01:43:59,050 --> 01:43:59,050
lap.
Yeah.

2098
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:00,080
Um,
so they had like a one point,

2099
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:05,081
they had like 30 goats in a room and 
they were all staring at to 16.

2100
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:10,820
They were like numbers on their backs 
and go number 17 fell over,

2101
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:15,320
which I suppose there's collateral 
damage.

2102
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:16,790
Uh,
I mean I would,

2103
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:21,170
I would argue that if he stared at it 
long enough it's going to fall over.

2104
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:26,620
I mean,
everything's going to fall over 

2105
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:26,620
eventually.
Sorry.

2106
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:26,620
I was drinking water when I was 
laughing.

2107
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:27,410
Okay.
Sorry.

2108
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:30,470
God really did fall over and die.
Well No.

2109
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,150
Oh well guys,
severely.

2110
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,960
So we tracked down the Goat Stereo.
This is two.

2111
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:41,110
He now runs a dance studio in Ohio,
the severely dance and martial arts 

2112
01:44:41,741 --> 01:44:44,660
studios.
So we tracked him down.

2113
01:44:44,661 --> 01:44:46,400
I said,
I said to him on the phone,

2114
01:44:46,401 --> 01:44:51,401
so do you still ever kill goats?
Just by staring at them and he went 

2115
01:44:51,621 --> 01:44:52,910
with,
with a matter of fact.

2116
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:58,540
Just last week I,
I killed my hamster just by staring at 

2117
01:44:58,540 --> 01:44:59,480
him,
be like three days old.

2118
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:00,770
He said,
he said,

2119
01:45:00,771 --> 01:45:02,690
he said he caught it on video and I 
said,

2120
01:45:02,691 --> 01:45:04,010
well,
can we come and watch the video?

2121
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,080
So we weren't said,
okay.

2122
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:09,980
So we flew to Ohio to meet guys 
severely.

2123
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:15,540
Uh,
the whole time his son was filming me 

2124
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:16,370
like the whole time I was there he was 
filming me.

2125
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:21,820
So eventually he admitted like why they 
were filming me and it was that he was 

2126
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:26,411
worried that I might be al-Qaida let 
China learn how to stare at people and 

2127
01:45:27,291 --> 01:45:28,370
kill them.
Yes.

2128
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:31,010
So he was like filming me,
just inserting really believed it.

2129
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:33,260
Totally.
So will this video,

2130
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:37,940
did it show him staring in Hampshire and
I saw the video of the hamster staring.

2131
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,110
I should tell you about the way that 
the,

2132
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:44,111
the,
the moment when I think I've pinpointed 

2133
01:45:44,111 --> 01:45:46,601
the moment when they worked out that I 
wasn't Al-qaida and it was because it 

2134
01:45:46,601 --> 01:45:49,970
turns out that guy severely,
his daughter is in the movie Chicago,

2135
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:52,500
like is one of the dances.
And so I Kinda,

2136
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:57,550
I kinda shrieked Oh I,
oh I love Catherine Zeta Jones.

2137
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:02,210
And I think they all kind of like a kind
of deep cover.

2138
01:46:02,211 --> 01:46:05,060
Al Qaeda operative wouldn't think to go 
that feminists.

2139
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:06,260
Uh,
so,

2140
01:46:06,261 --> 01:46:06,830
uh,
yeah.

2141
01:46:06,831 --> 01:46:08,780
So then they showed me the hubs to 
video.

2142
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:13,760
It's a hamster.
I'm sure this is on youtube by the way.

2143
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:14,910
I'm,
I'm,

2144
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:17,750
I'm sure you can find this.
It's if you typed in,

2145
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:20,960
I don't know,
Jon Ronson,

2146
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:25,961
hamster,
crazy roads of the World Guy Savannah 

2147
01:46:25,961 --> 01:46:25,970
was so like,
he's like,

2148
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,960
so perhaps just like running around in 
its wheel and that guy's off camera,

2149
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:34,990
like staring at the hamster.
And then finally the Hampton gets off 

2150
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:37,850
the whale and it's like all the sawdust 
and then the hamster light drops,

2151
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:43,150
light stops moving,
drops down and stops moving amid the 

2152
01:46:43,150 --> 01:46:44,120
sawdust.
So I'm like,

2153
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:49,150
whoa.
And then the hamster gets up again and 

2154
01:46:49,231 --> 01:46:50,280
the video ends.

2155
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:55,790
So I was like,
that's not that guy said he flew all the

2156
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:05,130
way to Ohio.
I see a video of a hamster guy said,

2157
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:05,430
yeah,
yeah.

2158
01:47:05,431 --> 01:47:07,140
My wife,
my wife told me like,

2159
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,160
not to.
My wife said,

2160
01:47:08,161 --> 01:47:09,960
don't show them the part with a hamster 
dies.

2161
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:13,110
What?
Yeah,

2162
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:18,111
in case I was like a bleeding heart 
liberal and his wife told him to not 

2163
01:47:19,261 --> 01:47:23,160
show you the video that you flew all the
way to fuck to Ohio to see what.

2164
01:47:23,161 --> 01:47:26,520
I think it's possible that that just 
doesn't die.

2165
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:29,430
I'm no way,
Bro,

2166
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:34,670
but it's true.
The guy showed me like a whole full 

2167
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:35,640
screen.
Please.

2168
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:37,470
You need to put it goes belly up,
man.

2169
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:42,560
Hey,
what happens when you've got a guest 

2170
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:42,560
who's on for three hours and they want 
to use the birth?

2171
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:42,640
Just go into a bathroom.
Good.

2172
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:43,580
Can you cover for.
Yeah,

2173
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:43,970
yeah,
yeah.

2174
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,430
We'll,
we'll,

2175
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:45,920
we'll turn the volume here.
Okay.

2176
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:48,270
Oh,
he's doing some fake martial arts too.

2177
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:51,390
Oh,
you don't understand.

2178
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:53,730
This is my favorite stuff.
Jon Ronson.

2179
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:56,790
Look at this.
This is my favorite stuff.

2180
01:47:56,791 --> 01:48:00,000
It's all like pokes triangle.
Oh,

2181
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:05,001
it's called the triangle of death.
I'll go back to that.

2182
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:08,640
I will need you to watch that again.
This just hilarious.

2183
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:14,820
The arteries,
the sophos airway.

2184
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:19,360
Yeah.
Helping a person.

2185
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:23,480
You're hurting a person.
They need a clear airway.

2186
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:29,170
They need to be able to breathe and they
need to have circulation of blood.

2187
01:48:29,181 --> 01:48:31,360
So their body pause every second.

2188
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:35,840
What's one thing about bullshit artists 
use these real technical terms,

2189
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:38,090
like especially in martial arts,
bullshit artists,

2190
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:40,450
they always talk about like,
uh,

2191
01:48:40,510 --> 01:48:45,510
like medical terms that they're 
destructing the nerve,

2192
01:48:45,531 --> 01:48:48,710
the vegas nerve that goes to the brain 
and the,

2193
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:50,660
this is your c,
six c,

2194
01:48:50,661 --> 01:48:55,661
seven cervical disc and I'm going to 
tack the cervical disc through the 

2195
01:48:55,661 --> 01:48:56,750
carotid artery.
They're all like,

2196
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:01,840
is almost like they learn all these 
technical terms to sorta make their 

2197
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:02,750
horseshit look more palatable

2198
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:09,310
in order to live in the poison,
the poison hands showing you how to 

2199
01:49:10,821 --> 01:49:12,800
strike,
to penetrate the skin,

2200
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:14,090
of which we have a way to do that.

2201
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:17,950
Please don't show anything

2202
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:18,640
buddy,
sir,

2203
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,890
with your flabby grandma arms.

2204
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:23,850
He's going to watch.
He's going to show you.

2205
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:27,510
Oh boy.
The alive.

2206
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:33,710
It's just the end part is my favorite.
Where he does like the fucking karate 

2207
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:36,000
stands behind them.
The guys back.

2208
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:41,360
Sit Your Little Lulu.
Pan To the back.

2209
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:43,700
Uh,
guys.

2210
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:48,710
Wonderful.
I don't know why man.

2211
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:55,600
I don't know why,
but it still gives me so much pleasure.

2212
01:49:56,230 --> 01:50:01,230
I enjoy fake martial arts videos more 
than almost anything more,

2213
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:06,691
almost as much as hold this beer,
that twitter account that I fucking 

2214
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,940
every two days after retweet one because
I find a good new one.

2215
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:12,850
I don't know why he's got new stuff.
Oh,

2216
01:50:12,851 --> 01:50:14,380
what's he going to do?
Mine Development.

2217
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:15,640
Oh,
mind developed.

2218
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:17,890
Let me see this.
Let me see.

2219
01:50:17,891 --> 01:50:19,990
This guy's Culligan close.
He's touching him.

2220
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,250
He's about to touch him.

2221
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:29,300
What the fuck was that?
You guys have had to touch him.

2222
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:33,170
Means that you can do whatever has to be
done to protect.

2223
01:50:33,171 --> 01:50:34,790
Not hurt.
These kids here,

2224
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:40,280
this development of the so you know you 
have to ship the me,

2225
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,000
right?
This isn't.

2226
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:51,150
This is your bread and butter.
This is well content.

2227
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:56,310
This is something I've been doing more 
than ever doing anything in my whole 

2228
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:59,171
life.
This is the first real exercise towards 

2229
01:50:59,171 --> 01:50:59,790
that goal.
You,

2230
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:04,080
Kevin.
It's so fucking stupid.

2231
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:08,790
He's the goat stuff and the going to 
punch a watermelon,

2232
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,180
right?
Oh,

2233
01:51:09,181 --> 01:51:10,170
you're crazy,
bro.

2234
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:11,720
Watermelon Salad.
Oh,

2235
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:13,470
no way.
That's impenetrable.

2236
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,740
It's basically a brick wall.
Fingers.

2237
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:17,010
I'm just gonna.
Use his fingers.

2238
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:18,870
One,
two.

2239
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:23,370
Oh,
I broke his hand,

2240
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:24,900
son,
you broke your hand,

2241
01:51:24,901 --> 01:51:29,901
kid.
He's the first guy to tell me about the 

2242
01:51:29,901 --> 01:51:29,901
dim mak.
The debt touch.

2243
01:51:29,901 --> 01:51:30,480
He went right through that watermelon,
bro.

2244
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:33,390
I would let that guy do that to me.
I'd be like,

2245
01:51:33,391 --> 01:51:35,070
okay,
fuck the watermelon dude.

2246
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:36,970
Let me tighten up my stomach.
Oh yeah,

2247
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:39,000
I've seen.
I've seen this stuff.

2248
01:51:39,030 --> 01:51:41,350
This is this guy doing military stuff,
right?

2249
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:42,310
This is.
This is deep.

2250
01:51:42,590 --> 01:51:46,280
This is really military,
but he's wearing a military out.

2251
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:51,460
Hey,
I do know that guy went to Fort Bragg 

2252
01:51:52,711 --> 01:51:55,440
and depakote stuff like he showed me 
documentation,

2253
01:51:55,441 --> 01:51:57,060
but see this right here.
Listen man.

2254
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,620
I used to do this.
Look stupid.

2255
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,780
He picked his leg up when he's doing it.
Oh,

2256
01:52:02,781 --> 01:52:05,130
this is hilarious.
Kids can do at his fingertips.

2257
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:08,340
Hi My right.
Well,

2258
01:52:09,010 --> 01:52:11,060
here's the thing.
When I was a kid,

2259
01:52:11,061 --> 01:52:16,061
like real young,
we used to do these demonstrations when 

2260
01:52:16,121 --> 01:52:17,340
I was like 15,
right?

2261
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:20,660
When we would open up a new school,
would you do these demonstrations?

2262
01:52:20,661 --> 01:52:23,270
And it was the only time we ever broke 
boards.

2263
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:26,090
We fucking never presents really easy to
do.

2264
01:52:26,370 --> 01:52:29,200
Looks hard to the desert,
but working on hot coals right?

2265
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:32,900
It's way easier than walking on hot 
coals because those things,

2266
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:35,650
first of all,
the way they're cut is with the car.

2267
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:40,700
Like the grain is a.
it's going in a matter of how.

2268
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,350
What's the way we describe it.
So they give you.

2269
01:52:42,351 --> 01:52:47,351
You're holding something up.
The is actually going in the way that 

2270
01:52:47,351 --> 01:52:49,790
you want it to break.
So you're breaking it with the grain you

2271
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:51,950
literally can do with your fingers like 
I could.

2272
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:55,130
You could take.
Those are thin pieces of wood to you can

2273
01:52:55,131 --> 01:53:00,131
take this piece of if this would,
if this pad was a would you would just 

2274
01:53:00,131 --> 01:53:02,930
go like this with two fingers,
just go snap and would break bricks like

2275
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,320
nothing.

2276
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:06,680
I was 15 and when we do this,
karate kicks and punches and stuff,

2277
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:09,110
they always broke,
always broke.

2278
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:11,450
So what are so easy to break?
So here's the question now,

2279
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:16,451
what does it say about like special 
forces at Fort Brag that they would 

2280
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:19,900
bring a guy in today?
They brought that guy in.

2281
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:20,900
Well,
I mean it wasn't like.

2282
01:53:20,901 --> 01:53:25,901
I don't,
I don't believe it was like an sanction 

2283
01:53:25,901 --> 01:53:28,061
from the very top,
but he certainly went to Fort Bragg and 

2284
01:53:28,061 --> 01:53:30,350
stared at goats.
He stared at goats at Fort Bragg.

2285
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:35,410
Well,
they're probably just grabbed whatever 

2286
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:35,410
dummies they could find like it gets.
Some dudes want to stare at a goat.

2287
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:38,750
Like there's a lot of people though.
Here's one thing that is a fact.

2288
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:44,080
There's a lot of people,
particularly in the eighties and the 

2289
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,560
nineties before the ultimate fighting 
championship came around.

2290
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:48,740
There was a lot of fake martial arts out
there.

2291
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:53,860
A lot.
I know people that were teaching fake 

2292
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:55,430
martial arts that got into the military 
that got into the police.

2293
01:53:55,700 --> 01:54:00,700
I knew the guy who was deep in the 
police force and he had fake martial 

2294
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:01,280
arts,
like his martial arts.

2295
01:54:01,281 --> 01:54:06,281
We're fucking completely useless and it 
tallies with the US military Crete 

2296
01:54:06,981 --> 01:54:09,020
olive,
like thinking out the box,

2297
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:11,150
like if we don't try this stuff,
nobody else will try.

2298
01:54:11,151 --> 01:54:14,570
This is going on here.
They're blurring easy.

2299
01:54:14,571 --> 01:54:16,640
It is to break that.
This special forces,

2300
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:19,220
special special ops.
Okay.

2301
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:20,330
So yeah,
there you go.

2302
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:23,030
I never killing goats con.
Wow.

2303
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:28,060
I've never even heard of that one thing,
but then stepper,

2304
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:33,570
pride,
general stuff about who I'm sure would 

2305
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:33,570
have been a fan of this show because he 
was,

2306
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:36,710
he was a big fan of Alex's and so on.
So he was head of army intelligence.

2307
01:54:36,711 --> 01:54:41,711
He had 16,000
soldiers under his command and he 

2308
01:54:41,711 --> 01:54:42,200
totally believed in all of this stuff.
He believed in that stuff.

2309
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:47,400
But that guy was doing general stubble.
Stubborn would when he was head of army 

2310
01:54:47,481 --> 01:54:52,070
intelligence in Arlington would try and 
walk through his walled,

2311
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:56,180
uh,
because he told me one time,

2312
01:54:56,181 --> 01:54:57,800
he said like,
he said,

2313
01:54:57,801 --> 01:55:01,580
what is the atom mostly made up of 
space?

2314
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:04,760
What is the wall mostly made up of 
atoms.

2315
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:07,980
I mean,
to me the key word this is most mostly a

2316
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:08,780
big part of that.

2317
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:13,100
He would like stand up from behind his 
desk.

2318
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:13,760
I'm like,
you know,

2319
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:16,160
basically run into,
you should have asked him,

2320
01:55:16,161 --> 01:55:19,010
what's an atom bomb made up?
You fucking idiot.

2321
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:21,080
He said,
let me show you a video.

2322
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,780
He that he would like,
bruises knows.

2323
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:27,890
He said fortunately he was going through
a messy divorce at the time.

2324
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:32,891
So like,
like other people in his office just 

2325
01:55:32,891 --> 01:55:32,891
assumed it was like,
you know,

2326
01:55:32,891 --> 01:55:36,280
his wife beater market,
but in fact he was trying to get away 

2327
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:40,211
from this wall walk and an asshole.
He was trying to merge the spaces 

2328
01:55:40,211 --> 01:55:41,600
between that and just kept pumping his 
nose.

2329
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

2330
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:43,200
This is,
this is,

2331
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:44,070
this is,
yeah.

2332
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:45,060
This was fun.
This,

2333
01:55:45,110 --> 01:55:48,930
my couple of years and when I did the a 
Scifi show,

2334
01:55:48,931 --> 01:55:53,931
we did a whole segment on remote viewing
and we actually had a guy who claimed to

2335
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:59,811
be a successful remote viewer and we,
we set up this location and asked him,

2336
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:04,160
me and Dj growthy Oh yeah,
yeah.

2337
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:05,500
Who's a skeptic.
Yeah.

2338
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,830
Very nice guy.
And,

2339
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,510
and you know,
Dj was just as accurate,

2340
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:10,700
just guessing,
right?

2341
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,390
Because this guy was.
Yeah.

2342
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,990
I think actually now that I think about,
I think Dj was more accurate,

2343
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,590
you know,
the um,

2344
01:56:18,730 --> 01:56:23,730
yeah,
the kind of dark secret remote feeling 

2345
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:23,730
world.
I'm an account,

2346
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:25,140
you can't sort of totally blame the 
remote viewers for this.

2347
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:30,141
But.
So the remote viewing unit for made got 

2348
01:56:30,141 --> 01:56:34,130
declassified and shut down.
So a lot of these remote viewers then 

2349
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:38,130
set up their own training centers,
including the Danes in,

2350
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,180
I don't know,
maybe in Vegas,

2351
01:56:39,181 --> 01:56:43,770
some or some are not.
So at Dame's had this student

2352
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,900
cool

2353
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:48,160
neato says,
Hey,

2354
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:53,650
um,
there was a woman called court May and 

2355
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:55,120
then there was this other students have 
gotten their names anyway,

2356
01:56:55,121 --> 01:56:58,510
but they would then.
So at times taught them remote viewing,

2357
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:03,750
these two people who would then go on 
the art bell show and they became light 

2358
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:04,110
lie,
you know,

2359
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:07,570
regular guests on the show and they're 
the ones.

2360
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:09,820
Then these two have ed dames and 
students.

2361
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:15,120
They're the ones who basically announced
on the bell show that the Hale Bopp 

2362
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:18,940
comet had a companion object in its 
tail.

2363
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,440
It remote viewed that help up comment 
that was about to pass over the earth,

2364
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:28,680
how to companion object in its tail and 
listening to the art bell show was the 

2365
01:57:30,161 --> 01:57:35,161
heaven's Gate Group.
So they decided that that was the 

2366
01:57:35,161 --> 01:57:35,710
spaceship they were waiting for.
Yes.

2367
01:57:35,711 --> 01:57:38,170
So they all killed themselves to get on 
the spaceship.

2368
01:57:39,730 --> 01:57:44,730
Prudence,
Kalibrasi and another guy whose name I 

2369
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:44,730
forgot.

2370
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:45,160
Good Lord.
Yeah.

2371
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:47,520
So that's the sort of weird butterfly 
effect.

2372
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:48,880
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

2373
01:57:49,210 --> 01:57:54,210
That whole thing was such a,
it's amazing where people want to 

2374
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:57,451
believe now this,
when it goes back to conspiracy 

2375
01:57:57,451 --> 01:58:00,331
theorists or whether it's um,
the remote viewers or even someone who 

2376
01:58:00,331 --> 01:58:04,951
would watch that guy's karate videos and
think that he's really doing death 

2377
01:58:04,951 --> 01:58:08,041
touches.
He's talking about it as a method of 

2378
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:08,530
going through the skin to attack the 
Oregon.

2379
01:58:08,531 --> 01:58:09,960
So.
Oh yeah.

2380
01:58:09,970 --> 01:58:11,520
He told me all of that said,
oh,

2381
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:13,910
he showed me a photograph of um,
uh,

2382
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:19,020
well actually he accidentally showed me 
a photograph of him karate chopping a 

2383
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:22,030
goat that you weren't supposed to see 
that one.

2384
01:58:22,031 --> 01:58:22,450
Yeah,
he did.

2385
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:27,550
He did the death touch on a goat.
A lot of what you could fuck a goat up 

2386
01:58:27,551 --> 01:58:28,890
if you hit it in the right spot.
Yeah.

2387
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:34,020
A lot of indignities meted out to goats 
in the US military.

2388
01:58:34,670 --> 01:58:36,170
Got.
You're actually pretty tough though,

2389
01:58:36,171 --> 01:58:41,171
now that I think about it.
I bet you probably couldn't kill a goat 

2390
01:58:41,171 --> 01:58:41,171
with a karate chop.
Right?

2391
01:58:41,171 --> 01:58:42,400
I mean,
you have to really

2392
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:45,280
hit it hard in the bright spot in the 
neck.

2393
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:50,020
Is it true that in the movie adaptation 
of my book,

2394
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:55,080
the metastatic goats,
there's a kind of bit of comedy where 

2395
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:58,520
somebody thinks that they fell victim to
the death touch that,

2396
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:02,860
but it happened like years later,
25 years ago,

2397
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:06,280
he was given the death touch and now 
he's dying from it.

2398
01:59:06,281 --> 01:59:08,400
Twenty five years later was in the 
movie.

2399
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:09,430
Yeah.
That was in the movie.

2400
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:12,800
Is it true in like the death touch world
and the world?

2401
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:17,870
Is it true that some people think like 
you can touch them now and that's the 

2402
01:59:20,450 --> 01:59:21,820
moment.
It was great.

2403
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,770
Yeah.
Uh,

2404
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:28,490
that's the moment.
So you're saying,

2405
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:34,050
so is it true in the death touch world 
that people think you can do the dim 

2406
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:37,510
back on someone and they'd die years 
later of seemingly natural causes?

2407
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,910
I'm sure that someone who believes that 
for sure.

2408
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

2409
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:43,120
I mean if you see that guy that was just
having,

2410
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:46,300
did you see that guy who did all the 
crazy stuff and the guy falls down?

2411
01:59:46,301 --> 01:59:47,790
You might have missed it.
Yeah,

2412
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:49,910
but that's the movie.
That's the movie based.

2413
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:51,450
Oh,
you mean in the load?

2414
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:52,090
Yeah.
The other guy,

2415
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,070
he does all the this using an English 
word for you.

2416
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:59,230
He does all these crazy like fake karate
moves up.

2417
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,020
Slap,
slap,

2418
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,090
slap someone.
Yeah.

2419
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:03,970
Yeah.
There's people that believe all kinds of

2420
02:00:03,971 --> 02:00:04,660
crazy stuff.
Well,

2421
02:00:04,661 --> 02:00:09,661
you know,
he definitely inspired the characters 

2422
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:10,720
into metastatic goats movie.
Have you ever seen what happens when one

2423
02:00:10,721 --> 02:00:13,870
of these fake death touch guys fights a 
real fighter?

2424
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,650
No.
Did I kind of get to shit,

2425
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:20,660
get terrific.
There's a few of them racked and these 

2426
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:24,451
guys just don't seem to learn.
One of them that was recently in China 

2427
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:29,580
was so,
so poorly received that the guy who was 

2428
02:00:29,621 --> 02:00:34,621
the MMA fighter had to go into hiding 
because he beat the living fuck out of 

2429
02:00:34,621 --> 02:00:38,641
this guy in like 10 seconds later the 
guy came out and did all this crazy 

2430
02:00:38,641 --> 02:00:39,810
stuff when they go to smashes him in the
face,

2431
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:43,990
mma style and his con food's no good 
this day.

2432
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:48,990
Watch this.
So you're the young guy in orange shoes 

2433
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:54,360
who's like a legit fighter.
And then the other guy who is this silly

2434
02:00:54,911 --> 02:00:59,560
death touch guy dressed up like he's in 
a different century and like,

2435
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:04,680
watch how this goes down because it's 
horrible because this guy on the left 

2436
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:10,410
with the orange sneakers on is a real 
train fighter and this other guy has a 

2437
02:01:11,801 --> 02:01:16,300
real belief in this system that he's 
been practicing under and he has no idea

2438
02:01:16,301 --> 02:01:20,500
that it's horseshit and the way finds 
out that it's horseshit is on youtube.

2439
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:24,610
I mean he literally finds out in this 
moment that what he's doing,

2440
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:26,580
he probably believed it.
He brought,

2441
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:30,220
probably believed that what he does is 
actually real and effective.

2442
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:32,290
So check this out.
It's horrible.

2443
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,590
The good together,
Blah Blah Blah.

2444
02:01:35,591 --> 02:01:37,990
They go over what you're supposed to do 
or whatever.

2445
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:40,070
And they,
I don't know if they make

2446
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:45,070
them shake hands,
you shake hands and then they go back 

2447
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:47,360
and then they get the party started and 
it takes 10 seconds.

2448
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,070
Here we go,
ready?

2449
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:50,150
Set,
go.

2450
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:57,080
There it goes.
So this guy's like literally doing like 

2451
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:05,110
some movie stuff and the boom,
the MMA guy just starts taking off.

2452
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,460
Boom,
boom,

2453
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:13,130
boom,
boom,

2454
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:14,390
boom,
boom.

2455
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:17,450
And that's a wrap.
It's horrible.

2456
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:21,470
Oh,
I mean it literally last once he engages

2457
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:26,530
in the last 10 seconds.
But that's because one of them is doing 

2458
02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:30,431
an actual martial art and the other guys
practicing nonsense and he's probably 

2459
02:02:30,431 --> 02:02:33,140
practiced that nonsense his whole life.
He thought it was real.

2460
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:38,410
There's another one where there's an old
man and that's even harder to watch 

2461
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:41,150
because there's old man gets kicked in 
the face and you just go,

2462
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:43,790
oh Jesus Christ,
like save this guy.

2463
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:48,850
This was horrible.
And he looks like legitimately like 

2464
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:50,060
let's watch what he does back it up,
up to the beginning.

2465
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:52,940
So he bet $5,000,
check this out,

2466
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:57,280
look what he thinks he can do.
He claimed a 200 and orx.

2467
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:58,580
Look,
he's not even touching these people.

2468
02:02:58,581 --> 02:03:01,520
They just go flying.
It's like they're a part of a cult,

2469
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:04,880
you know?
So they move at him and he really firmly

2470
02:03:04,881 --> 02:03:06,590
believes that he can do this.
Look,

2471
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:09,710
he's like manipulating them.
Like he's a puppet master.

2472
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,880
It's so crazy.
So this guy is so.

2473
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:19,870
He's so like hypnotized by his own 
bullshit that he decides,

2474
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:22,790
well he's,
well,

2475
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:24,080
I don't know.
See,

2476
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:29,081
here's the thing,
because he actually makes a real fight 

2477
02:03:29,081 --> 02:03:32,060
with a real trained martial artist.
So he might,

2478
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:35,930
he may very well have been in on it 
himself.

2479
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:40,960
I mean not being what I mean is he 
might've been taken by his own bullshit.

2480
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:45,410
He might've actually believed it.
So now he's gonna fly an actual,

2481
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:48,350
a young actual martial artist.

2482
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:53,680
And so he's got this crazy idea that 
he's just going to like give that guy 

2483
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:57,041
the hex and the guy is going to go 
flying through the air like the other 

2484
02:03:57,041 --> 02:03:59,000
guy was teaching.
But this kid just sort of circles,

2485
02:03:59,001 --> 02:04:00,170
um,
for a few seconds.

2486
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:02,500
And then just like that other video 
pizza,

2487
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:06,260
holy fuck.
Out of them inside of about 10 seconds,

2488
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:09,540
just zoom off until they engage.
Yeah.

2489
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,380
So here it goes.
See?

2490
02:04:12,381 --> 02:04:13,010
He's like,
dude,

2491
02:04:13,011 --> 02:04:16,820
all this craziness.
And the young martial artists just grabs

2492
02:04:16,821 --> 02:04:17,750
him,
punches him,

2493
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:20,410
kick some.
And he's like,

2494
02:04:20,411 --> 02:04:21,010
you see,
he like,

2495
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,760
he's holding his face is like,
what the fuck?

2496
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:24,200
And the young guys,
really nice look.

2497
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:24,550
He's like,
you,

2498
02:04:24,551 --> 02:04:25,940
okay,
you want to keep going?

2499
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:27,670
And he's holding his mouth.
Look,

2500
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:30,050
the young guy like literally says,
look,

2501
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:32,660
does he want to keep going?
Let's stop.

2502
02:04:32,661 --> 02:04:37,661
Let's stop.
[inaudible] guy's bleeding out of his 

2503
02:04:37,661 --> 02:04:37,661
nose.
And so he says,

2504
02:04:37,661 --> 02:04:38,040
keep going.
He says

2505
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,200
I'm fine.
And so he gets his hands up,

2506
02:04:40,201 --> 02:04:41,670
but he's now this time it's going to 
work.

2507
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:46,350
This time I'm going to hit them with the
full Voodoo and this kid just blam Blam,

2508
02:04:46,351 --> 02:04:48,480
blam.
And then this kick boom.

2509
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:53,190
That's where it gets horrific.
And that guy's probably like 60.

2510
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:58,660
It's not,
not a good time to get kicked in the 

2511
02:04:58,660 --> 02:04:58,660
face,
you know,

2512
02:04:58,660 --> 02:04:58,660
in the military.
I'm remembering,

2513
02:04:58,660 --> 02:05:01,230
I don't think about the metastatic that 
matched it was so long ago,

2514
02:05:01,231 --> 02:05:03,000
but now I'm remembering some of the 
other,

2515
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:05,160
some of the other stuff that they were 
doing.

2516
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:07,620
And there was a lot of weaponry stuff,
you know,

2517
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:08,830
there was the,
um,

2518
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:11,100
there was the prophet,
Hologram,

2519
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:14,610
all of this sort of came from this 
central well of like,

2520
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,470
you know,
eighties profit,

2521
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,540
hologram that,
that they would,

2522
02:05:18,590 --> 02:05:21,150
um,
they never liked got it off the ground,

2523
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:26,240
but what they were trying to do with 
have a Hologram of Allah that they would

2524
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:29,330
project over an enemy capital.

2525
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:31,550
We're an.
Allah would basically say whatever the u

2526
02:05:31,551 --> 02:05:35,220
s military wanted him to say,
Americans aren't that bad.

2527
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:39,000
They are blessed.
President Bush,

2528
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:43,320
they had a race specific stink bomb,
which again,

2529
02:05:43,321 --> 02:05:44,610
they never managed to get off the 
ground.

2530
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:45,950
What about the gay bomb?
They were,

2531
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:47,460
they had the gay bomb.
That was real.

2532
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:52,510
Yeah.
They literally were engineering some 

2533
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:54,981
sort of a chemical warfare device that 
would turn men homosexual and lit lit.

2534
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:00,680
And what's less known about it is that 
they will also trying to do a halitosis 

2535
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:03,150
bomb so that you'd turn the enemy gay.
And then he gave him bad breath.

2536
02:06:03,170 --> 02:06:08,170
You haven't gave him bad breath.
And I'd be like so freaked out that the 

2537
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:10,311
Americans were.
They'd come in and when they would just 

2538
02:06:10,311 --> 02:06:10,311
have shame all around.
Yeah,

2539
02:06:10,311 --> 02:06:12,090
they,
they had um,

2540
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:14,870
attack attack bees.
Uh,

2541
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:18,030
that would again just attack the enemy.
None of these things got off the ground,

2542
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:23,060
I don't think.
I guess it's sort of like writing 

2543
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:23,060
comedy.
You throw a lot of shit against the wall

2544
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:24,650
and like one 10th of it sticks.
Yeah.

2545
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:29,280
And some things did stick right.
I immediately,

2546
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:34,710
the Taser gave me from the military,
but that seems totally reasonable 

2547
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:39,201
though.
Everybody knows you can get 

2548
02:06:39,201 --> 02:06:40,131
electrocuted.
I figured out a way to get a large 

2549
02:06:40,131 --> 02:06:40,131
charge and a small device.
Yeah.

2550
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:42,170
And there was all this kind of weird,
our old,

2551
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:47,470
our old techniques that they would do it
on to animo in Abu Ghraib or Romania or 

2552
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:47,740
oral.
Yeah.

2553
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:49,620
I probably said it wrong.
Yeah.

2554
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:52,400
Where they would like play executive 
templates.

2555
02:06:52,401 --> 02:06:56,730
Subliminal sounds blast.
They'd blast like Metallica at people,

2556
02:06:56,731 --> 02:07:01,731
but laced into metallica would be these 
like subliminal sounds that will try to 

2557
02:07:01,731 --> 02:07:06,290
hypnotize people.
Do you remember when they used to do 

2558
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:06,290
that in movie theaters?
Hungry Popcorn?

2559
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:10,700
They live like subliminal images that 
will like in between like one fifth of a

2560
02:07:13,051 --> 02:07:16,610
second one frame has ever been shown 
that that actually worked.

2561
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:19,080
Works.
I'm not sure that I ever worked in the.

2562
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,340
I met this guy.
Oh my God.

2563
02:07:20,341 --> 02:07:25,341
I just remembered.
So I met this guy called Jamal Harris 

2564
02:07:25,341 --> 02:07:28,370
who had been released from Guantanamo 
and he was telling me about all of this 

2565
02:07:28,370 --> 02:07:32,571
stuff.
He was in Guantanamo for like two years 

2566
02:07:32,571 --> 02:07:32,571
and then he got released and he was 
telling me about this app.

2567
02:07:32,571 --> 02:07:36,230
He said they played him and entire cd 
have a fleetwood Mac cuff band,

2568
02:07:41,930 --> 02:07:46,750
abnormal in Guantanamo at normal volume.
Those guys are just fucking winging it,

2569
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:50,020
winging it.
What was going on?

2570
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:54,260
I didn't know.
I'm set up with.

2571
02:07:54,261 --> 02:07:59,261
They're doing it to be nice and maybe 
they thought you want to make it more 

2572
02:07:59,261 --> 02:07:59,980
pleasant and he said this.
It was good to me.

2573
02:07:59,981 --> 02:08:01,330
They weren't trying to be nice.
Anyway,

2574
02:08:01,331 --> 02:08:06,331
I saw,
I interviewed Jamal Harris was telling 

2575
02:08:06,331 --> 02:08:08,941
me about all of this weird shit and few 
months ago he goes and fucking joins 

2576
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:11,320
isis and blows himself up somewhere.

2577
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:14,320
This guy,
the fleetwood Mac cover band guy.

2578
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:19,770
Wow.
When they arrested him and brought him 

2579
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:20,830
to Guantanamo Bay,
was he innocent of those charges?

2580
02:08:20,890 --> 02:08:23,350
Well,
he certainly convinced everybody that he

2581
02:08:23,351 --> 02:08:25,720
was a.
and uh,

2582
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:30,990
in fact Tony Blair got involved and 
helped get him out of one on to be a 

2583
02:08:31,901 --> 02:08:32,920
jihadi.
What?

2584
02:08:32,921 --> 02:08:37,921
I don't know,
but I'd be very curious to find out 

2585
02:08:37,921 --> 02:08:37,921
which is exactly the question that you 
just post.

2586
02:08:37,921 --> 02:08:42,801
Like was he always it or did the 
experience of being in Guantanamo 

2587
02:08:42,801 --> 02:08:44,130
somehow years later,
you know,

2588
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:46,870
help to turn him into a god?
I don't know the answer to.

2589
02:08:46,910 --> 02:08:51,910
I think if you're an innocent person and
for two years they take away your 

2590
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:54,820
freedom and they make you listen to 
fleetwood Mac cover band,

2591
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:58,000
you probably feel like I can't get over 
that man.

2592
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:00,850
It's stained.
It stained my soul.

2593
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:04,540
I have no idea.
But I met this guy very personable young

2594
02:09:04,541 --> 02:09:04,930
man.

2595
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:09,160
I met him at a hotel in Manchester where
I interviewed him for the monster go.

2596
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:11,260
And where do you,
where did he kill himself?

2597
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:16,390
I can't remember.
Can you can look at other people as 

2598
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:16,390
well?
I don't know,

2599
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:20,341
Jamal,
I'll also heartbreakingly from around 

2600
02:09:20,341 --> 02:09:20,880
that time.
Omar Bakri,

2601
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:24,190
who was the guy that she had this,
I made a film about his son.

2602
02:09:24,191 --> 02:09:26,770
He had this really sweet little kid,
the son,

2603
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:32,010
Mohammed,
who was really scared that like as far 

2604
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:34,051
they might get hurt because he was so 
public and open and he would like to 

2605
02:09:34,051 --> 02:09:34,051
confide in us that,
you know,

2606
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:37,900
he was scared that his father would get 
hurt fucking two years ago.

2607
02:09:37,910 --> 02:09:41,650
Jordan's son joins Isis,
uh,

2608
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:44,380
tries to leave Isis.
So Isis,

2609
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:47,230
kill him.
I know all these.

2610
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:52,460
All these people I knew 20 years ago,
I tell you all the worse it would go to 

2611
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:54,180
Bella killed were to carry out a suicide
curb.

2612
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:58,220
Mean in an army base.
Yeah,

2613
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:02,020
she uses.
I know,

2614
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:07,080
I know.
What does that feel like when you hear 

2615
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:08,650
that you lose someone that became a 
suicide bomber?

2616
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:09,640
I was,
I was.

2617
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:12,280
Well tomorrow.
I just met that one time.

2618
02:10:12,281 --> 02:10:15,940
And still you knew him well,
I met him that one time.

2619
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:21,270
Someone on my podcast.
It turned out to be a suicide bomber 

2620
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:21,540
where you did hope.
No,

2621
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:23,530
you give me an f.
no,

2622
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:25,360
no,
I thought you were saying I didn't.

2623
02:10:25,361 --> 02:10:25,890
I didn't know.

2624
02:10:27,990 --> 02:10:32,990
I thought you were saying that you did.
But he did have a guy on my podcast at 

2625
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,040
almost beat a woman to

2626
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,530
death after he was on and now he's in 
jail for life.

2627
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:37,340
Shit.
Yeah.

2628
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:41,360
It was a very public story.
He's a MMA fighter named war machine.

2629
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:43,910
His name's John John Copeland Hammer.
Right.

2630
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:49,480
And uh,
he apparently found this girl he was 

2631
02:10:49,731 --> 02:10:50,960
dating,
but they broke up.

2632
02:10:51,230 --> 02:10:56,230
He found her in bed with another man and
when the beating him and beating her 

2633
02:10:57,140 --> 02:11:00,530
half to death,
like ruptured her liver broker ribs,

2634
02:11:00,531 --> 02:11:02,570
smashed her face,
broker teeth.

2635
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:05,000
Horrific,
horrific.

2636
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:07,760
And she was here with him.
Uh,

2637
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:13,120
what do you think?
Do you think it was steroids to the 

2638
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:13,610
goodwill is psychopathy?
Um,

2639
02:11:13,790 --> 02:11:18,790
all the above.
I think steroids probably played a 

2640
02:11:18,790 --> 02:11:21,431
factor.
Traumatic brain injury probably paid a 

2641
02:11:21,431 --> 02:11:21,431
factor.
Um,

2642
02:11:21,431 --> 02:11:23,170
I think that's what they say about Chris
Penn Law,

2643
02:11:23,171 --> 02:11:25,700
right?
That it was traumatic brain injury.

2644
02:11:26,270 --> 02:11:28,970
It's a huge factor because these guys,
they,

2645
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,420
they get hit in the head so many times 
and no,

2646
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:34,100
no one can tell you when it's going to 
go bad.

2647
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:35,060
No one knows.
It's,

2648
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:40,090
it varies.
Like you might be able to take a 100 

2649
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:40,090
punches.
For me it might be 30,

2650
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:41,750
you know,
no one knows it doesn't,

2651
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,250
it doesn't really make sense.
Yeah.

2652
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:49,480
And you don't know what they're 
absorbing and training versus what 

2653
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:50,080
happens in actual fights in,
you know,

2654
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:55,300
and what the effect it has on one person
is very differently affected house and 

2655
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:57,770
another person also.
Um,

2656
02:11:57,771 --> 02:12:02,771
how uh,
how much time is in between these 

2657
02:12:02,771 --> 02:12:05,990
beatings that they've received?
Are they receiving them on a regular 

2658
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:05,990
basis?
It changed them like instantaneously.

2659
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:10,040
I know far too many people that have 
experienced a lot of,

2660
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:14,480
a lot of shots to the head where it's 
completely changed who they are.

2661
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:15,560
Right,
right.

2662
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:18,540
This guy was troubled to begin with.
I mean he,

2663
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:22,190
he saw his father die beaten up by cops,
wasn't at the store.

2664
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:27,580
I think that was a store something 
fucked up experience at a very young 

2665
02:12:27,580 --> 02:12:27,580
age.

2666
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:32,430
I wonder whether this booklet a 
psychopath test and um,

2667
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:37,130
I met a guy once I got into like a road 
rage instance with this guy.

2668
02:12:37,670 --> 02:12:39,110
Um,
I've had like,

2669
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:42,610
my son was one at the time and,
uh,

2670
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:45,830
out of the car and I said,
my son's in the car and he said,

2671
02:12:45,831 --> 02:12:50,831
I don't give a fuck about your son.
And afterwards one of the psychopath 

2672
02:12:50,831 --> 02:12:51,890
test I was a member of,
this guy's being like,

2673
02:12:51,891 --> 02:12:54,620
I wonder whether he was a psychopath.
I wonder whether like,

2674
02:12:54,621 --> 02:12:58,160
given that one of the items on the 
psychopathic checklist is like grandiose

2675
02:12:58,161 --> 02:13:03,161
sense of self worth.
I wanted to with it with the mixed 

2676
02:13:03,161 --> 02:13:03,380
martial artist world,
given that,

2677
02:13:03,770 --> 02:13:08,770
you know,
whether it's sort of attracts 

2678
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:08,770
psychopaths.
Well,

2679
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:11,810
it certainly attracts people that aren't
opposed to violence,

2680
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:16,010
right?
Because they're engaging in violence.

2681
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:19,520
And um,
it also attracts people that are just,

2682
02:13:19,790 --> 02:13:24,790
like,
they might've been bmx riders or 

2683
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:26,020
skateboarders or sky divers.
They,

2684
02:13:26,070 --> 02:13:28,910
they love the extreme danger aspect of 
it.

2685
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:30,830
They're thrill seekers.
And what I,

2686
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:31,950
the way I described,

2687
02:13:32,570 --> 02:13:37,350
I described mixed martial arts is high 
level problem solving with dire physical

2688
02:13:37,351 --> 02:13:40,890
consequences.
And that's really essentially what it is

2689
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:44,790
and these guys are attracted to these 
extreme experiences.

2690
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:47,220
So some of them are very pleasant 
people,

2691
02:13:47,221 --> 02:13:49,020
some of them are very nice,
like,

2692
02:13:49,660 --> 02:13:50,880
like for instance,
mighty mouse.

2693
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:53,070
It's probably the best pound for pound 
fighter ever.

2694
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:54,540
If you met him,
you would never know.

2695
02:13:54,541 --> 02:13:56,520
He's the best fighter in the world.
He's the sweetest guy.

2696
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,800
So normal,
very articulate,

2697
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:01,020
easy to talk to.
It doesn't get hit a lot either though.

2698
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:04,680
He's so slick and smart and the way he 
fights is so clever.

2699
02:14:05,490 --> 02:14:09,390
But some of them get hit a lot.
And uh,

2700
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:14,420
you know,
now that we're knowing more and more 

2701
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:17,840
essentially every day about the effects 
of traumatic brain injuries and 

2702
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:22,280
concussions and you're seeing more and 
more of these stories of football 

2703
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:22,530
players doing crazy things.

2704
02:14:22,530 --> 02:14:27,530
And I'm sure you saw that recent study 
where they tested 111 football players 

2705
02:14:27,530 --> 02:14:30,350
and they found 110 of them had traumatic
brain injuries.

2706
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:35,390
Wow.
Would I know that that's what they said 

2707
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:35,390
about Crispin Law.
Maybe that's why he.

2708
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:35,390
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2709
02:14:35,390 --> 02:14:38,070
Those guys get it for sure in.
And people say,

2710
02:14:38,071 --> 02:14:39,150
well,
that's fake wrestling.

2711
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:44,180
Listen man,
there's nothing fake about what those 

2712
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:44,430
guys go through.
They might be choreographed,

2713
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:46,710
they might have a bunch of things that 
they're doing,

2714
02:14:46,711 --> 02:14:51,711
but these guys are body slamming each 
other and throwing each other through 

2715
02:14:51,711 --> 02:14:52,620
the air and landing on each other and 
hitting each other with elbows.

2716
02:14:52,621 --> 02:14:57,621
That is a 100 percent real and they 
suffer and you have to be tough to do 

2717
02:14:57,621 --> 02:14:58,410
that.
There they are,

2718
02:14:58,710 --> 02:15:03,710
experiencing some severe pain forensic 
exam.

2719
02:15:04,510 --> 02:15:09,510
He's crispin was brain forensic exam,
consistent with numerous brain injuries.

2720
02:15:09,691 --> 02:15:14,691
CTE,
which is found in all regions of his 

2721
02:15:14,691 --> 02:15:16,170
brain.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

2722
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:21,560
I wrote a paper about crispin for the 
Guardian and when it came out at 1:00

2723
02:15:21,841 --> 02:15:26,841
in the morning,
they a press officer for wwe phoned me 

2724
02:15:26,841 --> 02:15:31,641
up and yelled at me,
yelled at one in the morning because I 

2725
02:15:31,641 --> 02:15:33,560
said what that like.
I tricked the mentor,

2726
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:37,980
like spending time backstage at wwe when
I was only interested in Christian.

2727
02:15:37,981 --> 02:15:40,590
Where you know,
did you write?

2728
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:43,410
Did you go backstage before he killed 
people?

2729
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:44,340
No,
it was after.

2730
02:15:44,341 --> 02:15:45,900
It was afterwards.
Oh yeah.

2731
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:49,560
The trick them.
I don't think I'd trick them.

2732
02:15:49,650 --> 02:15:54,650
How the fuck could they think that you 
were going to put a positive spin on 

2733
02:15:54,650 --> 02:15:55,290
someone murdering their family?
Exactly.

2734
02:15:55,680 --> 02:16:00,680
I thought I was going to put less 
emphasis on crispin well and more 

2735
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:00,680
emphasis on,
you know,

2736
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:02,100
the nice things about wrestling.
I know Jesus Christ,

2737
02:16:02,101 --> 02:16:04,500
but you knew you were going to put some 
emphasis on it,

2738
02:16:04,501 --> 02:16:04,790
right?

2739
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:07,470
Yeah.
What I was asking lots of questions.

2740
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,800
So they must've known.
Yeah.

2741
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,880
Yeah.
Speaking of Nice people,

2742
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:14,910
by the way,
my porn people,

2743
02:16:15,690 --> 02:16:20,040
uh,
it was probably the loveliest year of my

2744
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:22,830
working life's hanging out.
Really young people.

2745
02:16:22,831 --> 02:16:27,831
Yeah.
You feel like you've got all that work 

2746
02:16:27,831 --> 02:16:27,831
done?
Like maybe,

2747
02:16:27,831 --> 02:16:27,831
I don't know,
a couple days.

2748
02:16:27,831 --> 02:16:32,360
Like why?
Just taking what I wanted to know.

2749
02:16:32,730 --> 02:16:37,730
A lot of digging.
It sounded like dicking with your 

2750
02:16:37,730 --> 02:16:38,470
accent.
He did a lot of dicking.

2751
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:39,990
I didn't know.
I didn't.

2752
02:16:40,170 --> 02:16:42,010
I'm sure.
Explain yourself.

2753
02:16:42,011 --> 02:16:43,530
I'm just joking.
I,

2754
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:45,160
uh,
no it was,

2755
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:49,810
it was tracing the butterfly factor,
Fabian's business plan on their world.

2756
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:53,860
It was such a kind of interesting 
exercise,

2757
02:16:53,861 --> 02:16:54,310
you know,
to,

2758
02:16:55,090 --> 02:16:59,350
to try and work out what's the furthest 
ripple I could find,

2759
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:01,390
like what light,
you know.

2760
02:17:01,391 --> 02:17:06,391
So Fabian has this idea about giving the
world free porn and then that leads to 

2761
02:17:06,391 --> 02:17:07,590
that and that needs to happen at least 
like where,

2762
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:10,820
what's the furthest I could find the 
furthest consequence.

2763
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:15,820
And it was such a sort of fun exercise 
coupled with the fact that being around 

2764
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:18,940
porn people was a little bit like being 
on at a Broadway show,

2765
02:17:18,941 --> 02:17:19,850
backstage,
you know,

2766
02:17:19,890 --> 02:17:20,780
he's like,
you know,

2767
02:17:20,810 --> 02:17:24,340
theater people.
So coupled with all of that and the fact

2768
02:17:24,341 --> 02:17:26,680
that I was in la and I got to let hang 
out in la.

2769
02:17:26,681 --> 02:17:28,120
It was,
it was really fun.

2770
02:17:28,121 --> 02:17:29,330
Yeah.
Can I tell you,

2771
02:17:29,331 --> 02:17:34,331
by the way,
one of the strangest consequences that 

2772
02:17:34,331 --> 02:17:34,331
should address,
um,

2773
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:36,890
so this um,
you know,

2774
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:41,900
like pretty much every child in the 
world gets learned about sex through 

2775
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:45,150
porn hub these days.
PORNHUB is sex education for like every 

2776
02:17:45,150 --> 02:17:48,751
12 year old.
I'm sure as a parents probably don't go 

2777
02:17:48,751 --> 02:17:50,350
around talking about it in time.
Exactly.

2778
02:17:50,351 --> 02:17:51,450
It's like,
you know,

2779
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:53,560
I think when we were growing up,
maybe,

2780
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:58,620
I don't know,
14 was probably about the age that we 

2781
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:01,471
started,
like seeing ripped up pages of playboy 

2782
02:18:01,471 --> 02:18:02,870
and bridges and so on.

2783
02:18:03,430 --> 02:18:05,410
We would find them in the woods.
Okay.

2784
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:07,010
I have a whole bit on,
in my act.

2785
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:07,830
Yeah,
that's,

2786
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:12,840
yeah,
about finding perversion was true story 

2787
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:16,881
I'd done literally didn't know about 
perversion until I found a fucked up 

2788
02:18:16,881 --> 02:18:18,820
magazine in the woods.
What was the magazine?

2789
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:23,880
It was like a,
I think it was called foot action or 

2790
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:24,460
something like that.
It was very strange.

2791
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:26,540
But here's what's weird,
um,

2792
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:29,380
that kids today,
if you give them a phone,

2793
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:30,670
like,
I mean,

2794
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:35,700
what age the kids get a phone.
Like some kids get a phone at like 10 

2795
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,180
and nine.
You're essentially giving um,

2796
02:18:37,210 --> 02:18:38,100
porn.
Yeah.

2797
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:41,680
You're giving them every awfulness that 
you've given them.

2798
02:18:41,681 --> 02:18:42,790
Isis.
Beheading.

2799
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:44,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

2800
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:46,900
So anyway,
so I was really interested in like,

2801
02:18:46,910 --> 02:18:51,910
so what are the consequences of this,
of like 12 year old kids learning about 

2802
02:18:51,910 --> 02:18:54,460
sex through porn hub.
And I found this terrible consequence in

2803
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:55,300
Oklahoma.

2804
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:58,960
So this was a boy called Nathan with 
autism,

2805
02:18:58,961 --> 02:19:02,050
so he was like an awkward kid with 
autism,

2806
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:07,470
um,
channels like chat up a girl but didn't 

2807
02:19:07,470 --> 02:19:08,200
know how to do it.
So he thought that the smartest,

2808
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:09,940
he thought,
you know,

2809
02:19:10,270 --> 02:19:15,270
he thought he should text her lines of 
dialogue that he'd heard in porn films.

2810
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:19,520
So he texted her,
um,

2811
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:23,140
first detected a bunch of Hentai porn 
photographs,

2812
02:19:23,610 --> 02:19:25,510
um,
and she didn't respond.

2813
02:19:26,290 --> 02:19:29,330
So I said if she responded,
what would you have done?

2814
02:19:29,331 --> 02:19:30,240
And he said,
I would've stopped.

2815
02:19:30,270 --> 02:19:31,940
Like if she said,
can you stop sending me these,

2816
02:19:31,941 --> 02:19:36,941
what would you have done?
He said I would have stopped sending 

2817
02:19:36,941 --> 02:19:36,941
them.
I just assumed she was busy.

2818
02:19:36,941 --> 02:19:41,510
So then he texted her line of dialogue 
that he heard in a porn film and it was,

2819
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:45,380
I want to bend you over and rape you 
from behind.

2820
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,920
So he is now on the sex offenders 
registry for 25 years,

2821
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:57,160
which means he has to live in a house 
right at the edge of town because he has

2822
02:19:58,431 --> 02:20:02,420
to be 2000 feet away from parks and 
daycare centers.

2823
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:07,010
He can't go anywhere where children go.
So he can't go to football games,

2824
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:09,950
basketball games,
he can't go to the Er was uh,

2825
02:20:10,050 --> 02:20:13,630
he was 17 and a half,
I think,

2826
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:15,200
something like that,
maybe 18,

2827
02:20:15,470 --> 02:20:20,470
but kids as young as eight years old or 
on the sex offenders registry in the 

2828
02:20:20,470 --> 02:20:21,650
United States eat eight years old.
I had no idea.

2829
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:23,530
Um,
boys and girls,

2830
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:25,550
by the way,
like if you play,

2831
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:28,680
there's this little boy.
Um,

2832
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:33,760
they were like playing this game where 
they'd take their clothes off in the 

2833
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:34,460
dark and then put the clothes back on 
quickly.

2834
02:20:34,461 --> 02:20:39,461
That budget manual kits or something.
This one kid kept his clothes off when 

2835
02:20:39,461 --> 02:20:42,590
they turned the lights on,
the girl complained to her parents.

2836
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:44,780
And this boy is on the sex offenders 
register.

2837
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:46,530
Yeah.
Um,

2838
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:49,030
so you can't like if a.
So with Nathan,

2839
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:50,720
first of all,
where the fuck where the parents,

2840
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:52,340
right?
You know,

2841
02:20:52,690 --> 02:20:55,760
on unsurprisingly,
it's like,

2842
02:20:55,880 --> 02:21:00,880
I think this kid was a foster kid.
So there's already like the sort of 

2843
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:03,210
stigma attached to the shadow of stigma.
Oh,

2844
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:08,590
Nathan's a kid with autism.
So I said to this woman who like defense

2845
02:21:08,630 --> 02:21:11,590
children on the sex offenders registry,
I said to a light so you know,

2846
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:16,600
why,
why doesn't the judge just say this is 

2847
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:17,030
ridiculous and throw it out of court?
And she said,

2848
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:22,031
you know,
there's this kind of prevailing view 

2849
02:21:22,031 --> 02:21:22,970
that a,
it's better to protect,

2850
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:28,460
you know,
it's better to err on the side of 

2851
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:28,460
caution.
Um,

2852
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:32,410
but also there's this prevailing view 
that if a kid starts acting sexually 

2853
02:21:32,410 --> 02:21:36,611
weird at the age of 10,
that's a precursor for them being 

2854
02:21:36,611 --> 02:21:40,871
sexually weird when an adult maybe,
but maybe not.

2855
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:41,990
Yeah,
exactly.

2856
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:43,850
I mean,
I'm sure it's true in certain cases.

2857
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:48,920
I'm sure it's not true.
The consequences of sentencing and kid 

2858
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:52,481
like that are so extreme.
Like you should probably have a real 

2859
02:21:52,481 --> 02:21:54,630
understanding of what's going on with 
the kid and if he's autistic and he does

2860
02:21:54,631 --> 02:21:56,810
know what the fuck to do and he's 
confused and he.

2861
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:58,460
Yeah.
Well Nathan.

2862
02:21:58,461 --> 02:22:03,461
So he read me like his book,
He needs to like fill out this sex 

2863
02:22:03,461 --> 02:22:05,090
offenders book like at therapy.
And so he was like,

2864
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:06,500
reading me the,
cause you know,

2865
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:11,740
a lot about 20 now he's going to be on 
the sex offender registry for the next 

2866
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:13,940
23 years now.
What is it like talking to him as well?

2867
02:22:13,970 --> 02:22:16,040
Does your understand the consequences 
weren't went down?

2868
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:21,070
Yeah,
he says it's like being permanently 

2869
02:22:21,070 --> 02:22:21,980
grounded.
He was reading me the questions,

2870
02:22:21,981 --> 02:22:23,700
not system,
the sex offenders book.

2871
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:28,700
So it's questions like,
have you ever had a sexual situation in 

2872
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:32,160
which you're in or feces was involved?
And his answer was no.

2873
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,430
And uh,
there were questions like,

2874
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:38,190
have you ever had sex with animals?
And his question was like,

2875
02:22:38,191 --> 02:22:43,191
no.
And then the last question was when was 

2876
02:22:43,191 --> 02:22:45,630
the last time you had sex with somebody?
And His answer was still a virgin,

2877
02:22:46,660 --> 02:22:51,030
a virgin on the sex offenders registry 
was when you can only cost,

2878
02:22:51,031 --> 02:22:56,031
you can understand what the girl was 
scared and I told her parents and the 

2879
02:22:56,031 --> 02:22:56,730
parents talk to the police,
like you can tell you understand it from

2880
02:22:56,731 --> 02:22:58,500
the other point of view.
Oh,

2881
02:22:58,501 --> 02:22:59,610
100 percent.
Yeah.

2882
02:23:00,050 --> 02:23:00,750
But you know,
I mean,

2883
02:23:00,751 --> 02:23:04,440
what a butterfly effect that is.
And I'm not,

2884
02:23:04,441 --> 02:23:09,441
of course,
I'm not saying any of this is Fabian's 

2885
02:23:09,441 --> 02:23:11,691
fault,
this is all had intended intended 

2886
02:23:11,691 --> 02:23:12,330
consequences.
That's just access to sex in porn.

2887
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:17,330
And you know,
the other thing that's weird as a porn 

2888
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:18,360
for the most part,
I mean other than this bespoke porn,

2889
02:23:18,361 --> 02:23:20,940
which is very specific,
but porn,

2890
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:26,960
there's like levels to the depravity 
that never existed before yet because 

2891
02:23:28,381 --> 02:23:33,381
everything's keyword search.
Well at least this is what happens when 

2892
02:23:33,381 --> 02:23:34,350
you let tech people run the world and 
ramping up.

2893
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:38,340
It's also people get tired of just 
people kissing and then having sex.

2894
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:39,600
Yeah.
So then it's like,

2895
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:41,760
oh I want to watch a guy at tire grow 
up.

2896
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:43,620
Oh I want to watch you guys spitting the
girl's mouth.

2897
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:47,760
I want to watch her get smacked around.
And then it gets weirder and gagging.

2898
02:23:47,761 --> 02:23:52,761
And although this is exactly that,
so that's one consequence of the 

2899
02:23:52,761 --> 02:23:57,531
ubiquity of like Freeport and just the 
sheer volume of stand out with extreme 

2900
02:23:58,950 --> 02:24:03,950
content some way.
But the other thing is already search 

2901
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:05,340
engine people are sort of looking at 
what's being searched for the most.

2902
02:24:05,490 --> 02:24:06,690
What is number one?
Well,

2903
02:24:06,691 --> 02:24:09,180
I tell you what,
tell you what it's like a room.

2904
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:12,120
I don't know if it's an important,
but I'll tell you what's really like way

2905
02:24:12,121 --> 02:24:17,121
at the top.
It's anything to do with like step 

2906
02:24:17,121 --> 02:24:18,210
sisters,
stepbrothers,

2907
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:20,830
stepfathers,
step daughters,

2908
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:24,450
mom's incest.
Porn is basically,

2909
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:29,780
it's basically real incest away with it.
But actually when I was on the set of 

2910
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:33,590
stepdaughter cheerleader orgy Grazer,
the director that,

2911
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:36,290
there was a bit of dialogue like these 
guys will like say I go,

2912
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:41,420
I think your stepdaughter is sexy,
but it kept on getting it wrong and they

2913
02:24:41,461 --> 02:24:43,480
were saying,
I think your daughter sexy,

2914
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:47,740
but it's step that backfired.
The carriers go step daughter.

2915
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:51,180
That's all there is.
We don't want to be too fucked up here.

2916
02:24:51,181 --> 02:24:53,970
People step,
keyword step,

2917
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:55,320
go right.
Take one.

2918
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:58,890
These are great people.
I've met people with great people.

2919
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,270
Well that's nice,
you know,

2920
02:25:00,350 --> 02:25:03,990
and that sort of shatter some of the 
stereotypes that people are about porn.

2921
02:25:04,410 --> 02:25:09,090
That the people are sleazy and uncaring 
and doing coke and smacking each other.

2922
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,840
This show.
Um,

2923
02:25:10,950 --> 02:25:14,100
if I may blow my own trumpet,
please do a,

2924
02:25:14,101 --> 02:25:17,790
which I learned on the set of blow my 
own trumpet,

2925
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:21,660
a I,
I,

2926
02:25:21,870 --> 02:25:24,540
I did a little bit the butterfly effect,
uh,

2927
02:25:24,570 --> 02:25:28,630
on stage at the ace hotel down in Los 
Angeles here in Los Angeles.

2928
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:33,930
And we've invited a bunch of our porn 
people along and they said to us 

2929
02:25:33,930 --> 02:25:36,640
afterwards,
like 25 years of being important,

2930
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:42,610
we were the first mainstream people to 
come along and not treat them as like,

2931
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:45,640
you know,
ingredients in our preexisting ideology.

2932
02:25:45,641 --> 02:25:50,641
So not pitying them or attacking them,
just treating them on a level as a 

2933
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:53,820
fellow human being and isn't that kind 
of nuts that,

2934
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:58,860
that,
that's rare in porn because we all feel 

2935
02:25:58,860 --> 02:25:59,230
sort of society as mainstream 
journalists,

2936
02:25:59,231 --> 02:26:01,950
we filled these kinds of societal 
pressures to,

2937
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:03,420
to,
to,

2938
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:04,840
in some way attack them.
You know,

2939
02:26:04,850 --> 02:26:07,660
they're there to be pitied there to be 
hated,

2940
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:08,970
you know?
Um,

2941
02:26:09,230 --> 02:26:11,100
well I think you also have to establish 
that you're,

2942
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:16,240
your own,
whether it's moral superiority or good 

2943
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:18,290
taste that you don't approve of this.
You're not one of those people.

2944
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:23,500
Exactly.
I'm not even a kind of sore of this 

2945
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:23,500
work.

2946
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:23,500
Right,
exactly.

2947
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:25,550
I made my excuses and left that was,
you know.

2948
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:27,070
Yeah.
Uh,

2949
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:29,750
and,
and that means,

2950
02:26:29,751 --> 02:26:31,370
you know,
because of our hypocrisy,

2951
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:36,700
they get exploited.
So that's why I wanted to do this show.

2952
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:39,170
I'm sorry that I sort of bought it back 
full circle,

2953
02:26:39,171 --> 02:26:41,120
but that's one of the reasons why I 
wanted to do this show.

2954
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:46,170
When I first moved to California,
I was on the Sitcom called news radio 

2955
02:26:46,170 --> 02:26:50,131
and one of the guys who was a writer on 
news radio was a writer for porn films 

2956
02:26:50,131 --> 02:26:52,330
on the side.
And what it was was it didn't really pay

2957
02:26:52,331 --> 02:26:57,331
much,
but it gave him access to the girls and 

2958
02:26:57,331 --> 02:26:59,470
they let him meet these girls and he was
kind of a nebbishy sort of Dorky guy and

2959
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:03,820
he had never been around like a real 
bomb shell girl that was willing to have

2960
02:27:03,821 --> 02:27:06,840
sex with them before.
So all of a sudden he's having sex these

2961
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:09,940
porn stars,
but they get to have sex with these guys

2962
02:27:09,941 --> 02:27:12,680
on set.
And it was like some of this weird thing

2963
02:27:12,690 --> 02:27:14,350
that like,
this was his girlfriend,

2964
02:27:14,351 --> 02:27:19,351
but she would go to work and get the 
shit fucked out of her by a bunch 

2965
02:27:19,351 --> 02:27:19,450
different.
And how did they feel about that?

2966
02:27:19,660 --> 02:27:22,000
This is what the straw that broke the 
camel's back.

2967
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:24,370
He was having dinner with her and she's 
like,

2968
02:27:24,371 --> 02:27:25,450
God,
I'm so tired.

2969
02:27:25,451 --> 02:27:28,420
I do an anal scene all day today.
And he was like,

2970
02:27:28,450 --> 02:27:29,840
what?
Like he was,

2971
02:27:29,990 --> 02:27:32,500
they were out to dinner and he like,
he in his mind,

2972
02:27:32,501 --> 02:27:36,160
he was able to put that barrier up.
And what she does is just work.

2973
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:37,350
It's fine.
You know,

2974
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:39,940
we're going to go to dinner and have a 
wonderful time.

2975
02:27:39,941 --> 02:27:41,860
Candlelight,
fine wine,

2976
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:44,920
some amazing food.
I didn't love with her.

2977
02:27:44,921 --> 02:27:46,960
She's amazing.
She was,

2978
02:27:47,110 --> 02:27:49,000
she was tired.
She was complaining about take it in the

2979
02:27:49,001 --> 02:27:50,860
ass all day and he was like,
check,

2980
02:27:50,861 --> 02:27:53,530
please get out of here.
So they split up.

2981
02:27:54,070 --> 02:27:58,900
I got another one who wasn't my friend,
but it was a friend of a friend who told

2982
02:27:58,901 --> 02:28:03,901
me this story that uh,
this guy was dating this girl and you 

2983
02:28:03,901 --> 02:28:03,901
know,
it was just the same thing.

2984
02:28:03,901 --> 02:28:04,330
So like,
hey,

2985
02:28:04,331 --> 02:28:06,340
you know,
switch does relive in no big deal.

2986
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:12,060
And he read or contract and he goes,
what's air tight and airtight is a dick 

2987
02:28:17,081 --> 02:28:19,110
and every hole.
And he was like,

2988
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:25,250
check please this,
I can't.

2989
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:28,490
So the guy,
the first guy that took me to a set,

2990
02:28:29,180 --> 02:28:31,810
and this is like in [inaudible] 94.
Okay.

2991
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:34,820
So this was the pretty keyword pre 
fabian days,

2992
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,830
pre Internet.
And um,

2993
02:28:37,010 --> 02:28:42,010
they were all rich.
Everybody was rich and the porn stars 

2994
02:28:42,010 --> 02:28:45,680
like real stars.
It was Janine and Jill Kelly who were 

2995
02:28:45,891 --> 02:28:48,620
very famous porn stars,
a lesbian scene.

2996
02:28:48,621 --> 02:28:53,621
And there was a scene,
like there was a cartoon character or 

2997
02:28:53,621 --> 02:28:57,281
comic book character.
This woman wrote and she came to life 

2998
02:28:57,281 --> 02:28:57,380
and they were having a lesbian scene 
together.

2999
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:01,040
But it was,
it was really weird because like,

3000
02:29:01,041 --> 02:29:06,041
um,
like she knew that we were watching and 

3001
02:29:06,041 --> 02:29:10,301
so there was like this,
it was just like air of theatrical 

3002
02:29:10,301 --> 02:29:13,710
enthusiasm that was very forced,
like they would do the scenes.

3003
02:29:13,711 --> 02:29:15,560
She's like,
I love my job,

3004
02:29:15,590 --> 02:29:17,900
I love my job.
My job is amazing.

3005
02:29:18,370 --> 02:29:23,370
Look at my friend at the time I was on,
I don't know if I'm buying all this.

3006
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:25,280
I was like,
this just seems weird.

3007
02:29:25,430 --> 02:29:30,430
I remember Mike Quiz me on my first pool
and set this director who kind of 

3008
02:29:30,430 --> 02:29:35,051
embedded ourselves with said to me,
you'll find that there's a wisp of 

3009
02:29:35,051 --> 02:29:36,590
darkness dot everybody who does this 
other thing.

3010
02:29:36,650 --> 02:29:37,840
Yeah.
Whispered.

3011
02:29:38,430 --> 02:29:40,670
That's what's fascinating.
Like why,

3012
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:43,250
what is it like?
It's illogical.

3013
02:29:43,460 --> 02:29:48,410
If you look at it on paper,
it's like everyone who is healthy,

3014
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:53,500
whose body functions correctly,
enjoy sexual relations,

3015
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:58,220
whether it's straight sex,
gay sex or whatever the fuck it is.

3016
02:29:58,610 --> 02:30:01,280
People like to be touched.
It's part of being a person.

3017
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:05,690
Why is it so shameful when other people 
get to watch?

3018
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:10,720
And why is it?
Why does it devastate people when they 

3019
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:14,561
find out that their loved one had done 
something on film that others can see 

3020
02:30:14,561 --> 02:30:15,470
and when they leave poor.

3021
02:30:15,470 --> 02:30:19,250
And this is another consequence of 
Fabian I look at in my show,

3022
02:30:19,251 --> 02:30:24,251
is that when they leave porn,
it's much more likely that that,

3023
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:25,360
you know,
they leave Poland,

3024
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:27,740
they go to a different part of America,
they started a new life.

3025
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:32,270
It's much more likely that they'll be 
noticed then in the nineties,

3026
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:35,560
like in the nineties for next porn star 
to be outdated.

3027
02:30:35,950 --> 02:30:40,190
Someone would have to go to like a DVD 
shop and Brian these days everybody just

3028
02:30:40,210 --> 02:30:45,210
watch his 20 poem films for five seconds
each until they found the one that they 

3029
02:30:45,210 --> 02:30:50,111
want to jack off too.
So it's much more likely that a former 

3030
02:30:50,111 --> 02:30:52,460
porn star will be spotted in outage.
And as a consequence by it,

3031
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:54,950
like I was talking to this guy called 
Dale Rutter,

3032
02:30:55,630 --> 02:31:00,630
his name is Dale debone and got a job as
a nurse in a hospital and human 

3033
02:31:03,621 --> 02:31:08,621
resources code the and said to him a udl
to bone and said,

3034
02:31:09,201 --> 02:31:14,201
we have to fire you.
Because like with any patient says you 

3035
02:31:14,201 --> 02:31:15,760
even like looked at the wrong way,
like they went to court.

3036
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Yeah.
So pull out a day offset that his 

3037
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:21,000
recognizability

3038
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,600
has gone up massively since pornhub and 
free porn came along.

3039
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:29,840
Yeah.
You shouldn't be mad at the people 

3040
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:29,840
recognize him.
Yeah.

3041
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:29,840
Pervert.
Yeah.

3042
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:29,910
I'm just doing a job.
You fuck.

3043
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,700
There was a woman who got arrested,
not arrested,

3044
02:31:32,701 --> 02:31:35,680
rather fired.
She was a school teacher and uh,

3045
02:31:35,710 --> 02:31:40,710
they turned,
it turned out that in the nineties or 

3046
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:43,221
something like that,
she'd done porn and she was like really 

3047
02:31:43,221 --> 02:31:43,221
well respected,
very,

3048
02:31:43,221 --> 02:31:44,220
uh,
loved school teacher.

3049
02:31:44,221 --> 02:31:47,940
And then one of the kids in school 
figured it out,

3050
02:31:48,020 --> 02:31:50,220
right.
Started telling everybody next thing you

3051
02:31:50,221 --> 02:31:51,600
know,
kids are getting online.

3052
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:56,930
Yeah.
And watching the teacher and she lost 

3053
02:31:56,930 --> 02:31:58,110
her job and she was like really,
really respected and loved.

3054
02:31:58,470 --> 02:31:59,430
And then,
you know,

3055
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:01,590
we don't love you anymore.
He used to fuck.

3056
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:02,970
I know,
I,

3057
02:32:02,971 --> 02:32:03,900
I,
it's,

3058
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:05,310
it's baffling.
You know,

3059
02:32:05,311 --> 02:32:09,180
even in these sort of sex positive,
more sex positive,

3060
02:32:09,181 --> 02:32:12,570
kind of empty slut shaming times,
there's still a massive amount.

3061
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:16,760
Technically that's not real when it's a 
bubble,

3062
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:20,440
it's a small book that most of the world
doesn't share the ball.

3063
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:21,790
That's the other thing.
It's like,

3064
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:23,400
what about other countries?
Like,

3065
02:32:23,401 --> 02:32:26,310
is this stigma attached to the.
Wasn't there like in Italy,

3066
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:31,420
uh,
a former porn star ran for PARLA 

3067
02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:33,100
national,
started going out with um,

3068
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:37,380
Oh fuck the artist Jeff Koons.
I don't know who he is.

3069
02:32:37,430 --> 02:32:38,400
Oh,
he's like a big,

3070
02:32:38,401 --> 02:32:43,401
like famous sort of pop artists and I 
think they will have a relationship and 

3071
02:32:43,531 --> 02:32:44,610
yeah,
she,

3072
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:49,880
she asked you to.
Britain is still that stigma and show 

3073
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:52,770
Italy doesn't give a fuck.
I don't give a little wild over there.

3074
02:32:53,490 --> 02:32:54,320
Yeah,
I mean I would have,

3075
02:32:54,321 --> 02:32:59,321
I would wonder like what countries are 
the most accepting of former adult 

3076
02:32:59,321 --> 02:33:02,520
stars?
Adult is my favorite term adult.

3077
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:03,560
It's like,
well,

3078
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:06,040
you know,
it's like urban land only.

3079
02:33:06,050 --> 02:33:08,070
If you say urban used just say black 
people,

3080
02:33:08,071 --> 02:33:12,180
Jesus Christ,
adult say porn to say porn.

3081
02:33:12,320 --> 02:33:14,490
And said to the adult industry,
like,

3082
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:19,520
what do you mean?
The industry of people who are grown up 

3083
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:19,520
like,
what do you.

3084
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:22,050
I play stupid like what adults as 
opposed to what do the children industry

3085
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:25,890
the fuck you saying?
Just a weird term.

3086
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:31,520
Well I hope that the butterfly effect 
because it's so just,

3087
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:33,840
it just shows them to be just,
you know,

3088
02:33:33,841 --> 02:33:36,060
just let the rest of us ordinary,
sweet,

3089
02:33:36,090 --> 02:33:38,730
fucked up.
[inaudible] Nice.

3090
02:33:38,810 --> 02:33:42,280
You know,
mixtures of and they are just people.

3091
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:43,980
I hope it will do its bit.

3092
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:51,100
Do you think I should go now?
Do you think you should go now and you 

3093
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:51,810
said enough.
What do you think?

3094
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:53,610
I think it was great.
We had a great talk.

3095
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:56,250
There would be a good way to end it.
I enjoyed it very much.

3096
02:33:56,251 --> 02:34:00,990
I'm going to meet my family and I've got
to run it and have a low.

3097
02:34:00,991 --> 02:34:02,700
That's a good place.
Yes.

3098
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:04,190
You do that all the time?
Yes.

3099
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:09,290
Good spot.
I could do every day when I'm in Los 

3100
02:34:09,290 --> 02:34:09,290
Angeles.
Oh beautiful.

3101
02:34:09,290 --> 02:34:09,290
It was such a pleasure.
As always.

3102
02:34:10,010 --> 02:34:11,780
Let's do it again for sure.
I would love to come.

3103
02:34:11,781 --> 02:34:12,920
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

3104
02:34:13,350 --> 02:34:14,910
And tell people how they could find your
stuff.

Here's the butterfly,
the biggest collection of audio 

3111
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:31,840
entertainment on the entire Internet.
I'm lucky that star rating.

Beautiful.
Look at you use savage.

3113

And my twitter thing.

02:34:37,691 --> 02:34:40,450
It's just that drum routes and Jon 
Ronson.

3116
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:47,551
movie called Oak Joe,
which is on Netflix about giant pig on 

3117
02:34:47,551 --> 02:34:48,330
Netflix.
Fearful.

3118
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:49,630
Yeah.
Jon Ronson.

3119
02:34:49,631 --> 02:34:51,190
Ladies and gentlemen.
