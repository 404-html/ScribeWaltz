1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:02,550
Uh,

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,090
Wyclef Jean who just robbed half
a fucking Haiti dot cock sucker.

4
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,110
That's why I'm Haiti.

5
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,550
You to see that he robbed us all.

6
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,930
Fucking earthquake relief.

7
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:10,350
Fun.

8
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,183
No,

9
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,100
that million dollars brow.

10
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,170
That's why I'm saying unless I see
the guy on the street bleeding,

11
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:18,004
I give them money.

12
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,370
When you sent her flowers,

13
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,250
they get 30 of it.

14
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,310
Did you steal my change jar in the late
nineties probably fucking change jar.

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,650
What's a change jar?

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,220
Is this the head?

17
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,250
Oh,

18
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,150
if blue just talking about Robert.

19
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,301
Yeah,

20
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:40,050
he was just thinking about the nineties
and we where we lived on curse on and

21
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,210
there was a fucking change.

22
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,200
Our Ego that probably is fucking,

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,390
I called you Joey jingles for awhile.

24
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,660
No,

25
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,080
no.

26
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,270
I would never write change.

27
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,390
I know that it was someone
who just fucking change.

28
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,940
Just like a fucking cup of cheese.

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:54,990
Yeah.

30
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,570
It was just a weird thought
at this point in my ankle,

31
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,930
I smoked pot,

32
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,060
which I never do.

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,750
A fuck is wrong with y'all.

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,693
I'm a professional.

35
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,580
Yeah.

36
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,590
Now I remember calling

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,580
Seattle one time.

38
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
I was opening up for a stay at
home and I picked him up in an Rv.

39
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,730
It was snowing in Seattle.

40
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,730
I know weird chick was her puppy Carroll,

41
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,301
the white stuff.

42
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,680
The fucking a little before Perez.

43
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,550
He was around for that.

44
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,470
He knew all about that shit.

45
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,060
See how Joe Rogan,

46
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,070
you could go crazy.

47
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,840
You got a chick that's sucking your Dick.

48
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,500
I've got no experience with this cocaine.

49
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,531
I don't,

50
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,760
I don't have any experience.

51
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,230
We have a fucking shady job.

52
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,483
Jesus.

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,873
No,

54
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,820
no,

55
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,031
no.

56
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,170
I just noticed the fucking,

57
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,650
all the chains had been taken
out and nothing else was stolen.

58
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,370
I go,

59
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,061
who would do that?

60
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:51,870
And I go,

61
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,490
I think Joey's back on drugs.

62
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,380
Maybe you fucking so I called Joe Doe.

63
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,311
It's impossible.

64
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:56,511
Joe,

65
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,121
you might've done it.

66
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:57,721
Forgot about it.

67
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:01,500
I think the last time I went to Stan hope
sounds like someone like I had an open

68
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,261
house policy.

69
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:03,410
He had an open house policy.

70
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,260
Still do.

71
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:04,831
I'm like,

72
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:05,720
who would just like,

73
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,260
I was just going,

74
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,440
this is the fucking like
1996 we were all broke.

75
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm going,

76
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,100
which one of my friends would be
broken enough to just fucking,

77
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,690
I have a thought of you.

78
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,760
I was at the coach and horses tangles out
of my fucking mind and I couldn't walk

79
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,520
to,

80
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,110
uh,

81
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,621
Vista.

82
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,700
So I went to [inaudible] because he had
the open door policy and I go to stay at

83
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,010
hopes,

84
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,420
I hope with the go.

85
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,310
He's got the bunk beds I get on.

86
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:29,640
But no,

87
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,810
at this time it was the living room.

88
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,644
He just had a cut.

89
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,480
I get on the car cause I couldn't even
make it to the fucking bed tonight

90
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,120
there's an earthquake and I wake up
to the house and they opened my eyes

91
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,440
sideways and I see the clock.

92
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,820
So I'm focusing on the clock,

93
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,890
but the fucking earth is moving,

94
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,753
you know what I'm saying?

95
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
And that was just,

96
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,100
that's I think the last time I was.

97
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,480
Do you still have that apartment?

98
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,230
It's subsidized rent control.

99
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,470
I still live there all the time.

100
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,490
I still beat the horn when I go by like
a motherfucker Hennigan's now just kinda

101
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,390
give him town.

102
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:01,990
Yeah,

103
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,261
yeah,

104
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:02,560
yeah.

105
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,430
Do you ever Miss La?

106
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,481
Yeah.

107
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,314
Now.

108
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,490
Right now the fucking
drive here was horrific.

109
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,600
I was going to change I,

110
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,130
I was trying to get ahold of you.

111
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,300
If,

112
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,090
if we have to do this the next
day I'm going to change my flight.

113
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,691
I'm like,

114
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:17,800
I can just fly.

115
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,780
I could fucking 10 days off.

116
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,700
I'll just fly to fucking somewhere.

117
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,750
I never do that.

118
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,190
Just fly somewhere for a vacation.

119
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,840
I had my passport in Costa Rica.

120
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,640
If I'm going to extend my stay here,

121
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,080
did fucking hang out with you.

122
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,850
I'll probably be fucked up when I leave.

123
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,863
Why not?

124
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,110
And then just the thought of lax
fucking ruined that entire fantasy.

125
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,780
Really?

126
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:37,931
Oh,

127
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:38,321
sorry.

128
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,490
He's going to talk down here.

129
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,671
No,

130
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,504
it was perfect.

131
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,020
All right,

132
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,500
that's fine.

133
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,770
Well,

134
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,530
my audio functions are way fucked.

135
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,110
Oh yeah,

136
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,670
I'm medicinally.

137
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,420
You know what I'm,

138
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,580
why did you move there in the first place?

139
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,414
Why did you decide to,

140
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,960
you live in Bisbee Arizona
in the middle of nowhere,

141
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,510
right?

142
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,343
What was the,

143
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,020
just wanted to get away
and Paul's by as a place,

144
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,940
I've found what I was driving on the road.

145
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,230
I really impulse buy.

146
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,160
Yeah.

147
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
I didn't even see the inside.

148
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,480
Did you know anything
about the town pictures?

149
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,800
Did you know anything about the town?

150
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
I had been there a lot.

151
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,161
Sorry.

152
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:12,850
I had a fucking,

153
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,540
it's fine dude.

154
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,781
Yeah,

155
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:13,991
yeah,

156
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:14,824
no.

157
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,420
Alright.

158
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,730
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

159
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,621
So,

160
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,430
um,

161
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,641
yeah,

162
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,121
so I've,

163
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:26,260
what's the downside?

164
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,650
What's the downside of living
in a tiny little town like that?

165
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:29,860
Cause you're in like a town of like what?

166
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,300
6,000 people or something crazy.

167
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:31,961
Yeah.

168
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,050
Jake Lamata has come over
to the house a couple times.

169
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
Jake Lamata the fighter.

170
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:36,880
Yeah.

171
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,540
Really?

172
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,373
Yeah.

173
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,600
The Guy who they made the
movie regional bullet about.

174
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,170
Yeah.

175
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,100
What's that guy like?

176
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,610
Uh,

177
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,330
you know what?

178
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,090
I could do a fucking 20 minute bit.

179
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,370
That's the downside.

180
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,820
Like he,

181
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,653
he lives there.

182
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,471
Yeah,

183
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:50,711
yeah.

184
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:50,891
No,

185
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,620
but you have to be respectful
of people there because like

186
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,150
any good story that comes out of there,

187
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,920
of course your neighbor.

188
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,020
That's the downside of
living in a small town.

189
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:02,230
Yeah.

190
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,350
You can't talk about camp.

191
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,880
Flip someone off half the fucking
stop sign because they cut you off.

192
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,970
Cause that guy will be behind you
in line it fucking safe safely.

193
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,201
Yeah.

194
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,330
Like how often you run into the
same people over and over again?

195
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,020
All the time.

196
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,620
All the time.

197
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,070
Yeah.

198
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,791
That's a weird thing,

199
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,170
huh?

200
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,421
I go,

201
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:16,691
yeah.

202
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,800
You get a fucking really funny
fucking bit about your neighbor.

203
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,670
So do you guys think that geography
is took care of his change real quick?

204
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:24,941
No,

205
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,950
I don't think there's this spot.

206
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:36,780
Yeah.
