1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,310
Yeah. Three, two,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,040
Youngstown the house. How are
you brother? Good. How you doing?

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,980
Thanks for doing this man. I appreciate
it. No, thanks for having me on.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,660
I appreciate it. You were out here.
I'm working with Danny Garcia,

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,300
[inaudible] Garcia, Mikey
Garcia and Garcia camp. Um,

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,350
oh. So I came out, you know, a couple
of things. Uh, as we mentioned earlier,

7
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,330
a buddy of mine,
uh,

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,510
mark with Micah told us some ideas around
and Kinda just taking a week out here

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,950
in California to, you know, keep moving.
It's nice, right? Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah,

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,080
it was nice. And uh,
Ohio, believe it or not.

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:40,470
And then this morning they woke
up to like three inches of snow,

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,700
so I'm out here enjoying
and they got the snow. Well,

13
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:46,620
the thing about La is no one's from here,

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,230
so everybody grew up in a place like
Youngstown or something like that.

15
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,690
Like you were saying, you're running into
a bunch of Youngstown people out here.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,970
Tony Hinchcliffe got super excited to
see you. Absolutely. And I'm a, you know,

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,010
that's what's weird about that.

18
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:59,070
I'm excited to see him and he's
excited to see me and this, uh,

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,810
it was really cool. Um, you
know, I've heard of Tony and
I knew of Tony, you know,

20
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,740
before and everything,

21
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:08,320
and then to finally be able to meet them
and somebody from Youngstown as doing,

22
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,610
you know, great things. It
was Kinda cool. So yeah. No,

23
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,410
it was cool hanging out with you
when we were in Columbus too.

24
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:16,440
That was a fun time. I was,
I was good eating stew. Yeah.

25
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,050
What was the name of that place again?
You guys picked it,

26
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,930
I believe in Italian market. I
think it was joint. Was that,

27
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,230
is that it was your friend's friend of
a friend of Mike Brown's friend, right?

28
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,970
I don't remember the name. Matthew
Morrel another good guy. Yeah. No, he's,

29
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,790
he's a fucking scary dude.
Just savage.

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,620
I got to tell you a funny story with him.

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,760
We're at my gym and he came and did
a seminar at my gym and uh, it was,

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,830
I have just a fitness gym right now there.

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,310
And he was going over and he was
showing people when he kinda came in.

34
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:48,180
And I was showing him like a little
punch in a hook and he started doing the

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,190
elbow off the hook. Now I'm a pretty
big guy and now since I retired and um,

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,791
you know,

37
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,530
and I'm working on losing the weight but
he hit me with that elbow on my arm and

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,460
it just hurt and it was slow motion.

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,730
He wasn't throwing it hard and I'm
going to at this son of a bitch,

40
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,440
really wanted to turn that over. I
wouldn't want to get hit by it. Yeah,

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,510
elbows are awful. Bones
are awful. It's like,

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,030
it always weirds me out that the UFC
has little padding on the gloves but

43
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,540
there's no padding in your shins.
No padding on your elbows,

44
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,350
no padding on your knees to
terrible way to take a beating.

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,700
It is and people get into the brutality
of it. Unfortunate not cause I boxed.

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,870
I think box is more brutal.

47
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,880
Only reason is because if you get dropped
in boxing and you got 10 seconds to

48
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:33,270
get up,

49
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,000
your brand could be rattled in the first
round and you can get dropped four more

50
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:40,920
times than not fight. You got 36 minutes
of fighting, unfortunately in MMA. Yeah.

51
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,710
They were hitting you with the knees,
the elbows. And if you go down,

52
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,430
they usually stop to fight.
Yeah.

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,640
Rightfully so because somebody could
come down with an atomic knee dropping,

54
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,100
you know. I know, but
I'm just saying it's a,

55
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:54,300
or anything can happen in it.

56
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:57,720
So when you are fighting a MMA
wasn't as big as it is now,

57
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,210
but did you ever think about doing it?
No. And I'll be honest with, you know, um,

58
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,900
but I was always interested in,
I was,

59
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,400
I was always interested
in the martial arts. Um,

60
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,590
actually that's how I got into boxing
was a young kid taking taekwondo and,

61
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:16,300
and uh, I don't know that's how
you pronounce it, but it's okay.

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,980
And, um, you know, I got into
it with that. It was, to me,
it was kind of like boring.

63
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,150
I'm a young kid,
you know,

64
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:26,890
I was full of Piss and vinegar and I
wanted to actually get in and do something

65
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:31,750
and I played other sports.
But, uh, you know, and then
after I retired a little bit,

66
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,200
um, I kind of strayed away from
everything in the fight game and, um,

67
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,340
and I started getting interested
in Jujitsu and stuff like that.

68
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,940
And how old were you when you
retired? 30. 30. That's young. Yeah.

69
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,830
Still am pretty young. How old are you
now? 36. Yeah. You're still in the range?

70
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,240
Yeah, no, it's the effective range. Oh,

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,850
that's why I've been working
out and I, you know, I,

72
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,580
I kind of slowed down on the power
lifting a lot and I've been doing,

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,330
getting a flexible again.
So you haven't had a fight in six years.

74
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:05,570
Do you ever get the itch? That's
why I'm saying right now. Yeah.

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,120
Yeah. I've been, um,

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,750
well another reason why I came out and
we'll talk about what mark and everything,

77
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:17,170
but, you know, I don't want to leave
nobody ever on either, you know,

78
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,370
this is something you just think I'm
really thinking about it and I'm working

79
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,370
out losing the weight.
But at the same time,

80
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,410
there's a lot of process behind that too.

81
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,430
I would have to sit down with the
family. Um, just go over a lot of things.

82
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,570
You know, you're doing any
boxing these days. Hey,

83
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,490
I've been working out just sitting the
bag pads, stuff like that. Um, you know,

84
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:39,070
I'm still lifting,
but nothing if you're Jack Dude,

85
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,360
look at the size of your fucking arms.

86
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,700
I know I was up a fight
in middleweight son,

87
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,590
no cruiser weight as to the
Nice area right now. The range.

88
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,300
Yeah. Anybody but USAC and
uh, I'm not fighting nut. That
guy's scary as fuck. Yeah,

89
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,630
I don't, you know, the
thing is everybody, I did,

90
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,150
I've mentioned this a couple of weeks
ago and the first thing that came out

91
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:03,010
about it was he needed the money
so I can't win for losing. Um,

92
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,881
you know what I mean?
Like,

93
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,370
cause there's other things right now
that we're talking about actually been in

94
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:11,200
contact believer or not what desks
and with the stars and uh, Jesus,

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,650
I'm, I'm having fun with it now.
I guess it don't make no joke.

96
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:18,070
So I tried to take a fight. I'd
rather fight, use sick, believe me.

97
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,290
It's for the stars is fucking hard work.
Man talks,

98
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,770
talks of it.
Which my buddy Mark's doing,

99
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,880
I've had a couple friends that have been
on that. I said it's brutally hard work.

100
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,610
It is a virtual or teas who was
a fighter. Been on it. Yeah.

101
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,870
So that's where it's going.

102
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:38,800
Why I don't want people also the
rumor mill will start nut he's broke.

103
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:42,670
He needs the money because it's
absolutely not the case. Um,

104
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,730
so you retired healthy.
Yeah.

105
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,740
You retired young and you set some
money away but you still look,

106
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,550
you were a world champion for a reason.

107
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,700
You know you had to become
a real world champion.

108
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:58,250
You have to have some
crazy drive competitive

109
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,250
fire inside you. So there is a, you know,

110
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,560
a lot of people don't understand
in any combat sport callbacks,

111
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,210
combat Umma not pat myself on the back.

112
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:10,340
I don't know if it's even
good to say but you know,

113
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,620
combat role to champion athletes
and fighter's mentality wise,

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,630
you always going to have that mentality,

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,720
you know and my only reason why I'm even
throwing this around and I guess that's

116
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,660
the right term to use
because if nothing comes up,

117
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,460
I don't want the backlash on that either.

118
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,160
Because I'm still only 36 and I at that
point where I got that small window

119
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,450
still, you know, where I'm not 40,

120
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm not 38 and uh,
you know,

121
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,290
I've been healthy for,
you know,

122
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,750
four and a half years and
I've been working out.

123
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,620
And what made you decide to go
power lifting? Just kinda know.

124
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,930
It's telling me US fucking
show bitches whatsoever.

125
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,730
That's another one. Guns. Exactly
right. I was tired and think about it.

126
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,170
I was so damn skinny.

127
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:59,720
If I turned sideways and stuck my
tongue out of the book a Zipper,

128
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,900
you know what I mean?
Um,

129
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,120
and being six foot 200 and make
it happen to make 160 pounds,

130
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,510
even between fights,
you still had to maintain your weight.

131
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,070
And I got tired of that. Uh, what
was your walking around with?

132
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,500
I'll walk around about one 73.
That's not that bad. No, it's not.

133
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,210
And that's a real light and you
know, and then, but as I got older,

134
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,980
yeah, I started getting a little
more difficult to, you know,

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,200
keep that and I started getting
up to like one 75, almost one 80.

136
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,200
So now you're looking at a,
and I'm still skinny at that point.

137
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,040
So now you're looking at it how can to
lose 20 more pounds again to get down at

138
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,910
that age. And it came to a point, um,
which cause a lot of issues for me,

139
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,400
one flight with the Martinez fight and uh,
after that we had to jump out.

140
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,900
Hmm. Yeah. That point of
diminishing returns, right?

141
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,730
When you're just cutting too much weight.
When you fuck Tremaine Taylor,

142
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,940
that was one 60, right? Yes. Yeah, too.

143
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,420
I was one fight where I remember getting
angry at Larry Merchant was Larry

144
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,380
Merchant's calling a
fight. I'm like, he's not,

145
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,330
he's wasn't recognizing that you were
tuning him up and you were hurting him and

146
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,020
he like, he was, he was commenting on a,

147
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,100
almost like it was a trend
that he expected to see
rather than what was actually

148
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,440
happening.
It was a lot of things about that fight.

149
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,260
I loved them guys because
believe it or not, in my opinion,

150
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,370
that was a great fight.

151
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,380
And I seen that day had that fight
and a top 10 middle weight, uh,

152
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,580
one of the top 10 middle way fights of
all time. And that's kind of a cool thing.

153
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,150
But also, you know, some of that
commentating, no really made that fight,

154
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:33,170
especially at the end in my opinion,
made that flight kind of what it was also,

155
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,440
you know, besides the fact that me
getting dropped and everything, but um,

156
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,590
I didn't agree with the judging of it,
you know, cause I still had me ahead.

157
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,640
I went back and wash it.

158
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:44,870
I'm not one of those egotistical people
use or like I like to really break down

159
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:48,170
what happened in that fight and I,
and if I lost a round,

160
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:51,080
I would say I lost around, you know,
I was hard on myself with that.

161
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,980
I watched that fight and I'll probably
10 times and I don't see where they

162
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,210
had remained winning, you know? Yeah. I
gave him one round and plus the 10, eight.

163
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:04,350
So as a total of three rounds and,
uh, I don't see how that happened.

164
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,590
Well, you know, I mean we,

165
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,120
we've had this conversation a
hundred times in this podcast,

166
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,260
but judging and boxing and judging
in MMA judging is just terrible.

167
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,680
It's just terrible. It's sad.
It doesn't make any sense.

168
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,270
There's so many experts out there.

169
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,270
There's so many really reliable people
that you can call on that would do a

170
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,900
great job of, of, of figuring
out what's going on in a fight.

171
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,790
And for whatever reason,
they don't get those jobs.

172
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,980
I think they gotta start doing something
soon. Inbox and what that, yeah.

173
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,520
They have to figure something out.
What the judging Charlo fight. Yes.

174
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,901
Yeah.
Yeah.

175
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,990
There's a handful of people I had the
argument with that actually thought

176
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:41,960
Charlotte lost.
Um,

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,130
I didn't think that he looked as good
as he could have enough flight. Yeah.

178
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,830
But I thought he wanted to fight,
you know, um, one 16, one 12. Uh,

179
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,880
but I don't know what system they could
try to break down for that or tried to

180
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,730
get to actually start making
some of them fights fair.

181
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,620
But boxing is doing fantastic to pass
two years. I mean the numbers are crazy.

182
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:06,100
You seem what does zone? There were
Canelo and yeah, so it's, it's there.

183
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,110
Just the attention is that the sport
and the popularity of it's coming back,

184
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,000
but what could eventually hurt it
again is things like the judging of the

185
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:18,600
flights. Yeah. Outcomes. Well
there's certain ones where you,

186
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,190
you want to like you want a criminal
investigation like Tim Bradley,

187
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,730
Manny Pacquiao. That was one where
after that was up I was like,

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,970
I was looking at the TV,
I was looking to the side.

189
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:30,990
I was looking at where I was like,

190
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:34,600
what the fuck did I just see
what just happened here? Okay.

191
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:35,910
Okay.

192
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,700
That flight rate there, I actually
had to walk away with my head down.

193
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,290
I that that was probably one of the
worst robberies that I've ever seen.

194
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,030
It was horrible robbery.
I searched to give Tim Bradley two rounds.

195
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,590
I gave him one. I was trying to give
him rounds there. Kyle Lake say, how?

196
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,310
Where did you get to set in other words
and I couldn't do it. Yeah, I loved him.

197
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:59,820
Bradley too, by the way. Awesome
guy. Awesome. Awesome fighter too.

198
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,460
I mean he's just all hard. I
mean the guy's, he's amazing.

199
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,290
But that just was a bad decision.
And you know,

200
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:07,981
I think there was a,

201
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,580
there was a lady that was responsible
for two really bad decisions. That word?

202
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,850
Yeah, to lady bird. Was it her?
Was it? There was another one too.

203
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:19,710
There was an adult bird. She does have
a May two I want to say. Ah, yeah.

204
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,320
Ladder. Letterman's daughter
baby. Well there was no,

205
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:27,000
there was another lady who retired
from doing it after that decision.

206
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:31,080
It was like a big controversy. People
were her, her score was so off.

207
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,520
People were thinking she got paid
off just so many anymore though.

208
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,750
It's hard to keep up with
it. Well, the thing is,

209
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,300
and people that are cynical or skeptical,

210
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,750
do you know how much money
is being bet on fights?

211
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:45,330
Especially a Manny Pacquiao fight.
There's so much money.

212
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,440
And if someone like packing,

213
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:49,740
I was a prohibitive favorite heading
to 10 proudly fight. I mean, who knows?

214
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:54,040
It could be four to one five, two, one
six, two, one. Somebody rolls up with

215
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,480
a Nice Brown bag, you
fill it. We got in here,

216
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,680
here's $30,000 I never have
to report. I think just, yeah,

217
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,950
there was more behind
why that happens to be.

218
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,150
That's always been the idea that there's
no bribery going on anymore. It's crazy.

219
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,650
I don't want to say it, but
I think I have, yeah, I think
I have an idea. You know,

220
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,410
I think it comes down to
who's putting the show on

221
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,730
[inaudible] and who's who's in the pocket.

222
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,220
But Teddy Atlas was explaining
it to when he was on the podcast.

223
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,830
One of the things that he was saying
was that they take these people out to

224
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,240
dinner,
like the,

225
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:29,990
like they're all in cahoots and friendly
with each other and if there's a

226
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:33,980
certain result that the
promoter would like to see,

227
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,060
these judges will lean towards that if
they have a good relationship with that

228
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:42,890
promoter. You said it for me. Yeah.
That's what it is. Look, teddy laid it out

229
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,510
and um, I don't know. Yeah, it's bad
because again, boxes really coming back.

230
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,170
It is and the fights, you got three
or four weight classes right now.

231
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,160
That's so interesting.

232
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:57,330
But the bad part about it is you don't
get interested in it or you don't get as

233
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:59,820
excited anymore because you're
afraid of the outcome of that.

234
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,880
Yeah.
You know,

235
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,970
I wasn't terribly upset at
the wilder fury decision.

236
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,330
I wasn't terribly upset. I
thought, I thought, you know what?

237
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,730
I think Tyson fury did enough to win.

238
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,550
But when I look at it,

239
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:20,350
I like when I like when they scored
damage damage means a lot to me.

240
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,060
And when I look at that fight,
when, when wild or hurt him,

241
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,330
he heard him twice and
he heard him real bad.

242
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,100
I mean I think that's worth a lot and
I think he was always threatening.

243
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,660
So I felt like,

244
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,590
I don't know if I would agree with a draw.

245
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,880
I think it was a close decision when
for Tyson fury, but I didn't hate it.

246
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,730
I didn't hate it cause I think I'd like
to see them fight again. Absolutely.

247
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,790
I mean it was one of them fights

248
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,320
where yes,
you're 100% right.

249
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,530
That it could have been a draw and I
think everybody would be kind of satisfied

250
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,040
with that. Yeah. Um, unfortunately
with the account and knocked down,

251
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,340
which I was so frustrated with
the comments and you know,

252
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:01,480
I had to stay away from the social
media and the boxing groups and,

253
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,940
and things like that because, oh,
just, you know, to some of the

254
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,900
opinions of people as the
way to put it. Uh, well deaf,

255
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,670
that was a long count and this and that.

256
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,410
There has been thousands of fights in
the last 10 years and I've very solid

257
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:21,630
heard anybody complain about account,
you know, that, that fight. Um,

258
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,450
they don't do a ten second count unboxing
and he'd go by the referees count and

259
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:29,300
for another thing,
we're a wilder kind of hurt himself.

260
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,690
Referee tells you in the locker room
before the flight and he explains it to go

261
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:37,400
to your neutral corner.
If you come out of your neutral corner,

262
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,010
I will stop the account
mean you know that.

263
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:43,700
So the first thing I used to do it when
I dropped somebody is I ran my ass to

264
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:46,920
that neutral corner. You know, said I
worked for, we can start counting. Um,

265
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,410
I didn't see any issue with the, the
knockdown, I even recorded it on my phone.

266
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:55,730
And if you did go by the ten second count,
Tyson fury still beat it. Really? Yes,

267
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:59,010
I have it. You know, I'd have
to go through and find it. Um,

268
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,720
I thought I saw it on a
Instagram or one of them. It was,

269
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:07,370
I think it was on Wilders Instagram where
he had it, where worthy count starts.

270
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,660
Right when fewer drops.

271
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,170
I counted it as soon as his back almost
right before his back kits to ground

272
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,000
until where he got up.
And again,

273
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,780
that's only a ten second count without a
referee even come on over to, you know.

274
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,130
Okay. Um, but you know, as
far as the, the fight itself,

275
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,023
I gave,

276
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,650
I gave Walter obviously the two knock
downs that's automatically four rounds.

277
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,100
But I thought,
and I gave him one other round after that.

278
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,190
I thought Tyson fairy
controlled the action. You know,

279
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,960
I had controlled the momentum of
the fight. On the flip side of it,

280
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,100
I think that water actually could've
made that an easier fight to, you know,

281
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,600
water actually has a hard time.

282
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,510
What is control and he don't know
how to really work to the body.

283
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,870
I don't want to put it on a trainer.
I don't know what the issue is with that.

284
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:53,120
But he neglected that body
a lot throughout the flight.

285
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,240
And I just thought that's why Tyson
when most of those rounds, you know,

286
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,360
he just controlled the action to pace
and was kind of able to do what he wanted

287
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,130
to.
And I think that if Walter went backward,

288
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,010
his trainer and watched
the tape would have light,

289
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,550
they're going to see a lot
of opportunities that were
missed enough light. Well,

290
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,180
you know what's crazy about wilder is how
little time he's actually been boxing.

291
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,490
I mean it's really stunning.
When he was on here,

292
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:18,491
he told us that he made the Olympic
team a year and a half into war learning

293
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:22,880
boxing. Yeah. And he won a bronze medal
in the heavyweight division though.

294
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,460
You can kind of get away with
that too. Yeah, you can. You know,

295
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:29,600
most of your heavy for, well back
then also we're big guys who came up.

296
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,030
Usually most of them were football
players or something like that.

297
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:35,480
And they kind of just got into the sport
and still even to this day you were

298
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:39,440
talking about maybe three heavyweights
that really could throw it down. Um,

299
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,410
as were some of the other guys are just
big sloppy guys that come in, you know.

300
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,750
So what do we got now? You
got Luis Ortiz, you got fury,

301
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,670
you wilder. Josh. Joshua. Who
else? Joseph Parker. Yeah.

302
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:57,530
Parker Parker is one of the guys that
could actually still upset anybody in the

303
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:00,930
heavyweight division, especially
with that style that he has. Um,

304
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,180
so it's getting interesting again
though. It is. It's certainly,

305
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,460
well I think with wilder and fury,

306
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,990
that was one of the more interesting
heavyweight title fights in a long time.

307
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,510
And while there's so, it's
so weird. He's so different.

308
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,800
He weighs 209 pounds. He's
skinny as a rail. He hits you.

309
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:21,500
It looks like you get hit in
the face with a missile. I mean,

310
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,350
it's crazy cause that is a missile
he's firing. Fuck, you know,

311
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,360
crazy power that guy and I tried to
explain to people when I tell you,

312
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:32,300
you don't have to be a big guy. Yeah.
You know, it's all about the leverage,

313
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,310
how he did torque. Uh, where are you,
how you generate that power and no,

314
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,910
he's just one of them guys that that's
one of the things were you either have it,

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,010
yeah,
you got it in the cradle or you don't.

316
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,830
And that's another one that you tried
to explain. And even like in baseball,

317
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,470
you're either a home run
hitter or you're not, you know,

318
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,130
you could on a little bit and

319
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,030
maybe knock one or two more home runs
out or knock a guy or two out more.

320
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,280
But if you don't have,
you're not going to,

321
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:01,080
unless you really go back over and find
the time and patience to reprogram that

322
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,720
fighter and change the whole style.
Yeah.

323
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:08,220
It feels like one punch knockout power.
You either have or you don't and,

324
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,790
but the, the guys who can put it
on you and stop you like Julio.

325
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,100
Cesar Chavez never had really
that one punch knockout power,

326
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:18,590
but he fucked a lot of people up and
he had a body shot too. He did not,

327
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,960
he didn't need a knock
out punch to the head too.

328
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,520
He was so perfect when
he was in his prime.

329
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,870
The way he would fight was constant
bobbing, weaving, moving in,

330
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,800
and then once he put that pace on you,
it was just constant damage,

331
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:33,780
constant punch to the volume,

332
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,500
the volume to accuracy and the
fact that he never got tired,

333
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,320
he would just keep that pace
up. Pap Pap, pap, pap pap,

334
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,500
and you'd see guys just start to wilt.
Just backing up all the time.

335
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:47,430
Just wilt under that pressure.
Then as that body attack that he had,

336
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,050
how he invested into that body from the
early rounds, people carry those punches.

337
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,950
You know, they carried out into the
fifth and six round and it was brutal.

338
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:59,970
You know, I couldn't imagine a fight and
I fly some tough guys, but I was glad,

339
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,460
you know, being a tall guy that nobody
ever went to the body like that.

340
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,040
I guess me, I would've hated that. It's a,

341
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,170
it's fucking rough way to make a living,
bro. There is Chavez in his prime.

342
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,640
God Damn was good. Ooh.
It was so good. I mean,

343
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,660
it's just constant movement to constant
cutting angles and the fucking pressure.

344
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,200
Another one like him was Duran too.
That's Roger Mayweather, right? Yes. Yeah.

345
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,040
Black Mamba. Yeah. People
forgot about Roger.

346
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,970
He just systematically broke
you down. Chavez. Yeah.

347
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,140
Very tactical and textbook
and it make many mistakes.

348
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,070
It wasn't flashy. He wasn't overly
fast. He wasn't overly powerful.

349
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,400
But he just broke you down the right
way and to the right punches. Yeah,

350
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,160
that's what, that's the best way to
put it. Through the right punches.

351
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:52,161
He was just relentless and he
was constantly moving forward.

352
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,940
Constant pressure. God Damn. He was good.
Yup. And you know, uh Oh Greg Halligan.

353
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,330
Oh,

354
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,480
remember that one Greg Hogan said he
found a bunch of Tijuana taxi drivers and

355
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:04,530
he'd beat the shit out of break out
those those left hooks the body.

356
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,680
But just like tough taxi
drivers, young fighters, man,

357
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:11,640
you want to like emulate a guy who
just fought with perfect technique.

358
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,630
This is the guy.

359
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,390
Well you know that comes down to
another thing that I was breaking down.

360
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,871
I actually,

361
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:20,871
I touched on it on my show a lot and a
lot of people get mixed up and confused

362
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,770
on a fact of foot work.

363
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,520
What people and some of the guys
that had the best footwork in boxing,

364
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:31,521
we're not flashy guys with the footwork
or even like Mikey Garcia now or like a

365
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:36,600
a Bernard Hopkins is another one.
But you had guys pronounce a word occur.

366
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,370
I know I'm going to probably get beat up
on this. He, he, he had decent footwork.

367
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,910
What I mean by that because,
because yeah, he make you miss.

368
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,920
But Brunel would occur a lot of times,
put himself out of range

369
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,550
by moving lake that, you know, he
make that move or he'd do it too much.

370
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,930
And then he wasn't there to
counter. So what good did it do? A,

371
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,030
you get guys like Chavez or Duran or a
guys like Mikey Garcia now they take that

372
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,680
one little step inches and angles.

373
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,620
They take that one step and earn
brightened position for that punch.

374
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,550
They take the opposite step to suffocate
your punch, you know, and throw you off.

375
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,670
They spin you around, you know,
that's where footwear comes in.

376
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,290
And Chavez was great at that.

377
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah. Um, he was always in range. He
was always in range. He was never,

378
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,140
never running away. And Yeah.
Yeah. And his like, you know,

379
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,860
the guy who does it the best today
about cutting angles and being bright in

380
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:31,030
front of you, you can't him
is Luma Chanko oof. I mean,

381
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:33,970
Loma Chanko stands right in
front of you and then he's not,

382
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,750
and then he's over here and he's
punching you in the face. Tj Dillashaw,

383
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:40,420
who's a UFC bantamweight champion,
said he's sparred with him.

384
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,600
And he said the first round was like,
you know,

385
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,230
Lomas Shankles just feeling them up,
just figuring them out and you know,

386
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:49,270
he's like, no, I'm kind of
hanging in there with this guy.

387
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,010
And then his dad yelled
something in Russian and then
the second round Loma Cenk

388
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:57,080
goes just dancing around him,
stepping to the side, touching them

389
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,120
Zoe round they put on youtube
too. You know what I mean?
Um, yeah, I see. You know,

390
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,600
the thing with Lowman Chanko is this,
uh,

391
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,140
and I tell people also
like Floyd Mayweather was,

392
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,910
is unbelievable defensive fighter. But
Floyd was really good on drawing you in,

393
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,721
you know,

394
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:17,170
and kind of countering off that his
defense and his reflexes were amazing,

395
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,860
but he kind of lured you in a
little bit, made you miss, make,

396
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,180
made you make a mistake,
and then he would counter you.

397
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,910
Loma Chanko on the other hand,
as a guy,

398
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,300
you could throw a punch and f punched
could be emitter and he's spinning and

399
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:33,280
he's already behind you. Yeah, it's
a, the athleticism is astonishing.

400
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:38,140
I have not seen it. Uh, granted, can
he lose? Absolutely. It's boxing.

401
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,410
And if you get one of them rugged guys
that are just going to come in and say,

402
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:44,560
you know what, screw it, I'm going
to, I'm just going to get hit,

403
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,090
but I'm going to hit him. That may be a
type of fighter that beats Alma Chanko.

404
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,780
Okay,

405
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,430
well, well who was it that was it the
Mexican guy who beat him? Uh, in uh,

406
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,440
one of his first fight.

407
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,820
Oh, uh, Selise Salito
Salito right, right, right.

408
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,860
Yeah. That was the kind of fight that
he fought. His dirty got on top of him.

409
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,070
But you got to understand
on that point too,

410
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:11,071
that was Loma Chanko second pro fight
and I guess a real veteran guy who's been

411
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,190
there and done it and seen it.

412
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,220
And that's the argument and
it's hard to explain again.

413
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:17,450
And that was another argument on,

414
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:22,451
he's a dag is a little frustrated reading
second pro fight and usually in boxing

415
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:28,160
and it goes like the first
year you're up for six,

416
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,350
second year he may be,
you start getting up to eight,

417
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,320
but you get a good amount of fights
under your belt before you start getting

418
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:37,250
into the 10 rounds and
12 rounds. Okay. Um,

419
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,940
you're talking about a kid coming
out of the amateurs fighting three,

420
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,630
three minute rounds are for two minute
rounds depending on whatever tournament

421
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:49,430
or international it is. And he's going
right into a Charl 12 round fight.

422
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,110
I know my myself coming up and the
process that top rung brought me up,

423
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:57,740
which was a great process to,
they've had,

424
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,320
they pick the fights and they made sure
that if ice that they pick for me where

425
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:03,710
to correct flights and a Gruen
me the right way, you know,

426
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:07,220
by rounds and everything else.
And I know just jumping from six to eight,

427
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,320
the difference in that,
you know,

428
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,280
let alone being a kid and you're going
into your second pro fight and you're

429
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:16,160
fighting a 12 round fight.
So if he lost that fight,

430
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:18,350
which he came back and he
made it a really close fight,

431
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,040
I would have to tip my hat to him just
on the fact that he was able to go 12

432
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:26,300
rounds, you know, um, people take
a lot away from, from that fighter.

433
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,810
What he accomplished is something
that not many can do. Well,

434
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:34,040
it's crazy mean he had a
second protitle at what,

435
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,750
how many fights in the second fight was
for the role title that he wanted to

436
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:41,870
roll side on his dirt profile.
Yeah, that's insane. And then,

437
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:46,260
but he's had more than one per
world title, right? Yes. He,

438
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,140
he's won a could three different ways

439
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,250
classes, but his second one was something
insane. Some insanely short seat.

440
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,870
Pull up his record. Yeah. I believe
Tom Bradley. I looked at the source.

441
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:56,851
What's that?

442
00:24:56,851 --> 00:25:00,470
It says his first fight was for the
international featherweight title that was

443
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,970
against Salito Ramirez. He said, Oh,

444
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,930
you lost against Lido for the vacant
Wbo featherweight title. Oh, okay.

445
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:11,450
So what was the first title? International
featherweight title. Wbo Yeah,

446
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,220
that's not a real, that's not
like a world title. This is,

447
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,270
they have a bunch of weird titles,
right? Like international title,

448
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,320
continental title. You're
assaulting me. I had to do an IPO.

449
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,340
I had to deal with the world champion.
But you had all of it. You are unified.

450
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:30,740
I should have been by all rights. But
Taylor vacated to Oh, that's right.

451
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,950
But he, you know, that's why I get
mad. And that's another big argument.

452
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,800
And boxing how you break
that down between the lineal,

453
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,280
the lineal and a unanimous, you
know, I had to ring the Wbo scroll,

454
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,850
Scroll up. So you see his homework.
So what was his, uh, okay.

455
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:51,851
So his second world title was
when routined retained one.

456
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,020
Okay. One, two, three,
four, five, six flights in.

457
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,210
He's in his second. He's um, he, that's
when he, he, he wins his second title.

458
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:05,240
Six fights in each one's a junior
lightweight title. That's insane.

459
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,080
The International, okay. That wasn't the
first one. Wasn't a world title fight.

460
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,370
It was the right with the second one
was the Wbo world title fight 11 fights.

461
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,750
Any wins is third world title.

462
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:19,280
What in the fuck I believe now there
was at one point it was seven rural

463
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:23,150
champions and just that short period of
fights, I believe it's around eight now,

464
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,910
eight real champions,
these flat and just that short period,

465
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,370
a three different weight classes.

466
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,270
I think when he fought were gone d out,

467
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,300
you really got a chance to see
how he handles a real world class,

468
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,010
you know,
Cuban amateur system trained top of

469
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,390
the food chain boxer and he
just put it to that dude.

470
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,370
That was the fight that I actually
really sold me on [inaudible] because I

471
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:57,120
thought for a fact that that was going
to be a chess match because of the boxing

472
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:01,350
ability from rigging dollar. Their styles
were very similar and I thought that,

473
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:01,981
you know,
I was like,

474
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,530
it's going to be a boring fight
for the first like four rounds,

475
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:07,590
which I still would have liked because
I like watching that type of fights,

476
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:12,480
you know? And um, I see. I go in there
and I'm expecting this fight, you know,

477
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,430
the,
the amateur background of both guys,

478
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,150
the how talented the guys are
in a skill level of both guys.

479
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,050
And then mixing, I know I'm two or
three rounds into it and I'm going,

480
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,640
he's playing what? We're no playing
with them. I'm going to hell.

481
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,640
That's the fight that really sold me
on Loma Chanko that he's that good.

482
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,540
My Man Vinny pass the ends are called
that not Vinny Pazienza, the boxer,

483
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:37,590
Vinnie pads, the rapper, this guy, Jedi
mind tricks he called and he was taking,

484
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,330
he was taking bets on Instagram.
Jeez. He called it that early too.

485
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,330
He was taking bets on Instagram. You
think [inaudible] has anything for him?

486
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,120
He's like five, 5 million, the
DMS. And he goes, let's bet. Yup.

487
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,910
I uh,
I took Loma Chanko and that flight,

488
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:56,850
but I thought it was going to be a
close fight, a really close fight.

489
00:27:56,851 --> 00:28:00,190
And I thought Loma Chanko was going to
pull ahead in the later rounds, you know,

490
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:02,730
and when that fight.
So that's why I really surprised me.

491
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,030
It was a stunning display of talent.
He such a weird guy too because uh,

492
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,570
his background,
you know,

493
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:13,530
the store where his father took him out
of boxing and made him do traditional

494
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:18,531
Russian dancing for several years and
just made him learn that for footwork.

495
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,580
It seems like his dad was just a
mastermind architect of a champion. Yeah.

496
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,370
You would probably know more than this.
The Nub would,

497
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,830
didn't he also have a more
short background? I heard, uh,

498
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,790
he definitely can do martial
arts techniques. I've seen
it, but I don't know what

499
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,120
background maybe, I don't
know. That makes sense. He's a,

500
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,500
his foot work though is so extraordinary
and if that really is that dancing

501
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:47,220
background, like learning the,
the footwork and the, the way he,

502
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:50,700
he's so agile with the stepping
of his feet. It's like,

503
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:53,570
I think a lot of people are going
to learn and mirror that. Yeah.

504
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,110
His training regimen is pretty brutal.
Also, I got a buddy, a Roger Romo, um,

505
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,610
good friend of mine.
He's actually,

506
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:02,460
he was working for a little while
there up until the last fight.

507
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:05,190
He was a strength and conditioning
coach would Cecilio Flores,

508
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,750
who was mine when I was an
Ochsner training and they
said it was just crazy that

509
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,730
the hours that he puts in,
how he trains,

510
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:15,040
how hard he trains and some of the
journals study does. You know, I,

511
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,270
I'm looking at them and going,
I could use these, not for me,

512
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,290
but I could use them for somebody
athletes that I got now. Yeah. He's, um,

513
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,400
he's definitely something special and you
know, you get those guys and it's just,

514
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,060
it's kind of ashamed that he's a
little too small for Terrence Crawford,

515
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,630
you know? I mean, I really would
love to see those two fight,

516
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,760
but it seems like Crawford just a
little bit too heavy for him. I agree.

517
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:42,150
But that's uh, you know, and that's
another touchy subject because I kind

518
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,990
of agree with you,
but I also go back,

519
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,140
cause I'm always trying to
really break down and nitpick.

520
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,950
I look at guys like Manny
Pacquiao [inaudible] who was it,

521
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:54,640
who came from I believe one
12 or something like that,

522
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:58,840
and went up all the way to
junior middleweight, which
is crazy. Yeah, he's small.

523
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:02,350
Shorter than than Lowman Shanker.
Yeah. And other than his calves.

524
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,340
And I don't think anything else was much
bigger than Lowman Chanko on his body

525
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,000
and he was able to do it. And what
the fuck is going on with his calves?

526
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,410
I don't know. It's like he's keeping Hams
in them. I don't know what he does. I,

527
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,700
you know, I wish I knew to secret
today cause I could use it.

528
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,810
So get that secret to Jon Jones article
says that his mother was actually a

529
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:23,740
martial arts, still is a martial
artist. Oh, interesting. Hmm. Gymnast.

530
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:25,420
The martial artist.
Well it makes sense.

531
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,160
Yeah. Man. Foot work the way he does
it. It's just, it's something to watch,

532
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,370
man. It's just the, the,

533
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,420
the ability to do move and also to
anticipate the other fighters movements.

534
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:39,950
It's like,
especially earlier in his career,

535
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,890
it's like he was fighting guys that just,
they seemed so

536
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,490
crude in comparison to his approach.

537
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,380
He knows even more crazy about it as
being the opponent because usually you go

538
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,150
into a fight and you break
down film and you're,

539
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:55,630
you're going over to film and you got
a good idea of what he does, right.

540
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,830
What he does wrong and,

541
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,790
and what you might have to do launch
Chanko it's hard to pick up where he's

542
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:04,300
going to go. He'd be different angles.
So you can't, you can't go well,

543
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:06,280
you know what?
After he throws the right hand,

544
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,480
he likes to move over to the left because
he does at one time and then the next

545
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:13,570
time he's totally something we're
opposite. You know what I mean? And yeah,

546
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,680
the angles, it's really almost impossible
to break film down on them. You know,

547
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,990
like this last fight with just per draws,
everybody's going.

548
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,490
That was the blueprint. No, no, no.
It wasn't. So, you know, he, uh,

549
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,640
interstate and it was a close to fight
then, you know, people expect expected.

550
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:30,940
I go, why? Because he finally got hit
with more than 11 punches in a fight. Oh,

551
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:34,330
that's him doing some,
uh, I'd be like, yeah,

552
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,060
he says trained it when he
was a younger Greco Roman.

553
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,590
Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's slamming
kids. That's right. Well,

554
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:42,424
you know what man,

555
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,660
I believe in cross training and I think
that there's certainly some skills that

556
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:50,110
would make you better at
different martial arts. And uh,

557
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,040
I feel like if you have the
ability to wrestle guys and,

558
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:58,330
and move guys' bodies around like that
you would get from something like samba.

559
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,890
I just feel like as a an elite boxer,
having that extra strength,

560
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:06,910
that extra ability to move your core that
way, I think that would be beneficial.

561
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,750
Yeah.

562
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,700
I mean the thing is no worldclass boxer
has the time to also be doing judo and

563
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:15,040
also be doing wrestling.
You just don't have the time.

564
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,520
Nope. And then being in combat
sports, even, I know that as far as,

565
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,820
I'm not involved in MMA, but I
know that, you know, these guys,

566
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,480
they have a perfect three or four as
much time in a short period of time.

567
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,820
You know, I imagine, I think Matt was
telling me you would know more. Like,

568
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:34,800
sometimes it's two days of
one, two days of the next. Um,

569
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,720
trying to fit that in.
Yeah, it's hard. You cannot,

570
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,190
especially in boxing the sweet science

571
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,130
where it's just hands, but you got
people, that's all he do all day long.

572
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,860
That's why I say it's so unfair when
an MMA guy goes in fights of Mayweather

573
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,250
because Mayweather,

574
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,850
he perfected that and you gotta
use just that style of boxing.

575
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,260
It's going to be almost impossible to
beat a boxer, a rural champion boxer.

576
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,530
Did you watch the new year's fight,
that thing that he did with the attention?

577
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,160
Yes. You Cower. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of
people think that was a fixed fight.

578
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,870
I think that was 120 pound fighter
fighting the best ever. Yeah.

579
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,720
I mean it's just,
it wasn't a fixed fight.

580
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,740
I don't know why people think it's a fixed
fight. That guy fights it 126 pounds,

581
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:17,630
I think. Yeah. I think
that's his weight class.

582
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,550
And you could definitely
tell the size difference.

583
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,390
Just like I could actually tell the size
difference stolen McGregor fight, Floyd,

584
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:27,230
you know, I think uh, both of his
legs equal to one of Mcgregor's,

585
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,210
but yeah, that tension, that fight
the first knocked down was legit.

586
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,260
And I think, my personal
opinion, what happened, it wasn't
fixed, you know, are fake.

587
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,320
I believe that he got hit with that right
hand and it seemed that how strong and

588
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,420
how to deep fence the skills that a
Mayweather had. And I think he said,

589
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,310
you know what,
this could be a long ass night.

590
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,420
And then the next couple of punches he
just kinda like went down because he seen

591
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:53,600
what could happen. He knew which way
that flight was going. Really? Yeah.

592
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,290
That's what you think. I do the first
knock down. Let's put play that fight,

593
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,180
see if you can find the fight and play it.

594
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,630
I feel like the first one
clipped him on the temple.

595
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,240
He hit him with a left hook on the temple,
hit him with a right hand,

596
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,070
but then he hit him with a left hook,
the right hand,

597
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,430
and then he hit him afterwards
as well as he's going down.

598
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,430
But I think that left hand the temple is
what did the real damage. And then, um,

599
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,990
then there was a big right hand
afterwards that dropped him.

600
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,010
I just think he was out of his league.
He's that way, way out of his league.

601
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,590
Not that he took a dive,
but almost to the point of like,

602
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:28,250
he knew that that fight was not going
any way. The way that he thought it was.

603
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,390
I mean, he looks, he was so smiley and
relaxed. It was kind of funny. You know,

604
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:35,180
he just sort of walk the dude down.

605
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:37,550
He had a big old smile and it tastes
like when they get them smiling.

606
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,780
What was the last time you saw us? And
he's so much bigger than this kid, right?

607
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah. He's fighting like it's
a joke. Like, look at him.

608
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,590
He's so much bigger than this kid.

609
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,720
What's really funny is if they let this
kid kick, he would fuck Floyd up. Yeah.

610
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,840
I feel that I'm Katie Floyd
made it look so dominant.

611
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,880
I didn't even know on that part.
But then again, that kid, his kicks,

612
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,290
that kid would've kicked Floyd's legs
out from under them in seconds. Oh wait,

613
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:05,180
you went too far there. See He,
he got up right there. Boom. See?

614
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:08,540
He hit him with a left hook
and he stumbled and then
he hit him with the right

615
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:12,560
hand behind it. And I just think
he's too little. He's just a,

616
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,880
he's a very small guy and for
him and Floyd's not a big guy.

617
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,830
This kid is tiny.
I mean,

618
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,840
I think he's fought as light as 121
pounds and I think sometimes he fights it

619
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:27,950
like one 26 yeah, I think he could
see right there, right there.

620
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,520
Sometimes it'll fight.
A lot of times in a fight,

621
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,840
the whole issue is you get hit with that
and you're fighting and somebody taps

622
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:39,000
you with a certain punch. Your brain.
You'll be surprised how fast it works,

623
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,710
you know, and all the things that go
through it at mind. Boom. That was yep.

624
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,490
And I think at that, that moment
right there, he just knew going in,

625
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:50,940
you can fill just when somebody hits you
on the arm or the shoulder, you know,

626
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,270
the how, how punch power
they have. And uh, yeah,

627
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,590
I think he's just trying to, after that
he knew I was going to be a long night.

628
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:02,340
So crazy. They paid him $9
million for this. It must be nice

629
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:08,550
that, yeah. I mean fuck, there was
a lot of people I seen going, uh,

630
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,380
he deserves to give somebody whose
prospects a a chance now, you know,

631
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,570
he should be fighting these guys instead
of doing this, these guys ain't boxers,

632
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:21,320
blah, blah, blah, blah. And my take
on that also is the man went 40,

633
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,920
49, 50 and older. He fought
almost everybody in the sport.

634
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:27,240
And even if you want to say
that they were past her prime,

635
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,620
some of them may have been a little bit,
he's still willing to earn,

636
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,690
dominated them and beat them.
Yeah. This guy, in my opinion,

637
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,720
if he wanted to fight
defensive backs from the NFL,

638
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,320
he has all the right and the roller. I
don't think that he owes a sport anything.

639
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,510
I think actually it's
the other way around.

640
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,120
The amount of money that he
has brought to the sport,

641
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,620
the attention that he brought to it.

642
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,090
So if he wants to go around and duty
side shows, let them, you know, I mean,

643
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:53,760
what do you want him to do?
Fight prospects until he's 51 years old.

644
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,610
I couldn't agree more. I
couldn't agree more. It's crazy.

645
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:59,210
The idea that they want to
see him sacrificed. Yeah.

646
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,200
They want to see him get beat.
That's what they want.

647
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:05,130
They want to see him finally fight someone
who's younger and faster, hungrier,

648
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,490
who was more active. And what
will happen was that he will lose.

649
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,560
And I think maybe what a
smarter than that, you know,

650
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,480
he wants to go out and keep that his
status and, and the, and the, the,

651
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,430
the record that he built up in that
resume that he has and go out like that,

652
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,190
you know? Well, they're talking about him
fighting Khabib number. Good amount off.

653
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,180
Who's the UFC 155 pound champion. But
it can be, it's not really a boxer.

654
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:32,220
I just want to say it. But boxing rules.
Yeah, he that would be same thing. Yeah.

655
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,340
It could be was a take down
ground type guy. Exactly.

656
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:37,380
It'd be the same kind of
fight as the Conor fight.

657
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,820
The only difference is I don't think
could be get as tired as Connor would. No,

658
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:44,490
I don't, I don't think, uh, he's,
he's definitely got better endurance.

659
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,220
I think one of the only
few in there right now.

660
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:51,480
That would be a good flight would be one
of the Diaz brothers as far as striking

661
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:54,040
down. Be Interesting. But they
would, he would box her face off.

662
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,780
I still think that he would win that,
but I'm just saying as far as you know,

663
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:00,990
stand up and letting the hands go.
I think those are one of the,

664
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,930
one of the two better ones in the MMA.
Yeah.

665
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,520
I mean he's got all
the right in the world.

666
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,900
Just keep fine freak shows to have fun,
man.

667
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,640
The only thing is, you know, a
father time shows up, you know,

668
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:18,870
he's getting to that age where you
might get one of them guys. And so,

669
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,610
I mean if he's having a fun do it.

670
00:38:20,611 --> 00:38:22,360
But if you go and get
beat by one of them guys,

671
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:24,630
that could change the whole
outlook of a career. Well,

672
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:27,810
it's interesting how guys who
are really good defensively,

673
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,490
they're not just really good longer
because they have such good technique,

674
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:36,160
but also they've taken less damaged during
their career so they're more durable

675
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,980
as they get older as well. Like you've
definitely saw that with Bernard,

676
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,860
like Bernard up until
the Joe Smith fight me,

677
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,900
Joe Smith was the first
guy to really put it on.

678
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:46,650
I'm like that and knock them out of
the ring. And it was hard to see.

679
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,590
It was hard to see that they,

680
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,670
they had that ring set up to where he
fell and landed on his fucking head like

681
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,030
Jesus Christ. You know? I don't
know if there was so much to ring.

682
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:58,450
I just think it was an awkward way
that he went out of the ropes in a way

683
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,030
because he got hurt by
that punch. Yeah. So,

684
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:04,660
and the legs buckled and when
the legs buckle like that,

685
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:08,390
they could put him in an awkward
position for him to slide out. You know,

686
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,890
his ass was headed out and then you get
clipped again and went right through.

687
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,630
But I mean, it just sucks that there's
nothing to protect the fighters.

688
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,840
If they fall out like that.
There's no padding. There's
no, no tables, no nothing,

689
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:21,460
nothing to break your fall.
No one,

690
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:24,350
therefore it just got to hope
one of the ringside judges are,

691
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,950
or commentators are there too.
That's crazy.

692
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:31,840
And you got guys that are 80 years old
trying to push a 200 pound man back in

693
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:34,360
the ring. Yeah. They're not going to
get clipped like that and wanting to,

694
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,290
somebody's fallen on them.
Um,

695
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,790
but Bernard was able to keep
his skill very late in life.

696
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,650
I mean deep into his forties, almost
a 50 years old was still world class,

697
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:47,410
which is really crazy. I had is, uh,

698
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,610
you got a handful of guys out there
that could do that and to be honest,

699
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:51,941
you know,

700
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:55,810
but he kept himself in good shape in
between fights and he did what he was

701
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:59,140
supposed to do. And some guys, you
know, you get some guys out there,

702
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,060
a good friend of mine, my trainer
Robert Garcia, retired at 29, um, uh,

703
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:08,440
Youngstown guy, man. See, he retired young
and came back a couple of years later,

704
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,920
but it was totally for one flight.
Um,

705
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,840
who did Mancy any come back against
Greg Haugen. Oh, that's right.

706
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,610
I forgot about that. Fine. Yup.
And uh, some of them, you know,

707
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,120
some guys they go in and do it and it's,

708
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:25,840
it's fun and then it becomes a career,
a job and financial security.

709
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,090
You know, the way Pete, a
lot of fighters look at it.

710
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,070
And then you get some guys like
Floyd, Mandy Pack, Yell, uh,

711
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:36,670
Bernard Hopkins who just loved the sport,
you know that much that does.

712
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,530
They don't know anything
else outside of it.

713
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,870
So what was it like fighting Bernard
who,

714
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,640
you know,

715
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,640
and I don't know if this is the stage
stage I want to fighting Bernard was,

716
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:53,950
it was, it was, um, totally different
than what I expected. What'd you expect?

717
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,280
I expect him to be tricky and sneaky
and just a very crafty and obviously

718
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,160
experienced.
Um,

719
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,720
I did jump up two weight classes
to take that fight and um,

720
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,540
but at the same time,

721
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,780
that was not an 80% Kelly public.
And this is true and this is documented.

722
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,170
Um, I have it on my phone and I was
going to actually bring that out.

723
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:25,171
But that flight I sparred three times
for that maybe for the time was with an

724
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:29,800
arm brace and then went into it and I'd
never said anything cause I'm the type

725
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:32,830
person, I don't want to have people
think that was making excuses.

726
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,160
I love Bernard and I think

727
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,430
he's, uh, one of the greatest of
all time, greatest middleweights.

728
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,700
But that was not that night. You know, I
came down, we had wrong what was right.

729
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:46,130
I had bronchitis, I was
sick, I was running a temp
actually in the locker room.

730
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,380
We had to go through what the commission,
um,

731
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,590
we almost took the inhaler for it.

732
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,090
Then we found out through the commission
that you cannot take that cause it's

733
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,930
steroid. So we had to go to the
nasal, um, or not nasal to the pill.

734
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,320
Oral pill. Uh, we had
an in the locker room.

735
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,330
I don't know if you ever heard of
a Guy Thomas houser. He writes you,

736
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,080
he used to write from New York Times.
He does a lot of big box and books.

737
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:14,210
He was an urn and houser don't, uh,
he's not one side. What's anybody?

738
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,800
He's Bryce. What? He knows what he
sees and that's the truth. And um,

739
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,720
he was in there when
the commission came in.

740
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,100
They were going through my prescription,
you know, they were taking a temperature,

741
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,070
uh, giving me the exam.
And that's what happened.

742
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:32,330
How it was a look Dardick
fight with, uh, of all people.

743
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:37,310
What was wrong with your arm? You,
you [inaudible] bursitis, societies,

744
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,370
bursitis in your elbow. And you know,
that came into an issue and we smart.

745
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:43,940
We know, like I said, it was a handful.
It might've been more than three or four,

746
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:47,360
but it wasn't a lot because usually in
training camp you do it three days a week

747
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,770
for about eight week camp for about six,
six and a half weeks.

748
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,490
And it was because of your album that
you couldn't spar. Yeah. You know,

749
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,550
cause he didn't want to keep hitting it.

750
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:57,650
And then I didn't like just the way I am.

751
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,490
I didn't like having a
brace on it or nothing. Um,

752
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,040
so that was an issue and there was a lot
of things that sometimes if you could

753
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,990
go back and you wish you
could do it over again,

754
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,880
but there was a lot of other things going
on. Why we didn't postpone the fight.

755
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,320
First of all is sold out and uh,
the Youngstown people bottle or tickets,

756
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,570
um, we had the issue with
Depaul Williams fight, you know,

757
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,010
that fell through. So I can't, I
just came off light and Gary Lockett,

758
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,540
who was really not of all
known name a household name.

759
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,940
So if I would to postpone that fight,

760
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,680
the backlash on that would have
been bad man. And you know,

761
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,360
so it was more the ego thing I think,

762
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,600
and worried about what
everybody was going to think,

763
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,970
taking nothing away at all from,

764
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,110
and that's where I wanted to tap into
taking nothing away from Bernard Hopkins

765
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:53,410
unfortunately against a guy like Bernard
Hopkins that had to have that happen to

766
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:57,770
me is what socks. And, and he
was a tremendous fighter. I mean,

767
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,650
he did things in there.

768
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,150
A lot of times I've seen him making
moves that I knew what he was doing and I

769
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:06,440
just couldn't pull the trigger on it.
Um, and he was fast and he was strong.

770
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:11,150
And then there was times that he just did
some crafty things also that, you know,

771
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:14,750
got to me and his body work in
that fight slowed me down a lot.

772
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,130
But it was just one of them fights where
I could honestly say that that was not

773
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:23,150
an 80% Kelly Pollick. And that could
be honest and say if I was 100%,

774
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,540
I don't know if I would have won that
fight. And I'll be honest about it.

775
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,970
I'm not going to be the guy that's,
that comes in and says, well,

776
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:33,000
if I was 100% I would have knocked him
out. No, it's Bernard Hopkins. You know,

777
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,510
when you think about your legacy and you
think about looking back at your career,

778
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,560
those kinds of fights where you had to
take it when you were compromised, um,

779
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,740
how do those factor in to do
those fuck with your head?

780
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,580
Hmm. Yeah, that liberal bad way,
right? But enough where you like, ah,

781
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,490
if I was 100%, yeah. You know,

782
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:55,090
I got invited to the international boxing
hall of fame over to summer and it was

783
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:59,140
cool as hell and to be there and you
start seeing the inductees and everything

784
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:02,770
and I start, you start breaking
down your career. Like, am I,

785
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,460
am I able to qualify for
this? You know, and it's so,

786
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:10,750
so going to get pissed off who didn't
get in because I got in and I look at it

787
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,310
and I break it down a couple of ways.

788
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:16,720
I say 40 and two with 34
knockouts is a hell of a record.

789
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,230
You know, I held the belts
for over three years. Um,

790
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:26,080
I'd be a handful of guys that were
legit when I beat them. And then I,

791
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:30,400
then I look at the fight though I
fought Bernard Hopkins and I got my ass

792
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:33,610
whooped in fight and there was no other
way of putting it, you know, the truth.

793
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,030
So how much did that damage? You know, uh,

794
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,870
people remembering that nobody looks at
the fact of the two way class jump and

795
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:45,310
they call him back down and defending
against a very game. Antonio Rubio.

796
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,880
And then of course the Martinez fight,
which a lot of people,

797
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:53,290
and it was documented and, and on
Hbo with the commentators, you know,

798
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:57,270
the weight issue in that fight. But what
was the way it is from that? Fine. Oh,

799
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,370
so how we had to get done. That was my
last fight. At middle weight, you know,

800
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:05,120
trying to cut the weight. I was 29 at
the time and another great fighter. I,

801
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,420
it happened, it was tough
with the weight. Um,

802
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,910
I really can't use that as an excuse
though, cause I don't know. But you know,

803
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,970
I know I was doing good in the
ninth round. I did hit a wall.

804
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,270
A lot of people would try to use the
cut and I think even without the cut,

805
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,030
the same result would have
happened. Now, you know,

806
00:46:19,031 --> 00:46:21,250
he would have boxed my ears
off the last four rounds.

807
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,590
It was just one of them things that
there's nothing you could do. So when I,

808
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,140
when I have some up my career,
I look at those fights and I,

809
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:32,080
and I know personally that
it could have been different,

810
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,000
but at the same time I'm very happy and
content with the way my career went.

811
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,680
You know, I was 40 and two, um, my last
four or five, I won my last four fights,

812
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,440
you know, before I retire. So
I went out winning, um, and,

813
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:49,650
and I was done with the
sport. I truly was. And so I,

814
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:53,650
I think right now I'm, I'm kind of content
and happy with my career. Of course.

815
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:56,860
I think anybody says could've been
better and I wish it was better.

816
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,250
It may be a little bit, but I'm not going
to have ever beat myself up over it.

817
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,730
Well, it's just one of those
things where you, when you,

818
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:06,840
when you look back and you think of all
the great things that you did accomplish,

819
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:09,120
then you realize that
you're retired at 30. Yeah.

820
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,640
So much so much room there,
you know, thirties so young.

821
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,740
You're in your athletic prime.
They, I think they say 32
for professional fighter.

822
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:22,140
They consider most athletic primes at 32

823
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,220
there was, but you know, uh, I look back
on it and again, you know, the 42 fights,

824
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:30,340
that's a lot of fights. Um, plus I
started when I was nine and a half,

825
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:34,360
a little over a hundred amateur fights
during, there was a lot. What that,

826
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:38,050
I mean for a while there'd
be a while before I retired,
I was throwing it around,

827
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:43,090
you know, retiring. I was one of them
guys that just, I liked it and I loved it,

828
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:46,280
but I also sometimes got tired of it.
You know,

829
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,330
I'm a very simple guy
and, and uh, it don't,

830
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,970
I don't care about the Glam
or to fame or any of that.

831
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:57,830
I truly don't, you know,
like even now what my,

832
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,140
my podcast and what I'm doing with some
of these other adventures because I got

833
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:05,980
bored and I'm on to have fun. Right. You
know what I mean? And keep myself busy.

834
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,380
And,
um,

835
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,890
I've been fortunate to have what I have
to be able to do all this on my own,

836
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,850
you know, and go out there and
be around everybody. But yeah.

837
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,020
So when I was fighting,
you know,

838
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:19,630
there was a lot of rumors around
up to retirement, this, that,

839
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,400
and I think the final icing on a cake
was we were supposed to fight Andre Ward

840
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,830
and that's when Andre Ward ended up
getting a shoulder surgery and I fight,

841
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:30,664
fell through.

842
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,900
And I've been out in California training
or an Ochsner trainer for almost a year,

843
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,770
which most fighters leave at the
beginning of their career. You know,

844
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:40,900
when they don't have a family,
when they're not making the money,

845
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,300
that's our opportunity to
try and go and make money,

846
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,360
not when you're 12 years
into it, you know. And uh,

847
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,910
so I went out there and that kind of
took a little bit from here as far as the

848
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:55,540
sport, even though I loved it and it was
great training with, uh, Robert Garcia.

849
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,380
I learned so much that I think I could
learn at that state point in my career.

850
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,810
And not that Andre Ward fight fell
through. Um, I was, I was done. I mean,

851
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:08,600
I was, I rolled over, I never forget,
I rolled over, told my wife, I said,

852
00:49:08,601 --> 00:49:11,830
I think I'm done. And she goes, what
are you talking about? And as an,

853
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:12,790
I think I'm retiring.

854
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,920
And she started crying tears
of joy because she wanted
me to be done even before

855
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:22,720
that. She don't know to sport or
but what prime ages or not. And, uh,

856
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,470
I hung them up and, and you know,
over the years as we talked earlier,

857
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,650
Herron who I would get the Itch,
you know,

858
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,590
and that could have been just going to
the gym and Aetna are doing around on the

859
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:37,150
pads, but I just didn't ever want it
to keep doing it. You know, my health,

860
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:40,990
believe it or not is more
important than anything else.

861
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,900
Well that is something that
every fighter has to consider.

862
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:46,270
Like when have they fought too much?
Yeah.

863
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,330
How do you make that
decision when your heart,

864
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,030
when you lose it in here
and that hard a little bit.

865
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,720
It's a horrible hobby to have, especially
at that high of a level. You know,

866
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,880
cause you're not fighting guys that are
getting off work at three o'clock and

867
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,360
you know,

868
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,360
you're fighting guys that are legit
athletes and skilled professionals that

869
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:11,140
fighting and um, it's dangerous.
Unfortunately, we've seen,

870
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,460
and no one we're talking about this,
uh, with me getting the itch earlier,

871
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,100
there's a lot of things I take
in consideration. Like, I'm,

872
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:22,440
I'm really intuit and I'm really debating
on it and I'm hitting the gym work in

873
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:27,040
boxing. Did I see things like this? A
Donna Stevenson situation, you know,

874
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:27,980
and those are the

875
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,850
things where I say,

876
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:32,080
I got to sit back and talk to explain
to people what happened. He just,

877
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,270
he got hit and it was a good fight.
He's been fighting for years now.

878
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:37,970
One of the most feared
fighters also in boxing.

879
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,500
He fought the guy we were
talking about earlier. Yeah. Uh,

880
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,400
I can't pronounce his name.
Um, I don't want to chop it up.

881
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,830
Pull up the Russian gentleman's name.
We, yeah, there's a way to say it.

882
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:54,120
It's a, uh, better be, but

883
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,650
I see them all at Donna Stevenson.

884
00:50:58,810 --> 00:50:59,643
Okay.

885
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,660
It's rushing cats. I have some crazy ass
news, man. They do. I know. It's hard.

886
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,360
You know,

887
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,370
me being a guy involved in a sport and
talking about it all the time to how hard

888
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:14,840
it is for me. Yeah. To get
it down. There's so many
bad ass Russians these days.

889
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:19,550
Okay. It's who Bostic. Yeah, it's GV. Oh,

890
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:22,520
z. D y. K. But it's vas. Dick,

891
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,780
you don't pronounce the G Wozniak.
He sent me these two men.

892
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,550
He's a beast. So in that fight again,

893
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,880
Donna Stevenson is a brutal puncher,
devastating knockout puncher.

894
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,340
He's been fighting all
these years now also.

895
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,760
And this is the part that's the
scary one on one, right? 41. Yes.

896
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:42,950
And that's another situation or you know,

897
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:47,420
factor factor where you might want to
say, Hey, I'm done. Right. You know,

898
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:50,810
even before this happened, unfortunately
had to get to this point. But uh,

899
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,890
he's in there and it's a fairly
decent fight from what I was watching.

900
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,150
And next thing you know,

901
00:51:56,151 --> 00:52:01,151
he goes down at fights over and he
dropped Fonzie kids at some point in the

902
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:06,140
fight. He did. Yeah. And He,
uh, next thing you know, he
ends up in a coma, you know,

903
00:52:06,141 --> 00:52:09,980
fighting for his life to the sport.
You never know.

904
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:11,240
That's the scary thing about it.
You know,

905
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:14,450
you could get injured two weeks
before the flight, the sparring,

906
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,960
and have a little bleed that you
would ever, no, no, no signs of it.

907
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:22,720
And then the next thing you're,
you're in a coma. Yeah. Well,

908
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:26,510
I know that that really fucked up
Roy Jones Jr when Gerald Mcclellan,

909
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,220
who was his arch rival,
you know,

910
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:31,370
this was the guy that they thought one
day he was going to fight when McAllen

911
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:35,000
was killing it at light heavyweight
and Roy was 168 pound champion.

912
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,300
And then you know,
to see mccloughan now you know,

913
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:41,900
people who don't remember man
McClellan was a fucking destroyer.

914
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,900
He was so God damn scary and so good
and he hits so hard and he was the guy

915
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:51,020
that, you know, Amusa
Cronk fighter, you know,

916
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:54,950
in the vein of Tommy Hearns and all those
other great Cronk fighters and people

917
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:57,470
looked at him like, man, one day
that's going to be the fight.

918
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,080
Him and Roy Jones Jr was almost
like it was inevitable. Yeah.

919
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,350
It was like Canelo and triple
j or something. I know,

920
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,900
cause everybody does the fantasy matchups
and they asked me if I Pavlik Verse

921
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,970
Michaela and I'm going,
what are you guys trying to do to me?

922
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,760
I don't want it that fight. You know
what I mean? Cause he did it that hard.

923
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:13,400
He was a brutal guy.
Yeah.

924
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:17,690
And then to see him when he
fought Nigel Benn, same situation,

925
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:18,680
lapse into that coma.

926
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:21,700
We don't know how a dynasty Woodson
is going to come out of this, but um,

927
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,460
a lot of times when a guy does
have a brain injury like that,

928
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:29,300
like they're never the same again.
Yup. That's what I was saying.

929
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,010
I like it could have happened that could
have been something two weeks earlier

930
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:37,020
that was never detected or signs
of it. So it's scary. It is.

931
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,740
Um, so you take that into consideration,
but you also have that itch. Yeah.

932
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,820
You know, and again, I, I'm 36, um,

933
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,630
is is something that again,

934
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,700
it's going to be a process of sitting
down and discussing, you know,

935
00:53:49,701 --> 00:53:50,140
what he's going to,

936
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:55,140
would you say you like 60% considering
finding again maybe a little more right

937
00:53:55,981 --> 00:54:00,180
now? No, no, no. Ooh, I know.

938
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,430
Um, do you ever like go back and watch
like highlight reels and then you start

939
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,760
shadowbox and again,
itchy and really start thinking around it.

940
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,680
And it's weird because I'm in my gym and,

941
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,630
and there was people lifting
weights and I'm in the back.

942
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:14,190
I got a couple of bags
back there. And, um,

943
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,680
you start hearing the bags
popping in and everybody,

944
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,820
they're not used to seeing it,

945
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,850
so everybody gets curious and they
come back and you see them like peeking

946
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:23,970
around the corner and watching me
hit the bag and then I get a little

947
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:26,010
embarrassed. I'm like, all right.
You know what? I'm just gonna,

948
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,360
I'm gonna Chill with it right now.
So, yeah, it's a, it's fun. It is.

949
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,830
It's a thought again and
we'll, we'll see. But the,

950
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:39,630
a lot of that plays in my mind because
the one thing is it becomes very selfish

951
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:42,770
to, at a point, I got two
young kids at home, you know,

952
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:47,490
that's going to be 13 and 10.
They're involved in sports
and a lot of activities.

953
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,310
They love me being around for it.
And it don't take me half an a fighter.

954
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:55,800
You sick, right. For something to
happen. You know what I mean? Um,

955
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:01,200
but we'll, we'll toss it around and
we'll, we'll see how that goes. Yeah,

956
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,750
that's, um, that's a big consideration.

957
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:05,640
There's a lot of things to
factor in on that. Well,

958
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:10,440
especially because you are busy now. And
so what made you decide to do a podcast?

959
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,920
Actually, I was excited when I heard
you were doing that and I was like,

960
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:17,550
all right. Yeah, you get into the podcast
where I am, I'm looking at, you know,

961
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:21,420
I hear some of these guys,
uh, commentating and I say,
I think I could do that.

962
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:22,560
Yeah,
you could do that.

963
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:27,270
After listening and the podcast we're
kind of throwing around. Um, I had,

964
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:27,661
like I said,

965
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:32,100
I got a handful of investments going on
and I pick and choose on what I want to

966
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:35,910
do and the podcast started
off, uh, hey, let's have fun.

967
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,300
Let's throw this podcast on.
We'll get some cheap equipment.

968
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,090
We know got a lot of
followers on social media,

969
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:45,210
so we'll do like the social media live
and then we'll also hook it to the

970
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:49,000
youtube and we're doing it. And it
started off for a little wilder. Um,

971
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,750
but no advertisement,
it was kind of lonely.

972
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,460
You know,
you're going,

973
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:59,400
if you feel like I'm talking into a mic
and nobody's there and then it started

974
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:03,080
taking it, it's doing fairly well right
now. It's how many downloads again, man,

975
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,110
I'm right now the social media is
the biggest. We ended up pitting.

976
00:56:07,111 --> 00:56:09,840
It reaches out after the first episode,

977
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:15,740
you got 2000 people were reached and
maybe like 400 views and then as the days

978
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,420
go on and to share his go on,

979
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:22,350
you started seeing it reaches out to
over like 27,000 people and then you see,

980
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,070
you know, uh, 8,000 views.
So in, so on social media,

981
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,120
Youtube is the one I'm working for,
you know, really trying to push.

982
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:35,800
And right now sometimes we get up 113
views on there and then sometimes I don't

983
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:39,040
even want to mention how many
dudes are on it. Uh, so again,

984
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,790
it's a process with that. Also, I know
that I'm starting to learn that. Um,

985
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,610
it's about consistency. That's the
most important thing. But I get,

986
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:48,530
I get out to these fights and
people will know, you know who,

987
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,040
who don't comment on a show
because we do it words.

988
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,090
It's live to format of it is to have
everybody involved cause they liked that.

989
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:58,900
They get ask questions and we're pretty
much faces on the phone and reading the

990
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,510
questions and answering it.
And I think they liked that.

991
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:04,210
And actually it's kind of funny because
we'll get some great guests on there.

992
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:07,360
We had Tj Dillashaw,
we had Mikey Garcia,

993
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:10,060
Terrence Crawford on how did you get out?

994
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,990
I think you could bring back Joe Lewis
and put them on there and people don't

995
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:17,440
care about that. They want their
questions answered, you know,

996
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:21,760
through social media or through youtube
and they kind of don't interact with the

997
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:24,880
guests that you have one. So it's,
it's weird. Um, I think the format,

998
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:26,050
I liked the format of it,

999
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,370
but at the same time I wish people would
be more involved with the guests that

1000
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,910
we have one. But for the most
part it's fun. It's different.

1001
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,390
But that kind of format.
It's well boxing fans in particular,

1002
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,710
well I should say just combat
sports fans in particular.

1003
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:44,590
They'd love to comment on things.
We'll have to get in on it. I mean,

1004
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,330
whenever there's a big fight,

1005
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,540
I mean social media just lights
up both with boxing and with MMA.

1006
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,650
They live in La and the ability to go
back and forth with the guy like you and

1007
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:56,530
get your questions answered and stuff
like that. It's gotta be huge. Yup.

1008
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:00,940
And we tap in. We've had Matt
Brown on so we tap into the UFC.

1009
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,730
I personally don't want to,
cause I don't want to make nobody mad.

1010
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,870
I don't know enough.
I watch it and I couldn't get anybody mad.

1011
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,970
But I'm saying that some of the fans,
you know, I would watch it, I enjoy it.

1012
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,530
But my now the Cohoes James Domingez,
he's really big into that, you know?

1013
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:19,531
And he was the one that
actually introduced me to
Matt Brown and so he knows so

1014
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,910
on now show, that's where we
work hand in hand together.

1015
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:24,280
Like he's able to do
more of the questions.

1016
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,420
And I think it's fun when
boxers don't know about him.

1017
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:31,090
A man they ass wonky questions. I
know. That's how I felt with, you know,

1018
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,900
vice versa. So I'm sure man.
Yeah, I'm sure like when you,

1019
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:38,690
when a big fight goes
down and um, you uh, do,

1020
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,420
do you watch it and stream
live? We do a, well we tried,

1021
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,070
we actually tried on that.

1022
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:48,580
That's a great idea for someone like
you that we do a thing called the fight

1023
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:51,160
companion. We do it all the
time with, as a UFC fight,

1024
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:52,180
we'll put it up on that screen.

1025
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:55,570
We'll have a bunch of guys in here and
we'll watch the fights and talk shit

1026
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:59,800
while the fights are going on and
people play it alongside the commentary.

1027
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,570
So it's like they're watching the fights
with us. Yeah, that's an idea. Thank you.

1028
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,570
That's great idea. Yeah, absolutely
is. And that's the whole thing.

1029
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:10,210
We're just looking for different.
Plus if you,

1030
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:13,900
if you go into the comments and start, you
know, having people ask questions like,

1031
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:16,750
what do you think won that round?
Then you go, this is why, you know,

1032
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:20,740
I think triple g one the round,
this is why Canelo lost the round.

1033
00:59:20,741 --> 00:59:23,380
Or this is why you could make an
argument that canela wanted that,

1034
00:59:23,381 --> 00:59:27,260
that kind of stuff for that kind of
interaction stuff for the fans. Love that.

1035
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,130
They love it. They love that. And
that's it. That's what we're, you know,

1036
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,220
we're looking at different ideas to you
cause you've never stopped learning.

1037
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,320
You can never stop, you know, expanding
and doing things like that. So it's good.

1038
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:41,300
And you know, we get places, we get
to these big fights and, and uh,

1039
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:46,100
people notice the show, you know, hey,
I love your show. Even if they don't,

1040
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:48,590
you're saying that to
me, you know? Um, yeah,

1041
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:53,370
it was a very keen insight. Right. Yeah.

1042
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,340
You know, and it was cool actually. What
was that, the first triple g Canelo fight?

1043
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,560
You know, when I retired, I stayed
away from boxing. I went to that, uh,

1044
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:08,540
I went there and I was all about promoting
my podcast and, uh, it was kinda cool.

1045
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:13,070
I walked in there and everybody went crazy
in the media room and I thought I was

1046
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:15,860
fighting again after we,
after five years of being retired,

1047
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:16,790
I thought I was fighting.

1048
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:20,560
I mean they were just asking and I was
trying to squeeze stuff in and tell him

1049
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:24,470
what I was doing. And then it was cool
also because Bernard Hopkins was there,

1050
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,440
you know, and I was just, I was
already a year into the power lifting.

1051
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:30,460
I was still about two 30.
And he came up and a,

1052
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,090
you gave me a big hug and you know,

1053
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:36,620
it was awesome to be able to after a
fight and being able to go in there with

1054
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:41,621
him to see how nice he wasn't
and how humble he was after that,

1055
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:43,340
you know,
you could have been cocky.

1056
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:48,080
He could've walked past me and I
said hi or recognize me at all.

1057
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:52,580
He was just really, uh, brought
me in. So that's cool. Yeah.

1058
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,380
What did he say to you after the fight?

1059
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:57,670
Did he tell you need to box like a
black guy? I think he did. You know,

1060
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,563
after that fight,

1061
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,930
he could of told me everything he wanted
and Rodica sat down for an hour with me

1062
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:05,900
and I wouldn't remember what
he said. Um, I was, you know,

1063
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,410
everybody's seen the
fight, so I don't, I mean,

1064
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,070
I need not to say much
more on that, but, uh, he,

1065
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:14,990
a little bit of it because my trainer was
there. It was, you'll keep your head up,

1066
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,570
you're a hell of a fighter,
you know, and, and, you know,

1067
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:20,990
I'm experienced and go back,
go back to the drawing board.

1068
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,440
Don't get too down on this and come
back strong. He goes, you're a champ.

1069
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,530
And then that was what he's remember
something where he said that you needed to

1070
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:31,280
learn how to fuck the black guy. I didn't
hear that. I truly didn't, you know,

1071
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:34,580
and maybe he might've said that in an
interview after with somebody and that's

1072
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:39,020
what people thought, but I know he didn't
say it in a fight. Yeah. Yeah. That was,

1073
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:43,730
um, that was, uh, was, you know, one
of his best performances. I mean,

1074
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:46,250
he had so many great
performances late in his career.

1075
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:48,530
The Tito Trinidad find in
particular because nobody,

1076
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,300
nobody thought he was going
to win that fight. That was,

1077
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,770
he was a big underdog in that fight.

1078
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,000
Trinidad was the up and coming rising
Puerto Rican superstar was fucking

1079
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:58,950
everybody up and Bernard put
on a show. I thought, you know,

1080
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:02,300
I actually had a Hopkins, the knife
fight toe because he was just bigger,

1081
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:06,350
you know, the big guy, middle
weight Trinidad's moving up. And uh,

1082
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,650
there was a lot of good middle waste
side and think Trinidad was going to be,

1083
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:13,430
I think Trinidad was a amazing
fighter by the kids. Great days.

1084
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:16,940
We're at one 47. Yeah.
Grill. Yeah, I was, um,

1085
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,820
I mean he was a big puncher though.
I mean he was a big puncher,

1086
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,250
even up into light heavyweight.

1087
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,960
I mean you'd been into a little
weight middleweight but he was,

1088
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:30,000
his style was almost tailor made
for Bernard or no, I was so,

1089
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,270
so clever. It's such a good counter
fighters. So good defensively.

1090
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:36,060
He didn't really open up,
he didn't leave many openings.

1091
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,520
That goes back to the foot work
that we were talking about.

1092
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:41,460
He noticed when he flat that fight,
even when he fought me,

1093
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:45,000
but Trinidad and other guys,
when they go to throw a punch,

1094
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:48,030
he take that one step in and
kind of suffer Kate to punch.

1095
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,360
And especially if it was a straight
right hand or did he would take that step

1096
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:54,120
and he would overthrow that overhand
right and catch you what it,

1097
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:57,360
so he was really good at just
putting a foot, not moving around,

1098
01:02:57,361 --> 01:03:01,980
much putting in the right spot to hit
you and counter you. Um, and he did that.

1099
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,060
Trinidad was probably one of the
best technically sound fighters ever.

1100
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,670
If you actually watch them, you
know, the way to his punches.

1101
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,130
He'd never made mistakes
on that part of it,

1102
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,640
but I think he needed a little bit more
change it up a little different with

1103
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:18,150
Bernard Hopkins in order to have
even made that fight kind of clothes.

1104
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,070
One of the most ridiculous
turning that fights ever.

1105
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:22,980
Remember we fought Ricardo Mayorga and my
org and let them punch him in the face.

1106
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,880
Yeah. He just put his hands down and go,
go ahead and intense Trinidad teed off.

1107
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,390
I think he hit him with two left
hooks on the chin. My role was crazy.

1108
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,440
He was so crazy.
That was a crazy dude.

1109
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,770
Smoke cigarettes in
between rounds and shit.

1110
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,330
I don't even know if I could believe that.

1111
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:39,430
I don't know if that was a show and he
did that when the cameras are on because

1112
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,510
he was able to go a handful of
rounds without getting tired.

1113
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:44,670
Now I know if you smoke a cigarette man,

1114
01:03:44,671 --> 01:03:47,940
that's going to take the wind
out of you. Yeah, but you know,

1115
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:51,390
I know fighters that smoke.
Yeah. Yeah. Joe Schilling,

1116
01:03:51,391 --> 01:03:55,530
who's a worldclass kickboxer a top of
the food chain world champion kickboxer

1117
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,740
smoke cigarettes. Well, crazy fucker
man. I chewed most of my career.

1118
01:04:00,741 --> 01:04:02,540
It's different though,
right? It is. You know,

1119
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:07,170
chew nicotine restricts the oxygen in
the blood and it's not good for a boxers

1120
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:09,660
or or anybody lifting weights.
Nicotine does.

1121
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:14,730
Chewing Tobacco restore restricts the
oxygen in the blood. I didn't know that,

1122
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:19,260
but can you pull it up? Just make sure
just a stimulant though. You know,

1123
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:20,940
it's actually like for your brain.

1124
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:23,940
People say the a lot of
folks I actually bought some,

1125
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:28,110
I never tried it but I
bought some nicotine gum to
try to see if I would write

1126
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:29,640
on it.
Like if it would help me writing.

1127
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:33,900
Like cause it apparently it works as
a nootropic as a cognitive enhancer.

1128
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,680
Nicotine is actually an effective
cognitive enhancer. I didn't know that.

1129
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:42,030
Maybe how much you take of
it. The quantity. Yeah. I
don't know. I mean I don't,

1130
01:04:42,031 --> 01:04:45,180
I didn't know that it uh, it affects
your, cause it's a stimulant.

1131
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,370
I didn't know that. It restricts
the oxygen, your blood.

1132
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:48,240
That's pretty good from what I,

1133
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:53,010
from what I heard and chew actually more
so than cigarettes because of the, uh,

1134
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,460
amount of nicotine on how it hits.
It gets into the stream faster.

1135
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,380
But to me it was never,

1136
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:01,770
I didn't chew a day of the fight
and I believe after so many hours,

1137
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:05,610
six to eight or 10 hours, um,
it's out. So, but any of the,

1138
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:07,230
or it didn't affect me that stuff.

1139
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:10,980
So now cause I was able to run
three miles and 19 minutes,

1140
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:14,880
19 some minutes and five miles
and 30 minutes. And, and uh,

1141
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,100
I was in, I was chewing it so
it never really affected me.

1142
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,970
Um, well maybe it did, but just you
were in such good shape, shape, barely,

1143
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:26,590
no smoking on the other hand,
lungs filling them. It is horrible.

1144
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:31,480
And uh, but after I retired and the
itch wasn't there for like a year,

1145
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:35,380
I, I, I wanted to give the gums a break
and I decided, well you know what else?

1146
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:38,130
Smoke and I quit smoking shortly.

1147
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:41,770
Started smoking cigarettes after
you retire that Jesus Christ,

1148
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:46,390
I didn't want to start. Someone else
starts at 30. I was switching out cause I,

1149
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:49,570
it was nicotine here. Oh
here it is. Smoke tobacco,

1150
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:53,890
smokeless tobacco and health
risks. Uh, but, but, but, but, but,

1151
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:57,490
but both the amount of nicotine in the
bloodstream after using smokeless tobacco

1152
01:05:57,491 --> 01:06:01,060
may be higher than that of
a cigarette smoker. Okay.

1153
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:05,200
What does it say about oxygen now?
That's where it was going into debt.

1154
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:09,910
This puts it all together. The nicotine
based is taking the place of the oxygen,

1155
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:14,680
I think is what the other, there's
another, it's a less scientific paper,

1156
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:17,810
but nicotine stays in the blood stream
longer with smokeless tobacco than

1157
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:22,210
cigarettes.
Oral Tobacco causes heart disease.

1158
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:28,410
Okay. It's not a safe alternative folks.
That's what it's saying. All right.

1159
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,930
We're [inaudible] bad for you. But
you started smoking cigarettes. Yeah.

1160
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,050
Cause not because when you were smoking,

1161
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:38,650
when you drinking kind of guys that what
it was? No, it was because I wanted,

1162
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,130
I liked the nicotine. Oh. And
I chewed, you know, and uh,

1163
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,180
I wanted to give the gums or break
the lips of break and I smoked.

1164
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:50,530
So I waited and have to chew and uh,
doing the lifting and power lifting.

1165
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:54,880
I went over and I think I've got seven
squats and I couldn't breathe Jesus.

1166
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:58,750
And I said, you know what? This is a
shame. How long have you been smoking for?

1167
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:03,470
I was only eight months.
Several months. That's long
enough on it, you know. And uh,

1168
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:08,110
yeah, I said, you know what,
cause I had no plans coming
back to the ring. I didn't.

1169
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,290
So I was done and uh,
yeah, I got to seven,

1170
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:15,190
seven reps into the squat and I
was like, you know, this is a sad,

1171
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:19,110
that was a former, you know,
world class athlete. So I,

1172
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:23,860
I was done right after that day, but to
cigarettes back. I'm a good for you. Yeah,

1173
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,560
I'm sad you started it up, but glad
you figured out to let it go. Yes.

1174
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,890
You that's a,

1175
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,440
that's a weird choice though at 30.
Yeah.

1176
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,200
I'm just cause smoking bull is nicotine,
you know,

1177
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,280
and that's what a lot of people do. When
I tried to quit, uh, the children, they,

1178
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:42,190
they, they go over to the smoke
and then just go to the gum.

1179
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:46,480
Usually you could do that too, but some
people would just like it. Um, yeah.

1180
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:50,980
I don't know what it does. It does juicy
up. Tony Hinchcliffe a smoked cigarettes.

1181
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:51,760
He doesn't anymore,

1182
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,330
but he used to and a couple of times I
took a cigarette from him and smoked it

1183
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:57,940
before I went onstage and he's like,
dude, you're going to get hurt.

1184
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,640
He was worried about me. You're going to
get hurt. I'm not going to get hooked.

1185
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,970
Yeah. I'm just going to smoke this one
cigarette. I'm not going to go buy a pack.

1186
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:09,100
But people are so scared of it. Yeah.
Well I see why though. Yeah. You know,

1187
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:12,370
especially again, you know,
as I'm mentioning, I'm over.

1188
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:16,070
I used to be able to do all that
and then I do seven reps on a

1189
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:20,300
squat night and I'm having a hard
time breathing and, uh, I racked it.

1190
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,450
Now granted we're, squats are hard
though. I mean, you're going to,

1191
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:25,040
if you're spending on a weight
and how many reps you're doing,

1192
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:29,030
it's a different type of exercise. But
you know, I, I was done after that.

1193
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:33,200
So you had a drinking thing
for a while too, Huh? Yeah.

1194
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:38,270
That's, that's one that, uh, that
gets a lot of fighters. Yeah,

1195
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:43,880
it does. Um, but it's one
that, you know, on that,

1196
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:48,710
that it ticks me off and it
don't, it ticks you off. Yeah.

1197
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,330
How so you'd, a lot of it was
ran through to the hometown,

1198
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:58,800
you know, and the troubles
that I, that I got in with the,

1199
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,740
um, TMZ, stuff like that, you know,

1200
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:07,070
the incidents that
happened were petty small.

1201
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,240
And if it was,
it wasn't in Youngstown,

1202
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:14,470
it would've never made news
stuff that kind of happens. Shit.

1203
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,280
Bb guns and in a four wheeler. Yeah,
I shot a kid. We were playing around.

1204
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,480
I was taking care of them.

1205
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:23,960
And this is the truth of the story
taking care of them. I was putting a,

1206
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:28,140
a big lake in my backyard and uh,
I got the country boy. I mean,

1207
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:32,690
I went out and rented two excavators and
some bobcats and started putting, uh,

1208
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,630
the ponded this,
uh,

1209
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:40,310
this guy I was helping out. He knows
how to run the excavators. So I,

1210
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,320
he needed work.
He had no money.

1211
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:47,210
I was taking care of him and his kids
over at the house. He's, he's working.

1212
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,290
So long story short,
after about five days,

1213
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:56,000
I'll come home and he's in the pond
or lake just in his underwear playing

1214
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:59,810
around. I grabbed the BB gun. I'm
joking around with him, you know,

1215
01:09:59,811 --> 01:10:03,920
cause we were shooting targets for a
couple of days in between work and I shoot

1216
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:04,754
him in the,
uh,

1217
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:09,320
on the arm for 42 years old at
the 41 years old at the time too.

1218
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,750
So it wasn't a kid. He gets out, he's
like, yeah, you shot me. And, and uh,

1219
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,820
he's crying about it and everything
else. And next thing you know, he,

1220
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:20,330
he's cool though. He gets out of these,
it's on Facebook and he's Giggling,

1221
01:10:20,331 --> 01:10:23,840
laughing about it and he stays at my
house that night. His kids come over,

1222
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:27,860
I'm feeding them, we're having
cookouts the next day, a little things.

1223
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,820
I don't know that I'm glad that I'm
not involved in no more or I don't put

1224
01:10:31,821 --> 01:10:34,970
myself in a situation.
So He's,

1225
01:10:34,971 --> 01:10:39,620
he stays for two days after
that at my house. And uh,

1226
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:44,660
his uncle comes there who worked for the
sheriff, the local sheriff's department,

1227
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:49,520
and it goes, hey, is so and so
here? And I said, yeah, he was,

1228
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:52,880
I haven't seen him. No. And he
goes, okay, listen. He goes, Kelly,

1229
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:56,600
I'm coming here to tell you.
So I way the news, the media,

1230
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,800
everything else don't come.

1231
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,480
He has a warrant out for his
arrest and tell him, you know,

1232
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:06,710
if he comes back, call us. So he leaves,

1233
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,990
I go walk it through
the house and they come.

1234
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,620
Brian comes down the steps and I was like,
dude,

1235
01:11:12,621 --> 01:11:15,420
you gotta get the Hell Outta here. I was
like, I didn't know anything about this.

1236
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:19,740
You having a warrant, blah blah, blah.
He goes over and pass out on my couch.

1237
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:25,500
I call his uncle, hey, you want
him? He's here. So he finds out,

1238
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:28,350
he ends up running out of the
house and they catch him, you know,

1239
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,780
that night or whatever,
they take him in,

1240
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:35,940
he does two months and a county jail,
gets out,

1241
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,880
takes his uniform off,
walks over to the sheriff's department.

1242
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:42,690
Sheriff's department and
presses. Charges on you. Yes.

1243
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,730
For shooting him with a BB gun.
Yes.

1244
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:49,620
And a buddy of mine who was there
when it happened was video in it.

1245
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:53,460
His girlfriends laughing in the
background, you know when it happened.

1246
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:56,100
But that was,
it was just a video of it happening.

1247
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:01,050
He'd sold it to a TMZ
and next thing you know,

1248
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,020
I ended up getting served or what not.

1249
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:07,710
My attorney calls me also
and it says, Hey, go down,

1250
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,480
turn yourself in. You know,
it's a federal assault charge.

1251
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:17,340
Yeah. Kinds of federal
assault. Yes. Yeah. And uh,

1252
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:22,710
that was it. And again, it was all
over money. It was a drawn out case.

1253
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:27,740
I'm supposed to have been beat and it
turned to that over a BB gun but a guy and

1254
01:12:28,831 --> 01:12:32,130
he said it was an assault.
So I always trying to get from you.

1255
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,140
You got nine grand and it was supposed to,

1256
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,020
when he filed a civil suit
or a couple months into this,

1257
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:41,400
the criminal charges are supposed to be
dropped at that point because prosecutor

1258
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:43,860
and everybody knew that
it was all about money.

1259
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,850
So today we're going to drop the
criminal charge. They never did.

1260
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,910
And uh, it goes back in
Youngstown, you know,

1261
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:55,800
I was out in the public eye and someone
that people would eight, they had it out.

1262
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:56,634
They have

1263
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,890
to for people to understand how big
star you are in Youngstown. I mean,

1264
01:13:00,891 --> 01:13:03,410
I remember at the time,
I remember reading stories,

1265
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:07,640
seeing news clips mean Youngstown's not
a big place and other than ray boom,

1266
01:13:07,641 --> 01:13:10,370
boom, man seen. He's not a whole
lot of like really famous people,

1267
01:13:10,371 --> 01:13:12,050
especially fighters had
come at a young sound,

1268
01:13:12,051 --> 01:13:15,560
but you were a fucking
giant celebrity in that.

1269
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:20,690
Yeah. And that was Kinda my, my bad
on that. That's where I think the,

1270
01:13:20,691 --> 01:13:24,540
the fault was probably hard for you to
recognize. You're not even 30 years old.

1271
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,410
Yeah. All this shit is going
on. Yeah. And it's true.

1272
01:13:28,411 --> 01:13:32,160
And I'm not looking for that as an excuse.
You know when I say it, but it is true.

1273
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:36,630
I looked, I looked at myself as everybody
else. Right. I think that was the issue

1274
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,740
you hadn't recognized yet that
you're in some weird place.

1275
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:40,590
We have to watch what you,

1276
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:43,390
I felt like if I go to
the bar and somebody goes,

1277
01:13:43,391 --> 01:13:45,730
boy you Kelly public's been
here three days. He's a lush.

1278
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,440
My argument was I got every right to be
here just like you do. Matter of fact,

1279
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:54,040
I have more of a right. You know, I'm
retired. I've got my money put away,

1280
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,790
you're probably drinking your
weekly pay away. That was my,

1281
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,430
my thought processes,

1282
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:04,840
thought process of that and it was
probably wasn't right. You know,

1283
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:09,841
because it comes down to is you are a big
fish in a little pond and it's a small

1284
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:13,480
city and I think that by being out there,

1285
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:17,380
I brought a lot on myself because of that.
It is what it is.

1286
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:21,800
Unfortunately as an athlete
you, you can't do that. And um,

1287
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,380
so that happened over a period of time
and the word got around and a lot of

1288
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:30,430
anger, you know, you have
some jealous, some angry,

1289
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:34,810
there's some who just didn't like me.
So just so much fun for them to gossip.

1290
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,980
Yeah, exactly. Cause what else is really
not beating up young song. I love it.

1291
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,420
It made me who I am.

1292
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:45,250
But if you really look up young Saunders
not drained a lot to talk about besides

1293
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:48,940
the fact that we do put out the
most NFL players per capita. Really?

1294
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,760
Oh absolutely. Youngstown does. Why
is that you think? I don't know.

1295
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:55,830
Is Averages there? Just some, some bad ass
dudes from, from Youngstown. And it is,

1296
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,420
I don't, I don't know why, I
mean, even the boxing part of it,

1297
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:03,630
if you truly break down the five rural
champs from such a small city and 36

1298
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:08,920
years as, as it came up with the other
world champs besides the [inaudible] area,

1299
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:13,370
royal actually held the title
in the same way class Ron,

1300
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:17,870
the same exact time that Massey and
he did, he had Jeff Lampkin, uh,

1301
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,470
Greg Richardson.
And uh,

1302
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:24,070
then you had a handful of other guys like
Roland Cummings and fighters out there

1303
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:25,990
that were making noise out of Youngstown.

1304
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:30,580
A guy can say granny who fought
Chavez and Comacho out of Youngstown.

1305
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:31,953
But,
um,

1306
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,160
being at being at being there like that,

1307
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:39,370
it brought a lot of attention and
people wanted, wanted, you know,

1308
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:41,080
and there was a lot of angry people.

1309
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:45,250
Was it weird growing up there and then
becoming a famous guy there? Yeah, it is.

1310
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:49,240
Because again, you know, you
don't, people will tell you, hey,

1311
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,690
when you get to that level,
when you wouldn't have rolled title,

1312
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,990
Shit's going to change man. And you're
going, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. You think,

1313
01:15:55,991 --> 01:15:59,200
you know, right. Like you're going,
yeah, I got what you're saying.

1314
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:03,820
And then it happens and you win it.
And it's so true when they say overnight,

1315
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:07,540
like you're not, you know
more, you know, like you're,

1316
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,040
you can't be yourself no more.

1317
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:12,940
It's a everything changes and
it comes down to the person.

1318
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:16,300
Even though if you don't want to change
and you like living your life the way

1319
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:20,930
you did two days ago, uh, fortunately
you can't, you know, and it's,

1320
01:16:20,931 --> 01:16:25,770
it's a hard, and it's something that
you got to learn how to deal with.

1321
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,380
And that, that wasn't my choice
though. You know what I mean by that?

1322
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:32,230
My choice wasn't to go out
and act like a jack alone.

1323
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:36,090
My choice was kind of just be me though.
And um,

1324
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:38,290
you just did what you wanted to do.
I did.

1325
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:43,390
And then it just became a big issue
because you were a famous guy.

1326
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,720
Yes.
And the,

1327
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:49,660
another issue on top of that came to was
where I could actually take the blame

1328
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:53,710
for this. And, and I honestly
cam a lot of it came down to,

1329
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,250
and everybody's different. So
I'm not, I'm speaking for myself.

1330
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,740
I trained my ass off when I
trained, you know, I was a six,

1331
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:05,370
seven hours a day type guy and uh,

1332
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,800
that's what got me to throw as many
punches as I did around, you know,

1333
01:17:08,801 --> 01:17:10,190
and I was in great shape

1334
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,300
for every fight. I sacrifice a lot
of things. I gave up a lot, you know,

1335
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:16,190
I'm even starting from high school,
you know,

1336
01:17:16,191 --> 01:17:19,160
being an amateurs and just turning
pro right out of high school.

1337
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,290
I missed a lot of things. My mentality
was when, you know, I had time,

1338
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:25,910
I was going to,
I was going to live,

1339
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:30,320
I was going to live like my
friends who were 19, 20, 21,

1340
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:33,560
24 and that was the process of it.
Um,

1341
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:37,370
I do believe though, at a point,
especially after I retired,

1342
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:42,190
that it got a little, got a little
out of hand. Absolutely. You know,

1343
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,520
and I'm not going to be the person
to sit her and say, you know, it did,

1344
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:50,180
I'm not naive enough to say that.
Well, you know better than anybody,

1345
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:53,590
but the rumors were always that
you were drinking a lot, but,

1346
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,550
and that was affecting your career.
It may have to at some point.

1347
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,230
I don't think it did.
People say,

1348
01:18:00,231 --> 01:18:03,920
use the fact that Hopkins beat me and
that was this. That was the reason.

1349
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,430
And that's why I retired so young
and it wasn't, it truly wasn't. Um,

1350
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,640
maybe some of the stuff I was doing,

1351
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:13,940
especially as I got older in
between flights to drinking,

1352
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:16,670
I think that that could have,
that may have heard a little bit.

1353
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:20,720
I don't think it was enough to make
any significant changes in my career,

1354
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:24,950
to be honest with you. Um, but
you know, who knows what that,

1355
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,620
if I didn't, we'll never know. Um, again,

1356
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:30,860
but I lived up and do I got
anything to regret about it? No.

1357
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,130
Do you still live in Youngstown? Yeah,
we're on the outside in the suburbs.

1358
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,200
You know, is it, I mean,

1359
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:41,030
it's gotta be strange to have
grown up there, been a child there,

1360
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:46,150
and then become an internationally famous
world champion boxer and celebrity and

1361
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:48,980
still stay there.
Yeah.

1362
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,750
It's the world changes and you're
still Kelly Pavlick and I think after I

1363
01:18:54,751 --> 01:18:55,311
retired,

1364
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:59,000
as far as some of the mistakes I've
come to where I should have gotten out,

1365
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,400
maybe come out here to
California or go to a on. Yeah,

1366
01:19:04,401 --> 01:19:07,950
right. I don't, yeah, we're working
on it. Plenty of room. Yeah.

1367
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:12,170
Just had that last night. What my, uh,
manager, uh, mark he was telling me,

1368
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:13,400
talking about you doing out here.

1369
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:17,360
Can you say he's throwing
around ideas also again,

1370
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,670
we were talking about what
we have talked about earlier,

1371
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:23,610
but to fight coming back, uh, we talked
about the dancing with the stars. Things.

1372
01:19:23,611 --> 01:19:28,460
Is that some ideas he's looking into?
Also sponsorships, um, you know,

1373
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:32,780
again, mark is, um, got a lot of
connects. He's in that industry.

1374
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,120
Boxing's in an interesting
place right now and I'm really,

1375
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:39,380
I was really bummed out that uh, HBO
canceled their boxing series. I mean,

1376
01:19:39,381 --> 01:19:43,930
after how many years? It's 40, 43
years. Something crazy like that.

1377
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:49,160
They put on some of the all time.
Great classic fights. And, you know,

1378
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:52,100
I think Jim Lampley,
one of the best commentators of all time,

1379
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:56,760
I loved hearing Roy Jones Jr
do it and Andre Ward and she,

1380
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:00,890
you know, I just, Max
Kellerman was amazing. I just,

1381
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,890
I just can't believe that it's
over. I mean, not, I don't know,

1382
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:06,920
I guess it wasn't profitable for them
or they just decided to get out of the,

1383
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,210
I really don't understand it.

1384
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:13,520
I don't believe that it's going to
be gone for long from Hbo. I, yeah,

1385
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:18,270
I have for some reason, I
think you noticed, uh, Lampley
still has the fight game.

1386
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,620
That was an error in her donut.
Um,

1387
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:23,770
I heard rumors of maybe
Roy Jones taking it over,

1388
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:28,600
buying it out or somebody buying. Yeah.
Um, but a big issue I think where that,

1389
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:33,420
what happens in to HBO and showtime
is doing very well right now. Yeah.

1390
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,470
And I don't know yet.

1391
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,710
I'm not sure if we'll ever fall
into this situation that HBO did,

1392
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:42,840
but you have these apps coming out now.
Espn plus a disowned DAZN.

1393
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:47,190
And again, like what they just had that
signing what Canelo how big that was.

1394
01:20:47,191 --> 01:20:49,970
The richest athlete, you
know, the biggest contracts,

1395
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,000
$150 million or something for,

1396
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:56,610
I thought it was three 65 and some
Canelo's how much money if something,

1397
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:00,600
I think it was 365 million, but
he, there was also per, you know,

1398
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,790
incentives and everything else but that,

1399
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:06,780
so 365 and it was a six in there.

1400
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:11,850
That's a lot of fucking money. Yes it
is for I think 11 fights or whatever.

1401
01:21:11,851 --> 01:21:14,610
It was crazy. And um, so again,

1402
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,600
that's where these people were
coming to this ESPN plus tig.

1403
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,280
They could wash these fights. Now on
these four, seven, nine, nine, nine,

1404
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:25,240
nine 99 a disown has UFC or MMA fight bar,

1405
01:21:25,241 --> 01:21:26,840
I think it's spelled tour fights,
whatever.

1406
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,930
It is nice that ESPN is putting
on a lot of fights now. Exactly.

1407
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:32,660
They also now have a deal
with the UFC. So, uh,

1408
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:36,900
into 2019 now the first UFC event,
it's going to be January 19th,

1409
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:40,290
which is Tj Dillashaw versus Henry
Cejudo for the flyweight title.

1410
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,440
And they're really putting
on some great fights on ESPN.

1411
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,760
It's just exciting just to see
MMA being recognized, be ESPN.

1412
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:51,810
But it's exciting to see ESPN put
like Llama Chanko fights on. Exactly.

1413
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:55,590
Cause Espn used to be kind of more so
the prospects you can go to Friday night

1414
01:21:55,591 --> 01:21:57,960
fights where are the up and
coming guys and they were,

1415
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,570
they were putting out on and
that was great for the prospects.

1416
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:03,960
I think they need to actually keep
doing that maybe on a different night.

1417
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,600
But now they're putting the loan with
Cenk goes and we're putting in a rural

1418
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:11,000
class fighters on ESPN Crawford's last
fight on ESPN I believe it was. You know,

1419
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:13,050
that's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah.

1420
01:22:13,051 --> 01:22:15,540
So that and that APP that
ESPN plus like I'm saying,

1421
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:19,560
so there's more accessibility to that
and people would rather pay that then

1422
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,730
order to 69 or 89 or $100
paper review funds. Right.

1423
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:28,410
Seven bucks a month is nice.
It is. I mean with the UFC,

1424
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:33,411
the UFC has a UFC fight pass and you know
they have events just constantly same

1425
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:37,850
sort of deal and that's great for that.
It is because it's easier route, you know,

1426
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,810
outlet for it. Yeah. And you can watch
on your phone on, on a train. Exactly.

1427
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,240
It's like the,
the world's changing and now also,

1428
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:47,610
I love the fact you could stream
it from your phone, right.

1429
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:50,940
To your television and you got a smart
TV. You can watch it. Exactly. Yeah.

1430
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:55,020
You know, I was even thinking about
that at my gym because I know how it is.

1431
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,880
What business in ordering
paper view fights.

1432
01:22:57,570 --> 01:23:01,080
There was actually a funny story about
that and Youngstown with that too. Um,

1433
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:04,350
where everybody thought it
was my fault. But uh, yeah,

1434
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:08,440
you could get that and I got to have
40 people there on a big fight night,

1435
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,940
UFC fight night or a boxing fight night
and I could just put that phone right up

1436
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:17,230
to the smart TV. We could watch it on
there instead of paying, don't say this,

1437
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,230
don't say this right now. They're
going to come get you. Oh yeah.

1438
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:24,310
You're not going to do that. This is all
hypothetical. This will never happen.

1439
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:27,500
You're not going to do that.
Right. Thought it was leaving.
No, I'd be legal. Yeah.

1440
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,750
Well the UFC is gone after people in the
past for illegally streaming things and

1441
01:23:31,751 --> 01:23:35,140
then showing them on television. Oh,
well I thought if you had the APP,

1442
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,830
I don't know. I don't know how to be
honest when you're showing it on a,

1443
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:42,310
in a business, because I know
what I was talking about earlier,

1444
01:23:42,311 --> 01:23:46,110
what the young style thing that happened,
it was kind of funny was um,

1445
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,590
they were getting the fights,
the paper view of fights and they were,

1446
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:54,900
some of the businesses were illegally
getting it and AOL got fine.

1447
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:58,060
They were going around and people
were actually coming to me like,

1448
01:23:58,061 --> 01:24:01,240
I have something to do with it. They
were like, I can't believe you'd do that.

1449
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,290
You should have to pay us like
$3,000 for to find out what you got.

1450
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,000
And I'm going, yes. I
started googling, I'm going,

1451
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:12,130
last time my mind was,

1452
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,140
I was worried about was who was ordering
fights in Youngstown. What I'm hearing,

1453
01:24:17,141 --> 01:24:20,020
you know, Atlantic City or
Vegas right now fighting, um,

1454
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:23,640
getting ready to try to make weight
and doing the interviews and the press

1455
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,240
conference.
And everything else.

1456
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:28,990
What kind of asshole says that you should
have hit? It kind of came out in one.

1457
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:30,640
Actually, my brother was doing, uh,

1458
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:34,840
going to get ads for the program from
places and they're like, I'm not giving,

1459
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,370
I'm not putting an ad and he costs
me $3,000. You know, you cost you,

1460
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,360
you fucking pirate.
I,

1461
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:45,220
he might nighties and I'm sure I'm not
just using that with the young side.

1462
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:48,130
That would probably would have happened
anywhere, you know, small, small area.

1463
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:52,820
So while, you know, illegal streaming, if
they don't do something about it, man, uh,

1464
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:57,910
it would run rampant. I just don't know
what the thing to do. That's correct is,

1465
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:02,530
you know, I've seen some outrageous
fines. I don't know. You know,

1466
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:06,640
and as you, as we just have about what
happened earlier, we don't know what's,

1467
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:09,850
what's legal and what's not either or
anymore with all the different, uh,

1468
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:14,740
Internet stuff and apps that you have.
And it was a smart TVs with TVs. Yeah.

1469
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:15,900
Yeah. I mean, or, you know,

1470
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,070
can you stream it on your phone and
have a bunch of people look over your

1471
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,760
shoulder? Yeah. How's that work for you?
If you have a smart TV though, you know,

1472
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:25,660
like if you have it on your phone and
then like 20 of your friends come over and

1473
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:28,870
they're behind you. Yeah. And you say,
hey man, everybody give me a dollar.

1474
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:34,540
He get in trouble for that and I was
at work or that could be a great idea.

1475
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:38,860
It's not the worst idea. But yeah. The,
how does that work? Because with Apple TV,

1476
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:39,730
anything you're watching,

1477
01:25:39,731 --> 01:25:43,540
you can watch a youtube video and you just
stream it to that TV with a, you know,

1478
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,650
a quick swipe and oppress Bam. Yeah. Yeah.

1479
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:52,150
I think the move for them is
to make it easily accessible.

1480
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,390
Like a WWE was the first one to
figure that out. Right. They,

1481
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:56,470
they figured out how to,

1482
01:25:56,950 --> 01:26:01,180
you get like a monthly subscription and
you get to watch all the events and then

1483
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:05,470
the UFC did that with fight pass
and ESPN plus doing this and you,

1484
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:10,130
he knows how to make the money. Yeah.
We could all see. Sure. Um, you know,

1485
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:12,830
I think it was also great as somebody
who's insights station, you know,

1486
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:16,430
local stations and inside putting these
fights on also like they used to do back

1487
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:21,140
in the day, you know what, ABC fights
and uh, oh it was a CBS sports. Yeah,

1488
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,580
yeah. All that shit do not again,
you know, why, why wouldn't us?

1489
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:26,510
It's great for the sport and you know,

1490
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,580
that's how you get people
involved back in it. You know,

1491
01:26:28,581 --> 01:26:32,090
it's almost like almost every
other generation or, or, or,

1492
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:36,630
or every other decade there was that
group of fighters that come out, you know,

1493
01:26:36,631 --> 01:26:39,730
he like the Frazier guys like that.

1494
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:44,090
Then you had like the Tyson
holy filled Reddick bow,

1495
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,560
but you also, at that time it was
easy and it was accessible to,

1496
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:53,210
to watch all the time. Now, you
know, it's not even the apps,

1497
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:54,440
which is I think is great.

1498
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:57,890
You get a lot of guys in their forties
and fifties who don't want to have to

1499
01:26:57,891 --> 01:27:01,910
watch an APP on your TV. So I think
if they start bringing it back up,

1500
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:06,560
just a little more variety of,
uh, shows or something. Well,

1501
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:09,440
it seems like,
especially with boxing right now,

1502
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:13,190
the talent level is extremely high. I
mean it is with them, I may as well.

1503
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:15,740
But I mean with boxing it
seems to be on an upswing.

1504
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,580
And it also seems like people really
interested in some of these big rivalries

1505
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:24,170
like triple g and Canelo.
That was two amazing fights.

1506
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,000
I thought the first one was a robbery.

1507
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,310
I thought that a triple g one the first
one, but they don't fight again. Really?

1508
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,980
Yeah. Why is that? Because, uh,

1509
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:37,610
when you get a guy that hits as hard as
triple g does and you get a guy that's

1510
01:27:37,611 --> 01:27:40,430
as good as Canelo, you know,
and, and they're, and there,

1511
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:43,160
even though they're not getting dropped
and are not getting knocked out,

1512
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:46,640
the dumb type of flights take a
lot out of you. They really do.

1513
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:50,120
And they shared a lot in those
two fights and we don't know,

1514
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:54,020
even right now if the next fight or to
fight after that Canelo start showing

1515
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:57,530
somebody effects from those first
two fights. You think so? Yeah.

1516
01:27:57,531 --> 01:28:01,700
You get a guy that hits two guys that hit
that hard and earned her fighting like

1517
01:28:01,701 --> 01:28:05,180
that, eventually it does drain you
a little bit and that will catch up.

1518
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:09,410
I think a third fight we'll
shorten the career of Canelo.

1519
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,680
I'm not going to say triple g
because triple g is my age now and I,

1520
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,580
I have a feeling that his might be
getting short here pretty soon anyways,

1521
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,470
just due to age. But Canelo I mean
that, that's, it was a brutal fights.

1522
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,630
They were brutal fights.
Did you think that um,

1523
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:26,240
some people thought that triple g one,
the second fight as well.

1524
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:29,060
I thought it was much closer.
Fine done the first fight.

1525
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:33,530
But did you think that Canelo triple g,
I think Conello showed some improvement,

1526
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:36,500
but it's also possible that triple
g might've slowed down a little bit.

1527
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:38,210
I think so. Um, you know,

1528
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:42,170
the first fight I had at nine 30 for
triple g that's how I spent sounds about

1529
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:42,651
right.
Yeah.

1530
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:46,940
And I gave the first three
rounds to Canelo and then
I had every round after for

1531
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:51,020
triple g this fight,
I thought Canelo one close fight.

1532
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:54,200
And if you gave it to triple g,
I wouldn't have screened where are bright.

1533
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:59,300
You know, teddy was saying that he thought
the triple g one, but, um, I felt like,

1534
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:02,040
well it's a pretty close
fight pretty close by,

1535
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:04,260
but certainly Conello
showed much improvement.

1536
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,540
He did and he fought a better fight.

1537
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:11,010
The first half of the fight
I gave a keynote a lot of
eyebrows because I thought

1538
01:29:11,011 --> 01:29:13,320
he controlled the fight
with the two body shots.

1539
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,780
Everybody thought triple g was
controlling it with the jab,

1540
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:20,430
but the reason why it triple g wasn't
using his size and strength was because it

1541
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:24,090
was using his jab was cause of the body
shots that Canelo was landing. I mean,

1542
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:25,270
they were brutal. And, uh,

1543
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:28,650
I just thought Canelo dictated the
pace of those first couple of rounds.

1544
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:33,780
I thought he won enough of the early
rounds and obviously triple g one the

1545
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:36,180
second most of the
second half of the fight,

1546
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:38,460
but I thought it was a little too late,
you know,

1547
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:42,810
and I had Canelo up by around
her too. Yeah. Um, it's,

1548
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,400
it's just one,
those are,

1549
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:49,080
those are two fighters that
really sort of epitomize, uh,

1550
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:53,330
what people like to see when they like
to see like these classic rivalries,

1551
01:29:53,331 --> 01:29:56,910
right? Like a guy like triple
g who's just forward pressure,

1552
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:58,350
constant throwing bombs,

1553
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:02,610
knockout puncher or garlic Canelo
who's just one of those classic Mexican

1554
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:06,710
fighters that as incredible heart
wants to fight the best of the best,

1555
01:30:06,711 --> 01:30:11,640
like really like really takes
it in the first fight. Yeah.

1556
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:14,190
Yeah. It's the on the ropes
with triple g and let him,

1557
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:18,150
let him use that power to beat your
organs. Then Pardot sites, you know,

1558
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:20,990
I was sitting, I'm going,
I'm not wanting to talk. I,

1559
01:30:20,991 --> 01:30:23,960
I kinda like getting in and
getting involved myself with guys,

1560
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:28,970
especially like Miranda who I personally
believe it harder than a triple g

1561
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,590
really? But yeah. And
I was a guy in there,

1562
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:34,230
but that was my strategy as we're Canelo.
I wasn't,

1563
01:30:34,231 --> 01:30:36,180
I really wasn't a great strategy,
you know,

1564
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,910
I didn't lay on the ropes
and let them around. Uh,

1565
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:41,250
do you think he just didn't know what
to expect until he was in there with

1566
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:44,130
triple gene? It could have been
because everything changes.

1567
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,780
Like I think Mike Tyson said it,
you know,

1568
01:30:45,781 --> 01:30:50,220
everybody's got a game plan until they
get hit. Uh, he might've got touched,

1569
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:50,970
like I said,

1570
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:55,130
even what the tension and that Mayweather
fight and the whole brain might have

1571
01:30:55,131 --> 01:30:58,650
just started going a thousand miles
an hour trying to figure out, okay,

1572
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,890
like this ain't going to probably work
tonight with this guy because he's a lot

1573
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:05,310
stronger than I expected. And he was
just trying to maybe tire them out.

1574
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,080
The only issue is now you're,

1575
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,750
when you're on the ropes like that and
you're getting hit by a guy that hits

1576
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:14,640
that hard and adults in the elbow
and the forearms and to the body,

1577
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:15,350
and then you're,

1578
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,940
you're tightening up and you're tensing
up really hard and you're cutting the

1579
01:31:17,941 --> 01:31:21,930
oxygen off to the blood. It tires you out
quicker and it wears you down. You know,

1580
01:31:21,931 --> 01:31:26,160
more than what he was doing in the
middle of the ring by pop shot and, and,

1581
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:29,850
and counter punching. And he could have
dictated how fast he wanted. You know,

1582
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:32,490
how much you wanted to punch all
hard. He wanted to punch. Yeah.

1583
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:37,310
We certainly made some big improvements in
that second fight. Yeah. Do you, um, you,

1584
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:40,740
you, you really don't want to see them
fight a third time? I truly don't.

1585
01:31:40,741 --> 01:31:44,340
I mean if it happens, I'm going to watch
it, you know, but they're going to fight.

1586
01:31:44,341 --> 01:31:44,581
Right.

1587
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:48,030
I mean Canelo's obviously going to fight
some people and triple g is obviously

1588
01:31:48,031 --> 01:31:50,270
going to continue fighting.
You don't, and again,

1589
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:53,160
I don't know how long triple g's going
to fight because as you mentioned,

1590
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:56,040
and I agree with you, um,
I think he's starting to,

1591
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:59,590
his age is showing up a little
bit with him. Wow. I, he,

1592
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:05,260
he got avoided by a lot of people and we,
you know,

1593
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,850
when he had a paper view a couple of
years back that only got 150,000 buys.

1594
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:13,540
And I remember thinking that is a damn
shame damn shame that people don't

1595
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:17,050
realize that this is absolutely
one of the best fighters ever.

1596
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,280
I was surprised by that too,

1597
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:21,550
cause I think he's a lot more
popular than what those numbers show.

1598
01:32:21,551 --> 01:32:25,030
I didn't get it. I don't
understand. I mean I don't,

1599
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,900
maybe it's because they didn't think the
fight was competitive. Maybe. I mean,

1600
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:31,480
maybe I don't know what it was,
but it just, it seemed like,

1601
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,470
I just think personally myself, there's
a lot of flights out there for Canelo.

1602
01:32:35,471 --> 01:32:39,820
He just went up to one 68.
Yeah. I'm not a big fan of that.

1603
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:41,980
I think he's too small for 16.
I do.

1604
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:45,580
Especially if you get in with the right
flight or I truly do believe that,

1605
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,980
you know, everybody, how tall is easy?
Five ten five, nine, five 10. Um,

1606
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:53,440
but you know what, boxing or like
football, when you see the height,

1607
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:56,980
you always got to take an inch, inch
and a half off to, so how did they lie?

1608
01:32:57,090 --> 01:33:00,370
Had me list is six three I'm right
under six. Two by like that much.

1609
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:03,690
So it's kind of like the football program
and high school. Right, right, right.

1610
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:08,650
But um, Canelo I think that there's
guys out there staying at 68.

1611
01:33:08,651 --> 01:33:09,520
It's kind of dangerous.

1612
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:12,550
I think he's great and I'll tell it to
enough to keep good fights out there.

1613
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,890
Yeah.
But it's a little dangerous in my opinion.

1614
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:17,410
I think it 68 could
cause problems for them.

1615
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:21,450
You got even the guys like Zardoz
Benevidez those are dangerous fights.

1616
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,810
Just them two guys right there.

1617
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,840
I would have to take not
so much overall skill wise,

1618
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,110
just size and being at that
weight and you know, um,

1619
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:35,740
you got guys coming down like
be evil from one 75 to one 68.

1620
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:39,320
I think that his better days are
going to be at one 60. You know,

1621
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:42,660
does he have a hard time making 60 or
do you just have an opportunity to fight

1622
01:33:42,661 --> 01:33:45,660
68 and he took it, I think
it's the trophies, you know,

1623
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,490
and I don't blame him for that and either
he had the right flight to go up to

1624
01:33:48,491 --> 01:33:52,060
one 68 so we'll get another weight
division under his belt. Yeah.

1625
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:55,240
He knows tuning in that dude up and I
think that would be what, three now?

1626
01:33:55,241 --> 01:33:59,530
He's a three week class
champ. Yeah. And uh, so that,

1627
01:33:59,531 --> 01:34:03,490
it looks good on paper when
you retire. Yeah, it does.

1628
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:06,360
I would have done it if I
could have, you know, if there,

1629
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:07,750
if there was the right fights out there.

1630
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:10,780
But when he fought Mayweather Mayweather,
it made them cut down to what,

1631
01:34:10,781 --> 01:34:12,250
52 was it something like that.

1632
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:15,900
I think the idea there were how to
catch weight around that, you know, um,

1633
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,040
that fight was to me,

1634
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:20,880
while it was a good learning experience
for him to be in there with a guy who

1635
01:34:20,881 --> 01:34:24,430
was as slick as Floyd is,
but also a good learning experience.

1636
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:26,440
So you're not supposed to suck
that much weight out of your body.

1637
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:28,810
Just he didn't have the fire.
No.

1638
01:34:28,811 --> 01:34:33,460
Even though you have a 24 hours or
however long it is to try to rehydrate,

1639
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:37,000
that's never enough time
to recoup. Yeah. So your,

1640
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:40,450
your thing is you're just hoping your
opponent's going through the same thing

1641
01:34:40,451 --> 01:34:42,520
that you are, you know,
that's what it comes down to.

1642
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:47,620
What I do like about boxing that is
missing in MMA is more weight classes.

1643
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:48,670
I really think that,

1644
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:51,150
and that's one of the things that
people have a problem with inboxing.

1645
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,560
They think there's too many weight
classes. I don't agree with that.

1646
01:34:53,561 --> 01:34:55,840
I think if anything,
there's too many world champions.

1647
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,040
I think it's ridiculous that in

1648
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,190
any organization that one guy
could be a WBC world champion.

1649
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:05,720
The other guy could be a waa. There's an
Ibf is the WBO. I mean like that's crazy.

1650
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:10,040
It's crazy to have that many world
champions. It should be a world champion.

1651
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:14,720
But how do you decide what organization
is the real sanctioning body while you

1652
01:35:14,721 --> 01:35:16,630
just need one sanctioning body?
Uh,

1653
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:19,850
I don't know how you would do that
either because it's all money.

1654
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,890
You know what I mean?
There are so corrupt. Yeah.

1655
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:26,570
It's all money is hard to do that. I,
I see your point on that a little bit.

1656
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:31,280
And then I also look at like, you got
so many guys that are so good. Yeah.

1657
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:34,010
And boxing is a short window.

1658
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:37,610
So like how long can you stay on to it
until you finally get that chance to

1659
01:35:37,611 --> 01:35:40,280
fight the top guy?
Top Dog.

1660
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:45,360
And anything can happen in boxing
too, you know? Uh, I, I kinda like,

1661
01:35:45,361 --> 01:35:47,060
I may maybe knock it down at three,

1662
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:49,220
but I think when you have
the different way classes,

1663
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:52,610
now you got four people just
say one person has each belt,

1664
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,840
you got four world champs,

1665
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:57,770
now you're looking at these four guys
and you can start taking these price

1666
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,693
prospects.

1667
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:01,610
And I started saying this will be an
interesting fight with this guy and this

1668
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:04,280
guy and then I,
I do believe that they should make,

1669
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:08,150
make happen one undisputed
champ. Yeah, I believe so too.

1670
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:09,950
I think that should happen
in every week class.

1671
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:15,220
They should have a fight off or a box
off and a four champions or you know,

1672
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:19,910
maybe that way keep the prospect's in line
and have the four champions fight off,

1673
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:23,870
you know, who's the undisputed champion
and then your prospects get your shot.

1674
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:27,590
You know, it just seems weird to
have more than one world champion.

1675
01:36:27,591 --> 01:36:30,890
You're either the world champions like
how many guys won the Superbowl this year?

1676
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:34,590
How many teams? One. One,
it should be one. No,

1677
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,590
can't have multiple world champion.

1678
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:39,500
Like when Anthony Joshua was walking
around as a heavyweight champion,

1679
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:42,590
but also Deontay wilder is walking around
is the heavyweight champion. Like what,

1680
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:43,663
what is this?

1681
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:48,140
Are you the heavyweight champion or you
the champion of the organization that

1682
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:49,520
falls into like what kind of,
again,

1683
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:52,160
what we were talking about earlier
with the Jermaine Taylor thing when he

1684
01:36:52,161 --> 01:36:53,930
vacated the belts. Okay. Yeah.

1685
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:58,940
In my mind you want the unified ton of
fire or universal recognizable the ring

1686
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:03,020
middleweight title because where does
the lineal begin? When does it not?

1687
01:37:03,021 --> 01:37:04,160
And I had to ring title.

1688
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:09,380
So usually in most cases during
cuddle is undisputed or Lenneal champ,

1689
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:13,950
just so in other words, d Champa that
way class, you know, it's something,

1690
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:17,690
but for the most part, you know, who is
the champion of a weight class? Well,

1691
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:21,380
ring magazine's title is almost as
valuable as anybody else's. That's one.

1692
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:25,010
And that's the one that I really
showcase when I show people my my case.

1693
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:26,770
You know,
it's so classic too with like the,

1694
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:30,810
the stripes and I think rocky really
did a lot for it. I bought two.

1695
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:35,870
I do. That's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well,
it's a classy look at belt, you know,

1696
01:37:35,871 --> 01:37:38,960
and everybody else has got the big ones
with the leather and the strap like the

1697
01:37:38,961 --> 01:37:42,380
ring magazines. A nice one. Yup.
I wanted to belts, you know,

1698
01:37:42,381 --> 01:37:46,520
I didn't want to pay to sanction and fees
for all four to belts, but I wanted to,

1699
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:51,110
I still wanted to Ibf and a WPA and um,
you don't have to put in the trophy case,

1700
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:55,990
but uh, fortunately lot of fights
filter when you were up, um,

1701
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,190
when you were a kid and you're
watching boxing where Yo Hagler fan,

1702
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,170
I was a Hagler Fan,
but you know,

1703
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:06,650
that's another one that's actually where
we may even have them guys like Manzini

1704
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:09,780
in a Roya from Youngstown
and guys like that.

1705
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,600
I had never really had this
one person that I was like,

1706
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:15,930
or a poster in my bedroom, you
know, like deloit or something.

1707
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,050
You never had one guy that like you
emulated or you were really little.

1708
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:22,900
I emulated everybody and I think that's
what helped me get to this far as I did

1709
01:38:22,901 --> 01:38:25,260
in my career. I mean, even when I was 16,

1710
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:28,470
I could watch a nine year old sparring
and see him do something cool.

1711
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:31,380
It hit a guy and I'd be like, Damn,
you know, I'm going to try that. That,

1712
01:38:31,381 --> 01:38:32,400
that actually might work.

1713
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,940
I followed it and I was just a
big fan of the sport overall.

1714
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:38,010
Of course I had guys
that like, like God, he,

1715
01:38:38,011 --> 01:38:42,120
because of his style coming up and de
la Hoya Sugar Ray Leonard in my opinion,

1716
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:45,550
is probably the one of the best fighters
pound for pound of all time. Um,

1717
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:47,720
and it's arguable.
I mean if somebody says May,

1718
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:50,430
whether I'm not going to say
one of the best for sure. Yeah.

1719
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:53,640
I'm not going to say you're stupid for
having a number one. It's a great debate.

1720
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:57,720
Um, but yeah, so I followed
it more as a fan, you know,

1721
01:38:57,721 --> 01:39:01,560
and I watched and I took from this
person I took from that person. We have,

1722
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:02,191
as I mentioned,

1723
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:06,600
we have some prospects in the amateurs
coming up that train in the same gym and

1724
01:39:06,601 --> 01:39:08,820
I would kind of copy their
style, you know, coming up.

1725
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,190
So I was always trying to keep learning.
Like I even doing,

1726
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:16,260
working out now I find different things
that work, you know, and what don't work.

1727
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:20,880
And uh, that's what I did as far as box.
And I just watched guys I heroin there,

1728
01:39:20,881 --> 01:39:23,430
I have a copy for like two days
de la Hoya style, you know,

1729
01:39:23,431 --> 01:39:25,950
he'd be there with their hands up
and picking them off with the hands.

1730
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:28,170
I go to [inaudible].
I didn't try it in a fight.

1731
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:32,130
I did it in sparring and I will copy his
style a little bit to see how it works

1732
01:39:32,131 --> 01:39:35,340
or how I could add it to my arsenal.
So yeah,

1733
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:38,720
I was just asking about Haggar because
he's sort of the quintessential middle

1734
01:39:38,721 --> 01:39:39,660
weight champion.
You know,

1735
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:44,661
there's like a few guys that you look
back in the day and you look at who were

1736
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:49,500
just iconic middleweight champion your
guys in your late forties and 50s.

1737
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,250
Okay. They'll argue with you that he
was the best middle weight of all time.

1738
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:57,180
He certainly was one of them. Yeah. And
you'll have, you'll have your guys that,

1739
01:39:57,181 --> 01:40:00,270
you know, have Hopkins. Uh, so
that's, that's what I'm saying,

1740
01:40:00,271 --> 01:40:03,030
like even the heavyweights,
you got your holders. Oh,

1741
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:05,520
Joe Muhammad Ali was the best.

1742
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:08,670
Then you have your guys and early
forties told you that Mike Tyson.

1743
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,370
So it's kind of like whoever
grew up on that. Me Personally,

1744
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:12,690
you've got to get past that because again,

1745
01:40:12,691 --> 01:40:16,110
that becomes biased and everybody's going
to kind of go with what they grew up

1746
01:40:16,111 --> 01:40:21,090
with. Um, there was a lot of greats.
Sure. Well, people sleep on Lennox Lewis.

1747
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:24,000
He was, you know, when you
talk about the greats all time,

1748
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:25,140
great heavyweight boxers,

1749
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:29,640
like how the fuck do you not
include Lennox Lewis this
size, the size, the power.

1750
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:34,250
Know. How do you not put Evander Holyfield
you do, you know guys that beat Tyson,

1751
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:37,370
the crazy Riddick Bowe I mean,

1752
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:40,320
we're way smaller than when I was a
helping Arrow called heavyweights right

1753
01:40:40,321 --> 01:40:44,010
there. Crazy era. Yeah, it was the
nineties. Right. And those are the ones,

1754
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:47,670
when you say heavyweight division, those
were the fighters, you know, but it's,

1755
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:51,930
how long ago was that now? You know,
a long time. Some years. And uh,

1756
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:53,860
so it don't around enough.

1757
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,040
Well, what I'm hoping is more emerging
town in the heavyweight division.

1758
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:02,450
We'll sort of take a little bit of this
spotlight that you're seeing now that's

1759
01:41:02,451 --> 01:41:06,680
going on fury and wilder and Joshua
and I'd like to see and you know,

1760
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:08,120
a little bit of our teas.

1761
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:12,470
I like to see more guys get in the mix
there and have it be like it used to be

1762
01:41:12,471 --> 01:41:15,380
back then where there are a bunch
of like really exciting contenders.

1763
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:18,980
He looked forward to these big fights
because right now there's like four guys,

1764
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:22,130
five, six guys at most that
are going to fight each other.

1765
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:25,650
Exactly. And you know, hopefully what
it does is it gets these other bigger,

1766
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:30,540
bigger guys. He's at the athletic
athletes and, and uh, skilled athletes.

1767
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:33,840
It hopefully it brings him
into the boxing again. Did I?

1768
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,680
Did I remember this is David tool
making a comeback? I hope not.

1769
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:42,780
Seriously. How old is he? Shit.

1770
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,390
He gotta be mid forties dude.
He was 46 want,

1771
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,330
maybe it's not, did I make that up that
he's making a comeback? I'm looking to,

1772
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,900
he was a fucking monster.
Fortunately in the heavyweight division,

1773
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:57,510
he probably could get away with
that f 46 I might be able to.

1774
01:41:58,170 --> 01:42:01,350
He was a god Damn Monster.
Uh, well he was short. He was,

1775
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:06,360
he was a hard guy to fight. He was one
of them guys that low to the ground.

1776
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:11,060
Thick, bigger legs. No neck.
Brutal power. Yeah. Good left hook.

1777
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1778
01:42:12,691 --> 01:42:15,770
He's the one who guides you didn't want
to fight even if you were Lennox Lewis,

1779
01:42:15,771 --> 01:42:20,770
his height. Remember when he knocked out
John Ruiz? Yeah. It was brutal. Yeah. No,

1780
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:25,020
he was an animal man and he could take
a shot too. Remember when he fought a I?

1781
01:42:25,021 --> 01:42:27,960
Kobe a Buchi who was the only guy to
go the distance with a bay of Gucci.

1782
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,370
I was another big, he was
a scary motherfucker. Yeah.

1783
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:33,270
And what did he went to jail for?

1784
01:42:33,271 --> 01:42:36,720
Like sexual assault or something crazy
like that. He was in jail for a long time.

1785
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:39,720
We were just talking about another guy to
kind of remind me of the Ummah. Samuel.

1786
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:44,550
Peter's another. Oh yeah,
neck thick. Yeah, he was my,

1787
01:42:44,551 --> 01:42:47,850
I actually, I trained with him a
little bit out a top ranks gym. Um,

1788
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:51,090
when we were fighting. He was
actually a really cool guy, you know,

1789
01:42:51,091 --> 01:42:52,410
and it was a big fan of mine too,

1790
01:42:52,411 --> 01:42:55,550
so it was kind of neat to be able to
share it out with him and you know,

1791
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,950
talk with them before we started
training. That's cool. That's cool.

1792
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,760
And Bay of Gucci, I think. I want
to say that he's getting out soon.

1793
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:08,510
He was in jail for all long time and
apparently there was some article that I

1794
01:43:08,911 --> 01:43:12,300
read a couple of years back that he was
planning on making a comeback when he

1795
01:43:12,301 --> 01:43:16,170
gets released. But again, he's
deep into his forties as well.

1796
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:19,980
And it's hard to make it come back and
no matter if it's heavy weight or not at

1797
01:43:19,981 --> 01:43:21,810
that level,
you don't have to be an hour.

1798
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:26,340
I tell people all the time with even
young kids that are 21 and 22 when it,

1799
01:43:26,341 --> 01:43:27,420
sometimes these promoters,

1800
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:31,830
freezer contractors is a dispute
going on and they sit out two years.

1801
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:35,910
Sometimes they may not ever come back
fully from that. You know what I mean?

1802
01:43:35,911 --> 01:43:39,120
It's true. Especially at that high
of a level, you know, in boxing.

1803
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:42,460
Did Mikey Garcia have a
contract as you did time? Yeah,

1804
01:43:42,461 --> 01:43:44,910
and I was concerned about that
when he came back. You know, I was,

1805
01:43:44,911 --> 01:43:48,300
I was concerned about how much
damage that time off could have done.

1806
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:50,210
How long was this contract as people,

1807
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:55,250
I think it was two over two years
for a top level fighter like him.

1808
01:43:55,341 --> 01:43:57,620
That's a disastrous is and you know,

1809
01:43:57,621 --> 01:44:02,621
but Mikey on the other hand is
a genius and a ring and he just,

1810
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:07,550
he has that going for him, you know?
And uh, he also could fight, you know,

1811
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:10,640
does he's been doing it since he
was so young and being in a family.

1812
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,220
I think the cake came out to
Boone with boxing gloves on.

1813
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:16,550
So there's so many good fights to
be made right now. It's just a,

1814
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:20,360
it's a really exciting time. It's just a
really, really exciting time, which is,

1815
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:23,450
you know, another reason why I'm bummed
out that HBO got out of the game.

1816
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,480
I would like to see HBO come back.

1817
01:44:26,481 --> 01:44:29,360
I mean do you notice talks of it and uh,

1818
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:32,120
I think it would be great for the sport.
Again,

1819
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:35,430
if it came back as big as it did now
don't get me wrong towards the end.

1820
01:44:35,431 --> 01:44:38,270
And it was kind of hard to watch with
some of the fights they had on in my

1821
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:42,980
opinion. You know, it just weren't
interesting. They weren't big fights.

1822
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:45,860
Um, you know, and I think
that was a funding thing.

1823
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:48,260
Like they didn't have
enough of a budget that,

1824
01:44:48,261 --> 01:44:51,970
or I think they knew longer that day
was so they were on the way out. Yeah.

1825
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,680
And saved them money.
You know,

1826
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,860
I don't know how many subscriptions
they lost from that. I,

1827
01:44:57,861 --> 01:45:00,760
I don't know if it hurt or what,
but I asked why I say I,

1828
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:05,750
if they're keeping the fight game open,
an Arrow showing that I see coming back,

1829
01:45:05,751 --> 01:45:09,110
especially if showtime stays with the
boxing and doing as big as they are in a

1830
01:45:09,111 --> 01:45:13,640
box office with the, the numbers I see
Hbo, I think it would have to come back.

1831
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:17,810
Well, I think with things like
Netflix and Amazon prime, they're,

1832
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:22,450
they're making these television shows
now that are so popular and they,

1833
01:45:22,451 --> 01:45:23,480
there's such high budget,

1834
01:45:23,481 --> 01:45:26,870
but you get things like game of
Thrones cost so much money to make,

1835
01:45:26,871 --> 01:45:28,190
but so many people watch it.

1836
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:31,550
I think they're concentrating on
those kind of things cause they're so

1837
01:45:31,551 --> 01:45:34,170
profitable. And I don't think
it's the networks anymore.

1838
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:38,290
I got worry about shutting down to
with all these other, uh, Zulu and,

1839
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:41,240
and Amazon and Netflix being out,
you know, I think some of the,

1840
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:44,870
eventually somebody cable companies are
going to have to worry. Yeah. You know,

1841
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:47,600
I'm sure. Yeah. It seems
like, you know, it's,

1842
01:45:47,601 --> 01:45:52,601
we're entering into a new era
of entertainment technology
and the advancement of

1843
01:45:53,361 --> 01:45:55,770
it, you know, again, these apps people,

1844
01:45:56,120 --> 01:46:01,120
I think that ESPN plus had over 7 million
some a subscribers when it came out

1845
01:46:01,311 --> 01:46:03,700
because of the boxing and
everything else and that,

1846
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:08,390
that does own does the u s or you
know, flights on there and uh, boxing.

1847
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:11,450
So you're going to have these coming out
and people were going to get into it.

1848
01:46:11,451 --> 01:46:15,800
And it's, it's changing. It's changing a
lot. Well, they're doing Beltour fights.

1849
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:19,910
They're doing a lot of fights on
disown. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's, um,

1850
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:23,710
it's very exciting time. You
thought about you, you were saying,

1851
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:26,690
talking a little bit about commentary.
If you thought about doing commentary.

1852
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,620
I have, have you ever done
any of it? No. No, no. But,
uh, I would like to, you know,

1853
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:35,480
honestly, I, I would, uh,
I not knocking anybody.

1854
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,370
I may not be the best
talker in the road either,

1855
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:40,010
but I listened to some of the
guys on there and I'm like,

1856
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:43,040
I think I could do that. You know,
listen, I know you can do it.

1857
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,480
You definitely do it.
Um,

1858
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:48,860
but to me it adds a certain
element when a real world class,

1859
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:52,740
um, is breaking down situations cause
you're getting to see it from their

1860
01:46:52,741 --> 01:46:54,690
perspective of how they would approach it.

1861
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:59,490
It's not just a guy who's
a boxing experts, a guy who
did it, who did it. Yeah.

1862
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:02,700
A guy who was a world champion like
Andre Ward. Like when Andre Ward's on,

1863
01:47:02,701 --> 01:47:06,990
I fucking love that guy as a commentator.
Yeah. All is good to Paulie's Andrei.

1864
01:47:06,991 --> 01:47:10,170
And Pauline is mal analogies. One
of my favorites. He's excellent.

1865
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,290
Damn that motherfucker
talks good fro times.

1866
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,110
Mala noche a little bit,

1867
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:19,710
just said a lot is smart as shit man.
He is,

1868
01:47:19,711 --> 01:47:24,530
he's a and all aspects of life, you
know, he's doing well for himself and uh,

1869
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:29,130
he does the right things. So Paulie's
is a great person. I like him.

1870
01:47:29,131 --> 01:47:31,980
He's a good buddy of mine.
And uh, yeah, it is. You know,

1871
01:47:31,981 --> 01:47:35,940
I think when the fans
like to watch and see,

1872
01:47:35,941 --> 01:47:39,780
you [inaudible] want to hear from the
historian or to guide as the other

1873
01:47:39,781 --> 01:47:42,810
commentator who just knows the
sport and who can speak well.

1874
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:44,400
They lay care in north side of it.
Yes.

1875
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:48,180
But I think at some certain times during
a fight they like to hear from the

1876
01:47:48,181 --> 01:47:50,780
fight or like, Hey, what the hell
is going through that guy's mind?

1877
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:52,830
He just got smashed, you
know, with that right hand.

1878
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,130
Or you get hit with a good body shot
and why does this keep happening again?

1879
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:58,560
Why is, why is he doing this?
What's going on with the flutter?

1880
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:01,650
Thinks should be set in a corner.
You know, they're in between rounds.

1881
01:48:01,651 --> 01:48:04,800
So I think it's important to
have a guy that's been there,

1882
01:48:04,801 --> 01:48:06,390
done it as a commentator.

1883
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:11,550
Andre Ward is another interesting guy
because he's also young and also world

1884
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:16,320
champion undefeated and just decided,
you know what, I'm good. See Ya.

1885
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,090
He is,
he is a right now.

1886
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:21,570
It actually is funny and I'm going to
have to talk about it a little bit.

1887
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:24,990
We were at, I was covering a fight,
the Loma Chanko per draws a fight.

1888
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:29,520
And he comes up to me and I
don't know where, and he's
like, hey, you're like, damn,

1889
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:33,660
you getting big. And he's smiling. He
shakes my hand and he walks down to,

1890
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:34,980
you know,
covered a fight.

1891
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:39,390
And I'm sitting there and look at watching
the fights and then I'm getting ready

1892
01:48:39,391 --> 01:48:41,490
to head out after, you
know, the fights about over.

1893
01:48:41,491 --> 01:48:45,900
And he comes walking up and he goes,
hey, if the offered you $10 million,

1894
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:48,750
would you make a come
back? I'm like, fuck you.

1895
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:53,080
I couldn't find a reason why I wasn't.
Um, I don't know. And he won't.

1896
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:56,310
He smiled and he walked away and I was
going, I'm scratching my head, I'm going,

1897
01:48:56,311 --> 01:49:00,730
I wonder why. You know why he would
ask me a question like that. Yeah.

1898
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:05,520
I seen recently that he's looking at as
certain fighters as a possible comeback.

1899
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:08,100
Oh, so he's thinking about doing
it again? Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1900
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:13,500
It's so real.
It's so itchy.

1901
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:17,310
I just don't think you're ever going to
find anything that's going to recreate

1902
01:49:17,311 --> 01:49:19,770
the highs of like when you
knocked out Tremaine tailor.

1903
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:24,620
How the fuck could you recreate
that high? You can't. You can't.

1904
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:28,050
That combination when you pin them in
the corner and put them away and then you

1905
01:49:28,051 --> 01:49:32,400
walk away and you realize that you one
holy shit and that don't even kick it

1906
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:34,800
ness all going a hundred miles an hour,
you're up on that.

1907
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:36,630
I see the pictures all the time,

1908
01:49:36,631 --> 01:49:41,631
all that up with the hands in the air and
I see all the people and you know that

1909
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:45,420
that's just, it was so
fast, you know? It took me

1910
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:50,980
wow. Before I could, I even know I walked
back out of my house and I had him up.

1911
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:54,040
You know on the side, this was before I
still live with my parents at the time.

1912
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:55,780
And I did too.

1913
01:49:55,781 --> 01:49:59,490
I had a pulpit at the house and I'd be
leaving to go to the gym or something and

1914
01:49:59,491 --> 01:50:03,790
I look over at the boats and um, I go,
wow, you know what? Those are mine.

1915
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:07,390
But it never really kicked in until
like a little while later. Like,

1916
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:11,960
those are my fucking boats. You don't
like add that I did that. That I'm,

1917
01:50:11,961 --> 01:50:15,070
I'm the role champion. Not only I've
got one, but I got three of them.

1918
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:19,610
When you're lying in bed that night,
you probably had to be going, well,

1919
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:24,400
what am I in a fucking dream? That's what
it felt like. It is. What fight this was.

1920
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:25,810
God Damn,
this was a fight.

1921
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:30,640
This was one of my all time favorite
middleweight championship fights for sure.

1922
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:35,200
And Jermaine Taylor, man, he
was a bad motherfucker. He
wasn't. And again, you know,

1923
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:38,200
a lot of people talked about the handful
of flights before that and a tough,

1924
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:42,520
you know, with smaller guys, but he was
a bronze medalist who beat, you know,

1925
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:43,740
demand Bernard Hopkins.
There.

1926
01:50:43,741 --> 01:50:48,100
It is doom the combination
when you put them away too.

1927
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:50,890
Fucking phenomenal man.
Phenomenal.

1928
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:56,110
This right here when you want it was
all bore. I just put my hands up.

1929
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:00,000
Yup. Fuck man. I mean
what that feeling like?

1930
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:02,710
Try to describe that.
Like what is going through your head?

1931
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,350
Everything possible for
him not to get back up.

1932
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:08,170
And I know it sounds funny when people
say that, but that's the truth. You know,

1933
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:11,620
my big thing was if I got somebody hurt,

1934
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:14,840
get them out because boxing
is dangerous. Right. You know,

1935
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:17,020
and anything can happen
and they could get back up.

1936
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:20,140
They have a chance that knocking
you out or beaten you. So,

1937
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:25,970
but when it was over, like what does that
feel like? It's, it's hard to explain it.

1938
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,500
It really is. You're just,
you're, you're on cloud nine,

1939
01:51:29,501 --> 01:51:32,350
you just not naked bring you down.
You know, you're, you're, uh,

1940
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:36,280
you went from being a proud open means
is through the roof to be in a world

1941
01:51:36,281 --> 01:51:40,120
champion. To be in a huge
superstar unboxing. Yeah.

1942
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,170
And it's hard to grasp at
once and it takes time.

1943
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:49,030
And unfortunately sometimes you get it
when it's too late. You know what I mean?

1944
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:53,520
You really grasp it and it's just one
of them things. It's, you know, even,

1945
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:57,310
I was talking with a guy
last night and he brought up,

1946
01:51:57,311 --> 01:52:00,580
he was originally from South
Korea and he was talking about,

1947
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:03,700
he goes there all the time, big
business guy and he says, uh,

1948
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:08,800
they actually just studied my fight down
or something on how you can get knocked

1949
01:52:08,801 --> 01:52:12,070
down. This is more of, you know,
in your field of up your alley,

1950
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:15,610
how you get knocked down to
what gets a guy to get back up.

1951
01:52:16,150 --> 01:52:17,920
Every cover to recovery,

1952
01:52:17,921 --> 01:52:21,250
the endurance to pretty much
have your brain's rattled,

1953
01:52:21,251 --> 01:52:25,390
but be able to come back that strong
Brown's later and knock somebody out,

1954
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:30,100
you know? And for me to support answer
is, you know, of course training hard,

1955
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:33,920
you know, making sure I'm in shape, but
I guess what he's trying to figure out,

1956
01:52:33,921 --> 01:52:37,830
I was like, what's, what's the,
the brainwave pattern wise said,

1957
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,820
what's the drive that gets you to do that?
What is the endurance of the muscles?

1958
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:45,890
And you know, that's pretty
deep thinking and a little pass.

1959
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,570
I think there's a lot there.
There's a lot, and there's no one.

1960
01:52:50,571 --> 01:52:54,440
First of all, every combination that you
get hit with is different. You know, some,

1961
01:52:54,441 --> 01:52:57,760
some combinations you're just not going
to get up from. And some of them you,

1962
01:52:57,761 --> 01:53:01,310
you were on the border. Can
you get up? Can you not get
up? How bad do you want it?

1963
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:02,480
Maybe think about your daughter.

1964
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:06,200
Maybe you think about your mom and you
just kept this burst of adrenaline and

1965
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:09,680
you're like, fuck this. I'm getting up.
And the referee gives you the count.

1966
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:12,440
He just fight smart.
Keep your hands up and keep moving.

1967
01:53:12,441 --> 01:53:16,070
The next thing you know that cardio kicks
in and then you're back at Tyson fury.

1968
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,070
That's the way I looked at it. That's
like the simple way of looking at it.

1969
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:23,360
Tyson fury against wilder. By all
rights, that fight should have been done.

1970
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:28,780
He lands that right hand and then that
left hook and you see Tyson fewer go

1971
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:32,150
down. Like he got hit in the
head with an asteroid. Boom.

1972
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:34,750
He's just flat on his back.
Like Holy Shit.

1973
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:38,330
He knocked him out in the 12th round
and then everybody thought he did the

1974
01:53:38,331 --> 01:53:41,560
undertaker. He sat up. Yes. You know what?

1975
01:53:41,561 --> 01:53:46,010
I like memes and gifs of him sitting
up and like they showed the undertaker

1976
01:53:46,011 --> 01:53:49,460
doing it with that right there.
I think a little different from mine.

1977
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:52,790
I personally believe that he
wasn't hurt that bad. Really.

1978
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:54,710
I believe that he got dropped it.
That was legit,

1979
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:58,350
but he was laying there taking
the eight, nine seconds, you know,

1980
01:53:58,351 --> 01:54:00,230
to recover and he got up.

1981
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:05,180
I don't think he was out because
there's no real way to be out that cold.

1982
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:09,000
I don't to get up,
get up and the hand of Jesus,

1983
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:14,360
Jesus came down upon him. Man,
this watch that knocked down.

1984
01:54:14,361 --> 01:54:16,330
Pull up that knockdown. Yup. Um,

1985
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:20,240
I feel like that was one of the
most fucking bizarre is my common.

1986
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:23,810
We're talking about that as far as
like what's going through your head?

1987
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:27,380
It's crazy because when I got knocked
down, it was more of an equilibrium shot.

1988
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:29,720
But I could hear my legs were gone,

1989
01:54:29,721 --> 01:54:32,540
but I can hear a certain people in the
stands and I knew what was going on.

1990
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:35,720
And the first thing that was in my head
was when you worked way too hard to go

1991
01:54:35,721 --> 01:54:39,170
out like this. So it is that
drive. Yeah, here it is right here.

1992
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:44,090
What's crazy is that wilder,
look at this. Boom. I mean,

1993
01:54:44,091 --> 01:54:48,380
come on man. This dude, he's fun.

1994
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:53,420
Fucking hurt. He's fucking
hurt. Something happened.

1995
01:54:53,421 --> 01:54:58,160
Jesus came down upon him. That's why
it's, that's why I was saying I think,

1996
01:54:58,161 --> 01:55:02,120
I don't know. Maybe he was hurt. I mean,
he went down, he went down pretty bad.

1997
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,670
He wouldn't talk quick.
Incredible.

1998
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:08,540
And then his ability to recover and the
fact that he's not the best in shape guy

1999
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:12,400
either. You don't think so? Well, I mean
we kept moving for 12 fucking rallies.

2000
01:55:12,401 --> 01:55:16,310
Yeah, he did do that. But to be
able to get up that quick, well,

2001
01:55:16,311 --> 01:55:20,640
how was he not the best in shape guy?
I mean to be six foot. That's a funky,

2002
01:55:20,641 --> 01:55:25,460
crazy knocked out and then while that
does the sleazy gray shape for for a

2003
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:28,940
heavyweight, you can put it that
way. I see what you're saying. Yeah.

2004
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:32,390
Well no heavyweight is ever going to
be in the same kind of shape that say,

2005
01:55:32,391 --> 01:55:35,180
Oh yeah your weight's going to be in just
because you're carrying around so much

2006
01:55:35,181 --> 01:55:35,690
body weight.

2007
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:40,690
But I was saying from the point of getting
up that quick after being dropped and

2008
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:44,160
not to be stumbling and falling over.
It's true.

2009
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:47,970
I mean he just came back and that's why
I'm thinking more so like yeah he got

2010
01:55:47,971 --> 01:55:49,740
hurt and I'm probably wrong on this,

2011
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:52,470
but I'm saying like yeah he got hurt
and he's laying there and he's going to

2012
01:55:52,471 --> 01:55:56,370
shit, let me just, let's watch it.
Here it comes. That fucking missile

2013
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,273
and then this one,

2014
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:06,360
I mean come on son timber.
That's, that is some crazy shit.

2015
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:11,220
They said he hit his head but he did not.
I let them, people say he hit his head,

2016
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:14,330
bounced off the Mat, it never
bounced off the mat. He,

2017
01:56:14,331 --> 01:56:16,740
he kept his head up as he was going back,

2018
01:56:16,741 --> 01:56:21,741
which lets you know that he was
conscious but doom and Bob boom.

2019
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:25,230
I mean he got fucking rocked,

2020
01:56:25,490 --> 01:56:28,920
but I wish they would've had an overview
because you could tell by the eyes also.

2021
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:30,271
Right,
right.

2022
01:56:30,271 --> 01:56:33,930
Whether or not the rolled back in his
head to the side cardio is significant.

2023
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:37,260
If you're in great cardio shape, you
recover quicker. You know there's,

2024
01:56:37,261 --> 01:56:39,630
there's a bunch of different
factors in why you recover quicker.

2025
01:56:39,631 --> 01:56:43,590
Your mindset has to play a factor.
Right. How bad you want it.

2026
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,431
That's what I'm saying.
I mean,

2027
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:46,860
no doubt he was hurt from
that bunch and he went down.

2028
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:50,700
I was just thinking for that period of
time was he laying her also saying I'm

2029
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:54,480
going to take the full eight and nine
to get up or like you said, did a,

2030
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:59,450
did a hand come down upon him
and rose from the dead. Yup.

2031
01:56:59,610 --> 01:57:04,170
He's just a tough motherfucker man. And
a good guy too. Super fucking smart guy.

2032
01:57:04,171 --> 01:57:06,270
Funny. Yeah. I mean, what a character.

2033
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:10,350
And now when you were training
and you were doing yours,

2034
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,000
your strength and conditioning,
did you,

2035
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:16,710
will you like an old school method guy
or did you use heart rate monitors and

2036
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:21,270
all the new school methods?
No, I was, I, I liked the, uh,
functional shrank training.

2037
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:23,010
I did a lot of that.
What kind of stuff?

2038
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:26,910
I do a sledge hammer and tire pushing.

2039
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:32,100
Matt Brown, uh, has a, a great, uh,
he's got a, what is Matt's company?

2040
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:33,480
Give us his company a plug.

2041
01:57:33,810 --> 01:57:36,660
I think it's a immortal something
strength and conditioning,

2042
01:57:36,690 --> 01:57:40,140
but he's got a great bunch of, uh, um,

2043
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:43,560
he's got sledge hammers but with a
rounded head so you don't have to fucking

2044
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:47,370
swinging around and uh, and mortal combat
equipment, mortal combat equipment.

2045
01:57:47,371 --> 01:57:50,820
He's got a great sled to
the stack weights on and uh,

2046
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:55,620
he left a lot of that stuff
out there. These grip. Yeah,
the war wagon. A lot of uh,

2047
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:59,730
different, uh, grip
strength, the apparatus,

2048
01:57:59,731 --> 01:58:03,570
things like balls at you, uh, do chin ups
for those, those balls on the far left.

2049
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:07,590
You do a chin up script. And those
things. Yeah, it's got some great shit.

2050
01:58:08,010 --> 01:58:13,000
Those slopes depths pushing,
pushing a trucks. Um,

2051
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:14,750
and what else did we get into it?

2052
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,360
I would go to this place called ironman
warehouse and it was kind of a nice

2053
01:58:18,361 --> 01:58:21,990
setup there too. And it was more
for like the, the, the gym owner.

2054
01:58:21,991 --> 01:58:24,330
I love him to death and he is crazy.
He truly is.

2055
01:58:24,331 --> 01:58:28,800
And he's about 48 now and he could still
Rondi runs with a matter of fact at the,

2056
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:31,350
my role title fight against
Taylor at the boardwalk.

2057
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:32,930
Everybody kept talking about,

2058
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:36,630
we were like 4,000 people talking about
this crazy guy running on a beach.

2059
01:58:36,631 --> 01:58:41,080
But I think the log was like 120 pounds
just running. You don't want to stop.

2060
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:44,230
Yeah. Real Christian Guy, you
know, intuit and he does all that.

2061
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:48,270
He runs all the piece races with
that. Um, phenomenal shape. It,

2062
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:51,760
well you had a place down in [inaudible]
was the functional strength training.

2063
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:56,410
You know, I do pull ups on fire hoses
and put a gripping and everything else.

2064
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:02,200
That's why I like Joe. And that was, you
know, cause I wasn't building muscle. Um,

2065
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:05,950
but I was getting strong as hell and I
was getting also a lot of cardio work

2066
01:59:05,951 --> 01:59:10,000
involved in that. But for the
most part it was the, uh, the,

2067
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:14,040
the sres. Yeah, the Roman road.

2068
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:19,050
A log on here is this motherfucker
running around with a log that can be good

2069
01:59:19,061 --> 01:59:23,620
for your names. I wonder how he's
walking right now. Like right now,

2070
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:26,920
I see guys do screw, screw,
screw, shit like that. I go, okay,

2071
01:59:26,921 --> 01:59:29,830
you can do that right now, but let me
see what you look like in six months.

2072
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:32,620
Let me call you back. I'm gonna
call you doing it for a long time.

2073
01:59:32,621 --> 01:59:33,820
I don't know how he does it.

2074
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:39,250
That's so much weight on your joints to
be running with 120 pound log on your

2075
01:59:39,251 --> 01:59:42,280
shoulders is a freaking nature.
What does that show?

2076
01:59:42,281 --> 01:59:43,990
The Ninja Warrior or whatever.

2077
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:48,880
I truly believed that he could go into
that and do very well on that. I mean,

2078
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:50,680
he had to,
at the ironman warehouse,

2079
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:54,210
they had the little balls and he
swings from each one up there. Uh,

2080
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:56,170
he takes the 45 pound plates,

2081
01:59:56,820 --> 02:00:00,400
he throws them up in the air and
it catches them back coming down.

2082
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,810
Just crazy things like that.

2083
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:04,630
And that's where I went to
train after the Miranda fight.

2084
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:07,510
I was doing all that shit on
my own for the Miranda fight.

2085
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,170
And then after the Miranda, he
had told me, he goes, Kelly,

2086
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:12,310
I got this place down here.
Come down and try it out.

2087
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:16,900
And I was doing all that crazy stuff, man.
And it worked it again. That was strong.

2088
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,120
The only thing that I wish I
could have went back with that,

2089
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:22,750
and now as time goes on and I'm
training some athletes at my gym,

2090
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:28,180
is we have this machine called a Virta
backs PC equipment. And it's amazing.

2091
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:32,860
I mean, it truly is. You could emulate,
um, more so than you can with the bands.

2092
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,830
What you're doing. If you're
a football player, you know,

2093
02:00:35,831 --> 02:00:39,240
you want to come off Verdun Max Max is,

2094
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:43,990
it's an amazing clinic for a rest.
Right? There is for wrestlers,

2095
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:45,370
is it,

2096
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:50,260
are these bands like elastic
button but as okay as no straps.

2097
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,320
Okay.
With the rubber band you,

2098
02:00:53,321 --> 02:00:57,130
your attention is usually gone at the
beginning and then get to get to a certain

2099
02:00:57,131 --> 02:01:00,770
point to get it as where this has
resistance all the way through. Oh,

2100
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:02,680
police system.

2101
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:06,730
It is a pulley system and you can set
the tension on it on the back part.

2102
02:01:06,731 --> 02:01:09,210
You could pull out and make it
a little harder. The tension,

2103
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:10,480
but it's unbelievable.

2104
02:01:10,530 --> 02:01:13,360
So when you go back down there's tension
all the way through from beginning to

2105
02:01:13,361 --> 02:01:16,670
end fast twitch muscle and um,

2106
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,660
a lot of wrestlers are
using it. Ooh, I like that.

2107
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:24,010
So I wish they had that because a lot
adding that in with the functional

2108
02:01:24,011 --> 02:01:27,250
strength training could have
definitely made a me a lot better.

2109
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:28,840
And I think it could
for a lot of athletes.

2110
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:32,490
That seems like you could do everything
with that thing. Yup. That's amazing.

2111
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:36,610
They had the wrap there also, which is
very good. It's the same concept as that,

2112
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:39,190
but you put it up on a fence
and you could run out farther,

2113
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:42,560
do different things on the raptor.
Also would that thing,

2114
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:45,800
could you do like shoulder exercises
and stuff like that as well?

2115
02:01:45,801 --> 02:01:47,210
You just have to prop it up.

2116
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:51,860
I've been screwing around with it at
my gym and I found ways to do flies on

2117
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:54,890
putting a little, um, balance boards.

2118
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:58,070
I put that down on it and I can get
the straps where you could do flies.

2119
02:01:58,070 --> 02:02:02,150
What a shoulder exercise at core.
You know, especially with the raptor,

2120
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:06,050
you could walk out with that. And what is
the raptor? It goes on the wall. You can,

2121
02:02:06,051 --> 02:02:08,240
it's more for like travel,
see if you find that thing.

2122
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:11,330
So you could put it on the fence
at a baseball field and just swing.

2123
02:02:11,331 --> 02:02:15,530
You could even do a Gulf street is
right there. Yeah. Verdun Max Raptor.

2124
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:20,210
Uh, wow. Look at called the golf swing.

2125
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:23,810
And can you adjust the tension? Yes.
Is this on the back? So you'll pull it,

2126
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:27,860
they have little black spots that uh,
tell you, you know, it goes up to three,

2127
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,520
three spots. So that seems like that'd be
great for punching power as well. It is.

2128
02:02:31,521 --> 02:02:34,710
And the thing is, you don't want too much
tension with that. I tried to explain,

2129
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:38,660
I got some people that work with the guys
at my gym on it and they trained them

2130
02:02:38,661 --> 02:02:41,660
more like an endurance thing. And I
tell him, you're defeating the purpose,

2131
02:02:41,661 --> 02:02:46,190
you know, there, there's a place in time
for strength and endurance socially,

2132
02:02:46,191 --> 02:02:50,180
a boxer, a guys running in the morning,
he's sitting pads at the gym. You had,

2133
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,750
I really think that should be focused on
the explosion. Don't go to your chair.

2134
02:02:53,751 --> 02:02:57,500
You're tired. I want every rep,
every movement to have explosion.

2135
02:02:57,650 --> 02:03:02,510
Roy Jones Jr. Yeah, yeah. That's amazing.

2136
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:04,520
So you just,
uh,

2137
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:08,560
it's just enough resistance so that
everything that you do just get too much

2138
02:03:08,570 --> 02:03:11,450
resistance and you're not going to be
able to really fire off the fast twitch.

2139
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:12,890
Right. Right. Now,

2140
02:03:12,891 --> 02:03:16,490
the only thing I see also that could hurt
people is that they do a whole workout

2141
02:03:16,491 --> 02:03:18,140
with that Dow.
What happens?

2142
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:21,740
You eventually get tired and fatigued
and then all your motion is slow.

2143
02:03:21,741 --> 02:03:24,470
So now you fall into a habit of
that. You know, I like to work,

2144
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:27,250
I'm on it for about 15, 20 minutes. Um,

2145
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:31,190
take them off and then have them do the
same exercises with it after what? No,

2146
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:32,150
no resistance.

2147
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:35,750
And then it just keep it that day
just with the fast twitch muscle,

2148
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:37,280
the small muscle training.

2149
02:03:37,281 --> 02:03:41,660
And then the next day we go into strength
or endurance. So are you training guys?

2150
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:45,260
I'm right now passing on
this. Jim and I have a, yeah.

2151
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:46,850
And I have one box and
the name of your gym.

2152
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:50,980
My Gym and was called Mine and my
gym. So we had, we had changed. Yeah.

2153
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:55,650
Because I've already had my gym. And
why Jim [inaudible]. Jim, yeah, me, Jim,

2154
02:03:56,150 --> 02:04:00,570
Jim. Come on down to the
gym by the Spanish my, yeah,

2155
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:04,760
or at a time. Yeah, no, we got, uh,
I'm doing that with them right now.

2156
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:08,240
It's fun working with a strength.
And conditioning, you know,

2157
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:11,630
I am also going to be doing a boxing
gym at the end of the summer, hopefully.

2158
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:15,800
And it's going to happen. It's
just a matter of time. Now,

2159
02:04:15,801 --> 02:04:18,620
when you were training
and you were fighting, um,

2160
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:21,560
did you have a specific schedule of when
you would do strength and conditioning

2161
02:04:21,561 --> 02:04:22,850
and how many days a week you would run?

2162
02:04:22,851 --> 02:04:27,020
How many days a week you would do like
physical exercises. Yeah. You know,

2163
02:04:27,021 --> 02:04:29,990
and that's another thing. You
all, as I've said earlier too,

2164
02:04:29,991 --> 02:04:33,350
you always keep learning, you
know, and it was never, I wasn't,

2165
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:37,010
it worked for me for what I did when I
was fighting and that would totally have

2166
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:37,980
it now

2167
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,800
knowing the stuff that I know and,
and you know, being involved in it,

2168
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:45,450
researching and, um, you know, we used
to run Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

2169
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:50,430
three miles, and then take Thursday off
on Friday and Saturday. And then we do,

2170
02:04:50,431 --> 02:04:51,770
on top of that,
I would go to your,

2171
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:54,630
my strength and conditioning training
and now we've got the boxing gym.

2172
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:59,550
That's a lot. Yeah, that's a lot on the
body too. And, um, you know, as we're,

2173
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:02,910
like when I went to California,
we did Monday, Wednesday,

2174
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:05,370
Friday running and it was only
two and a half, three miles.

2175
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:09,000
And then in those days in between we did
a strength and conditioning training.

2176
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:12,660
Um, so I didn't have a preference
on that. I didn't care. Um,

2177
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:15,510
the only thing I did say is I didn't
want to run early in the morning.

2178
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:19,470
Why is that?
Because I didn't get going.

2179
02:05:19,830 --> 02:05:22,800
I wasn't one of those guys in the morning
and it happens to people, you know,

2180
02:05:22,801 --> 02:05:24,300
like if I wouldn't ran too early,

2181
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:28,370
I would end up being the film like shit
the rest of the day really you got,

2182
02:05:28,371 --> 02:05:28,711
you know,

2183
02:05:28,711 --> 02:05:33,480
like it was just dragging ass as where
when I went and ran at like nine 30 in

2184
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:35,450
the morning,
I got my best run,

2185
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:39,040
I killed it and then I felt
great the rest of the day. What,

2186
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:42,560
how much sleep would you make sure
you had? That was a tough one.

2187
02:05:42,561 --> 02:05:44,540
I got about seven to eight hours.
Yeah.

2188
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:48,120
They say you need eight and you really
should try to get 10 when you're a

2189
02:05:48,121 --> 02:05:50,590
professional athlete.
I took my Sundays off and,

2190
02:05:50,591 --> 02:05:53,820
and I rested all day Sunday
and that kind of aid, you know,

2191
02:05:53,821 --> 02:05:57,470
a good amount of carbs and kind of what
I wanted to on, on Sundays, you know,

2192
02:05:57,471 --> 02:06:02,200
depending on where to wait was out, how
far out we were from to fight. But um,

2193
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:02,701
I don't,

2194
02:06:02,701 --> 02:06:07,320
I really don't believe in the theory of
you got to wake your guy up at four in

2195
02:06:07,321 --> 02:06:11,190
the morning and make them run.
I don't if I was training guys,

2196
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:14,190
I want my guy to run out whatever
I'm going to get the best run out of.

2197
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:15,960
That's what time I want him to run.

2198
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:20,490
He'll adapt and especially after he
keeps fighting and he'll adapt this more

2199
02:06:20,491 --> 02:06:22,500
mind over body.
Um,

2200
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:25,560
but I think the gym is not negotiable.

2201
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:29,340
Three o'clock I like to train and
if I was trading guys, my Gemara,

2202
02:06:29,341 --> 02:06:32,730
it would be between three and seven.
Why do you like late afternoons?

2203
02:06:32,970 --> 02:06:36,600
Because it gets you closer to the fight
night, especially closer to a fight.

2204
02:06:36,601 --> 02:06:40,020
I would like to actually from my guys
and train about eight o'clock at night,

2205
02:06:40,021 --> 02:06:43,980
nine o'clock depending on what they have
and are going on in a personal life.

2206
02:06:43,981 --> 02:06:48,000
So you have like a clock so your body
has like a time that it knows it's going

2207
02:06:48,001 --> 02:06:51,850
to work and I didn't do that.
What did you do? I sparred,

2208
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:57,020
you know for three but if I'm talking
about me being a trainer I would like that

2209
02:06:57,241 --> 02:07:01,950
for my fighters. So what you've learned
from your career, you just apply it? Yeah.

2210
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:06,450
The only thing I would really take from
it would be the running in the morning.

2211
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:08,730
You know,
if my guy want to said hey coach,

2212
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:12,570
I'd rather run after the gym tonight
and I knew that that was going to make a

2213
02:07:12,571 --> 02:07:15,420
difference in a minute on his mouth.
Okay.

2214
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:17,790
Run at night cause I want them
to get the best run. Pause.

2215
02:07:18,290 --> 02:07:22,350
That's the most important. So did you
run for speed? Did you do sprints?

2216
02:07:22,351 --> 02:07:25,260
Did you do long distance running? Like
what did, what kind of running did you do?

2217
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:28,500
I did do sprints. We added, I wish
we could've done more, but you know,

2218
02:07:28,501 --> 02:07:31,920
I was big with the uh, steps
to and we have ours. Yeah.

2219
02:07:31,921 --> 02:07:35,740
Youngstown State University and Youngstown
and it got one side that's pretty big

2220
02:07:35,741 --> 02:07:36,340
as steep,

2221
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:36,611
you know,

2222
02:07:36,611 --> 02:07:40,260
and it goes up and I would do that
probably about three times at Camp for

2223
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:40,671
unbeliever believer,

2224
02:07:40,671 --> 02:07:43,450
you've got to watch how many times you
do that throughout a camp because it

2225
02:07:43,451 --> 02:07:46,360
builds muscle, especially running
that high, you know, down the steps.

2226
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:49,070
And then when you start cutting
to wait and you got to get down,

2227
02:07:49,071 --> 02:07:51,280
this is going to be hard
to lose that extra pound,

2228
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:54,940
which could make a big
difference. Come fight night.
So for a six, eight week camp,

2229
02:07:54,941 --> 02:07:57,290
you would only run it three times,
three times interested.

2230
02:07:57,470 --> 02:08:01,270
Then I had sprints on the hills and
I did regular sprints because regular

2231
02:08:01,271 --> 02:08:04,720
sprints is firing that fast twitch muscle
and is also hitting a big muscle in

2232
02:08:04,721 --> 02:08:08,710
his building. The legs and, and strength.
Um, distance was, was important,

2233
02:08:08,711 --> 02:08:13,060
but still another big one to
me is the pad work. You know,

2234
02:08:13,061 --> 02:08:16,360
the training at the gym.
I'm not a big fan of bag work.

2235
02:08:16,450 --> 02:08:18,460
Anybody hitting the punching bag?
How come?

2236
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:23,640
Because you learn how to
manipulate the bag of trick your,

2237
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:27,400
your trainer and everybody else.
I can go ahead and bag right now.

2238
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,270
I probably do 10 rounds on it, you know,
just because I know how hard to punch.

2239
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:33,730
It's hard to tell us to worry
when you're hitting pads.

2240
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:38,140
I know how hard my guys punching and I'm
giving him the combos in a numbers so

2241
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:42,160
he has to concentrate on what you want
them to do and he's not throwing the

2242
02:08:42,161 --> 02:08:45,940
punches that he wants. You know
what I mean? So it's easier.

2243
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:47,880
I mean it's harder than it in the bag.
Um,

2244
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:51,490
I think that's a big part of the
training. You know, that I would do it,

2245
02:08:51,491 --> 02:08:55,480
the guys and, and it's, it makes
a big difference overall. Um,

2246
02:08:55,510 --> 02:09:00,510
did you do like a lot of drills in
term in terms of like a movement trills

2247
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:06,010
movement, drills with combinations? Like
how to not, not, not at home either.

2248
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:09,940
You know, I didn't when I
trained in a young stone. No, no.

2249
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:15,380
I learned a lot of that. You know, when
I went to California from Garcia. Yeah.

2250
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:18,880
So that was that one of the reasons
why you were saying like, man,

2251
02:09:18,881 --> 02:09:21,100
it was amazing that I can learn.
Cause you know,

2252
02:09:21,101 --> 02:09:23,230
I was cocky and I'm going to fuck,

2253
02:09:23,231 --> 02:09:26,300
they going to show me after 12 years of
being pros and awesome trainer. Yeah.

2254
02:09:26,301 --> 02:09:30,670
You know, I was cocky. What?
I'm like, I got all of these
fights and I was, you know,

2255
02:09:30,671 --> 02:09:35,170
great amateur, what more can you show
me? And I went out there and I learned,

2256
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:39,550
you know, you can't be taught and uh,
taking nothing away from, you know,

2257
02:09:39,551 --> 02:09:43,240
Jack and my trainer at home. I mean
that guy, he got me ready though.

2258
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,720
Like if you're fighting,
I was in shape, you know,

2259
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:47,410
it was like a drill sergeant on that.

2260
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:51,300
And you'll have another little thing on
that which of running, you know, submit.

2261
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:55,330
I think now I would have my guys
run on grass track was boring.

2262
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:57,130
I don't care if you're bored running,
you know,

2263
02:09:57,131 --> 02:09:58,120
you're going to run around a track.

2264
02:09:58,121 --> 02:10:02,920
It's easier on the joints and
a lusty man on the body. But,

2265
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:05,680
uh, so overall, I mean there's
a lot. That's why I like it.

2266
02:10:05,681 --> 02:10:08,980
That's why I like being involved right
now with the strength and conditioning

2267
02:10:08,981 --> 02:10:11,920
gym because I'm working with people,
getting them healthy, helping them out,

2268
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:16,230
and eventually I could add a lot of
this to my fighters, you know? Yeah.

2269
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:20,790
There's a long education when it comes
to physical fitness, the long education,

2270
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:24,910
understanding how much is too much,
when's the right time to do things.

2271
02:10:24,911 --> 02:10:26,350
And that's one of the
reasons why I was asking you,

2272
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:30,910
like how did you decide if you're going
to do three times over the course of a,

2273
02:10:30,911 --> 02:10:34,010
um, a training camp, you're going to run
those stairs. How did you decide that?

2274
02:10:34,011 --> 02:10:36,350
Was that a strength conditioning
coach at the side of that? No,

2275
02:10:36,351 --> 02:10:39,470
that was just because, yes, cause
I didn't want it. The muscle,

2276
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,740
I knew where he come and
wait on you. Yeah. Yeah.

2277
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:43,700
A couple times when when
you're starting to dry out,

2278
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:45,440
you're going to wish
that you kind of didn't.

2279
02:10:45,441 --> 02:10:49,680
But I always was afraid of the back that,
you know, of the second guessing my,

2280
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:53,310
my conditioning. So I always
wanted to be strong, you know,

2281
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:57,020
and again that the stuff like that
Verda Max that wasn't out yet. You know,

2282
02:10:57,021 --> 02:10:59,600
we had the bands and we do
some of the exercises on that.

2283
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:02,210
I had never researched
much at that time either.

2284
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:04,340
I was in great shape and
I was strong as a mule,

2285
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:07,310
but there was other things
like being athletic,

2286
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:10,250
I started eventually towards the
end doing some cross training.

2287
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:13,400
You said you're a big fan of
that. Yeah, I absolutely am. Also,

2288
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:15,840
I think becoming a great athlete overall.

2289
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:17,990
There's nothing wrong
with that and it's fun.

2290
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:22,160
It breaks up the monotony of the
same training regimen all the time.

2291
02:11:22,430 --> 02:11:25,340
Do you remember when they
didn't want you to lift weights?

2292
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:29,760
They didn't want boxers to lift weights
before Mackey, she'll stone, uh,

2293
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:33,260
before he worked with um,
uh, Michael Spinks when he,

2294
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:36,230
when he moved up to heavyweight
and fought Larry Holmes. I mean,

2295
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:41,130
remember people were saying like,
they don't want boxers to lift weights,

2296
02:11:41,131 --> 02:11:43,760
that it's going to tighten you up
and slow you down. Like that was,

2297
02:11:43,761 --> 02:11:45,200
that was the thought process behind it.

2298
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:49,070
And then from him and then in particular
Holyfield and Holyfield went from

2299
02:11:49,071 --> 02:11:51,770
cruiserweight to heavyweight
and he put on a lot of mass.

2300
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:54,740
That was Mackey shields stone too,
right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean that,

2301
02:11:55,490 --> 02:12:00,190
that just changed the game.
Jamie.

2302
02:12:00,370 --> 02:12:02,860
That's your guy. But I don't want to
make them have to keep searching thing.

2303
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:05,840
He loves it. They actually asked
if you could put in, um, yeah.

2304
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:10,470
Kelly pelvic workout workouts.
A training. We had a guy to,

2305
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:14,280
what's the wait, I did do weight lifting
when you were, when I was fighting. Yeah.

2306
02:12:14,410 --> 02:12:17,620
But I, and I do agree. What's the weight
lifting and I don't agree with it.

2307
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:20,800
I don't think you should go heavy with
the weight lifting if you're going to get

2308
02:12:20,801 --> 02:12:25,150
your strength. I absolutely.
Um, look how thin you are, man.

2309
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:27,330
Broad training. Slim bastard. Yeah.

2310
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:30,370
Trey put a training with rock at
Rocky's or something like that.

2311
02:12:30,371 --> 02:12:32,850
That was California. Yeah.
There you go. That second one.

2312
02:12:34,110 --> 02:12:34,943
MMM.

2313
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:39,820
Yeah, I see the lightweight. Yeah. Well
we would do hundreds and hundreds of reps.

2314
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:42,340
Just endurance stuff. Burn, just burning.

2315
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:45,170
When you look at yourself without
all the tattoos to go, Huh,

2316
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:48,720
look at all that blank canvas.
Look at those arms. Yup.

2317
02:12:49,590 --> 02:12:52,540
But you look at those arms now you're
probably embarrassed it was gigantic.

2318
02:12:52,541 --> 02:12:56,010
Tree trunks are packing now. No. Yeah,
but those things kick ass those things.

2319
02:12:56,230 --> 02:12:58,480
Fuck your head up. Yeah, exactly.

2320
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:04,300
I don't know if I had the snap on it
now like I had done, but um, so, so the,

2321
02:13:04,301 --> 02:13:07,840
the way stuff like that I totally agree
with because it is great for muscle

2322
02:13:07,841 --> 02:13:09,670
endurance if you're going
to get your strength.

2323
02:13:09,671 --> 02:13:11,650
I go back to the functional
training for that.

2324
02:13:11,830 --> 02:13:14,100
I don't think a boxer or a con bag,

2325
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:17,830
it might be a little different with
Yossi Guy MMA fighters because of the

2326
02:13:17,831 --> 02:13:21,530
wrestling and wrestling and everything
else. And that will come down to having a,

2327
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:26,110
somebody that really knows, like I said
it, he never stopped learning and it, um,

2328
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:29,230
but for me, what my guys yet endurance
training like that. That's great.

2329
02:13:29,231 --> 02:13:32,340
And you could even switch that in.
What's some endurance

2330
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:35,880
training to, you know, one thing
we used to do at ironman standard,

2331
02:13:35,881 --> 02:13:40,800
get a heavy chain and is locked out for
the front delts and turn it, turn it,

2332
02:13:40,801 --> 02:13:43,050
you know,
40 insurance do for a period of time.

2333
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:46,380
So there's just a lot of things that
you could add in. I think, you know,

2334
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:48,360
everybody goes, well,
you don't overtrain them.

2335
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:52,860
And that's another thing like the body,
it's really hard to overtrain. I mean,

2336
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:53,461
you could,

2337
02:13:53,461 --> 02:13:55,980
the only way you could really overtrain
as if you're not getting the right

2338
02:13:55,981 --> 02:13:59,180
nutrition and you're not getting
the right rest, you know? Um,

2339
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,750
or if you push too hard,

2340
02:14:00,751 --> 02:14:04,170
you don't give yourself enough recovery
time and you push it too close to a

2341
02:14:04,171 --> 02:14:08,100
fight. Yeah. See that's too long and you
don't get enough rest period in between.

2342
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:09,143
That's a big one.
Yeah.

2343
02:14:09,160 --> 02:14:13,840
The two long and camp, um, you know, Tim
Silvia or not Tim Silvia, Tim Kennedy,

2344
02:14:13,841 --> 02:14:18,430
who's a big, uh, who's for one
time at one point, he retired now,

2345
02:14:18,431 --> 02:14:20,290
but he was one of the top,
middle way contenders.

2346
02:14:20,291 --> 02:14:22,900
He went through two camps in a row
because one of his fights got canceled,

2347
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:27,190
rolled right into a tech camp and then
fought and then had no endurance and his

2348
02:14:27,191 --> 02:14:30,890
fight, you could kind of tell that he was
drained. They just, it was just too long.

2349
02:14:30,891 --> 02:14:34,540
It was like seven, six or seven
months of really being in camp.

2350
02:14:34,570 --> 02:14:35,680
Something along those lines.

2351
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:39,000
Probably in the, in the lines
of some word, the nutritionist,

2352
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:42,910
it could come down on a, on a person like
that. Is he getting enough, you know,

2353
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:48,210
the sources. It's also cutting
a lot of weight. Exactly.
So, you know, dehydration,

2354
02:14:48,211 --> 02:14:51,750
everything else. Yeah. Um, yeah.
It's, and it's hard. I mean,

2355
02:14:51,751 --> 02:14:55,110
you got to find if you're going to bring
somebody in. I was fortunate, my dad,

2356
02:14:55,111 --> 02:14:58,760
you know, we kinda kicked ass on that. We
had a little science brought, you know,

2357
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:03,420
broken down to a science and uh, we,
we made weight good and we were strong.

2358
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:08,880
Um, did you monitor your heart rate
ever? No. Never. Just felt how you felt.

2359
02:15:08,881 --> 02:15:09,430
Yeah.

2360
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:10,263
You know,
like,

2361
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:13,680
did you write down like how different
kinds of exercises you were doing?

2362
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:17,800
Did you play? You played it off and I
still do that. I still put that into my,

2363
02:15:17,801 --> 02:15:19,960
even a weightlifting. Really? Yeah.

2364
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:23,920
I feel like when you write down
your limit yourself, how so?

2365
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:27,640
Because if I go in, I see guys all
the time, not knocking at everybody,

2366
02:15:27,641 --> 02:15:31,210
but I see them come in with a little
notepad and they have what they got and I

2367
02:15:31,211 --> 02:15:35,140
see him go over and do literally only
four sets on a bench and then they write

2368
02:15:35,141 --> 02:15:38,530
down what they did and then they go over
and do some dumbbells or same with the

2369
02:15:38,531 --> 02:15:41,230
squats. I feel you're
limiting yourself. I mean,

2370
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:44,530
you didn't work that muscle to a,
you know,

2371
02:15:44,531 --> 02:15:47,950
failure then you should most
of the time because if not,

2372
02:15:47,990 --> 02:15:52,000
that becomes maintaining, you're not
breaking down the muscle fibers, you know,

2373
02:15:52,001 --> 02:15:55,120
unfortunate recoup. I feel,
you know, when you go and lift,

2374
02:15:55,121 --> 02:15:58,780
I'm not saying every Zach time you
got to kill it, but when I go in,

2375
02:15:58,781 --> 02:16:03,781
I want to do either a little bit heavier
or more reps than I did last time.

2376
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:07,380
You know what I mean? For me to get to
the point where I want to get in it,

2377
02:16:07,381 --> 02:16:10,780
it has worked for me. Um, I, I do,
I feel like when you write down,

2378
02:16:10,781 --> 02:16:13,960
the only time I do write things
down is if I'm doing a chart,

2379
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:15,820
I'll go through that chart.

2380
02:16:15,821 --> 02:16:19,270
And then when I finish what I finish
out with so many reps in that same

2381
02:16:19,870 --> 02:16:24,670
percentile of my PR, you know
what I mean? And I'll go down now,

2382
02:16:25,030 --> 02:16:29,740
then I have a speed day and endurance
day, what's it? And when I rubbed out,

2383
02:16:29,741 --> 02:16:32,110
and I do sometimes have to 300 reps,
you know,

2384
02:16:32,111 --> 02:16:36,370
on a body part and speed and endurance.
And then before I even do that,

2385
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:38,470
I work on safe as bench or squat.

2386
02:16:38,530 --> 02:16:43,530
I get the bands and I have my guys do
no more to six reps and all gotta be

2387
02:16:43,991 --> 02:16:47,560
explosion because that helps empower lift,
lifting for.one rep Max.

2388
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:50,030
You know what an explosion off
so it comes down, you know,

2389
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:52,990
and that's my theory on it. And
a lot of people, you know, do it.

2390
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:55,360
And then you got guys
who do write down though.

2391
02:16:55,630 --> 02:16:58,180
Do you think there's any benefit in the
kind of lifting that you're doing now

2392
02:16:58,210 --> 02:17:02,800
for a boxer? I think right now
if you have the time, yeah.

2393
02:17:03,010 --> 02:17:07,290
It could help you atomic in between if
you had time to get that big or get that

2394
02:17:07,291 --> 02:17:09,610
strong for maybe two months of heavy.

2395
02:17:10,050 --> 02:17:14,170
But I also think that you need a good
period of time of no heavy lifting to

2396
02:17:14,171 --> 02:17:17,440
recover before we start really boxing.
So your body's going to be used to it.

2397
02:17:17,441 --> 02:17:19,450
Muscle memory, you know, you'll still be,

2398
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:20,980
you're not going to lose all
that strength because you're,

2399
02:17:20,981 --> 02:17:23,680
you're not just stopping to power
lifting and not doing anything.

2400
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:27,850
You know what I mean? It seems like a real
guessing game. At least it experiment.

2401
02:17:28,060 --> 02:17:32,350
I wouldn't try it if I was active and
I had an active fighter. But yeah,

2402
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:34,840
I would like to see somebody
try that eventually.

2403
02:17:34,841 --> 02:17:36,390
One day you never know what her to go,

2404
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:39,280
always coming out with something or
they're always debunking some other,

2405
02:17:39,850 --> 02:17:41,860
you know, uh, you have to do this.

2406
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:44,320
And my favorite thing is where
I get an about the training.

2407
02:17:44,350 --> 02:17:48,010
When people say you can't do this two
days a week, you can't bench or squat.

2408
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:53,580
Look at your guy's in jail.
All they do every day. Yeah.

2409
02:17:53,610 --> 02:17:55,480
If I lift weights and eat shitty food,

2410
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:58,420
they don't have the supplements
that we have. You know,

2411
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:02,890
they can't take a protein
powder drink and bcas so,

2412
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:07,270
and they're not small. They're huge.
You're jacked, you're lifting every day,

2413
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:09,340
you know.
So

2414
02:18:09,770 --> 02:18:14,530
I don't know.
Well you familiar with Pavel Tot Salini?

2415
02:18:14,990 --> 02:18:18,980
Yes. Wasn't he the guy also with
the kettle bells or yeah. Yeah,

2416
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:22,580
he's um, he's got some
interesting thoughts about, um,

2417
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:26,260
about strength training in particular
because he's one of those guys that you,

2418
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:30,980
he believes you should do
more rest in between reps, uh,

2419
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:33,530
less reps and you should do it more often.

2420
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:37,640
So instead of like one
brutal workout a week,

2421
02:18:37,790 --> 02:18:39,980
will you break your body down the walk?

2422
02:18:39,981 --> 02:18:43,490
Like you're getting fucked in the ass by
a rhino for two days. Instead of that,

2423
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:47,900
you, you work out with less
repetitions. Don't go to failure,

2424
02:18:47,901 --> 02:18:49,370
but do it two or three times a week.

2425
02:18:49,371 --> 02:18:53,090
You get more repetitions overall
over the end of the week, but you'll,

2426
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:56,300
you'll be able to recover better.
And you never get that full breakdown,

2427
02:18:56,301 --> 02:18:58,910
but your body gets just
as strong or stronger.

2428
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,230
I seen that and I actually,

2429
02:19:00,231 --> 02:19:03,030
I was reading on that and that was
going to put that in, you know, uh,

2430
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:06,140
put that into my program
and I read a lot of them.

2431
02:19:06,141 --> 02:19:09,290
I see like Semans would west side.
Um,

2432
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:12,490
they got some great ideas and that's when
it comes to lift the weights and power

2433
02:19:12,491 --> 02:19:15,590
lift and there's only so much,
so somebody got it from somebody,

2434
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:17,180
you know what I mean?
Like west side,

2435
02:19:17,181 --> 02:19:19,610
they were big with the Russian
Olympic team and everything else.

2436
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:21,010
There's only so much you could do.

2437
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,780
There's only so many programs you could
do where you're not tapping in and

2438
02:19:23,781 --> 02:19:28,040
copying off this person's. Um, I
think that in, there is nothing

2439
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:32,180
wrong with that either. Now, not changing
it up after awhile in shotgun up body.

2440
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:34,760
I think that actually helps
you get stronger, you know,

2441
02:19:34,761 --> 02:19:38,510
and changing the program a little
bit. But um, you know, if that works,

2442
02:19:38,511 --> 02:19:39,140
I don't know.

2443
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:42,200
And that's something that I may try one
day because I'm doing power lifting,

2444
02:19:42,201 --> 02:19:45,650
but pilots and ain't going to
be my vacation home in Hawaii.

2445
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:49,580
You just doing the power lifting for
a drink for fun. It was, you know,

2446
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:51,890
it was something that was fun.
And uh,

2447
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:55,640
I got guys who I've gotten involved with
a buddy of mine, actually a coach on,

2448
02:19:55,730 --> 02:19:59,120
you know, certain days of the week. We
work on a heavy Lonnie Atkins. He's great.

2449
02:19:59,121 --> 02:20:03,800
He's a like six, seven time world champion
power lifter and drug free, you know,

2450
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:07,760
um,
federations like Ra and a WMP F and I,

2451
02:20:07,761 --> 02:20:12,050
and asked what I'm in because I feel like,
you know,

2452
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,980
I have not, I'm not knocking the other
people that use the steroids and stuff,

2453
02:20:15,981 --> 02:20:19,270
but for me, I like going the
natural route and you know,

2454
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,140
especially if you think about
fighting again, because if you do,

2455
02:20:24,141 --> 02:20:25,700
you don't want to fuck
up your endocrine system.

2456
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:29,360
So that's where I really turned against
it also is because of the boxing.

2457
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:34,340
You know what I mean? Um, I don't
want to make anybody too mad,

2458
02:20:34,341 --> 02:20:36,890
but when people would use it,
I feel like you're taking away.

2459
02:20:36,930 --> 02:20:40,520
And then I do feel like it's cheating. I
tell people in the gym, my gym, you know,

2460
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:42,800
there are certain people in
our diet that do it and I,

2461
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:45,860
and they try to come over and tell people
how to work out and this kind of like,

2462
02:20:45,861 --> 02:20:46,610
listen,

2463
02:20:46,610 --> 02:20:50,900
you're working out is totally different
than disguise and what you do to get big

2464
02:20:50,901 --> 02:20:54,410
as totally different all because of
that reason. Yeah, it is. It truly is.

2465
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:56,990
And the power lifting,
he's actually,

2466
02:20:57,020 --> 02:21:00,410
and I got guys right now that are freaks
of nature that do it and you could tell

2467
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:02,720
that they're not on it
because if they are, then he,

2468
02:21:02,721 --> 02:21:05,690
I thought long talk with her
dealer. Um, you know what I mean?

2469
02:21:05,691 --> 02:21:10,580
One of those type things. But, uh, I,
I like doing only because for me it's,

2470
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:14,690
it's not cheating, you know? And
also I liked the fact of like,

2471
02:21:14,691 --> 02:21:16,460
when I hit a plateau,
I look,

2472
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:20,360
it's more fun for me to go through and
research things and look at like how do I

2473
02:21:20,361 --> 02:21:21,510
get out of that and what's,

2474
02:21:21,630 --> 02:21:25,940
what's good nutrition that helps
naturally raise this or raised that,

2475
02:21:25,941 --> 02:21:30,050
you know what I mean? And different
workout routines, the board work chains,

2476
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:34,310
you know, add that all in. So that's
where it comes fun for me also. Yeah.

2477
02:21:34,311 --> 02:21:37,340
Do you do, um, do you get your blood
work done or anything like that?

2478
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:41,630
I did get a blood panel last, uh, last
year and was, yeah, that's it. Yeah.

2479
02:21:41,631 --> 02:21:44,900
And it can only get like normal ones,
regular ones. Kind of afraid to him, Hey,

2480
02:21:44,901 --> 02:21:47,930
I'm going, I'm getting to that age, you
know, I don't want that shit coming back

2481
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:51,980
bad. You don't want to
know. Yeah. You know? Hell,

2482
02:21:52,360 --> 02:21:56,060
if I start filling it then I'll
go. But um, no, but you should too.

2483
02:21:56,061 --> 02:21:59,450
I recommend it to everybody and
not every athlete, you know,

2484
02:21:59,451 --> 02:22:03,110
they should and eventually my time
has to go back soon also. Yeah,

2485
02:22:03,111 --> 02:22:04,520
I think it's a really important thing.

2486
02:22:04,521 --> 02:22:07,340
I think everybody should do it
on a regular basis. I really do.

2487
02:22:08,110 --> 02:22:10,760
I know you don't want to know about
anything bad, but you do know,

2488
02:22:10,761 --> 02:22:14,060
but you have to, if there really was
something funky going on and you know,

2489
02:22:14,061 --> 02:22:17,210
you went to the doctor and the doctor's
like, Kelly, these, these numbers are bad.

2490
02:22:17,211 --> 02:22:19,400
This is, we gotta we gotta
do some more. Exactly.

2491
02:22:19,401 --> 02:22:21,710
Work more tests and see
what the fuck's happening.

2492
02:22:22,170 --> 02:22:24,650
Especially with all these different
diets that people were getting on.

2493
02:22:24,651 --> 02:22:26,350
I'm seeing, yeah. Horrific things

2494
02:22:26,350 --> 02:22:29,730
that I had a brother in law from, you
know, a certain diet that Kito Diet.

2495
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:33,390
You know, what happened to him? Fatty
liver. A this, cause he's done it.

2496
02:22:33,391 --> 02:22:37,020
You don't drink. Yeah. Wow. That's fucked.
You know, diet, that's what I'm hearing.

2497
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:40,920
Well, if you really look at it, I mean,
you're eating the fat, all that fat.

2498
02:22:40,921 --> 02:22:45,630
And sometimes it's for me. Yeah. But if
Jess, all your body got to burn, you know,

2499
02:22:45,631 --> 02:22:46,820
and your organs got to the,

2500
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:50,780
what happens with people where it
does get dangerous is first of all,

2501
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:54,510
if you have certain, uh,
certain genes, certain people,

2502
02:22:54,511 --> 02:22:56,940
it's just not the best diet for,
and it's,

2503
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:58,950
it's a lot of trial and error to find out.

2504
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:03,800
But it's also if you engage in a
high fat contact dot content diet,

2505
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:05,370
but you also have high carbohydrate,

2506
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:09,130
which is where a lot of people cheat
and fuck up, that's not good. That's,

2507
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:12,390
that's not good for you. Like you,
you got to get your body into Ketosis,

2508
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:13,553
into ketosis.

2509
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:16,950
If you don't get your body into ketosis
and you're taking this high level of fat

2510
02:23:16,980 --> 02:23:20,890
and the car I love Oh carbs, it's
not, it's just not a good combination.

2511
02:23:20,891 --> 02:23:23,820
But it also has, you know, boards
to do on it. If you come off of it,

2512
02:23:23,821 --> 02:23:26,480
you can't just indulge into
the carbs either, right?

2513
02:23:26,530 --> 02:23:29,430
Don't you slowly work
that back into your body.

2514
02:23:29,431 --> 02:23:31,080
Always knows how to process carbs.

2515
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:33,630
It's more difficult to
get your body fat adapted,

2516
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:37,530
but once your body does get fat adapted.
But I've found is a,

2517
02:23:37,531 --> 02:23:41,560
I'm not on a ketogenic diet right
now, but when I've been on it, um,

2518
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:45,420
I can get back in it pretty quick,
but it takes a while.

2519
02:23:45,421 --> 02:23:47,040
Like the first time I did it,

2520
02:23:47,610 --> 02:23:51,090
it took a solid two weeks
before I felt normal.

2521
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:54,030
For two weeks I was dragging ass.
It was hard to stick through it.

2522
02:23:54,031 --> 02:23:56,520
Like I didn't want to stick through
it. I just wanted to, I'm like,

2523
02:23:56,521 --> 02:23:59,550
I'm just going to have a fucking apple
and a bowl of pasta and blow this died

2524
02:23:59,551 --> 02:24:02,040
off. But um, if you get through it,

2525
02:24:02,041 --> 02:24:05,400
then you feel your body switch over
when you feel you bought a switch over,

2526
02:24:05,401 --> 02:24:09,750
what happens is, um, you have more
even energy throughout the day.

2527
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:13,410
Um, uh, less tired, no crash
in the middle of the day.

2528
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:17,580
But I do have to say it took a long time
before my workouts felt like I could

2529
02:24:17,581 --> 02:24:20,430
have the same intensity.
I would die off quicker.

2530
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:24,020
And as how I look at even some of
those, um, what do you call it?

2531
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:27,150
Intermittent died things to them
and fasting. Yeah. Fasting. Yeah.

2532
02:24:27,151 --> 02:24:30,990
Like the w when you're drying out and
you're not eating and that period,

2533
02:24:31,290 --> 02:24:33,270
I wouldn't recommend
working out at that time.

2534
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:36,720
Power lifting or a strength training.
Yeah.

2535
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:39,350
I think that's a different kind of
animal. Yeah. Cause now you're getting,

2536
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:43,950
carrying down the muscles and everything
else. Maybe some cardio wouldn't hurt.

2537
02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:47,630
Listen, I'm not, that's why I'm saying
I'm not knocking all of them. And I,

2538
02:24:47,631 --> 02:24:49,040
and my brother in law,
he,

2539
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:52,890
the doctor told them they think that's
what it was from now granted that could

2540
02:24:52,891 --> 02:24:56,730
be because he messed up on
a diet somewhere along the
line, you know, um, meeting,

2541
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:58,820
uh,
I had a doctor that,

2542
02:24:58,890 --> 02:25:03,300
a buddy also that got fatty liver from
eating too much of the meat. Again,

2543
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:07,800
that could have been grass fed or steroid
type meat makes a difference. That was,

2544
02:25:07,801 --> 02:25:08,634
what the fuck.

2545
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:14,280
I don't even know if that
does cause it does. Yeah.

2546
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,720
And me personally,

2547
02:25:15,721 --> 02:25:18,360
I'm not knocking any of it cause her
pretty soon I've got to try some shit

2548
02:25:18,361 --> 02:25:21,870
myself, you know what I mean? Um,
I got to start losing weight again.

2549
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:24,160
Well why did you start eating like crazy?

2550
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,590
Because of the power lifting.
Yeah. Those guys. Yeah,

2551
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:31,240
he like fucking savages and notary also
coming out to like where you can eat

2552
02:25:31,570 --> 02:25:35,600
right. Lose weight and still be
strong, you know, um, me, uh,

2553
02:25:35,601 --> 02:25:39,430
I started eating like that and then it
really, I'll tell you where it gets me.

2554
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:43,290
So I was never a real big sweet
tooth, sweet tooth theater. Ah,

2555
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:46,090
I is a piece of cake
or a candy bar and her,

2556
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:49,000
I'd have like total throughout
the day and one count of pop.

2557
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:51,820
I drank a half a can in a
morning or an afternoon.

2558
02:25:51,850 --> 02:25:56,360
Then at night for people who
didn't grow up in Ohio. Oh yeah.

2559
02:25:56,361 --> 02:26:00,730
That was soda, Coca Cola,
Pepsi, you know, sorry,

2560
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:05,650
you'll pop Guy Columbus,
Ohio in the house. Yes.

2561
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:10,720
And uh, that's right. Yeah,
we were talking about that
and that's what I would do.

2562
02:26:10,721 --> 02:26:14,200
So it wasn't that bad, but it's still
enough sugar, long fucking sugar.

2563
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:17,680
And then I was starting the one meat,

2564
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:22,210
I was doing a to 20 pound weight class,
I was two 32 and my guy was like,

2565
02:26:22,211 --> 02:26:25,870
you ain't gonna make it in six days to
get down to two to 20 and that kind of

2566
02:26:25,871 --> 02:26:29,350
like, I get a chuckle at that
because I had to make 160 before,

2567
02:26:29,351 --> 02:26:30,820
so I got all this fat sitting on me.

2568
02:26:30,821 --> 02:26:33,850
You're going to tell me I can't
lose that in six days. A bet.

2569
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:35,990
And this is for a power lifting.
Yeah.

2570
02:26:35,991 --> 02:26:39,010
So I got down with that and
that was doing a wash. What?

2571
02:26:39,090 --> 02:26:42,820
I didn't even do hardly any cardio for
that and I still got down fairly easy to,

2572
02:26:42,821 --> 02:26:47,821
to 20 then now we're on falling into this
bad habit is I'll have like a piece of

2573
02:26:50,261 --> 02:26:54,160
cheesecake sitting in a refrigerator.
Okay. I know. And I love cheesecake.

2574
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:57,020
And that's true. That's one of my
favorites. It's a good one, eh?

2575
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:59,630
Would it be two cans
of pop left and right?

2576
02:26:59,631 --> 02:27:02,410
And my whole thing is I can't start.

2577
02:27:02,470 --> 02:27:04,510
I can't start watching cause
I don't want to say diet.

2578
02:27:04,690 --> 02:27:08,090
I started saying watching what I
eat and I go, I can't do that too.

2579
02:27:08,091 --> 02:27:12,640
When it's gone. I can't have that. I
know. It's weird. I'm telling you I can't,

2580
02:27:12,641 --> 02:27:14,800
I can't start until it's gone.
But you can't throw it away.

2581
02:27:14,830 --> 02:27:15,700
Can I can't throw it away,

2582
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:19,690
throw it away because it's the only one
piece left and I don't want to do that.

2583
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:24,790
So, and then the next thing I know my
sister in law who was a hell of a baker,

2584
02:27:24,791 --> 02:27:28,480
she makes something for the kids or
it makes me a homemade cheese cake.

2585
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:31,960
And the next thing I know I'm
back into the same thing again.

2586
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:36,040
Now let me tell you something
else that contributes to this.

2587
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:41,640
I think all the years of of fighting
and having to watch my weight and

2588
02:27:41,641 --> 02:27:46,120
especially for me to get done in one 60
and even when I was fighting at 47 and

2589
02:27:46,121 --> 02:27:50,480
the amateurs I, my life was pretty much
running and it was a job, you know,

2590
02:27:50,570 --> 02:27:53,050
it was time somebody was there.
I just couldn't go run.

2591
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:56,250
I had to run it so fast and I was
being timed for it and distance.

2592
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:57,850
I had to watch what I was eating.

2593
02:27:57,851 --> 02:28:01,870
I had people over me watching what I was
eating and when I retired I was like,

2594
02:28:01,871 --> 02:28:04,880
fuck this man, I'm free. Right.
You know what I mean? And I,

2595
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:08,080
I sometimes put that in the
back of my head, I shouldn't,

2596
02:28:08,410 --> 02:28:10,670
but I put in the back of my head
like, man, you deserve this man.

2597
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:12,940
You did that all these years like,

2598
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:17,200
but now it's coming to the point to
like you are getting a little older,

2599
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:19,540
you look a little bit like
shit other than your arms.

2600
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,790
Like you're going to have to start it
in a treadmill. You know what I mean?

2601
02:28:22,791 --> 02:28:25,970
It's one of those type things where if
you just cut the sugar out, but yeah,

2602
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:29,510
and it works and I don't want to hear
people say that they can't lose weight now

2603
02:28:29,511 --> 02:28:33,650
that will only work for a certain period
of time until that like levels out.

2604
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:34,481
Then you guys,

2605
02:28:34,481 --> 02:28:37,880
that's when you start tweaking the calorie
intake and then you can lose a lot of

2606
02:28:37,881 --> 02:28:41,000
weight if you just cut out the sugar.
Yeah, you can. Yeah. So that's why,

2607
02:28:41,001 --> 02:28:44,600
I mean I don't want to hear
people say it's hard. So I
will, I'll be eventually, I,

2608
02:28:44,601 --> 02:28:46,220
you know,
I said when I get home from this trip,

2609
02:28:46,221 --> 02:28:50,270
because like last night I went
out with my buddy and we ate uh,

2610
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:53,270
pizzas and stuff like that.
So you know, cause I'm Ma,

2611
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:55,760
I don't have the access
to healthy food right now.

2612
02:28:56,270 --> 02:28:59,880
While you're on the road places in La,
you can eat healthy. I know there is,

2613
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:03,770
dare you, I dare you say you can't eat
healthy here as the mindset men. I know.

2614
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:05,920
Yeah. The mindset. But that's, you know,

2615
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:10,010
the thing about a lot of great fighters
is they're very impulsive too. Yeah.

2616
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:13,160
It's just that fuck it.
Fuck it.

2617
02:29:13,161 --> 02:29:17,540
Mentality that sometimes carries over
to eating. Look at a lot of your ad guy.

2618
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:21,740
Retired fighters. Yeah. They
get mean. They balloon up
and blow up. You know, again,

2619
02:29:21,741 --> 02:29:26,190
I keep saying, I'm not like
bragging or anything, but here I'm,

2620
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:30,710
I'm fairly decent. You know what I mean?
I think at least you enjoy working out.

2621
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:31,970
I think some guys,

2622
02:29:31,971 --> 02:29:35,360
they got to a point where they worked
out so hard for camps that when it's over

2623
02:29:35,361 --> 02:29:39,920
they don't want to do shit. Yeah. It
just like I'm done. It's over. No desire,

2624
02:29:39,921 --> 02:29:44,660
no drive. Well that's why cardio's
very rare for me. Right. Yeah. And uh,

2625
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:47,180
you know, I used to say this
to all the time after a fight,

2626
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:50,030
I have probably two or
three weeks off and I,

2627
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:53,300
there was a place called Mill Creek
Park and a lot of people go to run and

2628
02:29:53,301 --> 02:29:54,670
exercise and stuff like that.

2629
02:29:54,671 --> 02:29:58,070
And there's a main street that goes past
the park and you see people riding a

2630
02:29:58,071 --> 02:30:01,820
bike and running. And I'll never forget,
my wife actually started laughing.

2631
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:05,120
I just got done with a fight and we're
driving past Mule Creek Park and these

2632
02:30:05,121 --> 02:30:07,610
people were out running.
And I go, what idiots

2633
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:14,270
like who gets up and go run? And I
left for, chances are I'm hilarious.

2634
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:17,180
Chances are I,
if I didn't have to do it like that,

2635
02:30:17,181 --> 02:30:19,910
I didn't have somebody hounding
me or over me while I was running.

2636
02:30:20,090 --> 02:30:23,450
Chances are I would actually like running
and I would like doing cardio and add

2637
02:30:23,451 --> 02:30:24,710
that into my training.

2638
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:29,720
But because it was a job for
all the mirrors from nine
years old to 30 years old,

2639
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:31,490
it was like,
screw this man.

2640
02:30:31,491 --> 02:30:35,810
I don't want to run to run as if there
was a fire or a big ass dog behind me.

2641
02:30:35,811 --> 02:30:39,110
You know? That's the only way. Or if
I want to run to the buffet table,

2642
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:41,120
but I know some people do it every day,

2643
02:30:41,990 --> 02:30:45,770
every day before work and they'll put
in five, six miles every day. And it,

2644
02:30:45,771 --> 02:30:47,210
you know what,
in this reality you have to,

2645
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:52,190
you got to any more or less you would want
to be out of shape and, and miserable.

2646
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:56,180
I think it's great to actually start
working out and even for me as I'm lifting

2647
02:30:56,181 --> 02:30:59,690
weights and it's fun and it's
considered exercising, but, um,

2648
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:03,830
and now with what I'm thinking
of doing and everything else,

2649
02:31:03,831 --> 02:31:05,870
I got to start getting into that.
You know,

2650
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:09,350
I'm hitting the bag and everything's
fun and I'm hitting the pads and that's

2651
02:31:09,351 --> 02:31:12,020
cardio. I mean that shit,
that shit's really cardio.

2652
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:15,020
And now to run a really thinking
about finding and you're,

2653
02:31:15,021 --> 02:31:16,880
you said more than 60%,
right?

2654
02:31:17,270 --> 02:31:20,180
80% I would say around

2655
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:23,790
70 to 80. That's a lot.
That is, that is. But again,

2656
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:26,580
and I'll shrine going to see you this,
um,

2657
02:31:26,750 --> 02:31:31,440
there was a lot of that goes behind a
lot more to think about also, you know,

2658
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:35,640
so I don't want, because what I don't
want is in six months when I say,

2659
02:31:35,641 --> 02:31:38,550
you know what? No, I don't
want the backlash for it.

2660
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:42,900
He's walked up again and he knows.
And that's unfortunately,

2661
02:31:42,901 --> 02:31:46,830
that's the way it goes. It does. But
you got to not read that shit. I know,

2662
02:31:46,831 --> 02:31:50,970
but that's unfortunately, it really
is. Especially comments, you know,

2663
02:31:50,971 --> 02:31:55,440
I tried not to and you catch them and
you get them. I try not to. I, it's,

2664
02:31:56,850 --> 02:32:00,450
it seems like the boxing world in
particular has a lot of fucking haters,

2665
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:04,380
but you know what, it's nothing like
football, like of a fighter loses.

2666
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:08,580
I was was watching Barstool
sports, barstool sports, Instagram.

2667
02:32:08,610 --> 02:32:12,300
They got some fucking guy leaving a
football game screaming and yelling.

2668
02:32:12,301 --> 02:32:15,960
I'm like, this guy is what I think
about when I think of like Douche Stout,

2669
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:17,160
like sports fans.

2670
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:21,160
This guy fucking screaming about
somebody not being able to make it kick.

2671
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:25,590
You know what I'm talking about? Yeah,
go ahead and crazy. It's so funny.

2672
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:27,680
I love it. I love it. I love it.

2673
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:31,950
I love hearing when I was playing
football and when I was in high school,

2674
02:32:32,010 --> 02:32:35,010
when you're watching these big games and
you'll see it on social or I'd be at a

2675
02:32:35,011 --> 02:32:39,960
buddy's house and I see have I
would've made that yet. Right.

2676
02:32:40,830 --> 02:32:42,660
People love saying stupid shit like that.

2677
02:32:42,661 --> 02:32:46,150
Like how many times did anybody given you
boxing advice? Oh, I have people that,

2678
02:32:46,151 --> 02:32:48,420
I don't know the difference between
a left Toke and efficient book.

2679
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:52,320
I swear to God they don't.
And why didn't you just hit him?

2680
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:56,100
Because he should have got up and
hit him in his TMZ. It material. No,

2681
02:32:56,101 --> 02:32:58,880
but I mean like, like they're
saying to you, why didn't,

2682
02:32:58,980 --> 02:33:01,470
why didn't you just hit him?
I don't know.

2683
02:33:01,471 --> 02:33:04,230
You don't have I seen the
episode that was the funniest.

2684
02:33:04,231 --> 02:33:07,680
I think it was on one of your episodes
with Charlie Murphy and they are doing

2685
02:33:07,681 --> 02:33:12,480
the Mike Tyson and like
de la Hoya situation that
happened like the guys that he

2686
02:33:12,481 --> 02:33:16,140
could beat up the lawyer and I true.
I wish I could happen on a regular basis,

2687
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:19,380
you know like call people out on it
when you're in front of somebody. Yeah.

2688
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:22,740
How many times I hear people say
like I, I could, I couldn't beat him.

2689
02:33:23,130 --> 02:33:26,670
And it's like, why? Why is he
sitting on like $25 million?

2690
02:33:26,671 --> 02:33:30,480
And you're over here picking up ups
shipments, you know what I mean?

2691
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:34,470
Like there's a difference for a reason.
Nobody's knocking what you do,

2692
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:38,370
but you shouldn't knock what he's
doing. Well, you're delusional. You are.

2693
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:40,290
People are dilution.
But for whatever reason,

2694
02:33:40,291 --> 02:33:43,170
especially when it comes to
sports and fighting in particular,

2695
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:46,380
people just say some
unbelievably delusional shit.

2696
02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:51,210
I don't know why and I truly
don't and I don't understand it.

2697
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:54,910
And I'd never get into the argument long
enough to even ask the question. Well,

2698
02:33:54,911 --> 02:33:57,990
what was the last time you
went on somebody else's
page and commenting on shit,

2699
02:33:58,170 --> 02:34:02,070
I can't tell you cause you're a world
champion and I don't want to ask another

2700
02:34:02,071 --> 02:34:03,930
reason. Hey, let's, you
know what, that's funny too,

2701
02:34:03,931 --> 02:34:07,440
because how many of might want to write
how many of the threads in it and may

2702
02:34:07,441 --> 02:34:09,840
involve me? Because you know, again,

2703
02:34:09,890 --> 02:34:13,510
a reason why I have to stay up on it
is because that's part of my podcasts.

2704
02:34:13,810 --> 02:34:17,980
You know, we're through the social media,
so I have to, and he's boxing groups or

2705
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,560
even on our own fight or a punchline,
a box and group.

2706
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:25,000
You see the comments and
I'm just going and I'm like,

2707
02:34:25,001 --> 02:34:28,030
I can't really answer that though because
I look corny as shit if I answered

2708
02:34:28,031 --> 02:34:31,720
that one. You know? And so it's hard
and it's frustrating. It really is.

2709
02:34:32,950 --> 02:34:37,060
Well, the, the interesting world
that we live in today, I mean,

2710
02:34:37,061 --> 02:34:40,020
it's a great time to communicate
with people. It's amazing. No,

2711
02:34:40,030 --> 02:34:42,490
it's also a great time for
Douche bags to communicate.

2712
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:44,620
It is dangerous time actually.

2713
02:34:45,850 --> 02:34:48,640
But I think it's cool that you're
doing this podcast thing and, uh,

2714
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:52,330
I think it's awesome and I really do
hope you do commentary as far as you

2715
02:34:52,331 --> 02:34:56,410
fighting. Hey Man, if you find a watch,
but if you don't fight, I'll be happy to.

2716
02:34:56,411 --> 02:34:59,200
I'll definitely keep you in
the loop. Tell me. I know.

2717
02:34:59,201 --> 02:35:02,610
I will definitely keep you in the loop
coming down. If you do announce something,

2718
02:35:02,750 --> 02:35:04,120
something's happening,
I will do.

2719
02:35:04,121 --> 02:35:07,300
Let us know and tell people how
to get ahold of your podcast.

2720
02:35:07,301 --> 02:35:11,110
How can they get my podcast
is the punchline. Dot Live.

2721
02:35:11,380 --> 02:35:14,440
That's the easiest way to get
to it. Or on Youtube. Also,

2722
