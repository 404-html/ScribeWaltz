1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,900
Yeah,

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,410
well,

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,751
Bom,

4
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:01,891
Bom,

5
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:02,221
Bom,

6
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:02,710
bom.

7
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm really working hard on not being,

8
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:05,034
sorry,

9
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,470
ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,970
welcome Dac.

11
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,520
If this is your first voyage with us,

12
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,820
he picked a very strange
part of the journey.

13
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,730
This is part two of the
honey honey podcast,

14
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,050
part one.

15
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,660
There was a lot of alcohol
and marijuana in the room,

16
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,411
allegedly,

17
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:22,860
and a,

18
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,691
some things we're sad.

19
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,010
We're not really sure what you said.

20
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,590
We don't even know what the
fuck we said after it was over.

21
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,240
Like what are we okay?

22
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,950
Did they do anything wrong?

23
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,180
Give us another chance.

24
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,141
But a,

25
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,950
what is this whiskey that
you find people have brought?

26
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,023
What does that mean?

27
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,190
Each y d means and fun times.

28
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,710
It does good talks in depth conversation.

29
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,080
They invented that shit when
people thought dragons were real.

30
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,463
They were worried.

31
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,211
They were worried.

32
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:51,720
Dragons,

33
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,010
we're going to fly out of castles.

34
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,370
Fucking hammered drinking that.

35
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,500
Um,

36
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,970
but I'm pretty sure we're okay.

37
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:01,800
I don't think we said
anything that fucked up.

38
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,820
No good.

39
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,040
But I'm not married to anything.

40
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,710
I just said it's easier that way.

41
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,630
I just want to let everybody know if I,

42
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:10,380
if I pissed you off,

43
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,580
I probably pissed me off too.

44
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,890
If I go off and listen
to me while I'm sober,

45
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,360
I'm like shut up.

46
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,210
Shut the fuck up.

47
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,640
So I'm right there with Ya.

48
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,351
Just A,

49
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:23,970
we're just trying to do the best we can.

50
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:24,804
Ladies and gentlemen,

51
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,323
this strange,

52
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,420
strange world.

53
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,330
It's world we're spinning around.

54
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,930
Yeah.

55
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,220
They found water on Mars today.

56
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,054
Bitches.

57
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,170
Shit.

58
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,700
Just covering up the cake time NASA now.

59
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,333
Um,

60
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,840
we not me and you know,

61
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,310
don't do it Suzanne.

62
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,380
I won't let you guys go.

63
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,290
Fuck all that.

64
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,900
You bring the funny no Jamie,

65
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,410
you bring the food shows out too.

66
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,010
And the Cliche,

67
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,800
I say we stay in the spa.

68
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:58,950
That's already awesome.

69
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,660
There's not a lot of tiling nice here.

70
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,080
Like,

71
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,261
yeah,

72
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,600
this is the best spot we have ever seen.

73
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:07,770
We've been sending rockets in
the spaces that I teed 50s.

74
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,990
This is the best part by far.

75
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,250
We ever tell you about our car.

76
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,133
The Escalade.

77
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,580
Yes,

78
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,413
I think so.

79
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,620
We went into the manual.

80
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:20,730
We've got a great deal on it.

81
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:21,960
We didn't want to buy a van.

82
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,321
We were like,

83
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,460
there's four of us we can.

84
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,810
That's a better move.

85
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,573
Fishers,

86
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,110
the user manuals,

87
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,580
how to use like all the
fucking spaceship buttons,

88
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,130
former owner registration falls out.

89
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:35,341
Ben,

90
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,260
who was it set up?

91
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Elon Musk.

92
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,640
Good Google worrying.

93
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,490
Now the government is spying on you.

94
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,910
Three Elon Musk's form a
vehicle to keep tabs on you.

95
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,070
This is all like some sort of a scam.

96
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,180
Like Ilan Musk,

97
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,110
big fan of honey.

98
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:52,861
Honey band says,

99
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:53,694
listen guys,

100
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,720
I need you to take a
Cadillac off my hands.

101
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,770
Make electric it electric Suv Ilan,

102
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,550
please.

103
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,031
That'd be great.

104
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:01,340
Thanks.

105
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,350
[inaudible] had to go buy clones signal
the same one as in the back of my Tesla.

106
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,320
That goes zero to 60 in one second.

107
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,470
He's controlling the vehicle levies cars.

108
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,530
He's creating these cars
that are literally like,

109
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,560
what's the most time you need speed?

110
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,610
The most time we need speed is like at a
rate are running at a red light stop to

111
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:24,130
go or merging onto a highway.

112
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:24,820
Right?

113
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,290
Like if you're trying
to merge onto a highway,

114
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,200
that's the only time you like
legitimately need horsepowers.

115
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,130
She only time,

116
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,770
well this guy is creating a car that's
in that way as fast as anything that you

117
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,610
could buy ever.

118
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,610
It's like a Ferrari ridiculously fast.

119
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,940
Maybe even faster than a Ferrari.

120
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,243
Nope.

121
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,473
Not Feeling it.

122
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,180
Yes.

123
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,320
If the apocalypse comes,

124
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,940
you're going to need gasoline shit.

125
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,530
You're gonna need to burn things.

126
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,440
Purpose to it though.

127
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,310
The electricity.

128
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,150
Amen.

129
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,990
Is that possible?

130
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,033
Yes.

131
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,120
If they can figure out solar to the point
where they make some dope paint that's

132
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:05,110
also like solar collecting
and is like a solar panel.

133
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,070
Like why is it solar panel?

134
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll have to look like,

135
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:07,660
uh,

136
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,030
like the inside of an
air conditioning filter.

137
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,450
Why did I switch stupid?

138
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,560
But I can't solar panels like dope.

139
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,590
Why can't the whole car
be just solar panels?

140
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,401
You know,

141
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,740
why don't you make some slick
ass fucking solar panels,

142
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,210
right?

143
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:23,650
Because on,

144
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,610
at Santos on it.

145
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,980
But I think if they did that,

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,833
older women,

147
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,860
they're working on it.

148
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,860
If they ever figure out a way to make a
car that is an 100% solar in California,

149
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,001
like a Tesla,

150
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,260
like a really high end,

151
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,020
beautiful car that also
you never need to plug in.

152
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,540
The batteries are so efficient.

153
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,311
I just,

154
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,880
I don't think they're
that far away from that.

155
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,270
I mean,

156
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,160
when I say that far thing
like a hundred years,

157
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,780
I don't think we're that far away.

158
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,340
I think they already know they're just
hiding it because the gas situation is

159
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,420
government.

160
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,050
Joe Totally sucks.

161
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,880
That covers now I don't
so out of the loop.

162
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,810
It's not enough time.

163
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:13,960
No,

164
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,250
that's all I'm saying in the day.

165
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,690
If you're tenacious d fan,

166
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,441
don't get mad at me.

167
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,820
I've enjoyed a lot of their work.

168
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,530
It's not what's going on here.

169
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,220
It's just not enough time to
know that you had to pick,

170
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,300
pick your mom.

171
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Too much fucking material out there
and we're all making more of it.

172
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,550
Yeah.

173
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,390
That's like how we do it.

174
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,050
It makes them fucking more,

175
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,550
that's the craziest thing about music.

176
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,180
If you really stop and think about
it at the break we were talking about

177
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:43,000
Beethoven and we're talking about um,

178
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,090
all the different notes and the,

179
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,780
the different things that they created
way back then that you can still recreate

180
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:50,190
today.

181
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,450
That's just being able to notate,

182
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,691
you know,

183
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,110
we can play music that was invented before
was recording technology or that was

184
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:57,160
the recording technology.

185
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,910
It's like this is how that sounds.

186
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,820
We'll figure out a way to write this and
now you can interpret that and make the

187
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,654
same sound.

188
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,081
Right.

189
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,770
And if you go back to then
how many people wrote music,

190
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,890
like what was the number of published
works and like Beethoven's finest year,

191
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,903
Mozart,

192
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,910
was it mostly like people aren't fully
aware of what Mozart actually wrote as

193
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,770
opposed to like his family
members contributed and stuff.

194
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,693
Is that what you're saying?

195
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,720
That was box.

196
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,553
There's some of that.

197
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,340
There wasn't,

198
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,510
the point is there wasn't much,

199
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,250
there wasn't much notated,

200
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,230
at least cause he was
an education to do that.

201
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,340
You needed tons of money.

202
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:35,000
You'd have to get people with
serious money to sponsor your life,

203
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,170
you know?

204
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,750
And there just weren't that many
tousled like that Tony Hawk,

205
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,780
Lance Armstrong thing where it's like
there's a couple of famous dudes in that

206
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,923
field.

207
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,161
Everybody else.

208
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,880
Who the fuck?

209
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,230
Okay.

210
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,300
Beethoven.

211
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,253
Bach,

212
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,983
Mozart.

213
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,740
The dude's.

214
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:51,981
Okay.

215
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,200
There's like a couple other dudes
that are like in the periphery.

216
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,101
That's like a three.

217
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,040
I got room for three or four major.

218
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,973
Yeah,

219
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,130
they're so fucking good though.

220
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,940
That's the thing about saying all these
contributing factors to the environment

221
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,870
is like being an,

222
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,790
I was like Malcolm Gladwell's outliers.

223
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,220
It's like there's all these
things that have to happen.

224
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,850
Like I'm sure there were other
people that had these magical ears.

225
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:18,650
They just didn't have the resources to
build it like Beethoven or Bach or Mozart

226
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:18,851
did.

227
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:19,490
And like,

228
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:19,791
you know,

229
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,900
if you like the arts,

230
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:25,250
like the Metta chief family who you know
were benefactors to these people that

231
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:29,690
like flourished because of their
incredible amount of wealth.

232
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,903
You know,

233
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,880
it's just certain things.

234
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,750
That was the chair.

235
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,680
I didn't fart.

236
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,630
Just making that clear.

237
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,670
It was like straight up.

238
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,620
I want to talk about this.

239
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,150
Here we are.

240
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,080
What happened to us?

241
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,150
They were so smooth.

242
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,550
We were so smooth on top of it.

243
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,720
We're still smooth.

244
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,160
Our feelings are like right up front
and you know they're right there.

245
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,460
There's no need for us to talk about why
you guys were upset at each other a few

246
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,180
days ago.

247
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,050
Definitely not.

248
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,861
Definitely not.

249
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,580
We don't even talk about
that and I need for,

250
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,860
I think we went through two and a
half hours of awesome psycho analysis.

251
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,770
Go back and listen to
that shit afterwards.

252
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:13,604
We're going to be like,

253
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:13,800
no,

254
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,300
you meant,

255
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,620
you said some really beautiful shit.

256
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,820
I'm not kidding for whether it's
people want to listen to it or not.

257
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,060
We all lies on the spot

258
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,193
work.

259
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,420
We'll take the,

260
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,300
the front,

261
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,220
the falsified information.

262
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,810
You ever listen to classical music?

263
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:30,890
Speaking to Beethoven or anymore?

264
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,240
I try.

265
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,033
I try.

266
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,420
It's difficult side.

267
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,010
Sometimes I'm going to listen to it.

268
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,650
Like when I write I'll put
on headphones on an airplane.

269
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,603
Yeah.

270
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,660
It's hard to navigate.

271
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,070
It's just so much shit and it's like,

272
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:43,550
you know,

273
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,720
historical at this point.

274
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,240
Like you gotta like
really energizing though.

275
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,080
It's not like it's like,

276
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,330
did it like that doesn't
like make you fall asleep.

277
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:50,960
That's like,

278
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,171
like,

279
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:51,860
oh my God,

280
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,610
let's get up.

281
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,750
It's also conquer the day.

282
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,100
The other problem with it is

283
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,500
like as a person who makes stuff,

284
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,230
I always look at it as like just some
crazy cover band because it's not really

285
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,064
Mozart.

286
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,271
Mozart's dead.

287
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:06,980
It's fuck.

288
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,290
Yeah.

289
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,580
Like even if they're nailing it,

290
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,510
even if they're there,

291
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,580
they're nailing what he was asking for.

292
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,050
It's not him doing it.

293
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Half of the Star spangled banner
is not the noise [inaudible] wow.

294
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,960
Wow.

295
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,410
Wow.

296
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,410
It's knowing that Jimi Hendrix did that
at Woodstock in 1969 that's half of what

297
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,261
it is.

298
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:30,261
It's like the sound that I hear from a
Sturgill Simpson song or a honey honey

299
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,630
song or fucking run DMC,

300
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,231
anybody.

301
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:38,880
It's like that's their shit
and it's coming out of them.

302
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,200
It's not a cover band.

303
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:45,201
It's their words with
their annunciations boom.

304
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,250
I mean,

305
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,001
that's what it is.

306
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,151
I mean,

307
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:48,990
that's what I want.

308
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:49,380
I don't,

309
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,320
I don't want to hear
like somebody recreating.

310
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,460
I understand it.

311
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,031
I mean,

312
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:54,920
I understand it that,

313
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,950
that it's compelling and amazing and
artistic and so integral to the structure

314
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:01,380
of music,

315
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,310
even today,

316
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,040
interest not men.

317
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,230
That's really interesting to hear.

318
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,951
You know what I mean?

319
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:15,270
Because I come from a total or
just desire to always fucking here.

320
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:18,060
That shouldn't be listening
to music in a way to be like,

321
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,070
I don't know how to describe it I guess,

322
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,870
but in a way that's a different
class of what you're talking about.

323
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,470
You know,

324
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,303
the idea of like,

325
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,320
you want to hear somebody
express themselves.

326
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,980
I'm using,

327
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,150
he's fucking offers,

328
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,700
but I want to hear like
when you're playing guitar,

329
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,563
I know those were,

330
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,500
that's been scratching those wires.

331
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,170
It's you doing that,

332
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:40,711
you know what I'm saying?

333
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,990
Like I hear you,

334
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,921
you know,

335
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:47,850
like you come through that and
there's nothing wrong with the,

336
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,420
they didn't have the ability to
transmit this information any other way.

337
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,870
Then write it down and notes,

338
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,690
sell these books that,

339
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:54,920
that,

340
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,230
uh,

341
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,010
uh,

342
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,700
that's it.

343
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:56,911
I mean,

344
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:57,840
it gets a hundred years,

345
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:58,411
200 years,

346
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:59,244
300 years.

347
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,240
It's the only way to do it.

348
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,570
Yeah.

349
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,650
It didn't have any other way,

350
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,210
but we have a better way now.

351
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,840
Yeah,

352
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:03,931
no,

353
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:04,291
you're right.

354
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:04,780
And this is,

355
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,340
it's funny,

356
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,180
there's a certain,

357
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,470
maybe it's not an indulgence.

358
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,220
Maybe it is,

359
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,690
but I was thinking about
it while you said that.

360
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,100
It's like,

361
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,220
well,

362
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,970
I just like listening to those sounds.

363
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,841
You know what I mean?

364
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:13,970
Whether the motets making,

365
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,180
I just liked that sound,

366
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:15,530
you know?

367
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,560
Oh that's cool.

368
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,410
But it's also something that
you do in your free time.

369
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,580
You have time to sit down and say,

370
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm going to appreciate some sounds as
opposed to what you're talking about.

371
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:23,641
It's like,

372
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm going to hear a person.

373
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,590
You're right.

374
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,101
You're right.

375
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:26,630
You know,

376
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,080
in in that sense I'm wrong because it's
really two completely different things.

377
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,030
It's like one of them's a
beautiful orchestration of
sounds and the other one is

378
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:39,570
a person's like expression coming through.

379
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,540
Especially with the addition of language,

380
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,290
the addition of songs and song
writing and the words like,

381
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,124
it's really almost,

382
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,780
it's like the difference between,

383
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,430
it's almost like completely
different artistic endeavors.

384
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,391
Well,

385
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:58,870
it almost feels like those like Mozart
sounds are like genetically passed down

386
00:11:58,871 --> 00:11:59,291
or something.

387
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,340
Like they've been around for so long
that like they become this like you feel

388
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,840
them in your body when you hear it.

389
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,140
It's like you hear,

390
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,410
you feel this like physical
reaction to them in this way.

391
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:10,170
That and as,

392
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,003
as you do,

393
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,710
um,

394
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,960
song written vocal expressions.

395
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,093
But those are,

396
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,810
they're so old that there's something
really interesting that happens from this

397
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,270
traditional reaction to it.

398
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,810
You know?

399
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,000
No one I think would be the shit.

400
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,421
No,

401
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:26,254
what

402
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,550
crash from the float lab and
Venice develop some crazy
underwater speaker system

403
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,280
that's waterproof.

404
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,881
Oh yeah.

405
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:36,750
He's such a wizard.

406
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,870
Oh my God.

407
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,140
It's fucking dude created that.

408
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,170
And he also has been working like forever
on this idea of a screen that amidst

409
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:46,950
the lowest amount of light possible,

410
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:51,870
so that needs to be suspended from you
in front of your face when you're a in

411
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,560
the tank.

412
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,380
And you could see these images almost
like they're floating in the air.

413
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:57,270
Like you can't see a television.

414
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,720
You only see the images in this,

415
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,400
this sensory deprived situation you fic.

416
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,230
But he's got the speakers that he has
figured out how to submerge like in the

417
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,120
water next to you.

418
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:08,620
It's incredible.

419
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,060
Crazy,

420
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,010
and it gives you the stereo sound in
the water where it vibrates off of your

421
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:14,700
body.

422
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,540
Like you feel it,

423
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,360
you feel it on your arms and your legs.

424
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,060
You feel it.

425
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,893
Uh Huh.

426
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,071
Yeah.

427
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:20,670
I mean that's,

428
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,660
and that's what it all is,

429
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:22,560
which is such a crazy,

430
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:23,380
it's just one.

431
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:23,850
Um,

432
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,240
what's it?

433
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,600
Oh,

434
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,080
crazy.

435
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,913
Yeah.

436
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,241
Playing the sounds.

437
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:27,511
I was like,

438
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:28,680
I want to hear them.

439
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,643
I've never done it.

440
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,670
I haven't done this.

441
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:33,870
A new system he's got,

442
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,590
yeah,

443
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,071
but he's a,

444
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:36,270
he's always trying to innovate,

445
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:36,751
but in the,

446
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:39,480
in that way he said
that you feel the music,

447
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,280
you feel it through the line,

448
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,900
which is fascinating.

449
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:43,160
Yeah.

450
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,550
Yeah.

451
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,910
I did that music.

452
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,860
If it's done through one of those things,

453
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,210
like this is just one step.

454
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,620
This guy's got a couple of speakers.

455
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,920
What if they insert them through the
entire base of an isolation tank and then

456
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,410
program music like,

457
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,861
like they,

458
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:03,300
they do those South American Eco rose
with the shamans when they do the IOWASCA

459
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:03,751
ceremony.

460
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:04,890
Some therapy would,

461
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:08,580
if they figured out a way to like get
you into some fucking crazy trans,

462
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,050
like we were talking about how houses
have certain frequencies and then make you

463
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:13,884
go nuts.

464
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,341
You know,

465
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:15,630
maybe there's like a certain one,

466
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,340
some people do like some

467
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,190
Jimi Hendrix did that and
he talks about it sometimes.

468
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,260
Like you get five minutes,

469
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,920
six minutes into some of this music he's
making and people kind of fall into a

470
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:26,754
different state.

471
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,241
You know,

472
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,260
there's a different place.

473
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,210
I guess what I'm saying,

474
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:32,760
it's like people are looking
for it and a lot of musicians,

475
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:33,720
that's what is based on,

476
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:33,871
you know,

477
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:38,100
it's like how can I make this shit
shake to kind of cast a spell without,

478
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,670
you know,

479
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,930
maybe that's not the best way to put it,

480
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:43,890
but it's like I'm trying to affect
you with rat and you can do it in

481
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,030
intentionally almost.

482
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:46,770
I think it's like you
go to a different place.

483
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:47,011
You know,

484
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:47,280
if you,

485
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,570
if you're like really trying to,

486
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,130
trying to do something like that,

487
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:50,970
it's like a weird,

488
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,160
maybe I sound

489
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,870
crazy things that we do it all the time.

490
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,130
Maybe you don't think about it that way,

491
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,900
but what you're doing is trying to connect
with people and express yourself when

492
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:04,250
you're doing it like
vibrationally fucking hippie tall

493
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,280
man,

494
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,940
Bruh.

495
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,571
It's hippy talk.

496
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,404
I agree with.

497
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,860
That's the problem with AP talk comes
from the mouth of hippies occasionally.

498
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,383
Goddammit.

499
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,450
You discredit a discrediting
all these interesting ideas.

500
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,173
Um,

501
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,510
you guys want to play some music?

502
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,230
Sure.

503
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,063
Let's do it.

504
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,113
We won't apply.

505
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,100
I'm going to put bad people.

506
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,143
Sure.

507
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,430
Tell me the punk kid story
because I'm frustrated.

508
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,710
What are you frustrated about?

509
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,620
Because I love that song.

510
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,600
That song is not died.

511
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,750
We you want to hear a song first?

512
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,973
Yes.

513
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,490
Okay.

514
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,323
Whatever you want to do.

515
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,830
Let's play bad people.

516
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm going to take these off and thinking.

517
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,373
Is that Okay Jamie?

518
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,603
I'll just sing.

519
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,250
We just want put it on our next record.

520
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,300
Yeah.

521
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,930
Okay.

522
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,763
Good move.

523
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,270
The legend will grow there or some
record company in congruencies that like,

524
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,680
I know you weren't able to do the things
we wanted with it and it's a really

525
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:59,030
tested it by saying,

526
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,433
wait,

527
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,813
good move.

528
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,820
It's a good song.

529
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,181
It's a,

530
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:04,790
it's a weird song to song.

531
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,050
It's got a lot of layers to it.

532
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,550
It's a lot going on.

533
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,810
What going on in that song?

534
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,343
What a weird shit.

535
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:13,530
Good.

536
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:13,821
Go.

537
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:14,101
Can I,

538
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:14,791
we can we just do it?

539
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,624
Yeah.

540
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,313
Recording.

541
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,140
Hi in the gay keyboard.

542
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,880
Mouse Front Yard

543
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,181
in Paul.

544
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:42,900
So I got to city

545
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,190
judge your best to be
the worst you must like,

546
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:51,470
hey,

547
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,800
that show of Kirsten.

548
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,243
Okay.

549
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,883
Hello.

550
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,473
Oh,

551
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,110
okay.

552
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,580
Ah,

553
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,360
Jimmy,

554
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,750
was it broken?

555
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,760
Sangoma Outta Ellen nut bread.

556
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:28,770
Like a pit bull on your butt.

557
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,510
Crack down his nose.

558
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:31,830
He was bloody all his life.

559
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,520
[inaudible] Abu Dammit.

560
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,750
They cashed the check and he won't know.

561
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,490
Lovers leftover friends.

562
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,890
So it's fine.

563
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,100
Is it Dan?

564
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,010
Hey,

565
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,820
bang in a burner

566
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,120
chimney.

567
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,610
Miss up our sleeves and we all
got some darkness up our sleeve.

568
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,300
Hmm.

569
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,810
Some pulls down and some push through

570
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,591
baby.

571
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:43,610
It's a toss up.

572
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:47,510
How you do maybe some
on the sides for you.

573
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,840
Maybe you don't even get

574
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,780
and a dog,

575
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,730
no

576
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,600
crash and

577
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,840
the bang and a burner.

578
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,190
The boat off come from

579
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,050
come from.

580
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,063
No,

581
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,850
God damn you got

582
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,963
both of you.

583
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,120
Both of you for being so awesome.

584
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,831
God Damn,

585
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:40,664
that was good.

586
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,960
You know it was really cool.

587
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,380
People that are listening to this only
you don't know that Suzanne adjusted

588
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,090
Ben's glasses in the middle of the song.

589
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,990
It's Ben's glasses started to
slip and Suzanne like Lego.

590
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,300
It's like a mama bear set you straight in.

591
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,860
It happens some but it in the middle
of like singing without missing a beat.

592
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,723
It was beautiful.

593
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,430
You were like looking for the
moment to reach towards his face.

594
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,181
Hello?

595
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:05,661
Coming in.

596
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:10,130
I'm coming down and wash my hair by down
his nose and there's nothing you can do

597
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:10,421
about it,

598
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:13,860
but she can't break those scanned
and one of them rubber band things.

599
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,481
Nah Man,

600
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,230
I'm looking for him.

601
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,160
He didn't do like a strap.

602
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,190
Yeah Dude.

603
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,750
Just something like we snap
down like a ski goggles

604
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,440
one day there's going to have a shot
just going to shoot something in your eye

605
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,260
balls and they're going to be,

606
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,441
no,

607
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:28,250
he doesn't want that.

608
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,150
My dad gets that.

609
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,493
He's terrified.

610
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,130
He's got macular degeneration so
we get injections in his eyeball.

611
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,340
Oh yes.

612
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,021
It's crazy.

613
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:36,854
Lord.

614
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,091
You think about,

615
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,040
I think about that sometimes.

616
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,180
Like if you could either go blind,

617
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:41,930
right,

618
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,480
or get hypodermic needles shot
into your eyes every month,

619
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,260
month,

620
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,710
every month.

621
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,370
Every month.

622
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:48,920
Okay.

623
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,180
Yeah.

624
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,100
Maybe there's some not a,

625
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,463
okay,

626
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,120
and you're so tough.

627
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,411
No,

628
00:20:58,411 --> 00:20:59,500
it's anybody's ever answer.

629
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,010
It doesn't say that he's hardcore.

630
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,850
Remember he's medium cords saying no,

631
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,260
no,

632
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,600
no.

633
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,740
You're a poser

634
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,280
Amar court,

635
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,113
bro.

636
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,340
All's part of the hardcore hardcore scene.

637
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,020
There was hardcore guys.

638
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,940
There's a bunch of guys
didn't believe that.

639
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,310
The guys who were calling us don't worry.

640
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,190
A lot of leather

641
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,771
or suede.

642
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,690
I wore this kind of squared like
that I should have wore off.

643
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:26,030
I was like on a stage coach
in the 17 hundreds of tassels,

644
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,341
tassels.

645
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:30,040
I wore moccasins only
wanted a tip throats.

646
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,960
You Woods making shit up.

647
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,120
Moccasins seemed cool.

648
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:34,960
I wish I were more,

649
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,040
it's interesting how like all you have
to do is we're a dead animal skin in a

650
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,570
dark color and you're a rebel,

651
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,400
you know like the black leather jacket
and the 1950s especially with the little

652
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,270
silver buttons.

653
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,010
Well that's what I love about Poeboy.

654
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,540
I think there's some really
interesting things in there.

655
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:57,070
Like people have these like connections
to certain elements of like what you put

656
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:57,870
on shore.

657
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,720
I think it's fascinating.

658
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:00,510
That's why you need all
you people out there.

659
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,930
Need to respect rob Halford.

660
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,880
Okay.

661
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,070
Is that Rob Halford to Judas priest.

662
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,700
Oh,

663
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,533
dare you.

664
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,970
No breakdown

665
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,320
Scott.

666
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,390
Another thing is sheltered life.

667
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,210
I mean that guy,

668
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,631
uh,

669
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:21,631
was probably one of the first openly gay
singers have a fucking a band when it

670
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:22,500
opened.

671
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,880
Right?

672
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,780
A metal pan and he got
everybody to dress like him.

673
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,153
Mother daddies.

674
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,970
You guys thought you were metal?

675
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,311
Well,

676
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,280
you really were the same thing.

677
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,260
[inaudible]

678
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,020
it was web.

679
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,720
Brilliant.

680
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:40,871
Yeah.

681
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,130
That's how bad ass he was.

682
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,553
I had him on one of them.

683
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,710
I did this show once

684
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,820
it's for ESP or not ESPN VH one.

685
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,900
And uh,

686
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,310
he was one of the guests on the show.

687
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:52,380
I'll get to hang out with
that guy for like an hour.

688
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,423
It was cool.

689
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,960
So cool.

690
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,771
But it was so weird.

691
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:56,101
It was like,

692
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:56,701
God damn,

693
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:57,021
I'm tall.

694
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:59,490
I'm senior talking to
rock and roll royalty.

695
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,790
You know when I was in high school,

696
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,490
I had this friend that was
obsessed with Judas priest.

697
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,340
I think I'll let them sit around

698
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,400
and wait until we had this fucking kid.

699
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,234
Man.

700
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:19,140
It's his life saw his life sucked.

701
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:20,240
His Dad's suck.

702
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,900
His situations sucked.

703
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,400
You got another thank God.

704
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,330
Dot.

705
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,360
That that fucking song.

706
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,300
You got another thing coming fueled
that dude through high school.

707
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,740
I swear to God it though.

708
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,080
That's the crazy thing
about what you guys do.

709
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,510
Like music can be heard it
like it feels like you can eat,

710
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,020
it's like fuel.

711
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,100
There's something to it.

712
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:41,550
Like it didn't,

713
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,630
Hunter Thompson had a,

714
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,710
he had uh,

715
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,920
an amazing quote about that.

716
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:49,520
He thinks of music as
inspiration or is it fuel heath?

717
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,700
I think he said fuel and he
said that when you listen to it,

718
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,570
you swear that you can get 'em
shittily paraphrasing what he said,

719
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:58,310
but it was like you could,

720
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,560
you feel like you could drive further on
an empty tank of gas that you can just

721
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,394
keep going.

722
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,220
Like it'll allow you to go at 20%
longer or something like that.

723
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:08,540
I forget what his actual quote was,

724
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,460
but it's like that's true.

725
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,150
Like there's something happens man,

726
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,180
when a song you've got

727
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,810
don like you feel stronger,

728
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,161
right?

729
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,210
If you were at the gym,

730
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,910
it sounds also like bringing you back to
this place that you'll never like that

731
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,270
always bring you back.

732
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:26,721
They're like,

733
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:29,120
they'll bring you back to
like this childhood of like,

734
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,680
nobody can fucking touch that.

735
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,860
Like this summer I,

736
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,790
every time I listened to
the fucking this song,

737
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,241
you know,

738
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,770
it brings it back to
this time where I'm like,

739
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,420
it almost makes you giddy.

740
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,070
Hunter s town.

741
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,910
Here's the code.

742
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,780
Music has always been a
matter of energy to me.

743
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:42,900
A question of fuels.

744
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:44,900
Sentimental people call it inspiration,

745
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,580
but what it really means is fuel.

746
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,260
I have always needed fuel.

747
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:50,750
I'm a serious consumer on some nights.

748
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:55,751
I still believe the car
with the gas needle on empty
can run about 50 more miles

749
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,110
if you have the right music.

750
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:59,610
Very loud on the radio purpose.

751
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,561
Beautiful border.

752
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:01,394
I butchered that.

753
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,713
I haven't read that

754
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,040
paraphrase job.

755
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,840
Ac DC,

756
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,673
ac DC.

757
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,450
For me it was a suicidal tendencies.

758
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,020
You can't bring me down cause the
greatest weightlifting song at all.

759
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:16,820
I swear to God I'm 10% stronger.

760
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,890
You can

761
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,620
never heard of suicidal tendencies.

762
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,220
Absolutely.

763
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,611
Fuck yeah.

764
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:22,910
Right.

765
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,743
Yeah.

766
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,920
Venice and they would come in and play
some time course that you can't bring me

767
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:28,550
down.

768
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,440
Anybody who listens to that
you can lift more weights.

769
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,060
You become stronger,

770
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,313
you become stronger.

771
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,701
You can be angry.

772
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:34,971
Sorry,

773
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:35,804
sorry to interrupt,

774
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,670
but that gave me a question in my mind.

775
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,160
How do you feel?

776
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,170
I just learned about estrogen blockers.

777
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,490
Okay.

778
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,323
How do you feel about

779
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,863
estrogen?

780
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,560
I feel the same way that I have
like with Roach motels there.

781
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:52,394
If you need them,

782
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,020
you should get them.

783
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,973
Okay.

784
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,563
I mean,

785
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,300
just blew my mind the other way.

786
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,134
He was like,

787
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,621
I don't know.

788
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:00,941
I mean,

789
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:01,141
uh,

790
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:01,941
if you have a headache,

791
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:02,774
you should get aspirin.

792
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,670
That's what I'm saying.

793
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,340
Yeah.

794
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,851
What's going on,

795
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:05,684
man?

796
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,570
I was talking to somebody about
building muscle and he was like,

797
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,200
Dude,

798
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,681
you should,

799
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:10,514
uh,

800
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,350
the real problem with
those things is what their,

801
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:14,581
the,

802
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:18,560
the with a really good for is if
someone is coming off of a steroid,

803
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,910
because when you take a steroid,

804
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,500
your endocrine system suffers,

805
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,140
stops producing testosterone and this,

806
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:24,591
these things,

807
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:25,640
like they're called,

808
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:28,160
like Clomid is one of m and a,

809
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:31,670
there's a couple of other
different companies that
make a similar product and it

810
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,960
increases your body's ability to reap,

811
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,340
to produce testosterone.

812
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,700
It has this like affection
blocking the estrogen.

813
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,170
You produce more testosterone,

814
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:43,780
your body tries to seek
some sort of a balance.

815
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,100
He sort

816
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,700
of trick it.

817
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,420
Yeah.

818
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,210
I think we know so little about what,

819
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,220
what does and doesn't like work for you.

820
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:53,701
Like is it,

821
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,830
there's a lot of
experimentation going on like,

822
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:56,011
well,

823
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:58,140
maybe he needs a this or
maybe he needs out of that.

824
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,160
How old is he?

825
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,510
What's his background?

826
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,010
But you can get this
stuff over the counter.

827
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,810
Right.

828
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,643
It's like,

829
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,780
what have you done before
you decided to do that?

830
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:08,100
This is the like if anybody
ever wants to do something,

831
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,030
if they ever want to go,

832
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,541
hey man,

833
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,760
I'm thinking about getting into
a hardcore workout program.

834
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
How many days in a row
have you worked out?

835
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,820
Be honest me.

836
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,041
No,

837
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:15,131
no,

838
00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:15,300
no.

839
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,350
This is why I set those dude too.

840
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:17,701
I'm like,

841
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:17,971
dude,

842
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:18,940
you fuck you.

843
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:19,441
Fuck her.

844
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,160
Listen,

845
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,621
if you want to,

846
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:22,140
if you want to start running marathons,

847
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:22,960
you've got to run every day.

848
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,290
But she,

849
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,520
okay,

850
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,870
I can't just keep talking to you.

851
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:25,800
You're talking nonsense.

852
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:25,980
Yeah.

853
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,813
Right.

854
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:27,841
And if you're saying,

855
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:27,961
well,

856
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,170
I'm thinking about
taking estrogen blockers.

857
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,720
How many days do you lift weights?

858
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,243
How often?

859
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,390
How sore are you?

860
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,320
A little bit sore.

861
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:35,610
Okay,

862
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,460
but I don't even do that.

863
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,670
Say never going to work
the thing if you wanted,

864
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,780
but if you want to do it,

865
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:43,890
the first thing you do before you think
about estrogen blockers are in a hurry.

866
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,480
It's just be consistent.

867
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,160
It's the most important thing.

868
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:48,270
It's more important than anything.

869
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,900
It's more important even than the
amount of weight that you lift.

870
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,130
It's the frequency in which you engage
in the act of going to the gym and

871
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:56,964
exerting yourself.

872
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,780
Cause if you can consistently
do it every time,

873
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,200
we talked to this earlier but I'd do it,

874
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:04,801
but this is,

875
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:07,290
this is plastic and available daily,

876
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,010
but you could just take
this shit and from no,

877
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,171
no,

878
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:09,320
no.

879
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,350
You need prescription.

880
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:13,680
They do need a good ass
unless it doesn't work.

881
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,750
I mean unless it's fake fake ones.

882
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,200
The people may forgive my ignorance,

883
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:22,710
but is this anything that like
transgender people would take to?

884
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,281
No,

885
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:23,551
no,

886
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:23,731
no,

887
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:23,941
no.

888
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:24,810
It's a different,

889
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,690
it's really to try to stimulate growth of,

890
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:32,730
to stimulate the reproduction
of testosterone by like
trying to fuck with the

891
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:34,681
balance.

892
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:36,780
Like by suppressing estrogen,

893
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,000
you sort of try to elevate
your body elevates us.

894
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:39,201
Todd.

895
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:44,201
There's like some wrestling match going
on cause they need hardcore chemicals.

896
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,120
Yeah.

897
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,120
They need bio identical hormones that are
in whatever gender they identify with.

898
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,630
I decided to transition into,

899
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,673
which is one of the,

900
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:58,050
I mean objectively nonjudgmentally but
objectively it's one of the oddest things

901
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,430
about the whole idea.

902
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,390
Well,

903
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,150
it's not just that like
this is who you are.

904
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:04,320
It's like this is who you are.

905
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Also putting hormones in your
body to become what it would,

906
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:12,660
it seems like you feel like you should be.

907
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,440
So there's a,

908
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
there's many layers and
and totally nonjudgmental,

909
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,730
judgemental sense.

910
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,800
No one's telling you to not do it at all,

911
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,820
but there's,

912
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,260
there's a lot going on there.

913
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,630
It's not just identifying with something,

914
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:26,700
it's choosing to transitioned into,

915
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,780
so there's a lot,

916
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:32,100
it's like there's some serious complexity
to all of this and in a nonjudgmental

917
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:32,311
way.

918
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:33,690
It's very fascinating.

919
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,440
It's very fascinating that we're coming
more and more comfortable with it

920
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,740
because ultimately isn't it
really when it's all over?

921
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,260
Ultimately,

922
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,710
what do I,

923
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,543
who gives a fuck?

924
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,870
Like jokes aside,

925
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,801
laughing,

926
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:47,710
assigned a serious hot debates.

927
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,160
Who cares if you want to be a man,

928
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:52,240
if you want to be a woman,

929
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,590
if you want to be both,

930
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,910
you want to switch back and forth.

931
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:56,320
There was a guy on one of the NPR,

932
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,460
it was not in a radio lab.

933
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:57,600
Okay.

934
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,750
I was switches back and forth.

935
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,441
He's like,

936
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:00,310
sometimes he's a woman.

937
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,443
I'm a man now.

938
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,940
He just is because in his head,

939
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,970
the way he identifies,

940
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,470
he was like two different
people in his head.

941
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,760
One of them's man and then it becomes
a woman and in the middle of the things

942
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,011
goes,

943
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:11,581
I just switched.

944
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:13,050
I just flipped here like he's talking,

945
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:14,670
he's people like I'm a
man now and we were like,

946
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,390
what?

947
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,160
You can just do that again?

948
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,440
This isn't it possible.

949
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:20,110
He's crazy.

950
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,080
Like isn't it possibly
he's making shit up.

951
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,280
Do we have electrodes?

952
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,080
And like sometimes he's like,

953
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:26,220
what is he thinking about dicks?

954
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:27,054
It's all decks.

955
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,470
Sometimes it's vaginas.

956
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,473
Agendas now,

957
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,530
well I mean there's an emotional mental
screening process for people that want

958
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:39,531
to go like full throttle with the like
Dick to v d two D to d switch it up.

959
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,880
Unfortunately like pretty certificated.

960
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,640
It's surgery and I think there's gonna
come a really interesting time where

961
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:53,080
they're able to manipulate what
you are in a way that's non,

962
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,860
not like as primitive as cutting and
stitching things back up together.

963
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,780
But maybe like somehow or another altering
what you actually are like changing.

964
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,810
Like the signal that your cells have
and what shape you want it to form.

965
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,680
I mean I don't think that's
outside of the the possibilities.

966
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,100
You know,

967
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,670
what about transmitting consciousness
to different body because people do talk

968
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:19,000
about that while we're also
recognizing that your body's not,

969
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,270
it's what you need it
while you're using it,

970
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,700
but it's not all of you and that the
idea of who you are when you're not even

971
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:32,050
connected to your body like that might
be the real you and what what this body

972
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:33,370
thing is is it's like this,

973
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,700
you have this like biological thing that
you're attached to if sort of evolved

974
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:44,971
with you and in just the same way you
have all this weird bacteria on your skin

975
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,590
and weird flora and your intestines.

976
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:52,780
That might be exactly what like life and
the body is and that the consciousness

977
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:53,614
in the body,

978
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,010
they,

979
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,260
they're the really the,

980
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,660
they're kind of the same thing
but not really the same way.

981
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,540
Like the things that are
growing in your body.

982
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:06,541
All the millions and billions
and trillions of microbes
and life forms that live

983
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:08,320
in every one of us.

984
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,491
Those are,

985
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:09,791
you know,

986
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,930
and we don't want to
think that they're all,

987
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,110
they're not even important if
without them you're fucked.

988
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,090
Just cause you can talk.

989
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,310
It doesn't mean they're
not in on the whole thing.

990
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,090
You know,

991
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,670
you're a giant collection of living,

992
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,463
you know,

993
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,903
it's incredible.

994
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,421
Fuck,

995
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:26,254
we're crazy.

996
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,820
We're so odd.

997
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,770
It makes me think of the planet thing.

998
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,700
You know,

999
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,870
all of a sudden all these gases,

1000
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,010
all this shit's just boom,

1001
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:38,730
smacks together and then it's the
thing or it was a thing before.

1002
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,670
Now the form changes.

1003
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:42,680
But like the fuck is it?

1004
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,930
Why is the center burning up?

1005
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,950
I Dunno.

1006
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,221
I'm not,

1007
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:47,080
I'm too dumb for that.

1008
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:47,331
Me Too.

1009
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:48,161
You don't like those zones?

1010
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:49,570
She dumped four k like,

1011
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,780
like water on Mars.

1012
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:51,020
Like,

1013
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,440
hmm,

1014
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,400
what water?

1015
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:52,911
Ice.

1016
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:53,301
What is it?

1017
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:54,560
I can get those concepts.

1018
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,423
I understand.

1019
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,630
I've seen water melts.

1020
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,930
I've seen it get cold.

1021
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:00,710
I've seen icicles on Mars.

1022
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,400
Could you imagine if they really
did find a life form on Mars?

1023
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,700
Haven't they found bacterias and like
microscopic things think they found

1024
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,800
evidence of biology

1025
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,810
in my very rudimentary way
of understanding what those
guys are talking about.

1026
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:21,550
I think they find like
there's certain cities,

1027
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,453
nature,

1028
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,850
uh,

1029
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,850
patterns that they can find that might
indicate some sort of biological life at

1030
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:28,791
some point in time.

1031
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,440
But I don't think they
found a smoking gun.

1032
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,290
I don't think they found
like a fossil or am I right,

1033
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:33,650
Jamie?

1034
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,483
Does that make sense?

1035
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,910
And there's the potential that there's
like forms of life that we cannot

1036
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,890
identify as as humans.

1037
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:40,530
Like,

1038
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,900
like aren't like these,

1039
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,320
you know,

1040
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,910
physical elements.

1041
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:45,920
But that it's like almost
something that you just can't see,

1042
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:46,191
smell,

1043
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:46,791
taste or touch,

1044
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,001
you know,

1045
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:47,834
it's like,

1046
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,021
oh,

1047
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:48,980
it might be,

1048
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,930
and this is going to be
the craziest thing to say.

1049
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,970
It might be that everything's alive.

1050
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,230
It might,

1051
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,230
it might be that everything that you
encounter reacts in some sort of a weird

1052
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,434
way.

1053
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,770
But we are so rigid in
our idea of what's alive,

1054
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:06,250
what's not alive or what's
conscious and not shot,

1055
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,790
but retains energy.

1056
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,160
And what doesn't that
we don't think about it.

1057
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:12,830
We don't think about like
objects and how well the,

1058
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:13,151
you know,

1059
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:13,400
this,

1060
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,130
the psychics talk about
like multidimensional planes
and stuff and I dunno,

1061
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:18,531
I know.

1062
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:18,891
I don't,

1063
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,300
I don't know where you
stand on this stuff,

1064
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:22,250
but I think they're mostly bullshit,

1065
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,853
bullshit stuff.

1066
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,930
But there's also stuff
that I've seen that I'm,

1067
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,240
I can't explain and I'm like,

1068
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,680
what the fuck is that?

1069
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,003
You know?

1070
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,781
Yeah,

1071
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:33,081
no,

1072
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:34,220
I know exactly what you mean.

1073
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,200
You never know what to
talk about it right now.

1074
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,490
But it's like we were talking about
the ghost hunting shows earlier.

1075
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,650
I don't not believe in like that guy a,

1076
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,230
what's his name?

1077
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,320
Zack Baggins.

1078
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:45,590
He's,

1079
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,640
he seems like a nice guy.

1080
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:47,890
I've watched the show for it.

1081
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:48,530
Entertaining.

1082
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,670
He goes looking for ghosts.

1083
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,140
Can I tell you some ghost stories?

1084
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:51,411
Here's,

1085
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:52,244
here's the go story.

1086
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:52,970
Okay.

1087
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,803
So my dad,

1088
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,343
uh,

1089
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,190
running this restaurant with
my uncle since he was 17.

1090
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,440
He kills a man with ax.

1091
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,380
Not Lately,

1092
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,940
but we didn't pay for up.

1093
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,780
You said sauce.

1094
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,840
Um,

1095
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,600
but my dad was telling me this story that,

1096
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,463
um,

1097
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,620
uh,

1098
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,600
I wasn't that long ago that this family
that's been coming into the restaurant

1099
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:18,740
for years and years and years,

1100
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,933
um,

1101
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,190
came in and he saw everybody,

1102
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:22,821
he saw,

1103
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:23,001
you know,

1104
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:23,331
mom,

1105
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:23,661
Dad,

1106
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:24,440
kids,

1107
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,180
beautiful grandmother shining the back.

1108
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,230
And he said,

1109
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,411
oh,

1110
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:27,741
he guys,

1111
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:28,341
party of five.

1112
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:28,940
And they said,

1113
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,271
nope,

1114
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:30,104
just for,

1115
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,980
and,

1116
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,630
and he told like this,

1117
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,351
you know,

1118
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:34,010
it's like Dad,

1119
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,750
like my dad is not going
to fucking make shit up.

1120
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,400
And he said he felt

1121
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,810
this incredible,

1122
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:40,820
like the,

1123
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,530
the grandmother was
standing behind the family,

1124
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,750
like just like looking so happy.

1125
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:46,584
And he was like,

1126
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,150
okay,

1127
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,983
four.

1128
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,711
And then he said,

1129
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:49,851
he,

1130
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:53,880
he like looked away and she was
gone and he sat the family down and,

1131
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,773
and he,

1132
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,790
he was really freaked out and he like,

1133
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,440
he was kind of like,

1134
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,041
you know,

1135
00:35:59,041 --> 00:35:59,791
doing other stuff.

1136
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,624
And he,

1137
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,830
he came back and he said,

1138
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:02,041
hey,

1139
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:02,874
how's your,

1140
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,020
how's your mom doing?

1141
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:04,381
And they said,

1142
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:04,531
oh,

1143
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:04,621
well,

1144
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:08,040
she passed a couple months ago
and he had this moment where he,

1145
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,611
he was like,

1146
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:09,780
I felt like I should tell them.

1147
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,130
And he did and he said,

1148
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,200
I feel really uncomfortable,

1149
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:13,391
but I,

1150
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:15,990
I really feel like I need you to know
that when you came into the restaurant,

1151
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,660
I saw your mother
standing behind you guys.

1152
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,800
And,

1153
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,820
and they didn't kind of,

1154
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,460
they didn't freak out and they,

1155
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,160
they just said,

1156
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,020
we really feel like she's still with us.

1157
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:25,590
And,

1158
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,500
and that's not the first time my
dad's had a weird ghost story at the

1159
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:28,920
restaurant.

1160
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,570
He's had a few other experiences.

1161
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:32,190
And when you talked about it,

1162
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,210
he was kind of like,

1163
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:33,820
yeah,

1164
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,550
I s I fucking saw her.

1165
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,413
Like I saw her.

1166
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,380
So your dad saw the old lady behind them?

1167
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,220
Yeah.

1168
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,570
And how old was your dad at the time?

1169
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,620
This was like last year.

1170
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,461
A couple of years ago.

1171
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:44,600
Like it wasn't that long ago.

1172
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,000
And um,

1173
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,020
wow.

1174
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,620
Yeah,

1175
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,010
it's,

1176
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,843
look,

1177
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,330
if,

1178
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,650
if you can have people,

1179
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,130
like,

1180
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,050
if the idea that goes to ridiculous,

1181
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,603
why is it,

1182
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,530
why is it any more
ridiculous than an echo?

1183
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,530
Yeah.

1184
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,870
You ever get under a bridge and yell,

1185
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,773
hello?

1186
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,183
Hello?

1187
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,673
Hello?

1188
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,660
Hello?

1189
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,550
Hello.

1190
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,340
Why is that weirder than ghosts?

1191
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,050
It's not right.

1192
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,760
It's a ghost.

1193
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:14,220
Could be just as likely
could be like your,

1194
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:14,521
your,

1195
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:16,590
your actual life form whenever it was,

1196
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:17,161
when you went.

1197
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:17,994
Sure.

1198
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,650
I mean it might like Echo,

1199
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,510
we underestimate how
powerful our energy is.

1200
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:22,841
I mean,

1201
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,720
people can leave a real impression
that people can stay with you.

1202
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:29,800
Like literally like have you ever had
somebody who just like fucking kicked your

1203
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:32,440
ass energetically and you
left a place and you're like,

1204
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:32,921
God,

1205
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:34,570
I just feel like there's still with me,

1206
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:34,920
like,

1207
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,630
like that stuff is not
to be taken lightly.

1208
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,190
I think.

1209
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,760
And it can be the absolute opposite
end of the spectrum of joy and love and

1210
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,580
kindness and you can get
energy in these places.

1211
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:50,581
And I think some people can have an
innate ability to us to interpret it in a

1212
00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:54,640
different way where they
are maybe actually see it
or the hear it or whatever.

1213
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,271
You know,

1214
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:56,290
cause I believe my Dad,

1215
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:57,011
I love my dad.

1216
00:37:57,011 --> 00:37:57,780
I believe him.

1217
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,530
You know,

1218
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,200
it's totally possible that
someone can actually see an aura.

1219
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,880
But if you can't take a photo of it,

1220
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,840
I'm just have,

1221
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,270
I just have to bank on the fact you know,

1222
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:07,470
out of your fucking mind,

1223
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,710
you know to date we've talked
to my dad and he'll ask him,

1224
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:11,340
I don't know.

1225
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,090
And go screen screen
all around him is green.

1226
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:15,940
Green is like,

1227
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,850
I see him,

1228
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,381
I see him,

1229
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,214
I see his arm.

1230
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,790
There are people,

1231
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,623
things like that.

1232
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,610
It's purple.

1233
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,750
You don't,

1234
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,583
what is that from?

1235
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,730
It's from almost famous.

1236
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,683
Oh,

1237
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,853
okay.

1238
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,773
Was

1239
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,371
One movie,

1240
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:32,581
right?

1241
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:35,890
So is that like the cautionary
tale for the young Rockstar?

1242
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,440
I that's probably the tempting tent,

1243
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,423
right?

1244
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,363
Yeah.

1245
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,520
I don't know if we'll ever get there,

1246
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:49,354
but maybe

1247
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,730
you don't want to get there.

1248
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,710
You want to get like in the neighborhood,

1249
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,260
you want to get like a adjacent

1250
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,660
from that guy.

1251
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,530
You don't have the time.

1252
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,190
Did we start this podcast
earlier than seven 45

1253
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,900
party that now it's been awhile.

1254
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,670
You guys want to play another song?

1255
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,170
W we should,

1256
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,090
but I also want to play
our sweet thing video.

1257
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,680
I feel like we should play it first.

1258
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,670
It's fucking awesome.

1259
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,150
Okay,

1260
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,750
let's play it.

1261
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,051

1262
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:17,681

1263

00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,953

1272
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,623

1273
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,050

1274
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,090
What is this?

1275
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,080
We did this official video,

1276
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,190
Dave Gruber Allen.

1277
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,431
Well,

1278
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:46,270
we have to be careful.

1279
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:49,090
We don't want you to flag
us off of Youtube with this.

1280
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,260
Will you get in trouble?

1281
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:50,681
You might.

1282
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:54,010
You guys might have some like really
overly enthusiastic regular company.

1283
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,120
Ooh.

1284
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,590
Do you have a good record company
or is your record company very

1285
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,510
by the book?

1286
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,880
We have not litigious.

1287
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,610
Um,

1288
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:08,610
then happy come into the office to give
them permission to saying and play sweet

1289
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:13,940
thing on their power lapsed.

1290
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,510
Who says we do?

1291
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,320
I would like you guys to say
it into the microphone that no

1292
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,150
forming the entire answer.

1293
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,541
Honey.

1294
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:23,090
Honey.

1295
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:23,471
Yeah.

1296
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,304
All right.

1297
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,443
Rolling.

1298
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,003
Sexy Bitch.

1299
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,231
Oh,

1300
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,064
nice.

1301
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,553
Speeding

1302
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,060
through my tab.

1303
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,041
Oh,

1304
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,720
if you're not watching this,

1305
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,540
there's an old dancing.

1306
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,620
He's got white hair,

1307
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,860
long beard and long
hair and these signings,

1308
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,710
everything is Suzanne sings
in a sexy gyrating way.

1309
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,290
Does look at him.

1310
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,390
I can't wait until

1311
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,613
this far.

1312
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,543
See?

1313
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,280
Oh my God.

1314
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,573
Makes me

1315
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,173
sick.

1316
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,890
That is awesome.

1317
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,290
That's a fun video.

1318
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:45,290
What is it about videos where when you
watch some shit that makes it look really

1319
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:45,681
old,

1320
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:46,640
it becomes better?

1321
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,621
Like all the,

1322
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:52,640
like the little scratchy things that made
it seem like it was like an old movie.

1323
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,210
Yeah.

1324
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:53,660
Yeah.

1325
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,470
Why has it become better?

1326
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,190
What does that,

1327
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,380
what does that call to
nostalgia and a mood,

1328
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,023
you know,

1329
00:43:59,290 --> 00:43:59,540
mood,

1330
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,530
make it familiar.

1331
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,940
Who is the old dude that was dancing?

1332
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:02,780
He was on Uber.

1333
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,823
Who's groover?

1334
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,300
Dave Gruber Allen is,

1335
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:05,931
he was,

1336
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:06,764
um,

1337
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,660
he's famous for a few things.

1338
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:10,550
He was on a show called freaks and Geeks,

1339
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,590
um,

1340
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,400
a Judd Apatow show.

1341
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,770
He played the guidance counselor,

1342
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,230
so there's like this
weird like cult following,

1343
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:23,210
but he was also the naked trucker on
comedy central and he's done a lot of

1344
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:24,140
really great work,

1345
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:27,830
but he's also been a really great
friend of ours over the years.

1346
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,600
When I first moved to La,

1347
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,410
I'd moved into a house and was,

1348
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,430
he was my house maintenance.

1349
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:35,490
It's like crazy intro to the city.

1350
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:36,360
I was 18.

1351
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:39,030
I moved in and he was
much older and just like,

1352
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,763
it kind of,

1353
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,840
I got to see all this
great comedy that I never,

1354
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:43,021
like.

1355
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:45,900
I'd never gone to a comedy club when I
was a kid and they didn't have that where

1356
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:46,530
I was,

1357
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,011
where I grew up.

1358
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:47,790
Excuse me.

1359
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:48,623
Um,

1360
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,021
and,

1361
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:49,770
uh,

1362
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,790
I was going to this club and in La and
seeing all these dudes like him and

1363
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,740
Patton Oswald was doing Largo,

1364
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,631
Largo guys.

1365
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:58,350
There's this great,

1366
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:58,531
yeah,

1367
00:44:58,531 --> 00:44:58,741
he's,

1368
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,574
he's in that,

1369
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,211
yeah.

1370
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,580
That's a very unusual video.

1371
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:02,941
Yes.

1372
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:03,031
Oh,

1373
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:03,440
cool.

1374
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:03,840
Oh,

1375
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,360
look a little more on the bow.

1376
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,250
How pretty consistent with our videos.

1377
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:09,360
The house had been
lived in and I lived in,

1378
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:10,110
again,

1379
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,440
it's kind of like this artist
compound and like Jim Turner,

1380
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,460
um,

1381
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,880
owns a house I really good friend and he
was our angel of death and our angel of

1382
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,714
death video.

1383
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:19,560
Um,

1384
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,520
but like he was also Randy
of the redwoods on MTV.

1385
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,440
This is fun to do shit with your friends.

1386
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:26,191
And I mean,

1387
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:28,530
that's what we keep doing over
and over when we have a project,

1388
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:29,820
people who just want
to do with our friends.

1389
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,310
Yeah.

1390
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:30,640
It's,

1391
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,121
it makes it,

1392
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:31,460
yeah.

1393
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,550
It makes everything more fun.

1394
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,413
Doable.

1395
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:33,990
Yeah.

1396
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,640
It changes what the thing is.

1397
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,240
Yeah.

1398
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,820
The thing goes from
being a labor to a party.

1399
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,753
Yeah.

1400
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:40,750
And Jim,

1401
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,390
Jim and,

1402
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,510
and Gruber are like our family to us.

1403
00:45:43,511 --> 00:45:47,860
So when we get to make
fucking silly videos with them
and whether people like it

1404
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:48,221
or not,

1405
00:45:48,221 --> 00:45:48,730
like we,

1406
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,361
we love it.

1407
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:50,194
It's so fun,

1408
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,180
you know?

1409
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,013
Yeah.

1410
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,390
I mean it's one of the
coolest things that you can,

1411
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,250
when you do things like that today,

1412
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,391
you could just,

1413
00:45:57,391 --> 00:46:01,470
you could distribute them in a way that
you'd never would be able to just a

1414
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:01,471
decade ago,

1415
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,304
two decades,

1416
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,240
three decades go.

1417
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:03,931
You know,

1418
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:04,230
it was,

1419
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,470
you guys were people in the
music business especially,

1420
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:12,060
we're so dependent upon like
traveling and getting a reputation,

1421
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:12,631
you know,

1422
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:13,800
and word of mouth.

1423
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,340
I know in some bands like became
gigantic just through word of mouth.

1424
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:20,910
Like that was like a big thing.

1425
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,170
Back when we were kids.

1426
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,690
It was like underground music.

1427
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:25,590
Like if you found that,

1428
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:26,820
if you knew about the creeps,

1429
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,080
do you know about the crepes?

1430
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,490
I like people knew.

1431
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:29,910
They knew.

1432
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,440
People knew about it like he had it.

1433
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:32,110
No,

1434
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,350
yeah,

1435
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:32,610
no.

1436
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,443
Someone,

1437
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,260
you know,

1438
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,740
if you wanted to hear about
some cool shit to this,

1439
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,980

1440
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,480
Do you know who Kool g rap is?

1441
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,770

1442
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:41,371

I need to get you a fucking demo tape.

1444
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,651
You know,

1445
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:46,860
there was like some dudes that were like
these underground dudes and knowing who

1446
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:48,720
they were was like crucially important.

1447
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:49,380
Oh yeah.

1448
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,240

1450

00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,120
Maybe a little bit too much.

1505
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,541
Yeah,

1506
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,440
we get physical,

1507
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,230
so yeah,

1508
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:26,671
yeah,

1509
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:27,504
yeah.

1510
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,450
A lot of flailing.

1511
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,820
We both got accosted by this woman
in mom recently and he was good.

1512
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:37,161
It was amazing.

1513
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,310
He see all of a sudden I was like,

1514
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,440
she was kissing my neck and I was like,

1515
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,313
oh,

1516
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,170
hold on a second.

1517
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,760
You need to buy me things first.

1518
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,770
How bad their breast milk now.

1519
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:48,910
She was really beautiful,

1520
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:49,661
but I was also,

1521
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:52,660
she was just so aggressive and I felt
like a fucking piece of meat and I was

1522
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:52,870
like,

1523
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:53,350
let's,

1524
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,183
let's not,

1525
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:55,870
let's just calm down,

1526
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,711
you know,

1527
00:48:56,711 --> 00:48:58,690
I want to be treated nicely.

1528
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,633
That's awesome.

1529
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,723
That's right.

1530
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,593
Have you been linked?

1531
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,810
I have a very strong husband.

1532
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,153
Heisman

1533
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,560
assumed the highest one.

1534
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,540
Can't let them get close enough
to turn you into a Zombie

1535
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,330
on the walking dead.

1536
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,253
And they were like,

1537
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:17,861
oh no,

1538
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:18,071
no,

1539
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:18,281
no,

1540
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:19,114
no bitch.

1541
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,400
If you're in the middle of the
football field with a Zombie,

1542
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,393
okay,

1543
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,740
they're not,

1544
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,580
you're not going to get me.

1545
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:24,830
No.

1546
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,211
Okay.

1547
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:25,630
You're not,

1548
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,890
I'm fast too fast.

1549
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,290
Just shoot right for the head.

1550
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,213
I know you do.

1551
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:30,520
Yeah,

1552
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,420
but if I have a gun,

1553
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,081
but I'm saying like,

1554
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:33,100
it was just me and the Zombie,

1555
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:33,560
like,

1556
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,300
um,

1557
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,890
this isn't 28 days later.

1558
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,340
28 days to fucking terrifying to those.

1559
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,160
They get you,

1560
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,820
you got to go slow movers walking into,

1561
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:43,070
I'll fuck those dudes up.

1562
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:45,131
What was he?

1563
00:49:45,131 --> 00:49:45,964
They were moving fast,

1564
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,730
but in the book and the
books and the audio tapes,

1565
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:49,740
which we listened to on toward,

1566
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:50,650
they were slow.

1567
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,350
When I saw the movie
scared the fuck out of me.

1568
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,320
I will head kick the fuck out of a Zombie.

1569
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,220
I'll tell you right now,

1570
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:59,020
let's talk about style zombies.

1571
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:04,170
I warm up with some software to the body
moving and then once I feel like this

1572
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:05,311
dummy,

1573
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:07,110
he's going to just walk
right into a wheel kick.

1574
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,830
I'm gonna try to take a Zombie's head off,

1575
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,060
tried to kick a Zombie.

1576
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,923
Right.

1577
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:15,580
I wonder sometimes when
people like Halloween time
when people like to fuck with

1578
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:17,290
each other and someone who's like,

1579
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,480
I'm going to dress up like
a Zombie and scare people,

1580
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,130
but if they like take it to an extreme,

1581
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:25,300
like if someone would actually like go
crazy on them because the fear of zombies

1582
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:26,134
is so great.

1583
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:26,350
Oh,

1584
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:31,070
people have been killed by that in the
south really by being a fake Zombie

1585
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,140
zombies impersonator.

1586
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:35,480
Hundred percent don't do it.

1587
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,560
That's really dumb.

1588
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:40,430
I was in Montana right around the time.

1589
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:42,830
It was like between like
maybe six months before,

1590
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,420
six months after I was in Montana,

1591
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,263
this happened.

1592
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,150
Some dude put on one of those,

1593
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:47,450
um,

1594
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,283
suits,

1595
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,420
one of those suits call the Ghillie suits.

1596
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,283
Is that what it's called?

1597
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,153
Ghillie suit?

1598
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,530
He put on like a camouflage suit.

1599
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,250
It's like this crazy camouflage suit
were dudes were in the military to hide

1600
00:50:58,251 --> 00:50:58,431
into,

1601
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,610
or sometimes people use it for
extreme hunting situations.

1602
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:01,940
You,

1603
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,910
you like pretend to be one of the bushes
and then you jump out and get people.

1604
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,340
This guy did it in
pretending to be big foot.

1605
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,460
So he put this Ghillie suit
on and stood by a Bush.

1606
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,020
And then when people were on the highway,

1607
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:13,940
stepped out into the highway and no,

1608
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:14,660
what happened?

1609
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,660
This fucking teenage girl accelerated
into him and killed bigfoot.

1610
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,710
She sent bigfoot flying.

1611
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,150
And then here's where
it gets even crazier.

1612
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:26,120
Another teenage driver going
the opposite direction.

1613
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,500
Dan ran over him again,

1614
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,480
double teenager.

1615
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:34,140
This is real story telling
you the true story.

1616
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,120
It's a real story.

1617
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,770
A man and a Ghillie suit.

1618
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:36,981
Is that,

1619
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:37,814
am I saying it right?

1620
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:39,711
If I,

1621
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:41,420
I apologize if I'm getting it wrong.

1622
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,710
I thought it was a Ghillie suit.

1623
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,570
It looks like a bunch of leaves.

1624
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:46,430
Like you're like you're
connected string and Lee,

1625
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,383
you know what I'm talking about?

1626
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,280
Like a flocking Walberg
and that movie crowd.

1627
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,430
This guy put that on too far.

1628
00:51:52,431 --> 00:51:53,000
Guys.

1629
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,810
You can't have safety with our prey curry,

1630
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:02,470
but don't you think that
that is the universe's way
of eliminating idiots if you

1631
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,430
really stopped and thought about it?

1632
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,960
Like what type of a person?

1633
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:07,400
Like what type of person goes,

1634
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:08,061
you know what I'm going to do?

1635
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:09,890
I'm going to say my day
fucking with people.

1636
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:10,960
I'm going to wait til it gets dark.

1637
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:12,740
I'm going to put on the camera.

1638
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:15,200
I'm going to jump in the middle of the
road because it's going to be awesome.

1639
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,383
Cool.

1640
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,440
Tiny bit crazy.

1641
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:19,221
Boom.

1642
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:19,331
Done.

1643
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:19,850
I mean,

1644
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,340
maybe I think about that a lot with,

1645
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:23,030
with uh,

1646
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,750
these like,

1647
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,110
you know,

1648
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,740
haunted houses that people like sign up
to go in and have people fuck with you.

1649
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,720
Like I want no part of it.

1650
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:32,480
I don't want some stranger
touching me with a fake chainsaw.

1651
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,190
Like I it,

1652
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,470
it,

1653
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,810
the physical reaction is terror.

1654
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:36,860
I don't have to do it.

1655
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,570
You don't have to do like who?

1656
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,680
Like the people that are doing that I
think have to be a little fucking askew in

1657
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:43,071
the brain.

1658
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:44,600
Like there's something weird with like,

1659
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,290
I'm sorry,

1660
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,590
it could be old fashioned fun.

1661
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:51,500
Flickery I pride myself on like,

1662
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,393
you know,

1663
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:56,660
putting fake blood all over myself and
just like getting people to shit their

1664
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:57,494
pants.

1665
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,760
I mean it's a job and it's like
that or night fry guy at Wendy's.

1666
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,600
What's a Guy gonna do when
you'd rather be that job?

1667
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:09,740
Yeah,

1668
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,890
I think that scare the fuck out.

1669
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,340
Some kids has a $9 an hour
production dollar an hour.

1670
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,240
It gives us little kids nightmares.

1671
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,610
I'll do it violently.

1672
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,641
A family.

1673
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:29,360
Remember there's always denied.

1674
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,510
Everybody might trauma.

1675
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,830
So the kid was,

1676
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,870
what the fuck just happened?

1677
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,870
I can't change their lives.

1678
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,170
Paul Little eight year old.

1679
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,870
That's how you get that $9 an hour.

1680
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,520
You only get seven at fucking one
says all she got to commit though.

1681
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:48,240
Dude that was good.

1682
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,470
Once that extra dose

1683
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,350
kids got to suffer,

1684
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,720
they an adult summer camp,

1685
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,450
you can go sleep over and
do that like for two nights,

1686
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,350
not a lake and all that.

1687
00:53:58,351 --> 00:53:59,184
Like did you ever,

1688
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,250
did you ever see the
documentary Jesus camp?

1689
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:03,783
Yeah.

1690
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,190
Well bits and pieces.

1691
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:05,641
You've seen it,

1692
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:06,474
right?

1693
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,920
It's crazy.

1694
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,210
It's amazing.

1695
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,330
It's like sort of the
opposite of the devil camp.

1696
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,870
I'm sure there is and it should be
equal time and all that good stuff.

1697
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,820
Maybe they got some points,

1698
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,940
but it was a documentary on these people
that we're taking these kids and turn

1699
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:26,790
them into radical fundamentalist
because they were like their,

1700
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:30,120
their logic was we need Christian warriors
because they're already developing

1701
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,140
Islamic warrior.

1702
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,000
People are tweeting about that.

1703
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,520
It's got rallying Christian army.

1704
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,673
Whoa,

1705
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,390
settle the fuck down.

1706
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,413
So you want to tell them,

1707
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,583
oh saying,

1708
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:44,130
oh,

1709
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:44,801
I'll just take it.

1710
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:45,570
That's what's up.

1711
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:46,110
Right.

1712
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:46,860
Take a breath.

1713
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,521
Everybody's like,

1714
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:48,331
please.

1715
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:50,310
Whenever you watch that shit
that's going on in the Middle East,

1716
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,850
be heading this and that and
fucking stoning this and that,

1717
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,780
like cheap it over there,

1718
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,060
please keep it,

1719
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,720
cut it out.

1720
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,420
That's the one thing that people
don't want to address in this world.

1721
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:06,780
When the world of this parts of
the world that are just really,

1722
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,270
really fucked up for some reason,

1723
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:10,500
as long as it's not right here,

1724
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,710
we just talk about it changes.

1725
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:14,660
Practice.

1726
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,340
Facts I know were so strange.

1727
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,090
Just the human animals so strange
and we think we're having a bad day.

1728
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,520
You know our bad days or ride show.

1729
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,990
Oh my God,

1730
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:27,300
I'm having a hard time quitting diet coke.

1731
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,170
Let's talk about that.

1732
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:30,391
No,

1733
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:30,771
I'm not.

1734
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:33,150
I'm just saying like that's
like someone freaking out.

1735
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,320
This is bullshit.

1736
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,780
My [inaudible] teacher is an asshole.

1737
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,120
I'm fucking,

1738
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,380
I don't want to hear Duran Duran anymore.

1739
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,800
These there a problem.

1740
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,580
Okay.

1741
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,973
Lucky people,

1742
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
a bunch of local people here.

1743
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,360
I think people when they
were alive are lucky.

1744
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,560
If you think about the amount of people
that have died and the fact that you're

1745
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:56,250
not one of them,

1746
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,440
you should be really fucking happy.

1747
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,470
It was lucky it shit.

1748
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,500
Yeah,

1749
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,340
we're all lucky.

1750
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,530
It's a perspective,

1751
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,980
that perspective issue and the
disenchantment with your own,

1752
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,590
your own position in the perspective.

1753
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,660
That's like what fueled the whole thing.

1754
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,640
It's like it's unavoidable in some way.

1755
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,850
If I say like one more
time I'll smack myself.

1756
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,773
It's

1757
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,530
like man,

1758
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:25,280
like I hear myself saying,

1759
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:25,780
I was like,

1760
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,190
shut up bitch,

1761
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,140
let me know what you sound like.

1762
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:29,974
Rich

1763
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,050
extra liked

1764
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,020
you could fall into those things.

1765
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:35,750
No,

1766
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:36,040
no.

1767
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,940
We're all lucky as fuck.

1768
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,470
And uh,

1769
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,530
I think uh,

1770
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,060
you know,

1771
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,350
hopefully that trend will continue.

1772
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:45,310
I mean we really nice if the people
next after we're done look back at us,

1773
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,560
like the way we look at those
coven wagon Douche bags,

1774
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:48,410
you know,

1775
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,200
we look at those covered
wagon Douche bags like,

1776
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,891
oh my God,

1777
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:54,560
you didn't have medicine
he had bark to do.

1778
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,120
If somebody broke their leg,

1779
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:00,640
broke my hand him with a rock and
you might've went back to eat them.

1780
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,070
Keep pulling.

1781
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:05,740
Well,

1782
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,570
did a lot of eating
people back in those days.

1783
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,303
That's when we should like,

1784
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,020
that's how you get to judge civilization.

1785
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:17,170
Like how much cannibalism per capita,

1786
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,370
the Donner pass.

1787
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:20,020
And I was thinking about
that and I was like,

1788
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,833
Danner,

1789
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,291
Robin Williams,

1790
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:26,330
he's like dinner 30 of that party of four.

1791
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,370
They didn't even know
where they were going.

1792
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,190
They didn't have topographic map.

1793
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,880
Crazy could've have
just kept getting worse.

1794
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,110
Why would this so cocky?

1795
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,450
They didn't even know America was there,

1796
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:40,721
right?

1797
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:41,830
They were in the wrong spot.

1798
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,400
They,

1799
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,100
when you think about the people
that landed in the West indies,

1800
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:46,150
that's where they landed,

1801
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:46,984
right?

1802
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,280
The fact that they were so confident and
not even knowing that the North America

1803
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:51,970
existed,

1804
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:55,510
they were in totally wrong spot and
then they move across North America.

1805
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:56,890
They get to these mountains,

1806
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,210
they get to these insane rocky mountains,

1807
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,660
these immense peaks
like what's the highest,

1808
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:05,320
what is it like 11,015
years this up there,

1809
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,191
and they just go,

1810
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:06,401
okay,

1811
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:07,270
let's go there.

1812
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,253
Let's keep going.

1813
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,570
No,

1814
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:09,403
we'll figure it out.

1815
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,280
Animals to people ratio at that point.

1816
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,140
It's not even cold up there,

1817
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:14,680
dude.

1818
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,513
Keep going.

1819
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,261
Stop bringing up pause.

1820
00:58:16,261 --> 00:58:17,930
Puzzler like what does it do?

1821
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:19,660
They know for sure what
was on the other end?

1822
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:20,301
Like what's the store?

1823
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:20,620
No,

1824
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,730
I mean that's whole Lewis and Clark.

1825
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,260
Then they were looking for a passage.

1826
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:23,710
They're like,

1827
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,850
this could be here.

1828
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:25,780
We hope this is here.

1829
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,160
But the Donner party is that,

1830
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:27,994
what was that story?

1831
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,820
Because the Donner party had
people already gone through.

1832
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,530
There was a lot of families and I think,

1833
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,200
I think it was like,

1834
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,520
I want to say like 50 people went through
and like 20 people made it out pull.

1835
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,200
That didn't make it were for a
fuel for the rest of the journey.

1836
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,243
Oh my God.

1837
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:49,030
Please quote me on incorrectly.

1838
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,400
Correct you right?

1839
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,403
Yeah.

1840
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:53,783
But she says,

1841
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,930
how bad must it have been where they were
that they wanted to take that chance?

1842
00:58:59,110 --> 00:58:59,500
I Dunno.

1843
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,490
I feel like I'd just be like,

1844
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,200
time next buyer.

1845
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,660
Do you see gold?

1846
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:06,010
Was it a gold rush thing?

1847
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:07,360
I Dunno.

1848
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,870
I think it was people really
desperately looking for their,

1849
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:10,180
you know,

1850
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,170
like this is our place.

1851
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:12,580
We need to find our place.

1852
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,470
Come on though.

1853
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,830
We'll do whatever we needed to do.

1854
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:20,290
Because you imagined the one person that
was like just not that fucking Gung Ho

1855
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:21,124
for this trip.

1856
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,030
You're hanging

1857
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:26,810
back and like to young gun rather
they're tying down the wagon.

1858
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,380
Right.

1859
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,213
Give me a hand

1860
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,151
in the legs.

1861
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:32,630
I think it's,

1862
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,160
you start with the meat parts.

1863
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:35,030
You know the hide.

1864
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:35,720
I'd be like,

1865
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:35,861
well,

1866
00:59:35,861 --> 00:59:37,130
it's hind legs.

1867
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,130
Smeta was where all the
animals aren't shifts.

1868
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,030
Let's go back to the light.

1869
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:44,301
Yeah,

1870
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:46,850
it would suck that I just had a deal.

1871
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,570
What should I put me first deal.

1872
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,463
It's my idea.

1873
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,200
I'm going to tell us to
go over the mountain,

1874
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,290
so if it all goes back,

1875
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,910
I'll let you bash my head in
with a rock and you can eat me.

1876
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,301
No,

1877
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:01,790
you have to die naturally
first like starvation.

1878
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,960
Well then you don't have a lot of meat.

1879
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:03,281
I don't know.

1880
01:00:03,281 --> 01:00:03,951
It's this tough.

1881
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:05,630
This is really tough for fucking Alva.

1882
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:08,550
Only the strong survive
type shit from Suzanne.

1883
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:09,410
Yeah.

1884
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,440
You just kind of like get a little
bit of the beginning off the bone.

1885
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,270
Just say right now you're
going to eat your grandma.

1886
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,460
You're going to have to eat grandma.

1887
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,660
She's going to die first.

1888
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,710
Why?

1889
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:19,041
Right.

1890
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:19,850
That's what I'm saying.

1891
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:20,850
Why did she say that?

1892
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,160
Because that's what's going to happen.

1893
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,780
This is like some Grapes of Wrath.

1894
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,653
Shit.

1895
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,710
Unless you decide this is sacrilege,

1896
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:28,963
you know,

1897
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,180
take the blessing.

1898
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,023
I'm saying.

1899
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,423
That's what I'm saying.

1900
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,710
Cause I want to get some dinner.

1901
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,593
Sure.

1902
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,703
Absolutely.

1903
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,120
You guys don't play any more songs.

1904
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,070
We can add whatever you want.

1905
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:43,983
Yeah.

1906
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,003
Um,

1907
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,040
what you going to do now?

1908
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:46,941
Yeah,

1909
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:47,391
we can do that.

1910
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:48,770
We got a new version of it.

1911
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,110
They're just popping off version.

1912
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,430
We just play a little differently.

1913
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,001
Oh my God.

1914
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:54,110
You guys are crazy.

1915
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,820
Powerful podcast number two.

1916
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:05,630
Damn.

1917
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,510
What is that part of
the violin called a bow.

1918
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,013
I know

1919
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:15,110
also served as a hunt animals with it.

1920
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,660
You just Kinda have to redirect it,

1921
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,860
but it can also make sound the violin,

1922
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,233
breaking it down.

1923
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,460
Check our website for more details.

1924
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:31,783
Really

1925
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,110
out of tune.

1926
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:33,943
But

1927
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:38,900
I wish I could play the fiddle sees
how many different things can you play?

1928
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,530
I play guitar,

1929
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:41,511
drums.

1930
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:42,740
I can play piano a little bit.

1931
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,753
Basically.

1932
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,990
Really similar to guitar,

1933
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,070
$50 an hour.

1934
01:01:46,071 --> 01:01:46,904
A lot of things.

1935
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,080
It's how much different is,

1936
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:53,090
I mean obviously besides
the physical movement,

1937
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:54,703
we'll talk later.

1938
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,980
He still us to play the drums.

1939
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,060
I don't think you should play the drums.

1940
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,790
Band is an excellent drummer.

1941
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:12,680
He wouldn't like state competition.

1942
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:16,610
I only have a certain amount of resources
dedicated towards hitting things.

1943
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,120
Lesson one and done deal man.

1944
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,010
I just want you guys to stay straight,

1945
01:02:23,011 --> 01:02:23,671
stay steady,

1946
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:25,570
being awesome and uh,

1947
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:26,730
I'll enjoy.

1948
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,350
Enjoy what you're doing.

1949
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:30,600
Okay.

1950
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,433
I think I'm good.

1951
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,750
Then how do you feel about your toneage?

1952
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,621
I feel pretty good,

1953
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:36,000
but I'm not really paying much attention.

1954
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,113
Okay.

1955
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,063
Keep it.

1956
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,690
We're to do this.

1957
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,613
We're going to do this.

1958
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,720
I hope the people out there.

1959
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:43,320
Okay.

1960
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,020
This is a lengthy is
they're going to be fine.

1961
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,390
We're not committing way to any of this.

1962
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:48,811
That's good.

1963
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:48,980
Yeah.

1964
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,660
That's the beautiful
thing about a podcast.

1965
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:51,961
You do.

1966
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:53,100
You do whatever you want to do.

1967
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:54,780
If you don't want to
listen to this anymore,

1968
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,040
go to radio lab.

1969
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:56,874
It's an awesome show.

1970
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:57,963
You ever heard about it?

1971
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:59,730
There's one called dark codes.

street.

2003
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,820
Maybe Justin sleep.

2004
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:12,270
Okay.

2005
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:14,800
You know I don't give a damn liar.

2006
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,810
She going to do now.

2007
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:26,503

2010
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:28,960
No.

2011
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,990
The dark and how it can harm you.

2012
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:34,770
Yeah.

2013
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:37,520
Bama Kuchins me apart.

2014
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:38,540
Two.

2015
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,370
Nah.

2016
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,593
Okay.

2017
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,183
Gotcha.

2018
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,740
Oh

2019
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,713

2021
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,080
God damn Suzanne,

2022
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,360
you are bad mother.

2023
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:47,551
Oh my God.

2024
01:07:47,551 --> 01:07:48,420
That's so good.

2025
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,273
Cool.

2026
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:51,850
Thanks so much for having me.

2027
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:52,780
Good.

2028
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:53,640
It's really fun.

2029
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,063
Woo.

2030
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,020
Have bottle of booze.

2031
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,480
We got some good talks.

2032
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:00,553
Good.

2033
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:01,763
That song is,

2034
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,050
you got to release that version too.

2035
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:05,670
Oh God.

2036
01:08:05,671 --> 01:08:07,650
Oh God.

2037
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:07,760
Oh,

2038
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,640
that was awesome.

2039
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,830
I want to do a record
that's more stripped down.

2040
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:11,664
I think that'd be awesome,

2041
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,593
dude.

2042
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,250
I'm not all do it all.

2043
01:08:14,251 --> 01:08:15,120
Do both kinds.

2044
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:16,140
Keep

2045
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:16,670
going.

2046
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,070
Take Adderall to what you gotta do.

2047
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,581
Keep it coming.

2048
01:08:19,581 --> 01:08:20,810
I want productivity.

2049
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,030
Yes sir.

2050
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:24,561
You guys are awesome.

2051
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:25,550
That was really fun.

2052
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,210
It's an honor.

2053
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:26,811
It really is.

2054
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,000
It's an honor to have
you guys do that here.

2055
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,410
So it's so cool.

2056
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:31,191
It's a,

2057
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,750
it's so whatever it is,

2058
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:33,560
you know,

2059
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,350
whatever you described something
when someone just nails it.

2060
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,880
That's what that just was.

2061
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,170
It was like the song,

2062
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:39,891
the lyrics,

2063
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:40,490
the song,

2064
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,120
the music,

2065
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:41,781
the sounds,

2066
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:42,614
the whole thing.

2067
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,693
Ooh,

2068
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,750
it's beautiful.

2069
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,583
It's a work of art.

2070
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,550
He should guys should be proud.

2071
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,170
You're tapping into it.

2072
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:49,004
Wherever the fuck it is.

2073
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:50,480
Whatever you did to do that,

2074
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,560
keep doing that shit.

2075
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,793
You know,

2076
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:53,840
whatever it is,

2077
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,560
whatever path you're mind is on
that made you guys create that.

2078
01:08:59,020 --> 01:08:59,853
That's good.

2079
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,713
That's really good.

2080
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,131
Really,

2081
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:01,371
really,

2082
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,120
really good.

2083
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,840
You guys are the shit.

2084
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,620
Yeah.

2085
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,453
Um,

2086
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,750
enough blowing.

2087
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:06,663
You

2088
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:12,260
tell people where they can see you alive
and tell people how to get your shit.

2089
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:12,861
It's all honey,

2090
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:13,970
honey bands at the best way.

2091
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,220
That's the portal for everything.

2092
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,900
Instagram for Twitter,

2093
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:18,260
for,

2094
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,093
for all that shit.

2095
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,190
And I'm like forum on our website too,

2096
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:23,720
called talking shit.

2097
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,230
We can like communicate
with the people and we,

2098
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:27,561
you know,

2099
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:29,840
we we uh,

2100
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,100
comment back six,

2101
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:32,150
call it talking shit

2102
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,860
because you can't,

2103
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,440
you can't technically swear on it.

2104
01:09:36,441 --> 01:09:38,300
Which is weird cause we
love is it to do that.

2105
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:38,870
But it's,

2106
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:43,160
it's talking to s h I
t it a message board.

2107
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,170
Why can't you swear on it?

2108
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,190
I don't know.

2109
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:47,023
I've tried.

2110
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:50,360
I've tried to know it'll stop me every
time I tried to send it so I have to

2111
01:09:50,361 --> 01:09:50,581
like,

2112
01:09:50,581 --> 01:09:53,150
and which makes me feel
really uncomfortable because
I feel very comfortable

2113
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:53,990
with my potty mouth.

2114
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,240
Is this here your own website?

2115
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,670
You don't need that.

2116
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,450
See that Ben?

2117
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,360
Mine's called Shit talking.

2118
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,370
Mine's called me about shit.

2119
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,450
Talking one on one.

2120
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,230
It's like the name of Jay.

2121
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:07,730
You could,

2122
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:08,391
you just change.

2123
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:09,224
The filters are easy.

2124
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,670
People can say whatever they want.

2125
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,660
The only thing I tried to
cut the racist stuff out.

2126
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,153
How did that happen?

2127
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:16,990
It's amazing.

2128
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:19,280
Easy on filters,

2129
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:20,630
on message boards.

2130
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:21,800
You can set filters.

2131
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,750
You could have him totally uncensored.

2132
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,330
You can have people say what
the fucks out of the cage.

2133
01:10:26,331 --> 01:10:27,980
There's a lot of them that come built in.

2134
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:28,880
We tried to write fuck.

2135
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:29,930
It'll give you like asterisk,

2136
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:30,501
asterisk,

2137
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:31,160
asterisk.

2138
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,993
You know,

2139
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
they say the people that swear a lot are
more in touch with their truth and uh,

2140
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,960
themselves.

2141
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,063
Who said that?

2142
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,350
A lot of people left those words.

2143
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:43,184
Free bitches.

2144
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,100
That's phrase.

2145
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:44,901
Stop being a word.

2146
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:46,710
Slave trade.

2147
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,110
We're word slave.

2148
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:48,561
Master.

2149
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:50,780
Controlling those words that I'm all free,

2150
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:51,350
right?

2151
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,940
Do it live a raise home.

2152
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,140
Well,

2153
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,480
I'm glad we did two podcasts that way.

2154
01:10:56,481 --> 01:10:59,060
I don't feel that uncomfortable
with you guys driving home.

2155
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,900
I think we reached a,

2156
01:11:00,901 --> 01:11:04,010
a blood alcohol level of accepted this.

2157
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,773
This was fun.

2158
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:06,921
You guys hungry?

2159
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:08,130
Let's get some room.

2160
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:09,710
Alright,

2161
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:09,891
honey.

2162
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:10,101
Honey,

2163
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:11,360
ban.com honey.

2164
01:11:11,361 --> 01:11:11,510
Honey,

2165
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,740
you ban Instagram,

2166
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:13,640
honey band,

2167
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,450
Twitter.

2168
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,170
Do you guys keep individual Twitter?

2169
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,173
No.

2170
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,290
Hmm?

2171
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:19,950
You like that weird married couple.

2172
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:21,060
The chairs an email

2173
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:24,420
maybe.

2174
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:24,651
Oh,

2175
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:25,480
I don't want to be,

2176
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,640
I don't want to be the wedge.

2177
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,680
I don't want to be the
wedge in front of me.

2178
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:29,880
Not in front of me.

2179
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,840
Respect our friendship.

2180
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,370
A goodnight.

2181
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,510
You fucking freaks.

2182
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,590
We'll be back soon.

2183
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:36,351
Bye.

2184
01:11:36,351 --> 01:11:36,820
Bye.
