1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,420
You know,

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,420
I was a incompetence shoot a
movie and I'm 18 years old,

4
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:08,071
19 years old.

5
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:08,851
Brad Pitt's in the movie,

6
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:11,130
we played runners together as
movie called across the tracks.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,140
So I think you know,

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,100
when you're 18 you're Tufts.

9
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:14,940
So I'm on my porch,

10
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,020
some Jivan around Compton stop at a
hamburger and fries to stop at a hamburger

11
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:19,201
joint.

12
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,760
This in 1988 the crack whores,

13
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,160
no crack wars are going on.

14
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:26,190
You would drive it around Compton in
a Porsche in 1988 looking like me,

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,710
Waa.

16
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,710
This is Nwa days,

17

18
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:28,770

21
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,990

23
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,010
And this is really nice.

24
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:38,611
Dude comes up to me,

25
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,510

26
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,590

Black people have always loved me.

33
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,661
I don't know why,

34
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,100
but they really dug silver spoons.

35
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,911
So anyway,

36
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:50,910
so we're talking a few minutes later I
go back to [inaudible] was the original

I go to back to check it out.

39
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,700
I go back to check on my car and there's
three guys in my car in your car and

40
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:57,870
like I didn't turn the alarm on.

41
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,151
My doors are open,

42
00:00:59,151 --> 00:00:59,911
my hatches open,

43
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:01,720
and they're pulling that CD change.

44
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,390
Remember back in the day
that you had like an eight?

45
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,230
Yes.

46
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,063
CD Changer.

47
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,870
So they're ripped that out.

48
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,731
Oh my God.

49
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,580
Now the working on my blog,

ran over and they were like cracked out

51
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,170

53
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:16,981
Get Out of my car.

54
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:17,251
Getting that.

55
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,180
They need to look at me.

56
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,820
They're like glanced at me
and just went back to work.

57
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,540
What?

58
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,170
Wow.

59
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,240
Literally that was,

60
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,660
oh my God,

61
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,620
there was nothing I could do.

62
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,120
What the fuck was going through your head?

63
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,050
You were helpless.

64
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:28,530
You were how old?

65
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,430
18 years old.

66
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,320
And they're ripping my
blop on guy with their,

67
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,071
with their screen.

68
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,460
You don't have a cell
phone back to any of that.

69
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,590
And then your page,

70
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:35,170

71
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:35,880
No,

72
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,580
the guy that was,

73
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,250
I was in line with ordering hamburger.

74
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:38,970
Cheeseburger.

75
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,803
Really Nice Guy.

76
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,540
He comes around the corner and he
sees my predicament and he goes,

77
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:42,811
Ricky,

78
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,644

79
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,090
these guys are ripping my stuff off.

80
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:45,661
And he goes,

81
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:45,901
okay,

82
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,291
I'll help you.

83
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,124
Hold on.

84
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,610
And I watched him go to his truck and he
owe his car and he opens the trunk and

85
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:55,611
he pulls out a shotgun this big wow with
a pistol grip and he runs up to my car

86
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,960
and he pointed at the guys
in my car and he says,

87
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,100

88
00:01:59,101 --> 00:01:59,934
I'm going to kill you.

89
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,950
And all those guys got
right out of my car,

90
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:02,130
man.

91
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,861
Wow.

92
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:03,720
Oh my God.

93
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,251
I got my car.

94
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:05,671
And he said,

95
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,020
Ricky,

96
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,721
you gotta get out of here.

97
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:07,650
You don't belong around here.

98
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
That was on youtube.

99
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,361
See,

100
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:10,950
that's the kind of shit
that needs to be on youtube.

101
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,760
Wow.

102
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
I never stepped foot off
the set again and Compton,

103
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,910
oh my God.

104
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,890
Holy Shit.

105
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,470
So they just went right back to work.

106
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,450
Yeah.

107
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,660
Just looked at me and went back to it.

108
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,523
Right.

109
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,940
But that one got to sit my ass,

110
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,774

111
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,760
