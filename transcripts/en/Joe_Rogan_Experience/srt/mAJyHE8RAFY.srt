1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,600
And we're live,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,200
that's the end of the world as we know 
it.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,283
Montana has been on fire for a month.
Florida has three hurricanes headed 

4
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,630
towards it and Houston is still have 
hundreds

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,150
water.
Uh,

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,360
Houston.
Sad.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,620
Have you been?
No,

8
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:24,070
I've just,
Ah,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,903
you know,
a lot of my ex sitting there and she's 

10
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,660
sending me photos and videos,
like her whole neighborhood's gone.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,793
Her and like people have to put 
everything outside for the insurance 

12
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,870
collectors to look at it,
you know.

13
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:39,040
So there's just everyone's house has a 
pile in front of it and all their stuff.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,320
And this is like no looting please.
You know,

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,320
I saw that on TV.
Yeah.

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,523
Fuck

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,603
Dude.
It's like there's nothing stopping that 

18
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:49,094
from happening for months.
Like this is the thing about like 

19
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:52,694
Hurricane Irma,
like they have harvey hits Houston and 

20
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,060
then Hurricane Irma.
Dave,

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,093
correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think they said that this is very 

22
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:04,940
unusual because hurricane irma picked up
speed in the ocean,

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,403
which is a really bad sign.
They usually pick up speed in the Gulf 

24
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:13,490
and the ideas that the Gulf has water 
that's warmer and that's what causes it.

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,190
I don't know shit about hurricanes.
I'm totally talking out my ass.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,910
Right.
I don't know.

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,743
I really don't understand that,
but I'm pretty sure that's what they're 

28
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:20,144
saying is that this is a very unusual 
storm because it actually picked up 

29
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,110
speed and picked up size and power in 
the ocean,

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,460
which means the oceans warmer.
So this could be a consequence of having

31
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,294
a warmer ocean is that these fucking 
hurricanes could get bigger and bigger 

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,403
in the ocean

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,590
and it's usually.
It's really unusual because you know you

34
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:42,680
have like a such a big storm,
like the one I hit Houston,

35
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,070
that's usually once a year.
Once every couple years.

36
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:45,904
It's not twice in like a month.
And then there's like what Jose's right 

37
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,360
behind it.
That's craziness.

38
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:55,361
I think they said there's two behind it.
The other one formed in the Gulf next to

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,130
like off of Mexico,
eastern Mexico.

40
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,950
So it's just another one at the same 
time.

41
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,023
Different place sitting there right now.
There could be another one forming off 

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,990
the Cape in Africa where they all 
usually forum,

43
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,730
but fuck man,
we don't.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,770
We don't get hurricanes because it's 
cold water.

45
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:12,320
Is that the logic behind it?
Yeah,

46
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:14,810
I think that's the move.
You want to live near cold water.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,690
Just suck it up like a man and deal with
that cold water.

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,673
That water is fucking coal too.
When you get in the water and the 

49
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,123
Pacific Ocean like,
Hey,

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,650
what is this like?

51
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,440
This is weird.
It's crazy cold.

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,710
Even in the middle of August,
it could be a 100 degrees in Malibu.

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,590
You get in that water and you're like,
Holy Shit,

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,993
this is fucking cold.
I've only been in it twice since I've 

55
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:39,300
lived here 13 years.
The first,

56
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,960
I remember the first week I moved down 
here,

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,110
I was like,
I'm going to the ocean.

58
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,390
I'm running the ocean freezing.
Never hit it again.

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,390
What does all this you're showing has 
and please don't say that hurricanes and

60
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,263
these hurricanes,
tropical cyclones or the 2017 Pacific 

61
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:53,924
hurricane season,
so these are cyclones that I guess I've 

62
00:02:56,451 --> 00:03:00,130
already happened this year either.
Assuming when I was pulling it up,

63
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,740
they were in the past like long time 
ago.

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,140
I didn't know these other,
this many had already come here.

65
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,373
When you look at this picture,
like if you look at this picture of the 

66
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,923
United States gives you such a way 
better sense of what it really is 

67
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,023
because that picture like because all 
the browns and the Greens and because 

68
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,690
I'm not seeing cities and because it's 
like a perfect scale,

69
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,000
like pull back a little bit.
So you see it in scale with the ocean.

70
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,920
Again,
like when you're looking at that,

71
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,053
you realize,
oh that shit kid shift left and right a 

72
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:32,104
bunch of times easy.
Like there's way more water than there 

73
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:41,140
is ground.
Like that is a fucking problem.

74
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,710
That's a giant problem.
We're next to an enormous chunk of blue.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,980
It's so big.
Dude.

76
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,820
I'll tell you,
man,

77
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,870
when I was living in that house in 
Malibu for a couple months on the water,

78
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,210
uh,
rented a spot on the water.

79
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,330
That's when you realize you go,
oh,

80
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,090
that's a monster.
That's like you're living on the edge of

81
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:08,410
a world that can just reach in and 
swallow you freaking out.

82
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,550
Did you fuck?
Yeah.

83
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,340
You know when it freaks you out is at 
night.

84
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,600
At night.
It reveals its true self because like in

85
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,440
the day it looks beautiful.
The Sun hits it.

86
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:23,070
It seemed so peaceful.
The birds or it's flat.

87
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,323
You see,
you see a seal or maybe a dolphin or a 

88
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,050
whale.
Sometimes you see a whale,

89
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,370
people see whales out there.
You're like,

90
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,080
wow,
this is crazy.

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,440
But then at nighttime when the skies 
dark and the sea is black,

92
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,330
then you get to see what it really is 
like,

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,193
oh,
this is a.

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,060
This is a whole nother world,
a world of water,

95
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,253
and if we can touch it,
we can go in between world and that 

96
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,310
world is far bigger than our world.

97
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,593
Then I started freaking out about all 
the shit that we're pulling out of that 

98
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,910
world,
like how gross we humans,

99
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,740
we're,
we're,

100
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,560
we're just getting everything in that 
world and scooping it up.

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,433
Just chopping it up and stuffed it into 
cans and feed it to our pets and eating 

102
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:14,560
it like left and right.
Raw Sushi whom yummy like that.

103
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:19,250
Never ending supply.
Fucked up the world of the ocean.

104
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,084
That is a real trip.
If you stop and think about what it 

105
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,034
really is,
because if it was in the sky above your 

106
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,060
head,
you'd be freaked out all the time.

107
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,190
You know,
if like you reached up to touch it,

108
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,443
he'd be freaked out.
You wouldn't want to be right next to 

109
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,960
that thing like Jesus.
It's to alien.

110
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,794
I can't get.
I can't get away from it because it's 

111
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,230
right there and it's blue and we're on 
the ground.

112
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,063
We feel like we're in control.
We're cocky because most of the time 

113
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:46,150
nothing happens.
Like no big deal.

114
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,920
It's right there.
I love the beach.

115
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,580
Like one of the beach gets sun,
cut some bruise.

116
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,733
So like we like flirting with death,
standing at the edge of this impossible 

117
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:56,944
to control life force filled with 
creatures filled with the biggest 

118
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,390
creatures in the world,
right?

119
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,800
Aren't whales the biggest things on 
earth.

120
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,083
The you know what they are,
they're the biggest living thing on 

121
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,950
earth.
Next to this.

122
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,503
There's like a.
A group of mushrooms in the Pacific 

123
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,711
northwest that are all connected in all 
considered to be one enormous life form.

124
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,040
Yeah.
I gotta get this Guy Paul stamets.

125
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,083
I think that's his name.
I believe that's how you say his name 

126
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,170
right?
He's a guy who studies mushrooms,

127
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,260
some mushroom scientists.
Fascinating studies,

128
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,590
fascinating articles and stuff online in
the Blue Mountains in Oregon.

129
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,733
Yeah.
There it is.

130
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,500
Shit.
More precisely.

131
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,334
A specific honeyfund gus measuring two 
point four miles across in the Blue 

132
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,243
Mountains.
It's known as the largest living 

133
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:57,440
organism on earth.
Several species of fungi belong to the.

134
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,330
Try that word.
Our Mila Ria.

135
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm Ellaria Janice.
Janice or Jenice.

136
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,820
How do you say that?
It's a read one.

137
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,230
That's what I read.
I never say,

138
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,623
you know,
I never used that in a conversation and 

139
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,494
wanting to be a super pretentious.
I'd have to be like a really high to be 

140
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,840
that pretentious.
I'm A.

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,460
I'm A.
I'm a malaria and malaria.

142
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,130
Malaria or malaria or malaria.
Jenise,

143
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,203
which is probably a properly rather 
popularly known as honeyfund gus two 

144
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,264
point four miles across.
I liked how they give it to us in 

145
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:34,970
kilometers.
Like if you don't want to be stupid,

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,833
three point eight kilometers,
if you want to be like the rest of the 

147
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:37,934
world and do everything in tens,
you fucking idiots sticking a miles and 

148
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:41,810
inches.

149
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,100
Why?
Why do we do that?

150
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,200
Because we're gross parts of America 
that are gross,

151
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:48,920
but like,
Nah,

152
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,600
we got it.
And they're like,

153
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,670
well we have.
We found a much better system.

154
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:55,010
It makes more sense.
It's all intends the whole world.

155
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,450
Use it.
Good luck.

156
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,970
Good luck with that fucking stupid 
system.

157
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,910
I'll take inches.
Brow yards,

158
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,893
inches.
It feels good to when you're in like 

159
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:08,060
other countries and you're like,
why are you going 120 miles an hour?

160
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,190
Oh wait,
it's a different.

161
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,573
So they're like 62 is like,
I want to say it's a hundred kilometers 

162
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,143
an hour,
but I think it's actually more than 

163
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,254
that.
I would say so always thinking it's 

164
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,050
half,
but that's probably wrong.

165
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,201
Well,
I,

166
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:25,850
yeah,
I don't know.

167
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,570
I honestly don't know.
Is Sixty to 100 miles an hour?

168
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,300
100 kilometer,
100 kilometers rather 62 miles an hour.

169
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,050
100 sounds cooler,
you know,

170
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,180
kilometers or just they're better.

171
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,100
We're using some old king shit inches.
It'd be weird to change now though.

172
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,010
Like we had to be born with that.
Like it's cool dude.

173
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:46,844
When I was,
I mean I don't know about when you were 

174
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:50,120
in high school but when I was in high 
school they were trying.

175
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,500
There was a real push to get people to 
use the metric system that I don't think

176
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,740
exists anymore.
I don't know,

177
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,960
but I mean maybe it was just the schools
that I was in.

178
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,470
I would like to talk to other people 
that are like my age that could remember

179
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,304
like the 19 eighties because of the 19 
eighties I think that they were trying 

180
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,024
to push the metric system.
I think I kind of caught on the tail 

181
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,200
end.
I don't remember it at all from scratch.

182
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,830
The United States is now the only 
industrialized country in the world that

183
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:21,831
does not use the metric system and its 
predominant system of measurement.

184
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,440
Most Americans link,
I think that our involvement with metric

185
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:29,070
measures measurement is relatively new,
but it's not right.

186
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,960
They.
What year did they try and do it?

187
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,910
Nineteen 75.
See the metric conversion act of 1975?

188
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,800
Yeah,
that's what I remember.

189
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,070
Dude,
share Ford.

190
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,973
Yeah.
They were trying that because maybe it 

191
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:44,520
wasn't.
Maybe I wasn't in high school.

192
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,780
Maybe it was before high school.

193
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,573
I think it was.
I was looking something up the other 

194
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,674
day.
I think it was when you asked are the 

195
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,110
president's allowed to change the,
uh,

196
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,880
White House or something.
And I think it was Ford that added solar

197
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,714
panels to the White House.
I was looking up and then the next 

198
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,100
president,
which might've been Nixon,

199
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,383
took them out and they didn't have them 
re-installed and thick until Obama was 

200
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,830
there,
like whatever,

201
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,933
five years ago.
So it was like 25 years of no solar 

202
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:14,070
panels when they already had them.
We were already headed that way.

203
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,730
Super Weird.
That is weird.

204
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,850
You see the new apple campus,
uh,

205
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,190
that they're gonna show,
I guess next week,

206
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,250
next Tuesday when they haven't seen much
of it.

207
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,550
But I know that it's supposed to be some
insanely impossible,

208
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,260
huge,
crazy place.

209
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,080
It looks like a spaceship.
It's now finished.

210
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,700
They have like drone footage that you 
can like just go round.

211
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,190
It looks just like a round donut 
spaceship and the whole a roof.

212
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,800
A solar collectors.
So that powers itself.

213
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,350
Look at that thing.
Yeah.

214
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,360
That might be a computer image of.
I think that is.

215
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,010
Wow.
Who Cares?

216
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,340
Back in on the computer image.
That's insane.

217
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,773
That's.
It must be so cool to have the kind of 

218
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,180
money where you could just build 
something like,

219
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,390
well you guys want to do some shit bro.
Yeah.

220
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,230
It's make a fucking giant apple 
spaceship.

221
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,670
She would make it the shape of an apple 
too.

222
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,720
Colony.
They could.

223
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,000
They could have easily made that thing 
in apple,

224
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,570
but then they would have never been able
to sell it yet.

225
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,700
Well yeah,
exactly.

226
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,010
It's going to go to like a tire company 
next.

227
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,490
Never be able to sell it.
Man.

228
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,820
You know,
if they do,

229
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,330
no one wants to buy your stupid apple.
You don't like the touch bar on your Mac

230
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,590
book.
I've not even seen one in person yet.

231
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,470
Some.
This is what I think.

232
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,900
I don't think it's necessary.
I think it's kind of cute,

233
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,460
but it does a lot of different stuff 
that I never use and um,

234
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,400
maybe it's me,
but also there's like a Siri button that

235
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,234
I accidentally pressed all the time 
while I'm typing because I suck at 

236
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:46,640
typing.
I'm,

237
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm okay.
You know,

238
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,893
I'm not very good at it.
I really should practice and get better 

239
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:51,780
at it.

240
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,470
I just have every time I get a chance to
write,

241
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,510
I just write.
You can turn it off,

242
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,070
right?
The touch bar though.

243
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:57,910
You can.
I think you could.

244
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,370
You can do stuff with it,
but I mean,

245
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,213
I don't know if you could totally turn 
it off because then you turn off the 

246
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:05,050
volume control.
That's where the volume control is.

247
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,940
Oh fuck.
Really?

248
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,530
The brightness,
the volume control everything.

249
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,810
The real problem is that fucking Siri 
Button.

250
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:14,050
It's right above the delete key with my 
fat.

251
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:14,884
Stupid fingers.
I touched that thing at least once a 

252
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,060
day.
You can siri off.

253
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,970
She's off.
You're off bitch.

254
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,680
Yeah,
I don't.

255
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,090
I don't want Siri on my God damn laptop,
but um,

256
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,440
it's uh,
it just an accidental touch thing.

257
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:33,580
It's an and it's not the best keyboard.
It's a very shallow touch,

258
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,620
you know,
and some people like that.

259
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,720
It's very precise.
I'll give it that,

260
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,860
but I like the IBM over the,
um,

261
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,860
those think pants who's making those 
Lenovo,

262
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,753
right?
Yeah.

263
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,370
They have a way better feel to their 
keyboard,

264
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,040
mechanical,
the apple's operating system.

265
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:51,874
To me it's just way better.
I shouldn't say way better because 

266
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,400
windows 10 is really good.
It's just more familiar.

267
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,293
Say at this point,
it was way better for a long time for 

268
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,200
sure.
But the,

269
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,540
there's more options if you want to buy 
a windows computer,

270
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,510
like you can get so many different kinds
of computers.

271
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,680
You can get big ones,
small ones.

272
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:12,070
You get ones with interesting keyboards,
get ones with keyboards,

273
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:12,881
they feel like,
you know,

274
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,980
like that,
like a Mac book or you get other ones,

275
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:18,390
like a thinkpad that it feels almost 
like a mechanical keyboard.

276
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:22,240
It's got a lot more touch to it.
I know it seems stupid,

277
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:27,190
but to me that like tactile feel is a 
very important part of writing.

278
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,290
It helps me.
It helps.

279
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,183
Like I like to to get in a good groove 
with where my fingers are growing and 

280
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:38,260
when I have actual physical keys that 
stick up a little bit more and they have

281
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:41,380
a little push to them.
My fingers find their way better.

282
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,480
It's hard when you're on this like very 
thin keyboard.

283
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,670
Just me.
Yeah.

284
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,753
I always.
I always upgraded my keyboard so I like 

285
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,370
raised.
Her keyboards are really nice.

286
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,204
They make it a good one.
I have a mechanical razer keyboard for 

287
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,930
my computer at home.
I love raised there.

288
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:56,950
The Shit.
Yeah,

289
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,903
my.
I got one of those razor laptops that I 

290
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,244
decided to switch over to pc for vc vr 
gaming and all that stuff and the 

291
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,850
keyboard is mechanical one.
You'd love it.

292
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:06,684
It's,
it's like a.

293
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,150
almost like a typewriter.
A.

294
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,700
Yeah,
the razer blade pro.

295
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,700
Those are slick looking devices to men.

296
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,730
They are like literally like the like 
it's a windows version of a Mac book.

297
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
Like as far as like the build quality 
and everything.

298
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,930
Yeah.
He's got the most powerful graphics card

299
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,060
in it.
A desktop graphics card.

300
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,040
Very slick,
very slick.

301
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,650
They make a lot of cool shit.
They make the best gaming mice to.

302
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,920
They made that thing I told you about at
cs at three screen.

303
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,960
Laptop.
I don't think it's out for sale yet.

304
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,630
It was stolen.
I stole that.

305
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,650
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

306
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:39,484
You know how deep you're going when you 
get three screens popped open because 

307
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,693
we're all on porn.
Three different movies going on at the 

308
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,054
same time.
Plus you're playing a game in the 

309
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:47,974
background.
Do you worry about like our devices 

310
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,040
listening

311
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,080
to us at all time,
like Alexa's and Siri's and it was.

312
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,430
They definitely are.
Oh they are.

313
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,130
That's how they work.
Like,

314
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,070
Hey Siri,
feel like this

315
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,433
inevitable.
I feel like this is where it's all 

316
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:04,080
going.
You know,

317
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,180
I think that you could fight it off if 
you want and you could probably stay out

318
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:10,014
of it for a really long time,
but ultimately we are so much less 

319
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:15,654
private today than we were a decade ago 
and I don't think people really really 

320
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:24,570
feel it yet because a lot of the people 
that are like 25 today,

321
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,823
you guys grew up with the Internet being
like this preeminent thing like Brian 

322
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:31,404
and I when we were kids there was 
nothing and then all the sudden it came 

323
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:37,830
about when we were in adulthood and 
you're like,

324
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,540
whoa,
this is nuts.

325
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,583
Like this is all connected and it's like
the whole world is learning a whole new 

326
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:48,840
style of being a person because of this 
connection.

327
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,060
I mean it's changing everything

328
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,500
and kids are born into that.
Like they've had it since they were born

329
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,330
now for sure.
They're completely different.

330
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,640
People did.
I went down a rabbit hole the other day.

331
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,043
I went down a rabbit hole of a vegan 
bloggers who are mean to other vegan 

332
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,040
bloggers and claim that they're not even
Vegan.

333
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,110
It was,
it was crazy.

334
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,633
I was like,
I just went to the total wrong rabbit 

335
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,224
hole that people are accusing people of 
not being Vegan and people are suing 

336
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:18,891
people.
I'm like,

337
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,890
Holy Shit.
Like this is Megan lawsuit.

338
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,700
The lawsuit's yeah.
Defamatory lawsuits.

339
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,290
People talking shit lawsuits.
Ooh Man.

340
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,150
You can go down a rabbit hole.
Right?

341
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,170
You know,
that's,

342
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,730
that's never been the case before.
Before you get into a good book.

343
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,580
This book is Shit Man.
I can't put it down.

344
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,473
It's a page turner,
but you could never like just go from 

345
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:47,900
subject to subject instantaneously.
You're stupid little brain.

346
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,200
Just suck it up.
All the fucking motorcycle accidents and

347
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,243
coyote attacks and just that's,
there's never been a person like us in 

348
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,380
terms of like the person with that kind 
of access to information.

349
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,820
We're the first generation ever.
Like there's never been anyone before us

350
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,830
and we're all figuring out as we go 
along.

351
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,550
It's like we're at the library nonstop 
at the card catalog,

352
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,660
look,
looking at stuff,

353
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,190
doing research papers,
you know,

354
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,240
nonstop,
nonstop,

355
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,523
on everything,

356
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,820
nonstop on everything you know.
And then you got all your factions.

357
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,653
You know,
we put group up the group by white 

358
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:28,360
supremacists factions.
You've got flat earth factions.

359
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,900
You've got,
I mean you've got giant groups of people

360
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:32,734
who chunk up together and they all like 
share memes and they make fun of 

361
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:41,350
everybody else.
I saw one online,

362
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,243
it was a flat earth guy calling all 
people who believe the earth is round 

363
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:50,730
globe heads and it was like.
And I was like,

364
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:53,160
what is this?
And there's a whole series of them.

365
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,560
There's like hundreds of them,
dude,

366
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,170
where people are mocking the idea that 
the earth is round.

367
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,600
You could fuck it.
Find Anything Online,

368
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,590
man.
Anything,

369
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,280
any,
any weird group you can find them.

370
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,913
Have you seen it?
I typed it in Google and there's just 

371
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:13,260
like the first three things or videos 
like another globe had theory debunked.

372
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,830
Eddie Bravo.
Pissed off dude.

373
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,190
I fucking love those people now.
I used to get upset at them.

374
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,180
Now I love them.
My parents were glow peds.

375
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,014
Not Anymore to burn the house down 
because the parents think the world is 

376
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:29,250
round.
This is the meme.

377
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,503
It's a child standing in front with a 
smile standing in front of a burning 

378
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,820
house.
Since my parents were global heads.

379
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,863
Not Anymore.
So this is my point is it's the same 

380
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:41,550
thing.
They're all,

381
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,750
it's all the same kind of mental illness
that drags you into this group Hook,

382
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,620
line,
and sinker.

383
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,350
If the group doesn't make any sense,
if it's,

384
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:50,184
you know,
vegan bloggers try and take out other 

385
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,304
vegan bloggers or whether it's this idea
that the world is round and that the 

386
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,300
people think the world is round,
should have their houses burnt down.

387
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:02,134
A little kid,
she'd be smiling even though it's their 

388
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:04,260
parents.

389
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,010
I'm like,
wow,

390
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,680
this is so crazy.
Like I didn't,

391
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,850
haven't talked to him too many flat 
earthers but uh,

392
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,851
but,
but my,

393
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:12,870
you know,
Kevin Pereira,

394
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,591
he,
he,

395
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:14,424
uh,
attached a gopro camera to a weather 

396
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:21,630
balloon one time or a few times.
And when it goes up to a certain point,

397
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,280
it's around earth.
It's the cameras show.

398
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:26,000
It can't live forever.
Is it global?

399
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,740
Is shill.
You don't know Shit,

400
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:30,660
man.
Eddie.

401
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,010
Eddie does believe in that,
right?

402
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,060
Like he says,
he doesn't,

403
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,160
he doesn't say does.
He doesn't,

404
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,650
he doesn't know about that one.
He keeps an open mind with everything.

405
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,580
That's.
Yeah.

406
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I don't think he's actually saying maybe
is.

407
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,990
Maybe he's not saying that to me,
but um,

408
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,980
I think it's fun for people too.
I think there's that.

409
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,850
It's fun to think that they're right.
It's fun to the end is really,

410
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,430
it's fun to say you don't know and 
you're right.

411
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,570
I don't know.
There's a,

412
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,890
there's a lot.
I don't know.

413
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,233
That's the reality.
I mean that's one thing that like if 

414
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,380
you're talking to flat earth people and 
you say,

415
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,660
why are you so confident that the world 
is round?

416
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,200
Like you got a good point.
I'm not doing any experiments.

417
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,333
I've never really looked at the data.
I've looked at all those satellite 

418
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:14,580
images though,
and I would assume that all those people

419
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,780
who are making maps and flying 
transcontinental flights,

420
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,660
pilots,
people make satellites,

421
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,580
people have actually been to space.
I would assume that not all in cahoots,

422
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,873
I mean,
but I don't know might be the biggest 

423
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,630
hoax pieces.
Could you imagine if we're really living

424
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,171
until.
I'm like,

425
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:36,330
what was that Jim Carrey movie the 
Truman show?

426
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,830
Truman show?
Yes.

427
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,083
If we're really living in some bizarre 
simulation and we are in a dome and 

428
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,860
we've been just trick some fake numbers,
science and images,

429
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,903
I continue to think that more and more 
to the point where that's my religion 

430
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,680
where people.
That's my flatter to the.

431
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,420
It's getting so weird the older you get,
how much I believe in that kind of shit.

432
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,700
Like a simulation simulation stuff.
I think there's probably.

433
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,013
I think we probably have a deeper 
connection that we can't measure and 

434
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,980
that's one of the reasons why it seems 
like things could be fake.

435
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,280
I think we have a connection that's 
changing too.

436
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:15,114
I think our connection with our reality,
not just because of information and 

437
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,600
technology that allows you to call each 
other and stuff like that.

438
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,733
I think the information that we're 
getting is allowing us to like almost 

439
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:27,474
like go through the world in a different
way and things are sinking up more and 

440
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,470
more with a lot of people.
I see.

441
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,840
I hear that all the time.
It sounds like total horseshit though,

442
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,570
but I wonder how.
I mean like what is the placebo effect,

443
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:43,890
right?
What is that

444
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,840
tricking your brain and to something 
that's not there,

445
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:48,320
right?

446
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,153
Yeah.
Well you trick your body into thinking 

447
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,670
that it took medicine and your body 
heals itself.

448
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,280
Right?
What the fuck is that?

449
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,600
So there's some tricks.
Some tricks you keep.

450
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,500
It doesn't even happen with like 
medicine.

451
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:04,250
They music and wearing certain forms 
that gets you pumped up.

452
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,960
Music is a perfect example right there.
There's songs that,

453
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,023
there are songs that I hear when I'm 
working out and I fucking workout 

454
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,583
harder.
Like they give me lecture more fucking 

455
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,720
more pep or energy and then there's a 
lot of fucking movies that do that too.

456
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,464
Right?
Like I saw rocky when I was a little 

457
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:23,930
kid.
I ran around the block,

458
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,430
I drank raw eggs.
I did the whole thing because I was just

459
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:32,180
like so pumped up.
That movie literally gives you energy.

460
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,960
I think every kid ate raw eggs when that
movie came out.

461
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,400
I remember doing it with my friend.
Fuck you.

462
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,420
And then there's glitches in the 
simulation,

463
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:41,961
like,
you know,

464
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:42,794
like Deja Vu and then like,
or when you're walking down a sidewalk 

465
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:47,210
and you know how you just walk people 
walking next to you,

466
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:48,044
like no big thing.
But then there's that one guy where you 

467
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,510
try to go left,
he's going left,

468
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:52,940
you're going right.
And you're just like,

469
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:54,470
why?
Why did we just sync up here?

470
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:55,490
Like,
what the fuck happened there?

471
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,030
Just random randomness up at all,
man.

472
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,923
I just made me think of it.
I just saw this article recently came 

473
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:04,490
out,
others a study about why music gives you

474
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:05,324
goosebumps.
Scientists studied 10 people that claim 

475
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:08,354
that they get chills when they hear 
certain songs or certain things happen 

476
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:12,410
and whatnot.
What does it say?

477
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,273
They did brain scans on them.
And what they found out is that their 

478
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,780
auditory cortex,
which is a,

479
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,630
or if they have fibers in the auditory 
cortex that are stronger,

480
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,110
I guess whatever the stronger than 
people who don't feel that,

481
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,493
um,
which leads to a stronger emotion 

482
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:27,764
reaction.
So they think that it can be used to 

483
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:30,344
treat people with depression,
to get them to bring up feelings that 

484
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:35,030
they might not be able to access 
otherwise.

485
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,780
Um,
it's obviously just a new study and it's

486
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,070
lots of theory and whatnot.
But

487
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,783
like what is it?
Here's another interesting way to look 

488
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,224
at it.
What it about a song that gets you like 

489
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:49,940
that,
that gives you that energy.

490
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,870
And part of it is like the novelty of 
hearing the song.

491
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,410
Not meaning that you don't want to know 
what the song is about,

492
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,560
but you can't hear it too many times or 
it loses impact.

493
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,610
You know,
like after awhile song becomes like flat

494
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,110
if you hear it too many times in a row.

495
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,013
I've tried to notice when it happens to 
me and more often not as from a live 

496
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:10,830
performance.
And I think I've,

497
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,793
I've,
I'm,

498
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,863
I'm feeling the emotion,
the person singing it has a little bit 

499
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,374
and I like I've noticed it's more often 
like a real live or there that person's 

500
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:21,870
first time on TV,
one of those kinds of things.

501
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:23,850
It happens more than just like listen to
the radio or

502
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,943
it could probably get annoying too if 
you heard it over and over and over 

503
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:29,110
again.
Radio kills music.

504
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,330
Do you remember back in the day when you
would hear a song over and over again on

505
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:36,010
the radio and you'd be like,
what the fuck?

506
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:36,844
This song again,
it's actually get annoyed if you go to 

507
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,030
any,
any,

508
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,700
any local radio station turn on or rocks
channel,

509
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:45,370
you know you're going to hear like one 
of three songs in an hour.

510
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:46,204
At least like one metallica song they 
enter Sandman is going to come on once 

511
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,380
has to come on board.
Metallica.

512
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:51,214
Yeah.
Yeah.

513
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,690
No Shit.
Right.

514
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,803
Boy,
that's how fucking tough gig because 

515
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,630
those guys like know the Dj's never got 
like the freedom anymore to go loose.

516
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,003
That just a roll up with a bunch of 
records to start playing some shit that 

517
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,390
they like.
That's what they used to do.

518
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,590
Right?
Correct me if I'm wrong,

519
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,040
but they always had program managers.
Right.

520
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:12,874
So the program manager would influence 
what they would put on a little bit for 

521
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:16,804
sure.
Do you remember when they would play a 

522
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:19,774
record?
You could hear the record skip 

523
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,354
sometimes,
like sometimes sometimes it would skip 

524
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:25,714
though and they would have to like go 
back and like we're sorry about that 

525
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,494
ladies and gentlemen,
like some fucking dude is not paying 

526
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:31,834
attention and he's off often the 
restroom or something like that or 

527
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:36,790
getting a cup of coffee while the songs 
playing and he doesn't realize that it's

528
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,100
been skipping.
That happens all the time.

529
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:42,010
Back in the day.
It's a local Dj here in Los Angeles that

530
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,873
does that.
He plays records and he's like a real 

531
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,580
djs.
Like one of the last guys I think.

532
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,170
I mean it's been a year since I've 
listened to the radio,

533
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:51,004
but he used to be really cool and you 
could hear the static of the record and 

534
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:54,680
it was cool.

535
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,500
I don't,
I don't remember what channel that was.

536
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,970
Do you remember that Christian slater 
movie or Christian slater was a volume.

537
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,790
He had like a pirate radio station and 
they were trying to get them.

538
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,420
The government was chasing them.
It was very,

539
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,070
uh,
almost like smokey and the bandit ask.

540
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:11,690
It was so stupid the way they're chasing
them,

541
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,520
trying to get him because he's 
broadcasting and you can't do that,

542
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,853
you know?
It's like he's wild and he's good luck 

543
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,800
in and you know,
he's rebellious.

544
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,890
Wasn't he supposed to be in high school 
too or something like that.

545
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,750
That was the weird.
The third year it was one of my favorite

546
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,280
movies growing up.
I don't know what you're talking about.

547
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:31,600
That was a great dude at the time.
It was a great movie for sure.

548
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,460
Well,
I'm just saying like how weird was it?

549
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:36,850
Like back then if you had like a pirate 
radio station,

550
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:39,220
you a rebel and people would be out 
there in the woods listening.

551
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,630
He like,
Hey,

552
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,120
if you send me out there,
you're still.

553
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,070
And

554
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,920
if you're still alive you could still 
kick some ass.

555
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,170
Be Given these fucking corny pump them 
up speeches to all the young kids.

556
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:53,250
They'd be like,
yeah,

557
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,000
we gotta we gotta rise against like all 
the old people were retarded.

558
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,330
Although none of the old people made any
sense.

559
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,050
It was the young people that knew that 
everything was wrong in the system.

560
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,640
Man looks like Pre-internet,
man.

561
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:07,410
That's.
Oh yeah,

562
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,580
dude.
You had a cordless phone though.

563
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,860
That's cool.
I like Christian slater.

564
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,970
Dig Farron.
Yeah,

565
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:16,320
that was pre internet man.
It was pretty fucking Internet.

566
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,240
I forget the movie I watched the other 
day.

567
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,523
Uh,
and there was no internet and there was 

568
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:23,820
no cell phones in it.
You forgot.

569
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,470
There's like a part of you forgets that 
because there's so many scenes where the

570
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,640
guy's like,
I need to contact Mary.

571
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,320
I need to find her.
And then you're like,

572
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:32,880
why don't you just put yourself a NASA 
one?

573
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,680
Wait,
there is no cell phones here.

574
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,870
Yeah.
When you need to find someone,

575
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:40,120
you had to go look for them,
like run around and yell.

576
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,260
People yell a lot.
Bob.

577
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,220
Call places.
Dude.

578
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,173
Italians.
I remember very clearly when I was a 

579
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:50,970
kid,
especially like in like the real Italian

580
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,804
neighborhoods on the east coast.
People would scream out for people in 

581
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:55,554
the street who just screamed dot I dot.
It would just be yelling at the top of 

582
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,700
their lungs.
It was so crazy.

583
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,423
I just,
people always did that and then people 

584
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,780
got answering machines.
That was a big one.

585
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,020
You remember answering machines.
I still have one in mind.

586
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:15,930
I would love to hear the messages on.
That was great.

587
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,783
What?
You always had to have like the best 

588
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,880
like outgoing message.
So like your music behind it or you pick

589
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:23,120
late Saturday night live skit in the 
back or.

590
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,180
Or like if you real creative.
Yeah,

591
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,150
like Tony Montana.

592
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,780
Mine was that Cheech and Chong period at
one time.

593
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:34,830
The one that's like,
hello,

594
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,060
hello,
or whatever that.

595
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,230
I forgot that.
Yeah,

596
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:40,410
there was always a lot of people trying 
real hard to be creative.

597
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,260
That was like your first social media 
profile.

598
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,230
It was and it turned into like the 
instant messenger away message,

599
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:50,064
which is a status update and then it was
the grossest thing ever invented 

600
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:56,700
ringback tones.
You remembered the verizon greenback?

601
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,270
Yeah.
Used to be called people up sometimes.

602
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,000
You still call people up and we'll play 
a song.

603
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:02,834
Yeah,
I guess they still have it probably 

604
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,840
Dana.
Right?

605
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,620
You still have king of rock.
You call other king.

606
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,850
Oh my favorites.
When you had to move,

607
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
you have to run DMC.
You had for a year.

608
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,510
I am beautiful,
Christina Aguilera,

609
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,613
madam.

610
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,183
We would just be like a normal 
conversation with like adults and it's 

611
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:38,351
suddenly that thing which is good 
tickets.

612
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,580
I like some sometimes like things and I 
don't like that.

613
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:47,110
I feel pressured,
not like them,

614
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,341
you know?
I'm like,

615
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,900
why?
How come I can't like that song?

616
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,630
It's a beautiful song.
It's,

617
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,050
is it,
does it too girly?

618
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,430
Is that what it is that.
What's going on?

619
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,670
A lot of prejudice.
That's how I feel with Taylor swift.

620
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:01,030
I was blaring her new song the other day
and I was at a red light and I was like,

621
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,470
God damn,
I got to roll up my window.

622
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,290
You go boy saying that shit.
Who gives a fuck?

623
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,990
It's weird.
You got to be scared to sing things out.

624
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,800
I was playing that one sia song in here 
after you left one day and you came back

625
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:16,340
in like the fuck.
Like Pad Thai sauce tight.

626
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,710
Hashtag black twitter.
It's the hot shit.

627
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,610
Yeah man.
I love it.

628
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,170
A lot of shit that I probably shouldn't.
Like.

629
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,410
What's your biggest latest guiltiest 
pleasure?

630
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,290
Um,
I like Taylor swift.

631
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,520
Yeah.
I love her music.

632
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:33,354
I like.
I like so your team tailor like Justin 

633
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,540
Bieber.
I like his voice.

634
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,430
He's got a beautiful voice.
A couple of his songs are all right.

635
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,070
I'm the kid can sing his fucking ass 
off.

636
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,930
I heard some people that kind of music

637
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,143
set right now because Justin timberlake 
is rumored or he's going to be doing 

638
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:53,750
vocals on the new foo fighters album,
but he's just doing some background.

639
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,213
You won't even know it's him,
but his name made it out in a blog post 

640
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:59,420
or something.
That guy's not going to do.

641
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,840
This is timberlake.
He's a smart guy.

642
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,080
He's not going to do anything stupid.
If he does do that,

643
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:06,914
he's going to smash it.
He wouldn't do it if he didn't get 

644
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,100
smashed at course.
Yeah,

645
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,080
we'll just smash it.
Yeah,

646
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:14,000
he's great.
I don't want white people shit on him.

647
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,530
He's like one of the best,
most talented,

648
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,270
handsome.
Too Tall,

649
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,800
too.
Pretty to rich.

650
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,480
He danced around too.
Good at dancing.

651
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,950
Don't like it.
Do not like it.

652
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,113
Yeah.
I don't like some handsome fellow 

653
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:29,570
dances.
Real good and sings his ass off.

654
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,330
Fuck that.
So people are hating,

655
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,523
he just gets all the poise and dances.
Fucking dancer can't like dancing too 

656
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:44,420
much if you're a dude,
but it's that same thing.

657
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:46,340
The same reason why you're not supposed 
to like that.

658
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:49,100
I am beautiful song.
It's Goddamn beautiful song.

659
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,150
But you know,
people prefer you to be like,

660
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,040
you know,
enter Sandman don't,

661
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,860
which is great to get balanced in this 
life.

662
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,770
Right.
You want a little Ozzy Osborne every now

663
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:06,650
and then you want a little shell crow.
I like a little sheryl crow.

664
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,220
I'm hauling notes all day.
I can't get enough of hall notes.

665
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,330
I can't go for that.
Got You.

666
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,140
I can't go for that.
No,

667
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,600
no.
Ken Do Hala notes.

668
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,160
Old School son.
Oh yeah.

669
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,240
If you,
if you want to hear that.

670
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,350
One of the best versions,
like there's a band called burden to be.

671
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,680
They're a local band,
will a woman singer and they covered all

672
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:31,514
the greatest hits and man,
her voice is so amazing and she just 

673
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,790
brought like life to like those old 
songs.

674
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:38,624
Like I just can't her name.
It's called bird and the bird and the 

675
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:44,030
bee and it's a hall notes.
Greatest hits or something like that.

676
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,640
I highly recommend that.
So on spotify.

677
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,460
Damn son.
Yeah,

678
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,100
they were great.
There was a.

679
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,010
There was a lot of those bands.
That was like seventies music,

680
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:56,860
right?
Was that seventies?

681
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,270
Eighties.
This more eighties.

682
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,770
Remember man eater,
she comes watch out,

683
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,780
but she'll eat whatever you can get that
sultry side look.

684
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,130
Listen,
bitch.

685
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,010
You knew the camera was on.
Why you're looking at me sideways?

686
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,410
He does,
right?

687
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,340
That's a weird luck,
bro.

688
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:20,360
You gonna hit me.
Hey,

689
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,430
let's work this out.
Don't hit me.

690
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,340
That's like a dude is and back with his 
right hand about to punch you.

691
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,910
Why are you looking at me like this?
Like look at me.

692
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,223
Look at me Bro.

693
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,720
That's not even.
Is extremely tight.

694
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,050
That's like you might.
You might be able to take my bag bro.

695
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,890
I left at the fashion is now the fashion
that we are dealing with right now.

696
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,350
It's coming back son.
Yeah.

697
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:45,184
That looks like Josh Martin on the left.
They're wearing his little leopard 

698
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:47,871
shirt.
Good.

699
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:50,070
Josh Martin is like the Pinnacle of 
fashion.

700
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,990
My Litmus test to find out what's going 
on in the world.

701
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,760
I'm like,
are those the new yeezys?

702
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:56,151
He goes,
yeah.

703
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:56,990
I go,
Yuck.

704
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,490
I hate those yeezys.
I don't get it.

705
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,840
You still into those stupid thing,
loves them.

706
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:06,770
I have enough of them.
I will say that I need to change it up a

707
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:09,370
little bit.
This model down for three years.

708
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,870
One day history will not be kind to you.
You know,

709
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,520
you know,
all he did is he went to Korea and found

710
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,730
one designer and he's like,
Hey,

711
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:17,380
I want that.

712
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,220
Oh,
he also spent whatever.

713
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,650
I don't want to get into all this,
but you've spent some time working as an

714
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:23,270
intern.
I don't think you should,

715
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,104
uh,
deny what he's accomplished when it 

716
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:30,680
comes to Mr Yeezy.
I just don't enjoy what they look like.

717
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,950
I don't like is tilted stage.
I just don't like what they look like.

718
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,290
They're comfortable as.
I bet they are.

719
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,460
I bet they are.
These.

720
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,980
Maybe not.
If it is half of what it's about.

721
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,030
Yeah.
I think half of is about to have yeezy.

722
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,260
Well,
oh you mean the easiest half of it is my

723
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,160
name and my percent of 95.
90 five.

724
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:52,994
Okay.
There's more comfortable shoes out 

725
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:54,210
there.
Oh,

726
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,730
for sure.
It's about.

727
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,800
It's also like a rolex.
Why would you get a rolex when you could

728
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:59,240
have a movement watch?
You know what I mean?

729
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:03,290
It's totally other watch $25,000
watch or $200.

730
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:04,430
Watch.
Exactly.

731
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,170
It's some sort of arm candy,
you know,

732
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,740
candy bracelet.
Yeah.

733
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,660
Yeah.
It's jewelry.

734
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,110
It's just watched jewelry like um,
like those watches that floyd mayweather

735
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:18,944
has those crazy watches that half a 
million dollar watch that he had the 

736
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,243
double arm jewelry that's not really 
watch like you're not trying to just 

737
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,970
watch costs like 150 bucks.
That's a cool watch.

738
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:29,804
What kind of Casio Casio Watch you know?
Every time I wear a watch Prince Freddy 

739
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,140
Mercury,
little

740
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,200
arm bracelets I was showing.
I was pulling this up.

741
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:41,250
I just saw.
What is it?

742
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,390
This is the new guy that's going to play
Prince Freddy Mercury and the bio pic.

743
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,590
This is the guy from Mr.
robot that was show Grammy Malika.

744
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:49,570
Oh my God.
It is him.

745
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,370
He looks amazing.
It's great.

746
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,243
It looks just like him.
That Song Dragon attack the Queen Song 

747
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,080
Dragon attack you.
That's fine.

748
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,940
That's my free song.
That's my song.

749
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:59,690
I want to go into freeze.
I just listened to dragon.

750
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,880
The TAC,
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

751
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,460
Have you made yourself to the Mac,
got into your Max,

752
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,810
like you're not allowed to go any 
higher,

753
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,170
longer in the free thing.
Is that how it starts?

754
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:11,310
I don't really like you going in more 
than three minutes.

755
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,683
Three minutes is pretty much the Max,
so I go in three minutes that I weighed 

756
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,440
out for 10 minutes.

757
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,320
Then I go in for another.
The animal do it feels good.

758
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,980
It feels like when you come out like a 
slushy,

759
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,040
is it little ice or something different?
They do anything.

760
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,110
All it does is it makes your body 
produce a lot of antiinflammatories,

761
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,730
like a heat shock,
cold shock proteins called cytokines.

762
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,623
Your body produces and when it freaks 
the fuck out and thinks it's going to 

763
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:41,010
die because it's so cold,
oh,

764
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,320
just if you feel amazing,
it free.

765
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,450
It really feels amazing when you come 
out of there,

766
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,560
like you feel like I'm,
uh,

767
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,443
Dr Rhonda Patrick explained it 
scientifically when she did a podcast 

768
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,620
about it and she was talking about the 
increased.

769
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,590
I'm anti inflammatory markers in the 
blood,

770
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,300
I think it was.
And the other thing was that,

771
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,970
um,
your norepinephrine,

772
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,740
I think that's how you say it,
a brain chemicals,

773
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,713
a spike and it's,
a lot of it is just dealing with the 

774
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:12,390
fact that your body's been thrust into 
this insane environment.

775
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,330
Like I guess I guess there's,
I mean it's like,

776
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,520
you know what we're talking about the 
placebo effect,

777
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,250
right?
Like there's a way through just thinking

778
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:21,084
about something you can get your mind to
operate in a way where it fixes your 

779
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:26,850
body.
Right?

780
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,133
And that there's sort of some,
something similar to in this respect 

781
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,750
that like your,
your,

782
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,753
your brain and your thoughts for 
something like a placebo effect or 

783
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:40,830
something like really trying to,
uh,

784
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,650
really trying to figure out how you 
interface with stuff.

785
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:45,484
I think,
I think I really do think that there's 

786
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,633
more to like how we go,
like this idea that like there's a 

787
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,040
simulation theory that you keep bringing
up.

788
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:54,874
A lot of people keep bringing up.
I think we interfaced with reality 

789
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,910
different than we ever did before.
It's just slightly different.

790
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,500
Just slightly.

791
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,070
I think that like all the different ways
you can hack your system,

792
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:07,904
whether it's through like a cold shock 
proteins from doing that or he chocked 

793
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:15,800
proteins from doing a sauna or even 
placebo effects,

794
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:18,620
like it might be good to get tricked.
It might be like,

795
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:22,150
that's like probably like half of the 
reason why religion does a lot of people

796
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,690
good because if you fucking believe,
if you really believe that Jesus is real

797
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,330
and you read all the tenants of the 
Bible and you go,

798
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:30,980
wow,
this is fucking what a great way to live

799
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:32,030
your life.
Like whoa.

800
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:37,210
You get almost like a bit of a placebo 
effect and you can say,

801
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:38,021
look,
it works.

802
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:40,660
It's real,
and it's like the same way you could say

803
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,250
sugar pills are real,
right?

804
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,510
If you give a guy a placebo sugar pill,
it does nothing really,

805
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,610
but all of a sudden it fixes what our 
aim on the ad.

806
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,160
It's all connected,
man.

807
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:55,370
We can do shit with our brains and we 
can do shit with our bodies.

808
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,390
And in that Wim Hoff guys living proof 
of that,

809
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,410
you ever pay attention to him to have 
had him on a couple of times.

810
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:04,244
You've got to check out a shitty.
This guy does marathons and his 

811
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:07,760
underwear.
He does.

812
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:08,594
Uh,
he runs to the top of everest in a pair 

813
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:16,250
of shorts with a ice like flip flops on 
his sandals on.

814
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,340
I'm not bullshitting.
Fuck summit's Everest.

815
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:20,720
He says it's easy.
Wow.

816
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,511
Yeah,
he does.

817
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:24,110
Like,
he runs barefoot in the snow.

818
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:24,944
He does marathons and all just by 
controlling his breathing and 

819
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:30,350
controlling his mind.
So real freak men.

820
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,310
Fascinating cat was like a yoga teacher 
most of his life.

821
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:40,310
Went through a bunch of hardships and 
really started realizing that by jumping

822
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,130
in cold water and controlling his 
breathing,

823
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,143
like he,
he really sort of changed his reality 

824
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,173
and he does it all time.
This guy goes into glacial waters so it 

825
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:56,381
isn't like frostbite and like,
like physical things real like it is,

826
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:57,494
but I think your body first of all 
develops tolerances for stuff and I 

827
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,740
noticed that just from doing the Cryo 
Chamber,

828
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,470
like if I don't do it for a few of them 
out there doing yoga,

829
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,230
barefoot in the snow on the top of the 
fucking mountain.

830
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,720
Is there a more bad ass photo ever taken
a look at that?

831
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,603
Pretty sweet.

832
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:15,963
That's amazing.
What about hyperthermia and all that 

833
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:19,790
crazy guy?
Controlling body?

834
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,290
I think your body adapts because when 
you do,

835
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,124
um,
if you do like cryotherapy and you've 

836
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:27,820
never done it before,
the first time you do it you're like,

837
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:31,030
Holy Shit.
Like first time they do it,

838
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:32,710
they won't let you do more than a minute
and a half.

839
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,660
They want you to go,
oh my God,

840
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:35,494
like what is this?
And if you take some time off and you 

841
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:40,010
get back in there,
like if you haven't gone in a few months

842
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:42,580
and then you go back in there,
you do feel way cold.

843
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,593
But if I go like three days in a row,
I can just get right in there and stand 

844
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:48,190
there and it doesn't even freak me out.
It doesn't.

845
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,780
I just,
I'm just used to it.

846
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,080
I know what it is.
My body's adapted to it.

847
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,913
My body's accustomed to it now.
Imagine like how people live that are 

848
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,790
living in northeast Alaska or uh,
you know,

849
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,140
like live in places where they hunt 
seals and shed the inuits.

850
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,090
They don't even get frostbite,
man,

851
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,780
like their hands going to be out and 
exposed and ridiculous cold.

852
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,663
They just don't.
They don't get the same sort of issues 

853
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:16,570
with it that we do like their,
their bodies have adapted.

854
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:17,943
It's weird as fuck.
I think your mind can make your body do 

855
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:23,014
a lot of shit it doesn't want to do and 
you get your mind can do it by forcing 

856
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:28,920
yourself new extreme physical conditions
like,

857
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,560
like a cryo chamber or like a sauna.
Sauna is amazing for you.

858
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:35,600
Apparently.
What that Rhonda,

859
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:38,450
Patrick Lady was saying that Rhonda,
Patrick,

860
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:40,730
Lady,
Dr Rhonda Patrick was saying,

861
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,803
was that there is a 40 percent decrease 
in mortality across all causes from 

862
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:50,270
everything that gets like heart attacks,
strokes,

863
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:51,104
cancer,
40 percent decrease in mortality across 

864
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:57,350
everything just from doing sauna like 
four times a week.

865
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,323
Apparently.
It's just fucking phenomenal for your 

866
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,124
body.
Just sit there and just heat up and it 

867
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:05,180
just fires your system up,
you know,

868
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:09,910
all those heat shock proteins.
They just act as an anti inflammatory.

869
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:11,510
If your body,
your joints feel better,

870
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:12,344
things move better.
So just get out of there too and you 

871
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:17,090
cool off and you feel way better.
It's just,

872
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,493
I think there's a bunch of resources 
like that that we don't take advantage 

873
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:23,360
of enough and I think everybody should 
be signing all the time.

874
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,263
I'm just traumatized from being a child 
and going with my dad and seeing all 

875
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:31,701
those dicks and balls.
He told you not to look shit.

876
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,960
You know,
I think um,

877
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,303
there's a lot of negative connotation 
towards sauna in mma because a lot of 

878
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,600
people think of a sauna is like a place 
where people go to cut weight,

879
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,250
like a real painful process to cut 
weight so they can make a weight class,

880
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,950
which is true.
They do use it for that,

881
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,140
but that's not the only use for the 
sauna.

882
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:55,240
Like you shouldn't just be using the 
sauna for that.

883
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,980
You should be using the sauna for 
health.

884
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,173
We should use it all the time I think.
I think it's a gigantic important step 

885
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,110
in like a body maintenance.
It's like a bunch of shit you have to do

886
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:10,390
for body maintenance.
I think that's one.

887
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,190
Has there been any news updates on 
there?

888
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,024
John Jones situation and like I haven't 
heard enough and that's so 

889
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:20,700
disappointing.
So makes me sad.

890
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,050
Right.
Abandoned sites on this one.

891
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,251
Yeah,
that's right.

892
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:24,084
You called the Dick Pills.
I would just like to state for the 

893
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,204
record,
Brian

894
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,640
banned completely called the Dick built 
thing.

895
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,210
You,
if I paraphrase,

896
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,010
you were like,
let me say he parties.

897
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,470
He does coke.
Uh,

898
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,351
he,
you know,

899
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:36,730
he probably took some Dick Pills.

900
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,170
I was like,
what?

901
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,270
Jesus Christ,
it made so much sense.

902
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:42,730
It was like how it was there right along
the whole time.

903
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,930
I just remember the FDA dot Gov had 
breakdowns of certain,

904
00:43:46,931 --> 00:43:47,764
like Rhino,
a dick pills at gas stations and a lot 

905
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:54,430
of them had steroid type things in them 
and he's so crazy.

906
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,470
He was taking that stuff that is still 
taking them.

907
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,240
Well now I bet he would.
I mean now that I always like fuck it,

908
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:02,110
I'll just take everything.

909
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,210
You could get addicted to them.
I was addicted to him for awhile.

910
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,270
I don't know why.
I don't think he's addicted to it.

911
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,130
The new thing that he tested positive 
for has nothing to do with that.

912
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,090
They said the new thing that he tested 
positive for his steroid,

913
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:16,924
that the only test for in urine and 
according to jail Sunnen it's like a 

914
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:21,754
very,
it's not a very common steroid and it's 

915
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:24,724
actually kind of old school.
It's like something that used to do a 

916
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,490
long time ago.
So he,

917
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,520
it's his thought was that if somebody is
getting them to do that,

918
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,890
that if that's not a tainted supplement,
if someone's getting them to do that,

919
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,440
that person knows their shit.
Like that's some sneaky steroids now.

920
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,543
Yeah.
And he said it's usually combined with 

921
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:43,890
other things since.
So unfortunate man.

922
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,880
I don't know if it's true,
right?

923
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,180
He could've got sabotaged.
What's he saying?

924
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:51,270
Is he saying no one's saying anything?
There's no official statement.

925
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,720
I don't think like [inaudible] there's,
I think they're trying to test other,

926
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,900
other samples.
They tested a blood sample and then they

927
00:44:57,901 --> 00:44:59,610
released the results of the blood 
sample.

928
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:02,850
They always do a blood and a urine.
The blood sample was negative,

929
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,310
but the blood sample didn't test for 
that stuff.

930
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,580
So I don't,
you know,

931
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,710
you could speculate all day long.
I'm sure as the facts come in,

932
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:11,544
we'll get a better understanding of it.
But it would be the most disappointing 

933
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,264
thing ever if someone's spiked his shit,
it almost be less disappointing if he 

934
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:22,770
took something and got caught that it 
would be if somebody

935
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,873
did him.
That's why I'm saying it like he knows 

936
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:26,274
his past.
It just seems ridiculous to think that 

937
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:31,140
he would even try,
even if it's old school or stuff,

938
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:31,974
they barely tasted like.
It seems like why would he even risk 

939
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:35,310
that?
Because you already went through that.

940
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:35,740
Right?

941
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,573
But being a cage fighter is a ridiculous
way to make a living and people who are 

942
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:45,220
cage fighters,
especially like elite level,

943
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,280
like a guy like Jon Jones,
he's that guy has like probably a belief

944
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:52,414
in himself that you and I will never 
understand and completely impulsive and 

945
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:01,150
like what he decides.
So he's why he's a wild motherfucker.

946
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,930
That's why it's so good.
Because he's smart and he's wild.

947
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,120
Like he'll take.
He's like legitimately wild.

948
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:07,954
He's wild chances.
Like I always talk about like when he 

949
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:13,390
fought shogun for the tile,
when he fought shogun for the title,

950
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:15,610
he opened up the fight with a flying 
knee.

951
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,190
There was the first thing he did 
fighting a legend,

952
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,920
finding a UFC light heavyweight 
champion.

953
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,190
I mean he was crazy talented and still 
is right?

954
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,173
And he's only 30,
but he's a wild man and wild men 

955
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:29,614
sometimes.
Do Shit that they don't even know why 

956
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:32,380
they're,
why they're doing it.

957
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,150
They're just doing it,
you know?

958
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:38,310
And if you're a guy that's that powerful
as the garlic Jon Jones,

959
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,270
like,
try controlling him.

960
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,030
Good luck.
Good luck telling him he can't go out.

961
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,310
Good luck telling him what he's gotTa do
you know?

962
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,153
It's one of the things about him in the 
past is that he hasn't trained hard for 

963
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:51,430
fights and they were way harder fights 
and they should've been probably because

964
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:54,940
he really wasn't in shape and everyone 
around him kind of knew it,

965
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:55,774
but it was,
he was that good that he could fight 

966
00:46:57,701 --> 00:47:02,701
world class title challengers and beat 
them in five round fights without really

967
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:05,410
training.
Like that's how God damn good.

968
00:47:05,411 --> 00:47:07,270
That guy.
So you and I,

969
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:12,040
we don't know how his brain even works.
So who knows what the fuck happened?

970
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,713
I hope he didn't do something.
But then again that means that one of 

971
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:17,770
two things happened.

972
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,603
Either he took a tainted supplement,
which is after awhile almost becomes a 

973
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:23,074
joke.
Like to keep people keep saying that he 

974
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:27,520
stopped taking supplements or even worse
at someone spiked him.

975
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah.
The spiking thing because it seemed like

976
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,260
a pretty crazy.
Yeah,

977
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,580
that would be crazy.
You could do that to somebody though for

978
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:37,414
sure.
I mean if somebody is around someone 

979
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:41,464
with nefarious intentions or someone's 
around someone who's resentful and 

980
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:45,844
you're in some sort of pro fight camp 
and someone just decides to fuck this 

981
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:52,360
guy and just dumped some stuff on your 
chicken steroid cream in your hand.

982
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:53,194
Cream.
I think there's things they could do to 

983
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,120
get it into your system.
You probably wouldn't even know what it,

984
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,120
the tests that came up positive I guess 
is the one that happened,

985
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:02,120
right?
It was after the way in.

986
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,033
Yes.
It's a urine test and tested at anytime 

987
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,693
before that.

988
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,550
Um,
I'm sure he was there.

989
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,180
They were tested multiple times in camp.
Um,

990
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,153
it wouldn't have probably come out.
Not necessarily because it's really 

991
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:16,960
like,
well if you know,

992
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:17,794
I don't know,
like what kind of time period they 

993
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:23,630
tested them in and I don't know what 
kind of half life this stuff has because

994
00:48:23,631 --> 00:48:24,464
uh,
apparently Chael Sonnen was telling 

995
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,020
Brendan Schaub that it gets out of your 
system quite quick and that's one of the

996
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:33,180
things that guys like about it 
apparently.

997
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,350
So you could do it.
It,

998
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:35,184
it gets out of your system really quick.
You'd have to find out like how much 

999
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:39,054
time do they usually have in between 
visits by Usada and what are the odds 

1000
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:45,030
they're going to get busted?
Like how much,

1001
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,490
how many times during camp or they're 
willing to roll the dice,

1002
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,020
see if they have a 24 or 48 hour acting 
steroid.

1003
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,200
How many times can you roll the dice?
You sought a visited three times.

1004
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:56,910
You got to roll the dice this week.
Roll it.

1005
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,620
Come on when I have a hard workout 
Thursday.

1006
00:48:58,621 --> 00:48:59,910
Fuck it.
Let's roll the dice.

1007
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,220
You roll the dice 27 hours.
No,

1008
00:49:02,221 --> 00:49:03,054
you saw 28.
You wake up and the all night sweat and 

1009
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,840
30 hours.
No.

1010
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,050
You know,
if they come,

1011
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:07,901
you've,
you know,

1012
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:08,734
if they come you're fucking career's 
over and they take away millions of 

1013
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,860
dollars,
40 hours your pen.

1014
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,060
Oh No.
You saw the,

1015
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,980
the next day you saw it,
you start thinking 52 hours.

1016
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,110
How many hours is that?
How many has it been?

1017
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,771
Pretty.
Hey,

1018
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:24,390
for 9:50,
50 1:50.

1019
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,313
Two,
three hours.

1020
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,300
Three hours.
It's got to be gone.

1021
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:28,134
Right?
It's got all begun and you give them 

1022
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:30,114
that pice.
Just wondering whether it's in and I'm 

1023
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:32,844
sure there's stuff that you can take 
that supposedly washes it out fast or 

1024
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:38,160
like any kind of drug tests you know,
mean like we'd test.

1025
00:49:38,161 --> 00:49:38,994
I remember,
I think it was like cranberry juice or 

1026
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:41,940
something.
You just constantly drained.

1027
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,350
There's certain diuretics for sure.
Certain diuretics can mask steroids.

1028
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,820
It's one of the reasons why they're 
illegal.

1029
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,930
I'm looking at this article that came 
out in about an hour ago.

1030
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:51,764
It looks like on a bloody elbow at it.
That's not like any update of news or 

1031
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:58,280
anything really.
It's a ped expert who's known,

1032
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,493
uh,
in the track and field world as known 

1033
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,290
for supplying performance,
enhancing drugs to them.

1034
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,140
His name is Angel Hernandez,
also known as memo.

1035
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,860
Not that that matters a whole lot,
but if anybody knows him a what

1036
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,850
an angel.
Heredia Heredia Hernandez,

1037
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,953
but Angel Heredia.
Is that the same guy that used to train 

1038
00:50:16,611 --> 00:50:17,444
manny Pacquiao or know who the fuck did?
There was a guy that was a really 

1039
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:23,950
popular.
Goddammit.

1040
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,990
I know I got his name wrong,
but a strength and conditioning.

1041
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,910
You're saying that the test that they do
texts tests for six different.

1042
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,133
Our particular metabolites,
one of those can last up to seven weeks 

1043
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,423
and a dennis skipped down to here.
He says that one of those metabolites 

1044
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,860
can look like the same structure as the 
Toronto ball and it may or may not.

1045
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,420
It doesn't mean that it's not Toronto 
Bar,

1046
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,263
whatever,
but it could be from a bad supplement 

1047
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:50,534
that he took during the training period 
that lasted in a system and ended up 

1048
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:54,860
looking like it.

1049
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,050
Ooh,
interesting.

1050
00:50:56,051 --> 00:50:57,250
But that's.
Listen to this quote,

1051
00:50:57,251 --> 00:51:00,370
listen to this quote.
If he would have been using way before,

1052
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:03,620
then he eventually would have been 
positive on the 21 days,

1053
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,950
testing before the fight,
but he was negative.

1054
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,110
Then he came out positive.
Frankly,

1055
00:51:08,111 --> 00:51:08,944
the testing itself,
it lacks credibility for a lot of 

1056
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:12,850
reasons.
A,

1057
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:13,684
we could go on and on,
but and I could be very specific in 

1058
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:17,314
terms of chemistry,
but I don't want to mislead the people 

1059
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:20,344
that listen.
It's just the fact that they are 

1060
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:22,744
detecting six different metabolites in 
one of them stays there longer than 

1061
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:27,874
seven weeks,
but the most intriguing part is that 

1062
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,333
some of those metabolites are not really
confirmed that they are actually coming 

1063
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:36,820
from that to how do you say that,
to rentable,

1064
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,120
to rentable,
to ball structure.

1065
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,060
All right,
but you sorta who's doing this,

1066
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,030
they know what the fuck they're doing 
and they're not.

1067
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:51,010
They're not going to come out with a 
result unless they're super,

1068
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,490
super sure that that's what they're 
tested positive for.

1069
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:55,100
I don't know if this is

1070
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,740
skype right?
He's just sort of speculating.

1071
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,700
I would imagine.
I don't know if he.

1072
00:51:58,701 --> 00:51:59,630
If he wasn't there either.

1073
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,370
Tell you.
I talked to Jeff Novitsky offstage,

1074
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:06,830
I mean off mic on my.
I talked to him around the arena.

1075
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,390
He's,
he's about as honest as it comes when it

1076
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,270
comes to like handling these situations 
with these athletes.

1077
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,910
They're catching people and the people 
they're catching,

1078
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:18,460
we're using,
there's,

1079
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:19,783
you know,
the way they're doing it is very 

1080
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:22,034
thorough.
The way they're handling it is very 

1081
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:24,194
thorough and there hasn't been anybody 
with a credible story that came forth 

1082
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:28,874
that didn't have something in their 
system that they weren't supposed to 

1083
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:33,560
have in their system.
We haven't had a case of that yet as far

1084
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:34,394
as I know.
I think almost all cases have been 

1085
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:39,590
either 10 tainted supplements or someone
getting caught,

1086
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,660
whether it's taking a diuretic or 
something,

1087
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:43,250
getting caught,
taking a steroid.

1088
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,700
There's a lot going on like that.
And he's got,

1089
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,920
you know,
they have a team of people that are just

1090
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:52,760
constantly checking people that might be
cheating.

1091
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,580
I guess you have to also say it's where 
there's smoke,

1092
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:57,110
there's fire.
How many fighters?

1093
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,290
You never have a steroid in him.
You know,

1094
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,570
there's a few,
you know,

1095
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:04,840
like Bj Penn,
uh,

1096
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,100
I'm sure there's a,
you know,

1097
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,413
I used to think it would be John Fitch 
within John Fitch tested positive he 

1098
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:12,344
was,
but he was getting older and he was 

1099
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:18,690
fighting and world series of fighting 
wasn't in the UFC anymore and you know,

1100
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,660
he might've been dealing with some 
serious injuries.

1101
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:24,380
Need to pay his bills for fighting.
Like I don't begrudge anybody,

1102
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,603
especially when they're not even in the 
UFC and the testing that they do in a 

1103
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,840
lot of these organizations.
It's like there's a lot of,

1104
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,320
uh,
there's a lot of organizations that have

1105
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:38,310
guys that are pretty much openly using.
And what they do is they have these guys

1106
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:39,144
fight on Indian reservations or fighting
weird states that have an athletic 

1107
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:47,580
commission that doesn't really adhere to
the rules or it doesn't have to.

1108
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,770
It doesn't restrict.
But what,

1109
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,310
especially the Indian reservation thing,
native American reservations,

1110
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:54,830
they took whatever the fuck they want.
Man,

1111
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,080
there are country inside our country,
but you sata,

1112
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,140
they look up your ass man.
They look up your ass.

1113
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:03,290
They come get you.
They come get you.

1114
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,830
And they wake you up,
hey man,

1115
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,240
hey,
how you doing?

1116
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,680
Hey,
we're going to have to look at your deck

1117
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:08,514
and I'm going to watch pis come out of 
your deck and it's going to go in this 

1118
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,790
cup.
And then you can go back to sleep.

1119
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,610
[inaudible].
It's a,

1120
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,150
it's no joke.
And uh,

1121
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,770
to see a guy like John was just 
spectacular,

1122
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:21,690
just spectacular comeback,
fight,

1123
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:22,981
you know,
I mean,

1124
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:25,170
like a Phoenix,
he rises from the ashes.

1125
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:28,620
He gave this really classy post fight 
speech.

1126
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,040
He won by just overwhelming devastation.
I mean,

1127
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:36,144
it was a beautiful combination with the 
left high kick and then a series of 

1128
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:39,894
shots.

1129
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,733
Daniel goes down.
He just beats him unconscious in a 

1130
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:43,254
spectacular performance.
And then to find out that it's tainted 

1131
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:51,051
by some fucking gross steroid.
They were,

1132
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,500
they were sneaking in.
It's either that or again,

1133
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,334
the other one,
which is almost equally grows that 

1134
00:54:57,181 --> 00:55:00,300
somebody gave it to them.
Like somebody gave him some,

1135
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:01,350
hey man,
hey champ.

1136
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,050
Have some,
have this gatorade,

1137
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,170
champ,
you know,

1138
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,440
hey champ,
I've got your gatorade champ crack,

1139
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,750
you know,
and they're very assessable.

1140
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,740
These fighters,
you know,

1141
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,410
they're going to,
they're just going to the gyms you go to

1142
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,440
a lot of times and if you're not 
fighting John,

1143
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:16,440
he's a great guy.
Yeah.

1144
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,420
He's a great guy,
great guy.

1145
00:55:18,421 --> 00:55:20,280
And people love them.
Um,

1146
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,390
I think that,
uh,

1147
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,010
we don't know,
you know,

1148
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,700
just makes me sad.
It makes me sad.

1149
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,180
But one day,
you know,

1150
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,583
when Dale they'll have it eradicated,
but by then I think there's gonna be 

1151
00:55:32,521 --> 00:55:33,480
some new methods.

1152
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,610
I think they're going to have genetic 
methods.

1153
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,800
That's the next one.
They're pretty,

1154
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,020
not pretty close,
but they're,

1155
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:40,854
they're pretty close to being able to 
alter embryos and to be able to change 

1156
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:50,930
like genes in people maybe even shut off
dangerous jeans,

1157
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:53,520
like genes for Alzheimer's and 
different,

1158
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,600
different diseases that people have.
They might be able to literally create,

1159
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,713
create the,
the tools to edit that in the embryonic 

1160
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:01,974
stage to something called crispr and 
that's one of the things that they're 

1161
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:05,850
using to,
to,

1162
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,400
to alter genes.
It's like Star C,

1163
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,840
R I s,
p,

1164
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:10,680
r,
I think it is.

1165
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:11,763
Did you see the video of someone used it
to make like neon green beer or 

1166
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,240
something like that?
They use crispr to make neon green beer.

1167
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,660
Would they use like.
So they did something to the wheat.

1168
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,853
Awesome.
They made a new color chocolate the 

1169
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:26,650
first time in like a hundred years.

1170
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,720
They made a new chocolate.
Oh,

1171
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:29,554
we're fucking around with nature.
That's why Hurricane Irma was going to 

1172
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,173
eat Florida.
They also recently took the West Nile 

1173
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:41,200
virus and pumped it into rats and it 
killed the cancer,

1174
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,183
which is crazy.
So you're taking one crazy thing and 

1175
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:45,604
killing another crazy thing with West 
Nile virus cures cancer in mice or 

1176
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:53,440
whatever,
but yeah,

1177
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:54,630
that's.
That's the thing.

1178
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:55,464
It's like there's a lot of shit that we.
That animals can't even touch or they 

1179
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:59,770
die.
This biohacker.

1180
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,700
What does it say again?
Sorry.

1181
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,540
Wants to spur a genetic engineering 
revolution with glowing beer.

1182
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,900
That seems healthy.
I'm worried about aspartame.

1183
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,220
Engineered yeast.
Imagine how bad your pee smells like.

1184
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,640
Think about how bad your pee smells when
you drink or you eat asparagus.

1185
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,590
Cutting edge genetic engineering 
technique.

1186
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:21,690
Crispr.
Yeah.

1187
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,470
Wow.
That's how they did it.

1188
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,440
That's insane.
That's insane.

1189
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,830
He sells the kits to.
Apparently that is so crazy.

1190
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:30,664
You can buy a kit to genetically 
engineer through Crispr your wheat to 

1191
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:37,630
glow.
It's pretty bad ass.

1192
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,580
That's insane.
It's got to be bad for.

1193
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:44,590
It's totally for good.
How I'm waiting for one of these fucking

1194
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:45,603
problems that we have to turn us into 
superheroes because that was what we 

1195
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,710
always saw in the comic books.
Right?

1196
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:54,340
Every time there was a nuclear spill,
dude came out of it with x Ray Vision.

1197
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,563
Right.
But the government also immediately 

1198
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:57,214
found the guy and took him and hit him 
and did tests on him so the public 

1199
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:02,620
wouldn't be scared.
Tried to borrow pride to.

1200
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:04,600
Most of the time they were afraid it 
already happened.

1201
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,790
Autism,
now they're like some of the best,

1202
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,480
uh,
like navy coders and.

1203
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,110
Oh yeah.
Well there's,

1204
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,420
there's without a doubt some super 
genius.

1205
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:19,450
People with autism.
And then there's people that are on that

1206
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:20,290
spectrum,
you know,

1207
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,483
autism and also asperger's and a lot of 
different disorders that allows them to 

1208
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:29,920
like focus on stuff with laser,
like precision.

1209
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,260
They just,
their brains work different.

1210
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,023
There's a lot of thought to that.
That's like the next style of person 

1211
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,913
that like we're so connected to our 
devices and to the Internet and to do 

1212
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:45,634
this we're going to lose our interaction
with each other and lose our emotions 

1213
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,253
and that it might manifest itself 
through a series of like weird errors 

1214
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,753
like a disease or a disorder and that 
disordered becomes favorable and that 

1215
00:58:57,961 --> 00:59:00,610
favorable disorder of just not really 
getting attached to things.

1216
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:02,800
Just focus on your work like a drone,
like a,

1217
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:05,960
some sort of crazy robot number 
crunching robot.

1218
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,340
Like it's a 100 percent possible that if
you.

1219
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,470
We know there are some people like that,
right?

1220
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,860
So if there are some people that are 
just super genius coders,

1221
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:15,694
they're just zone out and can code like 
crazy and they're kind of on the 

1222
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:18,694
spectrum.
If there's one of those that could be a 

1223
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,241
thousand thousand,
that could be a million.

1224
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:24,074
If there's a million,
they could start breeding and making a 

1225
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:26,834
bunch of other ones like that and maybe 
it's something to pass on and Eugene's 

1226
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,730
maybe pass on more than in our genes and
we know.

1227
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,880
Next thing you know you got robot people
like we slowly but surely integrate with

1228
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:42,440
our chips and fucking different qualcomm
chips in your brain.

1229
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,260
Your phone is now part of your body 
robot.

1230
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:46,094
People with abilities to call each other
and connect online and like what if 

1231
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:54,680
that's like nature's trying to engineer 
our humanness out of us.

1232
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:59,000
Slowly morphing change.
It may get more compatible to staying in

1233
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:02,090
front of computer screens.
Constantly crunching numbers.

1234
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,483
People's hands start growing different 
because they went to a holding cell 

1235
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:09,920
phones their whole life.
Their eyes get farther apart,

1236
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,783
like chance the rapper.
You know what fascinates me when people 

1237
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,324
have autistic kids,
then the kids show massive improvement 

1238
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,283
from a change of diet or from cannabis.
Cannabis oil for for a lot of kids is a 

1239
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,280
massive improvement.
Stop their seizures.

1240
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,200
Makes them start interacting with other 
kids.

1241
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:28,034
Better wonder if that is what I mean.
I don't think they know like a specific 

1242
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:36,560
cause for autism or any of the spectrum 
disorders right now.

1243
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,483
I mean,
I always just blamed cell phones and 

1244
01:00:38,211 --> 01:00:40,560
Wifi.
I've also heard it could be right.

1245
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:44,330
I've also heard gut bacteria be blamed 
for a bunch of them.

1246
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,430
Wow.
Extensure's.

1247
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,090
Yeah.
They were saying that um,

1248
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:47,924
a lack of probiotics and the Diet poor 
gut bacteria can be blamed for certain 

1249
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,970
issues and disorders that some people 
have found neurons in the gut.

1250
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,360
Right.
If those two things are true,

1251
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,111
that makes sense.
Well,

1252
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:02,200
if your gut bacteria is essentially like
a,

1253
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,830
like a community,
right?

1254
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:04,664
You have like a community of flora 
inside your stomach and the more bad 

1255
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:08,204
stuff you put in there and then it also 
like other people would be way more 

1256
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,670
susceptible than some,
you know,

1257
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,513
like,
just like today there's people that can 

1258
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,783
eat things that maybe have mild 
allergies and then there's someone like 

1259
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:20,654
you or I that we could eat the exact 
same thing and have no issue with it 

1260
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:23,324
whatsoever.
That's got to be the same with gut 

1261
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:25,790
flora.
It's got to be the same with.

1262
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,550
I mean,
we're so biologically variable,

1263
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:34,870
but if just imagine if that's just a 
step in a long process of peep.

1264
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:40,280
I mean like you look at like a super 
genius autistic people.

1265
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:45,020
We as far as we know,
I mean they might've existed hundreds of

1266
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:45,920
years ago but we don't know of them.

1267
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,900
Right?
We're just guessing.

1268
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:48,943
This is a fairly recent thing.
What if it becomes something even 

1269
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:54,440
different than 100 years from now?
What if it's these,

1270
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,303
these people that know how to read each 
other's minds and only they can do it 

1271
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,440
and they can all read each other's 
minds.

1272
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,333
They can probably read our minds.
We can never read theirs and they just 

1273
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:04,364
read.
They're just talking to each other and 

1274
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:05,631
we're like,
Hey,

1275
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:07,640
what are you talking about?
What are you guys talking about?

1276
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,623
Like,
we're going to be left behind like our 

1277
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:10,754
stupid genes.
We're going to be left behind and these 

1278
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:13,244
people without.
What if like war just stops because 

1279
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:18,680
autistic people just have no desire to 
go to war.

1280
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,360
Like not just rather sit around here and
code,

1281
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,320
you know,
or whatever the next stage is.

1282
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:30,321
Like if if autism or asperger's or any 
of these things are a new thing,

1283
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,700
I don't know if they are,
but if they are a new thing,

1284
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:33,863
just imagine what another new thing 
could be that takes it to another place 

1285
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:38,250
and the next level.

1286
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,570
People that don't keep their vr helmets 
on all the time that you've lived in the

1287
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:43,920
railroad.
What's wrong with you?

1288
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,180
Well,
you gotta think man,

1289
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:47,910
if evolution is true,
and I'm assuming it is.

1290
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,270
We used to be super primitive,
right?

1291
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:55,770
We used to be some sort of primitive 
primate thing and then there was a bunch

1292
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:56,604
of different versions of us and we 
branched out and we were the most 

1293
01:02:58,411 --> 01:03:02,550
successful and we made it to today.
So that means we changed.

1294
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,520
So why would we assume we're done?
That's crazy.

1295
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:09,000
We're getting more input now than ever 
before and we're assuming we're done.

1296
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,570
We're not even the same people from the 
19 fifties.

1297
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,520
We're not,
we're just,

1298
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,690
we're,
we're totally different.

1299
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,053
I wonder if our brains are going to 
start using more because we are more or 

1300
01:03:20,151 --> 01:03:22,940
less or less,
but I mean we're pretty much like,

1301
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:23,803
you know,
we're using our brains way more than we 

1302
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:27,110
were 20 years ago,
20 years ago.

1303
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,440
Instead of like researching and reading 
and reading,

1304
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:33,470
pretty much we're just probably sitting 
there looking at colors,

1305
01:03:33,471 --> 01:03:34,304
you know,
or something

1306
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,850
to who would have been way easier back 
then to be a con man.

1307
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,490
Nobody could do any research on you.
Yeah.

1308
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,370
Well I was reading on the town and all 
that.

1309
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:44,810
Right?
Well,

1310
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:45,643
raising a Buddhist monastery,
Eddie had the greatest fucking story 

1311
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:51,390
about that.
Eddie Bravo was taking karate or Kung Fu

1312
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,350
from this dude that said he had to go to
China to learn,

1313
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,240
uh,
from,

1314
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,073
you know,
some Kung Fu masters and Eddie was like 

1315
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:00,420
so proud.
It's like,

1316
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:01,880
wow,
my instructors,

1317
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,440
like one of the greatest churches in the
world is going to go to China,

1318
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,483
learn from some Kung Fu master.
And then he saw him like a supermarket 

1319
01:04:09,121 --> 01:04:09,954
or some shit.
The dude's car was like parked in front 

1320
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:12,590
of China.
He's like,

1321
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,250
that can't be him.
He got in the car,

1322
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:15,660
he drove off like,
what the fuck?

1323
01:04:15,661 --> 01:04:16,980
I thought that deal was in China.

1324
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,920
He just totally lied.
Not only did he lie,

1325
01:04:19,921 --> 01:04:21,840
but he was so stupid.
He stayed around the neighborhood.

1326
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:23,760
Wow.
There you go.

1327
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:26,130
On vacation for that.
He just lied to.

1328
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:29,550
The students was pretending he was off 
gathering knowledge from the masters.

1329
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,600
There was a lot of those guys,
man that had like fake karate classes.

1330
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,733
They'd like fake martial arts schools.
They were teaching like nonsense and 

1331
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:40,860
they would have this crazy background on
the wall,

1332
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,900
you know,
seven time undefeated,

1333
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:44,970
marine corps,
bare knuckle,

1334
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,820
no holds bar champion.
They would make up a bunch of shit.

1335
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,800
There's a lot of those dudes,
man.

1336
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,250
My favorite youtube videos.
Oh my God.

1337
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,530
So many of them are just so many of 
them.

1338
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,550
It's like the religious people like,
like you know,

1339
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:01,100
if people falling on the ground are 
getting thrown by the room,

1340
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:03,230
by the pet,
the pastor and stuff.

1341
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,580
It's the same kind of shit.

1342
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,310
Yeah.
And a lot of ways.

1343
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:10,090
But that's like the other side of the 
placebo effect.

1344
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,710
Right?
It's like there's the other side,

1345
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:12,544
like those people,
when that guy got does that thing and 

1346
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:16,840
they go flying through the air and they 
start their body starts,

1347
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:21,190
do you think they feel something like 
what do you think is going on?

1348
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:23,890
Are they just totally faking it?
I think it's done on this guy.

1349
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,753
I think it's all dumb people.
I think it's low watt brains that just 

1350
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,440
they're easy to trick and to believe in 
anything.

1351
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:32,040
I mean look at look at half the road.
Yeah,

1352
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,180
for sure.
That's a possibility,

1353
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,400
but I want to know like are they doing 
it?

1354
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,100
Are they conscious of what they're 
doing?

1355
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,263
Like are they willfully giving into this
because they want the guy to like them 

1356
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:44,890
and like he comes up to you.

1357
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,190
I was like,
oh.

1358
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,510
Or are they really feeling it?
I mean,

1359
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:51,820
are they convincing the.
Is it a placebo effect?

1360
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,970
Are they convincing themselves?
I think so.

1361
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:55,863
You think so?
Yeah.

1362
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,033
I think.
I think the like dumb people can really 

1363
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:03,130
do a lot that we can't even fathom.
Like we were saying,

1364
01:06:03,131 --> 01:06:07,630
if you really believe that there is a 
know makeup,

1365
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,850
but it doesn't even have to be Jesus or 
are gods,

1366
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:11,860
I don't want to offend anybody,
but if you really,

1367
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,713
if somebody really believed that Odin 
had carved his path in eternity and 

1368
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:18,221
that,
uh,

1369
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:19,054
his,
his destiny was chosen for him by the 

1370
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:23,860
cards and he would go forth with that 
kind of confidence.

1371
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:29,220
Like if you really believed that Odin 
has carved a path for you to destiny and

1372
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:32,920
you really believe that,
like that's got to be a powerful weapon.

1373
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,810
It's just having that belief.

1374
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,510
There's something to that.
Whether it's real or not,

1375
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:40,180
it might become real because you think 
it's real.

1376
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,900
Like the placebo effect is just one 
little,

1377
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:44,913
one little sliver of this weird puzzle 
of managing the mind and managing the 

1378
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:53,500
way you interface with reality,
with people,

1379
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,570
with,
with life itself,

1380
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,413
with different choices that you make.
I don't think we understand it 100 

1381
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:00,970
percent.
I don't.

1382
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:02,023
I think we just assume that like 
physical acts or like all that's going 

1383
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:06,880
on,
you know,

1384
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,060
like he picked up that box.
He moved it over there,

1385
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:12,220
like physical acts are all that's going 
on.

1386
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,330
I don't think so,
man.

1387
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:14,164
I think there's like there's some,
some weird connection that we're all 

1388
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:18,370
sharing that's getting closer and 
closer.

1389
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:23,371
It's getting weirder and weirder.
People Getting Shittier and nicer at the

1390
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:27,560
same time it's happening.
There's a boiling point of.

1391
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,860
I think people are way nicer than they 
ever were before.

1392
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:34,480
You know what we use as an example?
The Bro Hug.

1393
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,453
People didn't bro Hug back in the day.
They shook hands when we were talking 

1394
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:42,430
about that new,
a standup show on showtime.

1395
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:46,240
I'm dying up here and uh,
one of the things Bill Burns said,

1396
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,350
he goes,
he goes,

1397
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:50,140
they got the handshake wrong.
He was talking about it last night.

1398
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:51,010
He's like,
he goes,

1399
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:52,180
they hugged,
he goes,

1400
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:53,950
nobody.
Nobody hugged back then he goes,

1401
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:56,230
they would do like a low five or 
something like that.

1402
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,320
And he's like,
I was like,

1403
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,770
you're right.
You're right.

1404
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,540
They didn't hug like that.
They still,

1405
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:02,843
they did like,
like the knuckle thing back them though 

1406
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,140
maybe been for sure it was still like a 
high five,

1407
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,430
high five.
It's silly.

1408
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,290
It's fun.
I like high fiving people.

1409
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,140
I always Miss People's high fives that I
feel like an idiot.

1410
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:14,974
Like I'm always

1411
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,230
high.
Five to me is like fun,

1412
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:19,820
like high fives,
fun,

1413
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:20,863
like a handshake.
You could just be just cordial and 

1414
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:25,340
friendly,
but this has got some fun to it.

1415
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,470
When's the last time you did a low five?
What's that?

1416
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,100
Man?
I can't even remember because you've got

1417
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,250
to get a low five back.
This problem with a low five.

1418
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,500
High fives.
Egalitarian.

1419
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,440
Everyone's equal.
It's just high five.

1420
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:37,970
Low five.
We have to decide.

1421
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,833
Well,
who was hitting who?

1422
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,320
You hit me and my head.
You know,

1423
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,173
you're gonna.
Hit me first and then I'm gonna hit you 

1424
01:08:41,811 --> 01:08:42,990
back.
How's this work?

1425
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,260
Okay,
you go first.

1426
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:44,990
Ready,
go.

1427
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,160
Slap.
Slap.

1428
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,880
Nobody does that anymore.
I'll slap.

1429
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,353
I haven't done that yet up because 
people figured out we don't have to do 

1430
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:54,350
this.
We can just do this is better.

1431
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,870
What's up?
Like I,

1432
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,920
I feel happy when I get people high 
fives.

1433
01:08:58,570 --> 01:08:59,470
I'm a knuckle guy,
man.

1434
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,000
Tim.
Except too much pink guy.

1435
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:01,870
Too much.
Too Much?

1436
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,120
Yeah.
You gotta wash your phone man.

1437
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:05,650
I was reading this thing about cell 
phones.

1438
01:09:05,651 --> 01:09:07,750
They were saying the dirty than half the
toilets of the world.

1439
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,670
Oh yeah.
Because he never wash your phone.

1440
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,230
You touch everything.
You like.

1441
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,970
God Wash your hands.
We're just touching her ass.

1442
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,210
Me.
Oh,

1443
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:15,100
you pick up your phone and you're 
checking your twitter,

1444
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:19,030
your mugs and all kinds of weird fucking
biomes.

1445
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:20,530
All of your screen.
I saw,

1446
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,364
you know,
like there's but whites where they had 

1447
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:25,030
like the little container where you pull
the wipes out.

1448
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:27,160
Like those things,
like you reuse them.

1449
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,143
Like if you to think about,
around the thing where you're grabbing 

1450
01:09:30,881 --> 01:09:32,080
it.
Like I need another one.

1451
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:33,820
I need another one.
I got some on my finger.

1452
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:36,640
I think you're right.
For sure that happens.

1453
01:09:36,641 --> 01:09:37,540
Yeah,
for sure.

1454
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,980
That happens if you mess up.
Yeah,

1455
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,160
I just used the packs.
I don't even use the boxing

1456
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:43,420
and you got to be careful with those 
things too because you don't want to get

1457
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:46,960
antibacterial wipes.
Like you don't want to use antibacterial

1458
01:09:46,961 --> 01:09:50,830
stuff on your body unless it's like 
natural stuff like that.

1459
01:09:50,831 --> 01:09:51,664
Um,
I used to do Jujitsu with this dude who 

1460
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:54,484
got ringworm and after he got ringworm 
he started putting antibacterial soap 

1461
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,970
all over his body,
but that killed all of his,

1462
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:05,380
his natural skin flora and then he got 
it everywhere.

1463
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,220
It was

1464
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:08,350
great.
How much did he use [inaudible]?

1465
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,120
I use that,

1466
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:13,310
the anti bacterial soap that like 
hardcore stuff.

1467
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:18,820
It looks amber and say this stuff,
they extract the insects DNA on Jurassic

1468
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,380
Park.
Um,

1469
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,540
that stuff like,
it stinks.

1470
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,520
It smells like chemicals on it.
Yeah.

1471
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,693
That's hand antibacterial soap.
And a lot of people like that would get 

1472
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:31,300
like ringworm or something like that.
They would use that on their whole body.

1473
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,670
But the problem with that stuff is it 
kills everything.

1474
01:10:33,671 --> 01:10:36,610
It kills all the stuff that's fighting 
off the ringworm to kills everything.

1475
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:37,843
Just nukes the territory.
And I use tea tree for all that shit is 

1476
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,430
the shit.
I just hate the smell.

1477
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:45,880
Eucalyptus lived soil.
There's a company called defense soap.

1478
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,440
Yeah.
I talk about them all the time.

1479
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:49,120
11,
not a sponsor,

1480
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:53,320
but the guy's awesome.
And his stuff is amazing for that.

1481
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:56,200
Like keeping healthy skin floor.
We just have to think of our bodies,

1482
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,220
whether it's your gut flora,
your skin floor,

1483
01:10:58,221 --> 01:10:59,054
all that stuff.
You got to think of your body as an 

1484
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,990
ecosystem,
you know,

1485
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,033
[inaudible]

1486
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:04,480
defense,
so it's really great.

1487
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,593
I use that all the time.
But do you ever use it for like a 

1488
01:11:09,251 --> 01:11:11,230
Jujitsu?
Is that what it's made for?

1489
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:12,070
It's made for.
Well,

1490
01:11:12,071 --> 01:11:13,980
he made it for grappling,
but

1491
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,430
it's great for just skin.
It just good for your skin.

1492
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:20,370
It's not chemical because they use it 
like as my soap.

1493
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,203
Okay,
cool.

1494
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,780
I didn't know if I was going to like for
you,

1495
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,370
so I'll bet for you at all.
It's good for your skin.

1496
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:27,204
That's the thing about it.
It's like it's not damaging the healthy 

1497
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:30,060
stuff.
There's no poisons.

1498
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:30,943
It's not like antibacterial soaps are.
A lot of times it's like really heavy 

1499
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,440
chemicals that are just stripping away 
everything.

1500
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,400
You know?
Bacteria lives on our skin in the lot of

1501
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:42,234
it is good.
Apparently that's staff's all over you 

1502
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:44,964
all the time.
Like when people get an infection and 

1503
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:47,314
it's a staph infection,
what it is is you get an open sore and 

1504
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:51,780
then your body through whatever,
for whatever reason,

1505
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,350
can't fight off that staff that's 
already there.

1506
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:58,320
There's now getting into your 
bloodstream and he'd get infected and it

1507
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:02,430
swells up and gets nasty,
and then there's that immersive staff,

1508
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:03,264
that staff that they get at hospitals 
because people have been taken 

1509
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,360
antibiotics for so long.

1510
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,350
They have medication resistant staph and
scares the fuck out of people.

1511
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:12,540
You have to be on like ivy drugs for 
weeks.

1512
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:16,860
Sometimes people are just wrecked,
wrecked by.

1513
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:19,350
It happens to a lot of fighters,
man.

1514
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,543
It's like the silent killer of fight 
careers is Murcia with that whole Kevin 

1515
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:26,683
Randleman.
Yeah.

1516
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,910
We don't know if that was mercy or just 
untreated staff.

1517
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:33,730
I don't know if it was Murcia or just 
regular staff work guy.

1518
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:36,450
Yeah.
Kevin had a.

1519
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,730
He had a bad.
I've seen a lot of guys have it bad.

1520
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:39,564
I've seen guys with holes.
It looks like somebody stabbed him in 

1521
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:43,350
the leg and it was just.
The body was,

1522
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,500
I think it's called an NEC reifying or 
something like that.

1523
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,930
Yeah.
When your neck.

1524
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:52,950
That's something word.
What is the word necrophilia?

1525
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:53,881
No.
Yeah,

1526
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:54,714
but it's um,
there's a word that when your skin 

1527
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:58,883
starts becoming dead in certain areas 
because of a lot of it's like widow 

1528
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:04,920
bites.
We'll do that.

1529
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,620
I'm a brown recluse bites.
We'll do that.

1530
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:09,120
Staph infection.
We'll do that too.

1531
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,233
Yeah.

1532
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,150
There's a lot of widows.
I forget the term,

1533
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,360
but it's some something Niekro does 
something to your skin.

1534
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,900
Just there's a lot of those fucking 
creepy little bugs that'll do that too,

1535
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:22,734
man.
Ever seen someone like what it looks 

1536
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:25,980
like when someone gets bitten by a brown
recluse.

1537
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:27,900
No.
Fuck Dude.

1538
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,210
If you get beaten,
if you don't take care of it,

1539
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:33,330
like really quickly,
it can go super bad.

1540
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:37,680
Like those things eat through your body.
We sleep in so many hotels and shit.

1541
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:40,150
Have you ever had bed bugs because 
that's like.

1542
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,030
I haven't,
but you could definitely get it.

1543
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:45,180
I feel like I get bug bites every time.
Holes.

1544
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:48,510
That's all from a brown recluse bite.
Yeah.

1545
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:50,880
Fuck.
Are those in La or California?

1546
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:52,523
No.
Um,

1547
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,450
yeah.
They have some of them in California,

1548
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:57,870
but I think they're more in the Midwest,
but they definitely have him here.

1549
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,100
Yeah,
look at that.

1550
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,530
Yeah,
mostly around there.

1551
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,573
So it's mostly,
it looks like some Texas and a lot of 

1552
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:10,640
the south.
It's fucking scary ass bug man.

1553
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:17,170
That's a scary 10 sharks found in the 
home's basement pool.

1554
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:22,500
What some guy in New York had 10 sharks 
that were in a 15 foot above ground pool

1555
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:23,944
in his basement.
Three of them were dead when they found 

1556
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,800
them.
Seven.

1557
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,873
We're still alive.
People crazy because he's out of his 

1558
01:14:31,451 --> 01:14:33,850
fucking mind.
Wow.

1559
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,650
Well,
he might have.

1560
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,230
Okay.
They were two feet to four feet long.

1561
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:40,210
Those are little sharks.
He might've been.

1562
01:14:40,211 --> 01:14:41,044
I'm trying to do some sort of a deal to 
put a fish tank in somebody's house and 

1563
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:46,804
he acquired these sharks for it or he's 
a nutty dude and he wanted to keep 

1564
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:53,410
sharks and sharks.
But here's the thing,

1565
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:55,330
like I knew people that had sharks in 
there,

1566
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:56,164
fish tanks,
like everyone's all gung Ho to save the 

1567
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:00,820
sharks.
Now that was not the case 10,

1568
01:15:00,821 --> 01:15:04,000
15 years ago when people had swimming 
pools or not swimming pools.

1569
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,640
Um,
fish tanks like crazy fish tanks.

1570
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,530
Sometimes people would have like little 
sharks.

1571
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,260
He used to have crazy fish.
Yeah.

1572
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:12,094
I used to have a paranas.
Allegedly this may or may not be true 

1573
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,180
for Amazon.
Exactly illegal.

1574
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:20,890
I might've found something at a friend's
house in bowling green one time.

1575
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,690
Yeah,
they're boring.

1576
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,300
Boring until it's go time.
And then you're like,

1577
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:27,460
Whoa,
I want to get like a,

1578
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,620
like a,
an octopus whatsoever.

1579
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,050
Like things that glow in that,
like the black lights,

1580
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:32,943
a jellyfish jellyfish.
I want to get like a jelly fish 

1581
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,410
aquarium.
Like you can I guess,

1582
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,313
get that with the light.
So it just looks like you have a ghost 

1583
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,960
in your corner of your house.
They die easy though,

1584
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:43,930
unfortunately.
Yeah.

1585
01:15:43,931 --> 01:15:46,780
I was talking to a scientist about it.
She was explaining that,

1586
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:49,100
um,
they have like a,

1587
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:50,440
Mandalay bay has this.

1588
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,340
You ever seen the thing where they have 
the Jelly Ooh,

1589
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:58,080
tank of jellyfish that you could buy 
little tiny jellyfish.

1590
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,170
The accord is,
but you can buy basically.

1591
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,930
And so,
um,

1592
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:05,140
but she was explaining that they have to
constantly,

1593
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:08,110
like shuffle them in.
They'll take out the dead ones,

1594
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:10,060
putting the new ones and they breed them
there.

1595
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,613
Wow.
Do you ever see the one they have at 

1596
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:13,091
Mandalay bay?
Dude,

1597
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:13,924
it's the shit.
It's like a circular one and it lights 

1598
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:19,330
up different colors.
Dude is beautiful.

1599
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,823
Look at these guys like Jelly fish.
They look too much like twins to be 

1600
01:16:26,141 --> 01:16:26,980
boyfriends.
Right?

1601
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,410
Right.
So creepy.

1602
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:34,570
Their boyfriends and they were that 
close to each other.

1603
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:35,404
That's,
that's a weird thing to have laying 

1604
01:16:36,101 --> 01:16:37,300
around.
What do they eat?

1605
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:40,300
Uh,
I think just algae.

1606
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,423
Oh,
so is this like a go fund me or some 

1607
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:45,000
shit?
Yeah.

1608
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:51,030
I think the one they had at Mandalay bay
was bad ass because it was this big like

1609
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:53,163
acrylic cylinder and they were all 
swimming around it and they changed the 

1610
01:16:56,231 --> 01:17:00,130
colors.
Like I think that'd be cool to have that

1611
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,330
they're alive,
man.

1612
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,600
I mean it's,
they're alive.

1613
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,920
But is that it?
Yeah,

1614
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:09,560
I,
I didn't.

1615
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,990
I don't remember them having.
Wow,

1616
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:17,960
that's the one in Mandalay bay.
I'm probably conflating it with one from

1617
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:20,180
one of the aquariums that I've been to,
but fuck,

1618
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,520
that's beautiful.
How pretty they are.

1619
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,060
Can you imagine doing mushrooms and just
looking at that shit.

1620
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,253
They're so pretty,
but it seems Kinda fucked to have them 

1621
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:34,061
trapped in a tube just swimming around.
They can't go anywhere.

1622
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:35,953
Like isn't part of the magic of being a 
jellyfish is the fact that you're a 

1623
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,154
jelly fish in the ocean and you just are
constantly moving through the ocean or 

1624
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,230
have we decided that the jelly fishes to
primitive for it to truly experience the

1625
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:55,070
majesty of the ocean and fuck him 
getting the tube and gamblers just gonna

1626
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,904
Stare at you.

1627
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,820
I mean that's essentially what we 
decided.

1628
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,810
Feed feed,
feed.

1629
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,290
They feed at least once a day is.
I went to the same baby brine shrimp,

1630
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,700
so like sea monkeys.
Eight.

1631
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,880
See My god,
they're so weird looking.

1632
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:13,190
You know what's interesting?
If we found,

1633
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:14,923
oh,
you have to have like a separate tank 

1634
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,690
for all that stuff.
It looks like you have two tanks.

1635
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,210
What is that?
That's the baby brine shrimp.

1636
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,540
Oh,
weird.

1637
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,750
That's how bizarre.
Oh,

1638
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:24,584
they're in this little sheets.
Snap into strain and you have to put it 

1639
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:30,020
in a base there and squeeze it in there 
or something.

1640
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,260
Whoa.
Weird.

1641
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:37,100
The size and number of jellies would 
determine how much to feed.

1642
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,900
Oh,
you have to be like really specific.

1643
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:42,630
Fuck feet and get some fat,
Jelly Fish.

1644
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,843
Die Dude.
Or they're going to get out into their 

1645
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:46,670
toilets and then.
Oh,

1646
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:47,510
look how they feed them.

1647
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,680
Man.
That's crazy.

1648
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,660
It's cool.
They just squirt it out there.

1649
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,420
I wonder if they came back in.
What was the out?

1650
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:56,000
Now I'm back in.
I'll figure it out.

1651
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:57,290
I'll just,
I'll do the right thing.

1652
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,040
I'll measure it.
I'm sure a dead jellyfish looks just the

1653
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,120
same.
You know,

1654
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:04,400
it's just not.
They're not moving enough though.

1655
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,440
You want to move and man,
look,

1656
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,340
look who's pouring in there?
Looking at them all.

1657
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,580
Heating.
That's crazy.

1658
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:11,960
They're,
they're actually reacting.

1659
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,530
Here's the thing,
like,

1660
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,743
they're so primitive.
We probably don't feel that bad when 

1661
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:19,010
they die.
Right?

1662
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,600
Like,
if a goldfish dies,

1663
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:21,600
you're like,
Oh,

1664
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,220
poor little dude.
Because eyeballs,

1665
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,780
eyeballs,
uh,

1666
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,220
their faces.
Right?

1667
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,740
Like people I've heard people say don't 
eat anything with a face,

1668
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:36,640
but they usually don't eat oysters.
Those people gotta eat oysters.

1669
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,060
I love oysters until you have bad 
oysters.

1670
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,970
Had some bad ways.

1671
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,770
There's the other day I definitely have 
before.

1672
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,240
That's the worst.
Yeah,

1673
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:45,680
I mean there's a possibility,
right?

1674
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:46,950
You're eating something wrong.
Yeah.

1675
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,073
Did you know,
there's so many different kinds of 

1676
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:50,024
oysters.
Like I never knew that there was like 

1677
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,810
tons of different kinds of oysters.
Yeah.

1678
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:56,090
I don't know a lot about them,
but uh,

1679
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,280
I do,
you know,

1680
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,330
if you go to a place they give you a 
variety,

1681
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,370
you get like a dozen year,
three of each.

1682
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:01,811
Like,
Whoa,

1683
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:05,780
look at these Kuma motos and there's a 
lot in the Pacific northwest.

1684
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:07,710
I know people like around the Seattle 
area,

1685
01:20:07,711 --> 01:20:08,420
they actually

1686
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:10,620
go out and get them and get clams and 
stuff like that.

1687
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:11,503
There's a certain kind that you're not 
supposed to eat anymore because of some 

1688
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:15,560
kind of pollution levels or something 
like that.

1689
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:16,970
Oh really?
Yeah.

1690
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:17,730
I don't know.

1691
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,563
Yeah,
they go clamming and the Pacific 

1692
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:22,080
northwest is pretty.
They get big ass clams to man.

1693
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:23,603
They go digging them right on the shore.
They just like bring a bucket and just 

1694
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:30,930
dig into the sand pot those fuckers out.
That's pretty bad ass.

1695
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:32,550
And go find some clams.

1696
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,180
Santa Barbara has the biggest oyster 
farm,

1697
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,880
like interact,
like it's,

1698
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:39,714
it's huge.
And it's usually like go out and have 

1699
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,890
these underground cages and they lift 
them up and.

1700
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:44,813
Oh Wow.
And you just pick them and eat them and 

1701
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,550
that's good enough.
Hm.

1702
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,220
Wonder how much they're affected by 
pollution.

1703
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:53,700
Think it's a lot.
What's up?

1704
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,640
Aren't they not like fully used for 
pollution,

1705
01:20:56,641 --> 01:21:00,120
but don't they clean the like a shit out
of the ground?

1706
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,300
Like the clean the water.
I thought that's what they're.

1707
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,260
They're kinda like the ocean filters.

1708
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,840
Hmm.
Well that's what lobsters are,

1709
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:08,220
right?
Lobsters and crabs.

1710
01:21:08,221 --> 01:21:10,710
They eat all the dead shit.
That's A.

1711
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,590
isn't it interesting that they're so God
damn delicious.

1712
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,710
All they eat is rotten shit all the 
time.

1713
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:19,890
It's weird.
Lobsters are so delicious.

1714
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:23,080
Like sometimes you forget,
sometimes you forget and you get a,

1715
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:27,420
like a Maine lobster when you dip them 
in butter and you're like,

1716
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:29,700
good God this is fucking delicious.

1717
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:30,703
Check this out.
Here's a timelapse of oysters filtering 

1718
01:21:34,551 --> 01:21:37,120
water.
Whoa.

1719
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:40,790
It's super dirty water here and then a 
couple hours go by.

1720
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:42,590
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1721
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:46,370
Did they just poop them out though?
The oysters bitch.

1722
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,240
Just throw a bunch of sand in that way.

1723
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,290
See what the fuck goes down.
Yeah.

1724
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,900
It seems like their filter in the 
waters.

1725
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,560
It's crazy.
There sense.

1726
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:57,700
Look,
nature has a plan for all.

1727
01:21:57,701 --> 01:22:01,960
It's a little weird things and I bet 
they have all sorts of.

1728
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:06,340
I mean you think about that.
We need plants for oxygen,

1729
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,253
right?
Plants actually create oxygen and we 

1730
01:22:09,401 --> 01:22:13,270
create carbon dioxide and plants live 
off carbon dioxide.

1731
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,723
It's weird how there's all these like 
little relationships that all these 

1732
01:22:18,611 --> 01:22:22,030
different beings have like back and 
forth all over,

1733
01:22:22,031 --> 01:22:22,864
all over nature.
So many of them in so somebody weird 

1734
01:22:25,421 --> 01:22:26,254
parasites and symbiotic relationships 
that animals have with each other to 

1735
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,710
fucking.
It's a dome,

1736
01:22:32,711 --> 01:22:34,660
Bro.
Flat to dome,

1737
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:35,860
so all simulation.

1738
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:37,403
I'm blown away.
I just got a dehumidifier the other day 

1739
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:43,890
yesterday and how much water you can 
pull out of your air like I've already.

1740
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's a 70 gallon drum or a tank and I've
already emptied it three times 70,

1741
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,540
70 pint.
70 pint,

1742
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:52,374
sorry.
Not counting 70 70 pint a gallon of 

1743
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:56,443
milk.
I know.

1744
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:01,820
Biggest 77 got swimming pools the fuck 
are you doing in your house man?

1745
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:06,250
But it's a pretty huge bucket of water 
and just like four that's just pulled

1746
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,870
out of my house.
That's crazy.

1747
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:08,470
Yeah.
No,

1748
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:13,000
it's just like from your body notes from
any aridity I see.

1749
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:14,680
I've been,
we've been using our air conditioning so

1750
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:18,110
much lately that mine started leaking 
everywhere if it.

1751
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:23,170
So it's making the house wet you.
It's making my floors fucked.

1752
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,360
So uh,
yeah.

1753
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,800
So I'm trying to suck all the water out 
of it.

1754
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:27,663
Everything.
So it just pulls it from the air and 

1755
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,950
humidity and stuff.
That's weird because La is pretty dry.

1756
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,390
Yeah.
But not lately.

1757
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,390
It's been pretty shitty.
Well it's not shitty.

1758
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:39,050
We need watermelon,
you know,

1759
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,000
if we,
we,

1760
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,970
we barely got away with what we got last
winter,

1761
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:43,983
you know,
they're kind of brought everything back 

1762
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,540
to pretty normal.
But like,

1763
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,650
like lake to hone to hone ranch still 
half full of water.

1764
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,990
That's what my,
uh,

1765
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:53,503
from my personal experience,
what I can see about how weird the 

1766
01:23:56,201 --> 01:23:57,034
drought was,
there was a lake that we used to drop 

1767
01:23:58,511 --> 01:24:00,940
people out of helicopters into a fear 
factor.

1768
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:04,390
And it went away.
Like the lake didn't exist anymore.

1769
01:24:04,391 --> 01:24:06,700
There was no lake.
All the fish died.

1770
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,290
All of them.
It was,

1771
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,330
there were huge fish in that lake.
Like big,

1772
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,790
large mouth bass.
There were all over the place.

1773
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:13,624
Man.
People would go from miles around to go 

1774
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:18,190
fish.
They're dead still dead today.

1775
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:19,600
Just nothing there.
Wow.

1776
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,970
So little bit of water now.
A little bit of water,

1777
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,133
like maybe like last time I was there 
I'd have to go see it again to get a 

1778
01:24:26,681 --> 01:24:28,570
good read on it.
But uh,

1779
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,550
the last time I talked to somebody who 
was there,

1780
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:32,140
it was like half full,
you know,

1781
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:34,180
it'd be interesting,
which means it's really shallow.

1782
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,940
If it gets rained and it comes back to 
life,

1783
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:38,163
if how long it would take for the first 
fish to find its way there due to 

1784
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:44,320
probably be a million years or a 
psychologist accidentally drops one in.

1785
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,190
The thing about these.
What does that cost tech?

1786
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:49,750
No,
that's like a steak.

1787
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,410
So Lik is take in 2017.
Looks pretty good.

1788
01:24:53,411 --> 01:24:55,270
It's back.
That's nice.

1789
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:56,523
Yeah.
That's another place where we used to 

1790
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:02,040
draw people out of helicopters that was 
talking about to Holland Lake though.

1791
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:05,440
And this is what came up and said,
well that's pretty close.

1792
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:07,540
It's on the way.
But uh,

1793
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:08,350
yeah,
that,

1794
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:13,350
that place has giant striped bass.
I saw the stuntman on fear factor.

1795
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:14,493
They would go fishing like in between 
stents that had like a lunch break and 

1796
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:18,694
these guys caught these like in like 20 
minutes caught these giant ass striped 

1797
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:23,380
bass.
That place is awesome.

1798
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,800
But that was half gone,
you know.

1799
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:26,643
So you got to see it with our own eyes,
like places like drying up and just 

1800
01:25:31,511 --> 01:25:32,344
because it caught it and it turned 
around because the weather changed 

1801
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,880
doesn't mean it can't happen instead of 
three,

1802
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:37,750
four years,
five,

1803
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:38,530
six years.

1804
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:41,260
How about 30 years?
Thirty years of no rain.

1805
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,940
Go Fuck Yourself.
That's.

1806
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,880
That can happen.
I think it's going to be the opposite.

1807
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:46,714
I think just how bad of a rain that we 
had last year and I think this winter I 

1808
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:55,540
think we're just going to get pounded I 
think and like all the Burbank mountains

1809
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:56,403
that with all the fires,
I think we're going to get flooded now 

1810
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:00,850
from all the mud,
mudslides that that's going to cause.

1811
01:26:00,851 --> 01:26:05,690
Because I think this end of the road 
shit's just continuing to go on.

1812
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:06,583
See?
I don't think it really is the end of 

1813
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:09,350
the world.
It's not even the end of us.

1814
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,393
It's just that what we thought was 
permanent was very fragile and that Fox 

1815
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:15,434
of their head,
but you just got to go into it knowing 

1816
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:21,350
that you can't think that those hills 
are going to stay up to slide.

1817
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,710
Those houses are going to slide,
you know,

1818
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:24,544
it's just like there's some fucking 
people that built their houses like 

1819
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:27,283
this,
like hanging off the side of a cliff 

1820
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,400
with like spikes into the side of the 
hill.

1821
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,380
You've seen those houses.
There's a lot of those,

1822
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:34,880
right?
Like on Laurel,

1823
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:35,930
you look,
look at that house.

1824
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:37,340
You Go,
where's that one going to go?

1825
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:38,743
That's going to slide down here.
Remember they shut down Laurel Canyon 

1826
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:43,220
like a few months back because one of 
the porches,

1827
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:45,380
back porch,
like 9,000

1828
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:48,260
fucking pounds slid down the hill,
all concrete and shit.

1829
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,900
And you know that's gonna Happen to the 
comedy store at one point.

1830
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:53,210
Like every time you're around behind it,
every time it rains,

1831
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:55,730
I'm scared to fuck to be that asked for 
that movie heat.

1832
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:58,070
But that house is preposterous.
Stupid.

1833
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,800
I'd hate to live in that.
Was that Robert Deniro movie heat.

1834
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:03,350
Wow.
What a crazy view they must have though.

1835
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,640
There's a lot of those houses,
man.

1836
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:05,840
Look at that.
That is.

1837
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:11,110
You have to be such an optimist.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1838
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:17,200
Like look at that fucking house.
Look at that thing up on giant ass metal

1839
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:19,220
poles.
Seems like such a pattern.

1840
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,450
Every night you hear some crazy homeless
man sawing at your pole.

1841
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:25,910
Oh my God.
You looked out.

1842
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:27,250
Get the fuck away from there,
man.

1843
01:27:27,251 --> 01:27:30,120
Man saw.
Nah,

1844
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:33,800
man,
I saw you go to bed.

1845
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:36,603
Check out this ad for him from 1969.
None of those are safest buildings as 

1846
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:42,240
far as landslides and earth tremors are 
concerned.

1847
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:45,350
Why none of those exist anymore.
Oh,

1848
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:46,223
let me read this.
The cliff dwellings amongst the safest 

1849
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:53,960
of all buildings as far as landslides 
and earth tremors are concerned,

1850
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:58,310
are supported by steel girders.
Planted deep in the ground.

1851
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:02,660
Anchor to heavy iron bells.
Far below the surface.

1852
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:05,680
Actually I gives me kind of excited.
I liked that.

1853
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,370
The engineer the shit out of it like 
that.

1854
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:08,953
That's actually.
I like when someone solves what seems 

1855
01:28:11,181 --> 01:28:11,860
like.
All right,

1856
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:13,250
I'm,
I'm on board now.

1857
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,503
I want us stilt house with metal bells.
So it's like your house is supported by 

1858
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:21,380
Kettlebells motherfucker.
Yeah.

1859
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:22,420
Until,
I don't know.

1860
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,920
They probably didn't have like a five 
point.

1861
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:25,754
Oh earthquake.
They were probably like at least a good 

1862
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,840
for like the strongest earthquakes at 
three point four,

1863
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,090
but it'd be good for all earthquakes.
You don't know shit,

1864
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:32,924
Bro.
I bet none of these houses exist 

1865
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:34,874
anymore.
It was one in the upper right hand 

1866
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:38,084
corner.
That's like one of my favorite pictures 

1867
01:28:38,901 --> 01:28:41,750
is scroll up past this spaceship 
spaceship house.

1868
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:44,660
I love that.
That house is the shit.

1869
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,470
I don't know who owns that house with.
That is the fucking coolest house of all

1870
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:50,620
time.
I think it was just sold recently.

1871
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:52,913
I would never want to live there.
That seems like the perfect house for 

1872
01:28:55,731 --> 01:28:57,050
you though.
It's too freaky.

1873
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,720
I would go deep.
I need to stay calm.

1874
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,560
Like if I lived in a spaceship,

1875
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,450
I don't trust myself.
I was just,

1876
01:29:06,451 --> 01:29:07,284
uh,
I just got to go to Ron White's house 

1877
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:10,620
recently.
It's a nice house.

1878
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,180
Yeah.
You Know Ron's story.

1879
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:13,320
What happened?
Yeah.

1880
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,900
Who went out of town,
came back and he.

1881
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:20,730
There was a leak on the first floor and 
it flooded well on the top floor,

1882
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:21,564
the third floor rather.
And it flooded down to the second and 

1883
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:24,750
the first four filling all of them up 
with water.

1884
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,780
That's unfortunate.
And he just had it finished now.

1885
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,310
Fuck.
Yeah.

1886
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,363
But it's cool.
He has a recording studio in there and 

1887
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:34,280
like a bar.
It's like a pimp house.

1888
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:35,970
Sure it is.
Ron White's that shit.

1889
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:37,440
Bad Ass.
I love that guy.

1890
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:42,000
He was just in Austin doing a benefit 
show with Eliza and Leah and they raised

1891
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,880
like $250,000
in just one show.

1892
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,150
Yeah.
That's awesome man.

1893
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,730
That's awesome.
I heard about that.

1894
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:49,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

1895
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:52,180
Ron White's fucking fantastic.
I love that man.

1896
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,570
He's beautiful.
He's an animal.

1897
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,753
You know.
You were you ever hear of a APP called 

1898
01:29:57,931 --> 01:30:00,450
next door or next door?
Next door.

1899
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,270
It's one of the greatest things ever.
It's a,

1900
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,910
it's like Reddit for your neighborhood.
Oh No.

1901
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:10,950
So it's pretty much you log in and you 
have to live in this neighborhood or you

1902
01:30:10,951 --> 01:30:12,750
can't get in.
It's pretty much kind of thing.

1903
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:14,123
And it's like,
it's cool because there's little things 

1904
01:30:16,051 --> 01:30:16,561
like,
hey,

1905
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:17,394
I got this,
you know,

1906
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,640
dresser,
if anyone wants it or you know,

1907
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,990
things like that.
But it's also like,

1908
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:22,883
Hey,
I saw a black guy the other day and the 

1909
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:26,640
neighbor psycho,
Tony Hinchcliffe bit.

1910
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,070
Which one?
The mass text bit.

1911
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:29,731
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1912
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:30,181
yeah,
yeah,

1913
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:30,751
yeah.
It's like that.

1914
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:31,584
Don't say anymore.
Yeah.

1915
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:32,443
I don't want to give away a bit,
but it's the most addicting thing ever 

1916
01:30:34,741 --> 01:30:34,920
in.

1917
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,753
It's very helpful,
like if you have a lost pet or a cat or 

1918
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:39,263
a.
But it's one of my favorite things to 

1919
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:42,390
read now I just go home.
I'm giddy about it.

1920
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:42,871
Like,
oh,

1921
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:43,704
what's going on?
But we do have an interface that allows 

1922
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:48,270
you to communicate with people,
like straight to your head.

1923
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:51,570
How,
how quickly do you think you'd adopt it?

1924
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:55,590
How quickly do you think you'd try it?
I guess if you could turn it off,

1925
01:30:55,591 --> 01:30:57,620
I would try it pretty close.
Right?

1926
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:59,190
Why do you trust the government?
Man?

1927
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,990
Times,
man.

1928
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,550
Yeah.
I'm worried about my car right now being

1929
01:31:05,551 --> 01:31:06,384
hacked,
you know,

1930
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:08,640
it's too little,
too much.

1931
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:11,610
Like I don't even have a emergency brake
anymore.

1932
01:31:11,611 --> 01:31:14,340
I have a button that says I know.
I'm like,

1933
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:16,200
no,
I want to pull it up.

1934
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,670
Emergency.
I don't want to push it.

1935
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:20,280
I like old cars for that.

1936
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,173
Yeah.
Like I like a car that has the fucking 

1937
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,300
brakes,
baby.

1938
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:25,690
Yeah.
Right,

1939
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,593
right.
Those are the ones you want to with the 

1940
01:31:27,451 --> 01:31:29,370
button on the top.
You don't want to stomp,

1941
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,263
break.
That's for assholes because you can't 

1942
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:32,574
even control it.
You've got to like stomp it and pull it 

1943
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:37,270
back up and like you don't have like a.
You can.

1944
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:42,270
You can actually control the outbreak 
with the lever a little bit.

1945
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:44,190
You can get yourself to go sideways with
that thing.

1946
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:48,480
My car has a bug lot of it probably.
Yeah,

1947
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:51,120
they probably don't have it filled.
My car is a bug though.

1948
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:51,983
If like you plug in your iphone before 
like too early and you don't hit the 

1949
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:58,270
button that says,
you know,

1950
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,600
agree to like the maps or whatever.
Yeah.

1951
01:32:00,601 --> 01:32:01,131
It's like,
hey,

1952
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:01,964
it's okay if that goes away.
And then like if you have your air 

1953
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:07,270
conditioning on and other things,
you can't turn them off.

1954
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:09,940
So like the other day my stereo was like
on full blast.

1955
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:10,774
My air conditioning is on full blast and
I was trying to turn it all off while 

1956
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:16,690
driving and it couldn't.
This was your Honda?

1957
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:17,573
Yeah,
yeah,

1958
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:22,280
it's got apple home or air or car car,
police,

1959
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:23,123
car.
But if you disconnected your phone when 

1960
01:32:24,371 --> 01:32:25,540
it stopped,
that's how I did it.

1961
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:26,374
But I.
At first I couldn't figure out what was 

1962
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:29,710
going on.
I've never heard of that before.

1963
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:31,030
Yeah,
it's kind of happened.

1964
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,830
Yeah.
That's a dope car though.

1965
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:33,851
I like it,
man.

1966
01:32:33,851 --> 01:32:35,220
It's cool.
It's a,

1967
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,390
it's a technological tour.
De Force.

1968
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:40,720
I could hook up androids or it has like 
android play on it.

1969
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:42,970
Also new.
Most of them didn't have it,

1970
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:43,804
which is kind of fucked.
I couldn't believe that they were 

1971
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:46,024
getting away with going with apple 
carplay only because there's a lot of 

1972
01:32:48,371 --> 01:32:51,130
people that would buy like Chevy's and 
GM cars,

1973
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:54,410
like cadillacs in particular,
they have that apple carplay.

1974
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:58,030
Porsches have that apple carplay.
I like it though the texting.

1975
01:32:58,210 --> 01:32:59,043
Definitely,
I never text while driving anymore 

1976
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:02,500
because now I just tell Siri to,
hey,

1977
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:03,490
text joe,
hey,

1978
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,860
what's up?
Oh,

1979
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:06,190
you can do that with both hands on the 
wheel.

1980
01:33:06,191 --> 01:33:07,024
It's awesome.
Yeah.

1981
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,440
Yeah,
I like it.

1982
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,900
I'm a fan.
I'm a fan of those,

1983
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:11,734
uh,
the,

1984
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:14,460
some of the new Japanese cars to a man 
that,

1985
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:17,780
some of that technology that's coming 
over with [inaudible].

1986
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:21,370
They got some incredible shit.
They just put out this new lexus,

1987
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:22,443
the Lexus Lc.
Five hundred CV could find Lexus lc 500 

1988
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:32,460
in atomic silver.
They're making future cars like,

1989
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:33,484
you know,
remember when you were a kid and he 

1990
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:36,040
thought about cars in the future.
Like what they would look like.

1991
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,910
This car looks like a future car GC.
The first flying car.

1992
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,900
I saw it yesterday on the news.
Uh,

1993
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:44,500
I don't know if it was.

1994
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,560
I think it was real.
Yeah.

1995
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:50,080
I don't know if it's real,
but it looks like.

1996
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,360
I'm sure that will be something.
Look at that thing.

1997
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:55,210
We'll look at that car.
Beautiful.

1998
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,850
That's a spaceship.
Look at that thing.

1999
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:59,213
I mean that looks like some Sylvester 
stallone movie from Nineteen Ninety 

2000
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:03,730
Eight.
You know the year 20,

2001
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:04,900
60,
20.

2002
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,120
Yeah.
Especially in atomic silver.

2003
01:34:07,121 --> 01:34:10,510
There's something about that silver 
color that looks that's a rendering,

2004
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:15,820
but that's a ridiculous looking car.
Cars are so sexy nowadays.

2005
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:18,310
I really liked them.
Well they can do so much now.

2006
01:34:18,311 --> 01:34:21,040
They break for you.
They recognize objects in the side.

2007
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:23,050
They give you warnings.
Yeah.

2008
01:34:23,051 --> 01:34:23,884
Mine has the lane departure,
so like if I'm texting and not paying 

2009
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:29,710
attention and I go out of my lane,
it pushes you back in.

2010
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,790
Or if somebody stops in front of you,
slams on the brakes.

2011
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,810
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

2012
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:35,644
Which that kind of freaks me out because
what if there isn't something there and 

2013
01:34:38,111 --> 01:34:40,570
it just malfunctions and slammed on my 
brakes,

2014
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:42,970
know?
Well it probably can happen.

2015
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:47,200
I mean anything that's automated can 
fuck up.

2016
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:49,600
Just like a person fucks up.
Is this the flying car?

2017
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:52,750
It's called the what?
The lilium jet jet.

2018
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:56,290
We believe in a world in which everyone 
can fly anywhere.

2019
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:57,710
Anytime.
Oh Jesus.

2020
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:58,550
Anywhere.

2021
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,920
Like what about Hawaii Bitch without a 
terrible joke.

2022
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:04,130
But you're going to fly across the 
country and I don't trust that guy.

2023
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,350
Looks a little wacky.
So he's on adderall.

2024
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:10,190
Sell me a dream.
The vision becomes a reality.

2025
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:15,020
Now this is like the beginning of a 
science fiction movie.

2026
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:16,093
Fuck you doing.
Are you bringing in an organism from 

2027
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:19,124
space?

2028
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:21,600
So this is real.
Is it real?

2029
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:25,170
This is the first test flight.
It says it's probably slow as fuck.

2030
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:29,490
Like a balloon just floats through the 
air.

2031
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,710
It might the onion.

2032
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:47,180
Why do I.
It doesn't seem real to questionable.

2033
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,153
Three hundred kilometers an hour.
So what did we decide that is somewhere 

2034
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:53,270
around 150,
150.

2035
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,013
It's all about

2036
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,250
that guy takes too much ecstasy.
I don't trust him.

2037
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,890
It's got that look in his eyes.
You know that?

2038
01:36:01,891 --> 01:36:02,724
Look when a guy's done a lot of extra,
see it doesn't look like he's just 

2039
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:06,480
shooting party.
He doesn't look real.

2040
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:09,120
That's shadows.
The thing looks today,

2041
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,330
Jamie Goodman the comments.
Look in the comments,

2042
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,370
not a man dreams.
Some bitch.

2043
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:16,110
Fairly fake.
Half the comment section.

2044
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,380
Oh goddammit,

2045
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,210
you sons of bitches.
But does it squeeze cheese?

2046
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:23,600
Recent article about,
uh,

2047
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:28,630
what they were calling a Russian troll 
farm that they have a troll farm,

2048
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,880
like make a business out of trolling.

2049
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:36,040
I met someone recently that his,
he worked at a meme factory.

2050
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:39,790
What?
I didn't really ask a lot more questions

2051
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:42,970
about that because I just assumed it was
like someone working for that fuck jerry

2052
01:36:42,971 --> 01:36:47,170
account where there's like four or five 
guys that all work together to just talk

2053
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:48,073
about memes all day.
But he literally was working downtown 

2054
01:36:50,411 --> 01:36:53,970
somewhere in his job description was 
whatever at a meme.

2055
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,330
Factories.
That's kind of hilarious.

2056
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,700
Yeah.
Cool job.

2057
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,870
You know,
by the way,

2058
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:02,410
mad props to some people that actually 
use the internet.

2059
01:37:02,411 --> 01:37:04,900
Like when the guy that writes for 
Wendy's twitter,

2060
01:37:04,901 --> 01:37:09,190
I don't know if you've been following.
This is some of the funniest shit ever.

2061
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:12,010
Whoever Bravo,
you were the king of twitter.

2062
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:14,860
But like people like talking shit on 
Wendy's,

2063
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:19,210
he'll come back with like some of the 
best comic timing ever.

2064
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:24,390
Wendy's owned a twitter troll so hard.
They deactivated their account.

2065
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,850
So that's the first one.
Our beef is a

2066
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,110
right is your beef is frozen.
We all know it.

2067
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:35,050
Y'All know we laugh at your slogan 
fresh,

2068
01:37:35,051 --> 01:37:36,250
never frozen,
right?

2069
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:38,470
Like you're really a joke.
Wendy says,

2070
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:40,990
sorry to hear you think that,
but you're wrong.

2071
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:45,190
We've only ever used fresh beef since we
were founded in 1969.

2072
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,133
The other guy says,
so you deliver it bra on a hot truck 

2073
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:50,383
says,
where do you store cold things that 

2074
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:53,650
aren't frozen?
Wow,

2075
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,633
y'all should give up.
Mcdonald's got you guys beat with the 

2076
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:00,050
dope ass breakfast,
and then he said,

2077
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:00,953
Wendy says you don't have to bring them 
into us just because you forgot 

2078
01:38:03,871 --> 01:38:08,871
refrigerators existed for a second and 
it do this for a couple of strong.

2079
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,740
That's really strong because they didn't
even lose their temper.

2080
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:16,050
Like that's kind of funny.
Oh,

2081
01:38:16,051 --> 01:38:16,884
and they handled that really well.
Wendy's has been doing this for about a 

2082
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:21,870
year now.
Just nonstop.

2083
01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:24,000
Wilson.
I don't like to get burgers on the road.

2084
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:27,300
I don't like to get fast food,
but if I do,

2085
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,433
that's the one I go to Wendy's all day 
unless there's an in and out nearby and 

2086
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,780
I've got extra time,
extra time.

2087
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,673
Wendy's,
we'll give it to you in a shocking they 

2088
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:38,190
quick amount of time,
like how is that even possible?

2089
01:38:38,191 --> 01:38:39,024
It's actually hot.
Like what do you just anticipating 

2090
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:43,410
selling a certain amount of double 
cheeseburgers.

2091
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:46,620
Whitney's Burbank is also that when the 
future stores,

2092
01:38:46,621 --> 01:38:47,454
they're testing where you walk in and 
you order off this huge ipad like wall 

2093
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:53,063
and and then your food comes and it's 
like you don't have to even talk to 

2094
01:38:56,821 --> 01:38:58,090
anybody anymore.
Yeah.

2095
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,310
There's a lot of those now,
right?

2096
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,313
Yeah.
Well the other thing Wendy's does is 

2097
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:05,640
they let you be a total fucking slob in 
order.

2098
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:08,340
A three,
a triple cheeseburger.

2099
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,050
They have it like right there on the 
menu.

2100
01:39:10,051 --> 01:39:12,630
It doesn't even look crazy.
Like when I go to in and out,

2101
01:39:12,631 --> 01:39:14,760
I'll order a three by three.
I feel like an asshole,

2102
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:18,180
but with Wendy's it's like it's right 
there in and out.

2103
01:39:18,181 --> 01:39:21,540
I'm asking for some shit that doesn't 
even exist on their menu supposedly.

2104
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:23,430
That looks good.
Look at that.

2105
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,540
Dave's hot and juicy.
A three quarter triple you motherfucker.

2106
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:28,710
Whenever I eat one of those,
I'm like,

2107
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:31,740
this is such a preposterous sandwich.
At Fat Burger.

2108
01:39:31,741 --> 01:39:32,574
They have all the pictures on the wall 
of everyone that's finished the giant 

2109
01:39:34,801 --> 01:39:35,710
fucking trip.
Right.

2110
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,350
So great.
It's such a big thing.

2111
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:39,150
It's as big as people's heads.
It's giant.

2112
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,343
It's like speaking a giant.
Did you see that fucking guy that had a 

2113
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:48,510
bladder stone that was the size of an 
ostrich egg and he get it.

2114
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:51,720
He had to get it removed from his body 
was sued.

2115
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,910
That is the craziest thing I've seen in 
my life.

2116
01:39:53,911 --> 01:39:54,744
Like this guy had a rock inside of his 
body that his own body made look at the 

2117
01:39:59,431 --> 01:40:02,310
size of that thing,
so we get the guy having it in his hand.

2118
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,780
So what does that mean?
That all right.

2119
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:07,770
What is in your question?
That's a good question.

2120
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:10,280
I think that's what it is,
but she tasted it.

2121
01:40:10,281 --> 01:40:11,740
No God.
The hey is.

2122
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:14,310
What do you think it would taste like?
Salt it salt?

2123
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:15,383
Yeah.
Why is that any weirder than licking 

2124
01:40:15,951 --> 01:40:16,784
salt that came out of the ground?
Take that you grind it up and put it 

2125
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:19,740
under state.
Nobody cares.

2126
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,210
I would lick my own stone.
Somebody else's.

2127
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:26,800
Find out ct scans of the man's abdomen 
also revealed another much smaller stone

2128
01:40:26,801 --> 01:40:31,620
in the man's left ureter,
which is the tube that carries the urine

2129
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:32,454
from the kidneys to the bladder 
according to the report which is 

2130
01:40:34,891 --> 01:40:35,940
published today,
blah,

2131
01:40:35,941 --> 01:40:36,774
blah,
blah.

2132
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,840
The doctors treated them and noted that 
he had invasive bladder cancer more than

2133
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:44,640
a decade before he developed the stones.
Well,

2134
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,980
wonder how long it took them to make 
these stones.

2135
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:50,940
Woo.
Imagine if they just keep making them.

2136
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:54,070
You have to make up fucking.
They have to build a door into

2137
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,903
his body where they could reach in once 
a month and pull out an ostrich egg 

2138
01:40:57,131 --> 01:41:00,280
sized rock.
Like how often does it,

2139
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:02,020
one of those things cook up inside your 
body.

2140
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:03,010
It's got a years,
Huh?

2141
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:05,163
That's an issue with not that in 
particular with kidney stones or an 

2142
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:10,630
issue with a fight or sometimes a cut,
a lot of weight.

2143
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,550
It becomes a,
uh,

2144
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,250
uh,
unwanted side effect,

2145
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,500
real bad to men.
Kidney stones are brutal.

2146
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:21,100
A lot of guys have canceled flights 
because of kidney stones and actually,

2147
01:41:21,101 --> 01:41:21,934
no,
I've never had them.

2148
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:25,570
I'm Matt Metro and actually had them 
before,

2149
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:27,340
uh,
his fate or fight and they had to cancel

2150
01:41:27,341 --> 01:41:29,830
the first time they were supposed to 
meet because kidney stones,

2151
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,690
super competent,
Matzoh heavyweight,

2152
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:32,524
which is even weirder because 
heavyweights don't have to drive 

2153
01:41:33,971 --> 01:41:37,600
themselves out,
but somehow some people just genetically

2154
01:41:37,601 --> 01:41:40,000
are predisposed to getting them and then
somebody gets him.

2155
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:41,163
That's when you tap it out.
She gets it like maybe every six months 

2156
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:46,660
she has god.
That's horrible.

2157
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,160
Yeah.
Fuck man.

2158
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,570
I wonder if it's like a diet thing.
I think it's a little bit of that.

2159
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:57,100
I think it's also just some people just 
know get 'em all the time.

2160
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:59,950
It's also like the Diet thing,
just so not fair.

2161
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:02,070
Some people could just scarf,
you know,

2162
01:42:02,071 --> 01:42:04,100
they could just chow down pizza and 
check.

2163
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:08,680
They do it right in front of everybody 
and they look like Tb.

2164
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:12,160
You know,
they never gained any with his clay.

2165
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:13,001
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2166
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:15,370
Well don't eat pizza every day.
He works out a lot though.

2167
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:17,560
It just does work out a lot,
a lot.

2168
01:42:18,790 --> 01:42:22,240
Go to my good amounts of good in front 
of the other night.

2169
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:24,641
My arm.
He's like,

2170
01:42:24,641 --> 01:42:26,030
what are you doing to take something 
else?

2171
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,640
Like I know I'm not.

2172
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:30,700
I go to the gym three times a week.
Tony Heart.

2173
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:33,280
How many times a week you think Tony's 
going to the gym?

2174
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:37,420
He's worked out with me before.
I think he's just.

2175
01:42:37,421 --> 01:42:38,254
It's worked out in the same areas.
Mistake on the treadmill versus kettle 

2176
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:41,920
bells.
Did some weights,

2177
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,360
lifted some weights once.
He's pretty ripped.

2178
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,750
He lifts weights.
I think he does a little weight lifting.

2179
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:49,990
He's shockingly ripped.
Find to have a contest.

2180
01:42:49,991 --> 01:42:50,840
She.
Jamie,

2181
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:53,470
I think Jamie works out way more than 
Tony.

2182
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,390
Tony has.
Tony incident might be like.

2183
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:56,403
I'll take you up on your context.
Young Jamie might have to get another 

2184
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:01,684
one.
Yeah.

2185
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:04,190
We still have to figure out what we're 
going to do with this other lady.

2186
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:05,710
Goes already.
Went Back to New York.

2187
01:43:05,711 --> 01:43:07,120
We got nowhere with that.
I fucking.

2188
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:08,950
Yeah,
we barely did.

2189
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:11,830
They wanted to wrap it up.
We're going to finish this.

2190
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,270
What is it?
Well,

2191
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:18,300
we came to one idea which was a a 
contest gene Sigora burt,

2192
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,930
Ari and me that for the for 30 days of 
October.

2193
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,260
No booze and you have to do 15 yoga 
classes.

2194
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,370
We all agreed on that one.
15 hot yoga classes,

2195
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:31,060
90 minute classes,
but no breaks.

2196
01:43:31,061 --> 01:43:32,310
Right?
Or something like no breaks.

2197
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:34,030
Alright.
He wants to take breaks like a bitch.

2198
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:35,573
I was going to lose anyway.
I feel like that's one of the reasons 

2199
01:43:37,421 --> 01:43:37,961
why we say,
well,

2200
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:41,610
what about a broad.
I'm going to take a photo to go with pig

2201
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:43,240
pig.
I'm a Jew.

2202
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:45,580
Jews need to pick.
Everybody said that I go right here.

2203
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,310
That didn't make sense.
He peed twice during the show.

2204
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,980
He pulls his dick out and pisses into a 
Kombucha jar.

2205
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:53,110
What?
He's he doing that shit a lot.

2206
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,720
A lot of this is wild man.

2207
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:58,030
He lives in the jungle for months.
He lived with a,

2208
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,250
you know,
like natives and shit.

2209
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,860
Yeah,
he's out there in the forest.

2210
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:03,350
He's crazy.
But um,

2211
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:06,710
so he's basically backing out.
He's like a kid drew a kid,

2212
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,000
started living out of suitcase.
I'm like,

2213
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:10,490
bitch,
you were in Asia for four months,

2214
01:44:10,491 --> 01:44:12,650
living out of a backpack,
sleeping in hostels.

2215
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:15,290
Now all of a sudden you're back.
You got to taste the good life.

2216
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,840
Didn't he also bet already walking 
around naked?

2217
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,190
Why is he walking around naked?
They went to the desert last night.

2218
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,600
Oh,
they do mushrooms.

2219
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:26,270
Yeah.
So ours just wandering around.

2220
01:44:26,271 --> 01:44:27,860
Jesus Christ.
That makes sense.

2221
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:32,510
There's a place next to me,
has a new kind of yoga used to try out.

2222
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:33,630
I want to try it out.
Uh,

2223
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:34,483
it's outdoors.
It's a baby goat yoga and it's pretty 

2224
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:38,654
much you do all this yoga and then 
there's this baby goats that will climb 

2225
01:44:41,571 --> 01:44:44,270
on you while you're doing it and run 
around and stuff like that.

2226
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:46,250
Oh,
this is supposed to like the baby goats.

2227
01:44:46,251 --> 01:44:47,084
Like,
feel good.

2228
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,080
It make love kids.
Yeah.

2229
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,863
And it's hilarious right next to my 
house I needed to do that is fucking 

2230
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:58,500
hilarious.
So they let these goats,

2231
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,830
they were literally shit in your face 
while you're down there.

2232
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:01,843
They don't do that.
So these people are doing their yoga 

2233
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,980
while they're doing yoga.
They have to do it around these goats.

2234
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,270
Goats just climbing up.
The guy's probably like,

2235
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:15,530
I don't know why I decided to up for 
this to go.

2236
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:17,900
So fucking incredible balance,
man.

2237
01:45:17,901 --> 01:45:21,050
Like from the box,
like right out of snatch.

2238
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:24,400
They can climb a tree.
Now you should have baby goats.

2239
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:25,310
I think.
Why not?

2240
01:45:25,311 --> 01:45:26,670
Why not?
I had a friend who had goats.

2241
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:30,140
I had a friend who got goats because he 
has a big piece of land in Topanga.

2242
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:33,110
And uh,
the goats ate everything.

2243
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,030
They don't stop eating,
man.

2244
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:36,770
They don't just eat the hay either.
They're like,

2245
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:39,110
fuck your head.
And they just start wandering through.

2246
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:39,944
You look at the goat climate treatment.
How does that happen to fucking palm 

2247
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:45,560
tree?
They just can do.

2248
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:46,910
That's the crazy.
How's it going?

2249
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:48,380
And get down.
They calm down,

2250
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:49,970
dude.
Yes.

2251
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:53,780
I am so amazed by baby goats.
I want one so bad.

2252
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:54,920
Yeah.

2253
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:58,010
These things are crazy.
Did it fall out here?

2254
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:00,580
Didn't receive videos that eagles coming
in.

2255
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:02,210
Super Nice.
But that's different.

2256
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,280
They grabbed me.
They definitely fall.

2257
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:08,330
They have fallen in the past.
They definitely fall and animals.

2258
01:46:08,331 --> 01:46:10,640
Uh,
sometimes like bears in particular,

2259
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:14,540
if you see a bear,
I'm eating a mountain goat.

2260
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:19,600
A lot of times it's because the mountain
gold fell like bears most of the time or

2261
01:46:20,811 --> 01:46:21,644
not catching mountain goats.
That's one of the reasons why they have 

2262
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:25,213
adapted to live in these crazy 
environments is because predators can't 

2263
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:29,840
get to them.
They're like,

2264
01:46:29,870 --> 01:46:32,180
this is what they've done.
They figured out a way to exist.

2265
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:34,300
Yeah.
Like how keep that thing there,

2266
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:35,840
man,
hold on Jesus Christ.

2267
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:39,830
I want to see what the fuck happens,
but look at what it's doing.

2268
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:41,540
Like trying to figure out how to turn 
around.

2269
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:42,523
I mean it is on the side of a cliff and 
also it knows not to do anything stupid 

2270
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,200
and it's not freaking out.

2271
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:51,253
It's amazing.
It's almost like the brains don't have 

2272
01:46:52,801 --> 01:46:54,720
the ability to look at that.
Oh my God.

2273
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,910
Oh my God.
I'm freaking out.

2274
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:02,130
Like the way those things can catch 
themselves and the way I can walk on the

2275
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:03,820
side.
Oh Christ.

2276
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:07,080
Oh my God.
And they're not scared of heights at all

2277
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,220
at all.
Like they don't have that in them.

2278
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:11,910
He's young too.
That one looks young.

2279
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:15,390
You know?
I think that what you saw like that slip

2280
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:16,224
right there,
that could definitely slipped to it's 

2281
01:47:17,251 --> 01:47:18,660
death.
It definitely could.

2282
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:21,830
It must happen every now and then.
Somebody.

2283
01:47:21,831 --> 01:47:22,664
I attached a Gopro to an eagle recently 
and they live streamed it on periscope 

2284
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:30,210
and it was one of the most fascinating 
things.

2285
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:33,140
Just seeing an eagle fly around and look
like,

2286
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:34,523
look to the right and see like a little 
dot moves and so then we'll get closer 

2287
01:47:37,051 --> 01:47:37,850
and then.

2288
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:41,430
And it was a cool camera view,
so I don't know if it's on youtube now,

2289
01:47:41,431 --> 01:47:45,510
but very interesting to watch.
That is crazy that you can do that now,

2290
01:47:45,511 --> 01:47:46,344
right?
To a camera on an eagle and see things 

2291
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:51,300
from his perspective.
Did you ever see that photo?

2292
01:47:51,301 --> 01:47:52,134
A series of photos where a mountain lion
tried to kill a goat and they both fell 

2293
01:47:57,601 --> 01:47:59,250
to their death?
Yeah.

2294
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,260
A mountain.
A mountain goat.

2295
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,950
Was it a mountain goat or was it a sheep
made a mountain sheep.

2296
01:48:04,951 --> 01:48:07,380
I think it was a big horn sheep.
It was like,

2297
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,473
yeah,
it was like a mountain lion and the big 

2298
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:13,080
horn sheep and they were both splattered
on the fucking highway.

2299
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,220
It's,
uh,

2300
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,760
it's amazing though.
It's an amazing series of images.

2301
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:19,770
Like,
I mean,

2302
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:22,200
I'm not a cruel person.
This is not me being cruel,

2303
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:23,034
but I think there's something beautiful 
about that and this is what I think is 

2304
01:48:25,441 --> 01:48:26,274
beautiful about that.

2305
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:29,560
Go to like fullscreen with that thing.
Full series.

2306
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,093
Just go it.
I printed that one picture that you had 

2307
01:48:31,971 --> 01:48:33,630
up.
Sorry.

2308
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:38,030
Go look at that.
I mean,

2309
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,950
they're both gone.
They're both next to a cliff.

2310
01:48:42,970 --> 01:48:44,540
And the only way this happens,
right?

2311
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:51,340
You see the horn off to the left that 
says other horn off.

2312
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:53,840
No,
I blew off.

2313
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:58,550
I mean,
they probably felt a long way.

2314
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:01,670
Go to the series now.
That's a,

2315
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:07,220
it's what's crazy about it.
It represents how hard that life is.

2316
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:08,481
Like,
look,

2317
01:49:08,481 --> 01:49:12,500
it's just blood's pouring out of his 
head sets nuts.

2318
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:14,750
That is nuts,
man.

2319
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:17,900
Where the,
where the horn blew off.

2320
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:22,120
Holy Shit.
God Damn Dude.

2321
01:49:22,121 --> 01:49:23,840
Look at that mountain lion tree to,
to,

2322
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:28,860
to tweak.
It's got a mouthful of furrowed brow.

2323
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:32,620
Never let go.
That is so powerful.

2324
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:35,720
Oh,
that is so powerful.

2325
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:38,360
It probably had it in its mouth.
As they went down.

2326
01:49:38,361 --> 01:49:40,780
They both went down together.
Dude,

2327
01:49:40,781 --> 01:49:44,230
this is a daddy is a goddamn powerful 
series of images.

2328
01:49:44,231 --> 01:49:46,330
Look at that backup and see the height 
of that cliff.

2329
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:51,690
Holy Dick.
Banga surprise.

2330
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:57,280
He didn't land on his feet.
He probably held on that goat the entire

2331
01:49:57,281 --> 01:49:58,840
way down.
That's a fucking murderer.

2332
01:49:59,490 --> 01:50:01,600
It fell from somewhere up there.
Jesus.

2333
01:50:01,601 --> 01:50:02,440
How high that is

2334
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,570
found on a closed road near glacier 
national park.

2335
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:07,800
Fuck,

2336
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:10,173
dude.

2337
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:13,250
We got to get those images for the 
studio.

2338
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,000
We have to see if those are for sale.
Find out if those are for sale.

2339
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,110
I have a poster printer.
You just send them to me.

2340
01:50:21,111 --> 01:50:23,600
I'll print them out for you.
I think you're supposed to buy those.

2341
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:25,160
Right?
Those are like,

2342
01:50:25,161 --> 01:50:25,994
um,
there's something powerful about it 

2343
01:50:27,771 --> 01:50:29,690
that's not like just a picture of a kid 
with a balloon.

2344
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,220
Right?
You know something about that.

2345
01:50:31,221 --> 01:50:33,020
Like somebody had to be there to get 
that picture.

2346
01:50:33,021 --> 01:50:34,070
This.
Does she get some money?

2347
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:35,550
Printers are pretty amazing nowadays.
I,

2348
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:40,410
I got this poster printer for like $200,
$300 and it,

2349
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:44,870
it prints like pretty decent size 
posters and so like you can just go,

2350
01:50:45,050 --> 01:50:45,650
go,
hey,

2351
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:48,890
you know,
I've always wanted a werewolf poster and

2352
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,170
you just printed out and it's like go 
into the store,

2353
01:50:51,171 --> 01:50:52,850
boom.
You have it framed a big.

2354
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:54,193
Um,
I'd probably say like maybe 31 by 20 or 

2355
01:50:58,401 --> 01:50:59,234
something.
I don't know.

2356
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:05,000
I've been seeing a lot of stuff that 
special effects guys like Rick Baker are

2357
01:51:05,001 --> 01:51:09,290
doing with three d printing now.
They're making all these masks and heads

2358
01:51:09,291 --> 01:51:13,610
and shit with three d printing.
Imagine if you could just make something

2359
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:17,570
in a computer and then go over to the 
three d printer and print that bitch out

2360
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:19,280
for some things.
That's perfect.

2361
01:51:19,281 --> 01:51:23,720
Like I just lost like a little battery 
cover to one of my remotes the other day

2362
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:24,733
and I bet I if I had a three d printer,
I could find the model of the battery 

2363
01:51:27,051 --> 01:51:29,560
cover and just print it out or make it 
in a fun.

2364
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:31,700
That's amazing,
right?

2365
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:33,680
Yeah.
When you really think that,

2366
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:37,370
how much of that is going to be like the
future of objects,

2367
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:39,290
you know,
the future of things,

2368
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:40,393
like how much less shit would you have 
to sell people if you could just sell 

2369
01:51:43,311 --> 01:51:44,740
them.
Oh whoa.

2370
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:45,733
I would print that out.
Is that Rick Baker's Popeye makerbot 

2371
01:51:48,950 --> 01:51:50,360
three d printer I believe.
Oh my God.

2372
01:51:50,361 --> 01:51:52,690
That's awesome.
That's amazing arts.

2373
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:54,710
Then he paints it.
Wow.

2374
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:58,640
That's crazy.
Look at that one right above it.

2375
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:01,310
That's so cool.
Wow.

2376
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:03,200
Go back to that other one that you just 
had with that whole.

2377
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:07,360
The whole series of them.
There's the Benito Doterra Werewolf A.

2378
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:08,870
Yeah.
Sort of.

2379
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:10,310
Pretty close to it in the middle.

2380
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:13,240
God Damn.
That's amazing.

2381
01:52:13,241 --> 01:52:15,280
That'd be fun to paint.
Yeah,

2382
01:52:15,281 --> 01:52:17,740
right.
Once it's three d printed out.

2383
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:18,603
Right?

2384
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:22,810
These guys have so many tools at their 
disposal now,

2385
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:24,513
but I wonder how much of that is going 
to be lost like all the special effects 

2386
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:28,324
makeup stuff in the transition to cgi 
because it seems like it's just 

2387
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:32,494
inevitable that CGI keeps getting better
and better and better arguments for 

2388
01:52:36,701 --> 01:52:37,534
having a mix of this and using practical
effects and I saw a clip of that gay 

2389
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:46,100
American Werewolf actually moving in the
back while they were testing it out.

2390
01:52:46,101 --> 01:52:48,920
It looks obviously fake as shit,
but you can't.

2391
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:50,953
We know what to look for now in that 
fake stuff and it really is catching us 

2392
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,823
off guard all the time.
Just like when I saw that video right 

2393
01:52:55,971 --> 01:52:56,900
away were like fake,
fake,

2394
01:52:56,901 --> 01:52:58,700
fake,
and even when it looks good,

2395
01:52:58,701 --> 01:53:00,800
10 years later you look back at 
something and you're like,

2396
01:53:00,801 --> 01:53:01,910
God,
that looks horrible.

2397
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:04,580
White Dude.
I played King Kong,

2398
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:05,443
the original King Kong for my kids a 
couple of years back and they were 

2399
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:10,754
laughing.
They were so scared at first and I was 

2400
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:13,401
telling him,
no,

2401
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:14,960
I'm not showing you anything scary.
I'm like,

2402
01:53:14,961 --> 01:53:17,990
this is going to be really funny.
It's so silly.

2403
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:20,840
It doesn't seem real at all.
And they were like,

2404
01:53:20,841 --> 01:53:22,160
no,
that's the monster.

2405
01:53:22,161 --> 01:53:22,641
I go,
yeah,

2406
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:24,170
that's the monster.
And you know,

2407
01:53:24,171 --> 01:53:26,320
because they're little kids,
they overlap.

2408
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:32,450
Fell down and they're being so silly.
It was really funny.

2409
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:35,360
I really wished that nuke,
that King Kong Island was better.

2410
01:53:35,361 --> 01:53:37,340
I hated that movie.
Swamp man.

2411
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:40,550
How many times can tell a stupid story,
so racist story.

2412
01:53:40,551 --> 01:53:41,384
Anyway,
King Kong surrounded by black chicks 

2413
01:53:43,851 --> 01:53:46,040
never cares.
One white chick shows up.

2414
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:49,160
He loses his fucking mind.
He's climbing buildings.

2415
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:52,070
Bring them into that.
He breaks out of chains.

2416
01:53:52,071 --> 01:53:54,500
It's so stupid.
Look how big he is.

2417
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,410
Not that big.
That's pretty big.

2418
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:00,530
They changed a bunch of times.
Different versions.

2419
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,170
They have a graph that shows all the 
sizes from all the past.

2420
01:54:03,171 --> 01:54:05,150
Maybe he said him and Godzilla.
Well,

2421
01:54:05,151 --> 01:54:05,984
the Japanese movie was a big one.
They made him like 500 feet tall or 

2422
01:54:09,321 --> 01:54:11,960
something crazy.
So I think he was supposed to be like 50

2423
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:16,040
feet tall.
And the first one is that over there.

2424
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:20,750
King Kong escapes.
Nineteen 67.

2425
01:54:20,751 --> 01:54:22,520
That's the one.
18 foot,

2426
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:25,550
12 foot tall in the 1933 one.
Wow.

2427
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:26,271
That's it.
Yeah,

2428
01:54:26,271 --> 01:54:28,400
that's what I was saying that he looks 
so small compared to like.

2429
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:31,150
Wow.
And then he was 12 feet tall.

2430
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:32,210
The son of Kong.
Oh,

2431
01:54:32,211 --> 01:54:35,400
that's the little one.
Yeah.

2432
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,680
King Kong lives.
That was my fear.

2433
01:54:36,681 --> 01:54:39,830
I saw that in theaters.
So he was pretty God damn big.

2434
01:54:40,730 --> 01:54:43,670
He was a thousand feet tall.
King Kong Godzilla.

2435
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:47,510
Godzilla was gonna fuck him up period.
Like how much bigger is.

2436
01:54:47,511 --> 01:54:50,150
How has that even not even close the new
Godzilla.

2437
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:53,300
Super Fuck them up.
The new Godzilla has goddamn terrifying.

2438
01:54:53,301 --> 01:54:57,980
Seems to be thinking you can't make a 
good one of these.

2439
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:02,480
That was a which years?
Skull island one is the newer one.

2440
01:55:02,510 --> 01:55:03,343
The newer one.
I mean you can only make so many of 

2441
01:55:05,751 --> 01:55:08,300
these God damn things.
You know,

2442
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,643
after awhile it's like,
let me guess know the girl is going to 

2443
01:55:12,551 --> 01:55:14,610
make you.
She's going to be fun.

2444
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:19,110
It's going to have a few close calls.
I'm going to be real excited when she go

2445
01:55:19,111 --> 01:55:19,960
with me.
Okay.

2446
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:23,030
This is the girl that blonde lady going 
to be okay.

2447
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:24,083
He won't.
He's stomping on black chicks left and 

2448
01:55:26,151 --> 01:55:29,900
right.
Just stop it his way through the village

2449
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:32,780
stepping on black dudes.
Just that white girl.

2450
01:55:32,781 --> 01:55:37,250
He's just so enthralled buyer.
It's the most racist movie of all time.

2451
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,610
Like the first time King Kong sees a 
white chick,

2452
01:55:40,611 --> 01:55:44,040
he loses his shit.
I went

2453
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,873
down a rabbit hole the other day 
watching that one gorilla that you know 

2454
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:49,770
Robin Williams used to hang out with all
the time.

2455
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,630
What's that grill at Koko.
Have you ever watched any of his coke?

2456
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:56,430
I love that.
It's pretty amazing.

2457
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:58,650
They're very smart man.
Very smart.

2458
01:55:58,950 --> 01:55:59,530
Yeah.

2459
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:02,570
I mean they're not like people smart,
but they're like you.

2460
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:03,463
You understand that they're not.
This is not like a gopher or groundhog 

2461
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:09,843
or something like.
They're on a completely different level 

2462
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:15,190
than most other mammals besides us.

2463
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:19,760
Coco recently got some new kittens and 
it's watching.

2464
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:22,210
It's amazing watching him play with the 
kittens.

2465
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:23,260
I think it's a girl,
right?

2466
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:24,100
Yeah,
her.

2467
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:26,390
Sorry.
As gendered Coco Bro.

2468
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:29,980
That's just one of those animals.
You just think it's a guy.

2469
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:30,980
You know,
you look at it,

2470
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,980
it's like.
It's like how I look at dogs,

2471
01:56:32,981 --> 01:56:35,440
I considered them guys and cats girls 
for some reason.

2472
01:56:35,441 --> 01:56:36,274
Yeah,
because she could smash your fucking 

2473
01:56:37,271 --> 01:56:38,104
head and anytime she wants.
So you almost how strong the thing must 

2474
01:56:40,871 --> 01:56:41,704
be.

2475
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:47,040
Yet she's so gentle.
They're vegetarians to their sweeties.

2476
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,780
Grills are big sweeties for the most 
part.

2477
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:53,670
What's really kind of nuts,
man is a chimpanzee.

2478
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:55,570
How smart they are.
She's twerking.

2479
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:57,980
Twerking,
let's see that.

2480
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:01,170
Hey,
can I get on that

2481
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:05,980
strong torques by the way?
They will love it.

2482
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:10,230
She has been working on our host skills.
She's not just,

2483
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,100
this is not like our first time doing 
that.

2484
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:14,560
She's developed those fast twitch 
muscles.

2485
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:15,853
You know,
we could really torque to girls who 

2486
01:57:19,370 --> 01:57:20,410
twerk and you go,
Whoa,

2487
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:23,250
you really do know how to do this.
You know,

2488
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:24,910
you ever seen like a little kid tried to
do a Yo Yo.

2489
01:57:24,911 --> 01:57:28,870
They don't quite get.
It doesn't come back all the way.

2490
01:57:28,871 --> 01:57:29,531
Like Shit,
you know,

2491
01:57:29,531 --> 01:57:32,510
you try to teach them now you got to 
like go down and then go up when they,

2492
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:33,413
they never get it.
That's the same thing with like a a 

2493
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:38,560
amateur torquer girl doesn't really know
how to work.

2494
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:41,590
They don't have that kind of pop and 
bounce that that girl did.

2495
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:44,230
That girl has done a lot of things.
She probably regrets.

2496
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:47,620
She's probably been hammered more than 
once doing that.

2497
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,050
It's probably gone but to.
But with other girls.

2498
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:51,580
I love butter,
but yeah,

2499
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:53,530
but to.
But yeah,

2500
01:57:53,531 --> 01:57:54,364
it's been a lot

2501
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,293
of the box that comes in and asks man,
in the last couple of years I've never 

2502
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:03,590
asked her why.
How can't even imagine.

2503
01:58:03,591 --> 01:58:06,830
I was a tit guy for so long,
like assets.

2504
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:09,210
I've really enjoy the whole woman by the
way.

2505
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,910
Yeah.
That's like the male feminist approach,

2506
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:15,060
asshole.
He just treat them as a whole woman.

2507
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:20,420
Not think of it as like a tit guy.
Guy Get girls are like,

2508
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:26,240
I'm not a dick girl.
You know I liked the mouth.

2509
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:30,310
I like to eat my box and shut their 
mouth and a A.

2510
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,630
I saw that.
I looked up.

2511
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:36,120
I had to find the black China naked 
photos.

2512
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:41,090
Boobs are back.
They're back near amazing.

2513
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,070
Boobs are back.
They

2514
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,500
went away.
When the fuck did go away,

2515
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:46,960
see,
this is just like people run out of shit

2516
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:49,330
to talk about this,
what it is.

2517
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:51,760
It's like half the things that we 
discussed in this podcast,

2518
01:58:51,761 --> 01:58:53,260
like what,
what are they doing?

2519
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:56,150
We're just shooting the Shit folks 
concrete.

2520
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:58,090
They're printing it.
Congratulations on that.

2521
01:58:58,130 --> 01:58:58,963
That,
that.

2522
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:00,003
A New York Times a retraction that you 
pretty much cause that was pretty 

2523
01:59:04,901 --> 01:59:05,734
beautiful watching that go down.
I mean it was a guy who wrote it and it 

2524
01:59:09,491 --> 01:59:11,440
was printed in the New York Times,
you know,

2525
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:13,180
I mean,
it wasn't the New York Times,

2526
01:59:13,181 --> 01:59:14,014
but it's an individual's choice and 
maybe an editor's choice to embellish 

2527
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:20,560
the reality of what happened.
They said that Connor's,

2528
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:21,453
it was about the boxing match.
They said that his face was covered in 

2529
01:59:24,521 --> 01:59:25,354
blood,
completely covered in blood and that he 

2530
01:59:27,011 --> 01:59:28,840
was rescued before he fell through the 
ropes.

2531
01:59:28,841 --> 01:59:29,890
Neither one of those things are true.

2532
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:32,920
Just not true.
His face wasn't bloody at all.

2533
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:34,173
I mean,
he had a little bit of a swelling under 

2534
01:59:34,961 --> 01:59:36,490
his left eye.
Um,

2535
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:37,623
he was definitely getting punched in the
face and I definitely agree with the 

2536
01:59:40,391 --> 01:59:44,470
stoppage of the fight.
He was exhausted and he was a fallen all

2537
01:59:44,471 --> 01:59:45,304
over the place,
but it was more that floyd was just 

2538
01:59:47,381 --> 01:59:49,690
teeing off on him and he wasn't firing 
back.

2539
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:53,380
There was no blood and he didn't.
He wasn't gonna fall through the ropes.

2540
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:54,243
He might've went down,
might've went down at one point in the 

2541
01:59:56,141 --> 01:59:56,741
fight.
I mean,

2542
01:59:56,741 --> 01:59:58,300
if,
if floyd kept punching him,

2543
01:59:58,301 --> 02:00:01,240
that might be actually a smart move for 
them to catch 10 seconds,

2544
02:00:01,241 --> 02:00:03,370
you know,
do a standing eight count,

2545
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:04,473
get up at the counter or you know,
do go down to a knee rather get up at 

2546
02:00:06,521 --> 02:00:07,620
the count of Eight,
you know,

2547
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:10,240
they brush your gloves off,
you get a second or two there,

2548
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:11,323
then you go back in.

2549
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,930
Maybe that had been enough for him to 
get through the round,

2550
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:14,823
you know,
because he was for sure having a real 

2551
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:19,090
hard time recovering.
But with the New York Times where it was

2552
02:00:19,091 --> 02:00:19,924
just not true,
like what it was was just as juicy what 

2553
02:00:23,771 --> 02:00:24,604
it was.
His 40 year old boxer comes out of 

2554
02:00:26,711 --> 02:00:27,544
retirement and schools,
the number one most popular MMA fighter 

2555
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,033
in the world in a boxing match,
proving what a lot of experts already 

2556
02:00:35,891 --> 02:00:39,670
knew that a specialist someone is the 
greatest specialists of all time when it

2557
02:00:39,671 --> 02:00:41,980
comes to boxing.
I mean it's pretty arguable.

2558
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:42,814
Floyd's in like the two or three people 
that you could argue like the greatest 

2559
02:00:45,461 --> 02:00:46,510
of all time.
In my opinion,

2560
02:00:46,511 --> 02:00:51,430
floyd is the number one,
but he beat conor mcgregor in a way that

2561
02:00:51,431 --> 02:00:52,264
you would expect a real specialist to 
beat someone who's just pretty good at 

2562
02:00:55,661 --> 02:00:57,090
it.
He was masterful.

2563
02:00:57,310 --> 02:01:00,520
Fucking awesome to watch and what Connor
said afterwards,

2564
02:01:00,521 --> 02:01:02,230
hilarious too.
I turned them into a Mexican.

2565
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:05,260
He fought like a Mexican because that's 
what people love about.

2566
02:01:05,261 --> 02:01:09,190
Mexican fighters at Mexican fighters are
known for coming straight at you.

2567
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,920
Like Mexican fighters aren't dancers.
They're not dancing around and you know,

2568
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:15,580
doing the Ali shuffle,
they're like Julio Cesar Chavez.

2569
02:01:15,581 --> 02:01:17,350
If moving forward,
you know,

2570
02:01:17,351 --> 02:01:21,030
they're like Marco Antonio Berrera.
They're moving forward Mexican boxers or

2571
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:24,340
like some of the proudest,
most rugged warriors ever.

2572
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:27,610
That's how floyd fought.
Fought really?

2573
02:01:27,611 --> 02:01:31,640
Did fight like a super technical 
aggressive brawling style.

2574
02:01:31,641 --> 02:01:34,610
He tired connor out that beat his ass 
too.

2575
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:37,210
Beautiful Man.
Beautiful for boxing.

2576
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:38,850
Beautiful for,
um,

2577
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:44,110
for the overall art of fighting because 
we need to see these things.

2578
02:01:45,681 --> 02:01:50,681
I think this thing that we're all 
participating in eat fans of of MMA,

2579
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:51,584
practitioners of MMA,
this thing that we're all participating 

2580
02:01:53,931 --> 02:01:58,931
in is trying to figure out what style is
the very best style for fighting period.

2581
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:02,210
And then we found along the way that it 
varies.

2582
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:05,210
It varies on the individual styles.
Make fights,

2583
02:02:05,211 --> 02:02:07,520
and then sometimes one guy can beat 
another guy,

2584
02:02:07,521 --> 02:02:09,230
but that guy can beat someone who could 
beat him.

2585
02:02:09,231 --> 02:02:11,120
And it gets real weird.
Like mma.

2586
02:02:11,121 --> 02:02:11,954
Math is one of the squirrel,
earliest fucking predictors of who's 

2587
02:02:14,931 --> 02:02:18,740
going to win a fight ever.
But we're finding out like what?

2588
02:02:18,741 --> 02:02:19,574
What's fucking real?
Like when you got all the belief in 

2589
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:25,190
yourself in the world,
when you've got knockout power,

2590
02:02:25,191 --> 02:02:27,800
when you really believe you could beat 
the greatest boxer of all time,

2591
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:29,210
what happens?
Oh,

2592
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:30,740
you get fucked up.
Okay,

2593
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:32,450
that's good.
It's good to learn.

2594
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:33,523
It's good to learn.
It's good to learn that even though he 

2595
02:02:35,031 --> 02:02:38,180
lands it lands a few shots,
makes it a real interesting contest.

2596
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:42,440
Good to learn that the best specialists 
of all time is that for a reason.

2597
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:44,750
This isn't bullshit.
This is floyd mayweather.

2598
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:47,660
He's 49 and now now he's 50 and no,
I mean that's.

2599
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,150
That's good for combat sports.
It's good for everybody.

2600
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:53,960
That's what's so stupid about this whole
boxing versus mma feud.

2601
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:55,333
It's so dumb.
It gets everybody excited about fights 

2602
02:02:57,590 --> 02:03:02,510
and this inter competition thing between
a an MMA fighter coming over to boxing.

2603
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:03,583
That's even more fun because then it 
gets like everything excited on both 

2604
02:03:06,741 --> 02:03:07,574
sides and I think it's gotten a lot of 
people super excited about Canelo 

2605
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:13,130
Alvarez and triple g,
which is next weekend.

2606
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:16,010
People are super pumped up about that 
fight,

2607
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:18,680
particularly because we're just past 
this.

2608
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:23,300
Connor Floyd Mayweather fight.
Floyd mayweather has his way with connor

2609
02:03:23,301 --> 02:03:24,134
just puts on a display and now we're 
going to get to see instead of the 

2610
02:03:27,351 --> 02:03:30,200
master versus a guy who really wasn't on
his level.

2611
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:33,440
Now we're going to get to say to guys in
their prime,

2612
02:03:33,441 --> 02:03:36,470
at the top of the food chain,
to the top three,

2613
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:39,020
top four pound for pound fighters in the
world,

2614
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:41,030
and they're going to go at it so it's 
good for everybody.

2615
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,470
They just don't.
They.

2616
02:03:42,471 --> 02:03:46,370
These guys are so old school.
They understand social media in a sense.

2617
02:03:46,371 --> 02:03:47,960
They know they can use it to promote 
fights.

2618
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:52,100
They don't know that it's changed the 
whole community and that instead of like

2619
02:03:52,101 --> 02:03:57,101
having some stupid rivalry with this 
other like sport mma,

2620
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:00,350
instead of having that just accept each 
other,

2621
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,393
accept each other and talk highly of the
best examples in both sports and 

2622
02:04:05,781 --> 02:04:06,614
everybody will be fine.
I mean that's what you're seeing with 

2623
02:04:08,151 --> 02:04:10,130
this conor mcgregor floyd mayweather 
fight.

2624
02:04:10,131 --> 02:04:12,680
That's where you're to see with the 
triple g Canelo Alvarez fight.

2625
02:04:12,681 --> 02:04:15,230
You don't have to be one or the other 
and the boxing.

2626
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:19,640
People don't have to not like MMA.
I love boxing and I work in MMA.

2627
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,680
I love boxing.
I watch all the big fights.

2628
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:23,600
I'm always gonna.
It's fascinating.

2629
02:04:23,601 --> 02:04:24,434
It's awesome.
It's nice to know who the real 

2630
02:04:26,331 --> 02:04:27,890
specialists are.
You know,

2631
02:04:27,891 --> 02:04:29,720
when it comes to that,
I love kickboxing.

2632
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:32,230
Big Fan of that too.
I like to know a lot.

2633
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:33,660
I love Jujitsu.
I want to know.

2634
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:36,560
I wonder how good are the best guys?
What would happen?

2635
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:37,633
The best guy in the UFC fought the best 
guy in Jujitsu in a straight up Jujitsu 

2636
02:04:41,311 --> 02:04:42,210
match.
I want to see,

2637
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:43,133
you know,
those are.

2638
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:44,220
Those things are interesting.

2639
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:51,480
I went to see a box or go to the UFC and
see how it's going to happen eventually.

2640
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:52,890
You know what I mean?
We had James,

2641
02:04:52,891 --> 02:04:53,611
Tony,
of course,

2642
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:54,444
but James was way past his prime and it 
didn't even look like he trained for 

2643
02:04:57,781 --> 02:05:00,100
that fight.
I think James just took a payday.

2644
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:01,350
If I had a gas,
you know,

2645
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:03,570
and randy just hit them with a low ankle
pick.

2646
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:07,230
Took them down.
I think maybe hit a low single.

2647
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:09,690
I forget what it was,
but he went way low,

2648
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:10,943
but either way there's not a chance in 
hell that James Tony was ever going to 

2649
02:05:13,651 --> 02:05:16,230
stop randy coture from taking them down.
It's just not going to happen.

2650
02:05:16,231 --> 02:05:18,600
He would have to catch them.
Absolutely perfect.

2651
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:20,850
Coming in for the very first punch and 
if he didn't,

2652
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:23,900
randy was going to molest him.
Have his way with them.

2653
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:27,660
Excited about GSP.
Yeah.

2654
02:05:28,150 --> 02:05:30,990
I'm interested to see what happens.
Quite honestly,

2655
02:05:30,991 --> 02:05:33,110
I wanted to see him at 70.
I want to.

2656
02:05:33,490 --> 02:05:34,323
I think him versus Woodley is the fight,
like Woodley's had two fights in a row 

2657
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:40,433
where people were booing him and three 
really because they had to fight with 

2658
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:46,800
wonderboy that will like chess matches 
and then one fight with Damien Maia,

2659
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:49,740
which was also like just not the most 
exciting fight,

2660
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,950
but I think him versus GSP would be very
exciting fight.

2661
02:05:52,951 --> 02:05:56,010
I think that's the real fight because 
that's GSPS real weight class to,

2662
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:57,750
you know,
I'm interested in that,

2663
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:01,440
but I'm interested in the bisping fight 
too because I think it's a tough fight.

2664
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:04,110
It's a tough fight for GSP.
Bisping is a handful.

2665
02:06:04,111 --> 02:06:06,490
He's a big fella to fought at two.
Oh five.

2666
02:06:06,491 --> 02:06:08,700
And the ultimate fighter fights in one 
85 in the UFC.

2667
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:12,440
He's way bigger than George and he's 
gotten fucking tough man.

2668
02:06:12,450 --> 02:06:14,760
He's real good.
Legitimately real good.

2669
02:06:14,761 --> 02:06:16,910
And George has been out for a long time.
Yeah.

2670
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:18,270
What's he been doing?
Well,

2671
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:21,210
he's been training.
He's definitely stayed in shape.

2672
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:23,820
He did a lot of gymnastics,
did a lot of exercise,

2673
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:24,654
you know,
he made a shit ton of money when he was 

2674
02:06:25,891 --> 02:06:26,724
fighting.
He had contracts with Nike and he had 

2675
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:30,330
some.
He had a.

2676
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:32,130
was it Nike or was it?
Um,

2677
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:35,280
I think he had something.
I knew we had something with Gatorade,

2678
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:37,620
but I want to say George had something.
Maybe it's under armour.

2679
02:06:37,850 --> 02:06:39,240
I think he's got something with under 
armour.

2680
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,193
Yeah.
So he's at a bunch of big endorsements 

2681
02:06:41,611 --> 02:06:44,930
and he's at a giant hero in Canada.
I mean,

2682
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,500
just giant.
Right.

2683
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,840
So I think for,
you know,

2684
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:52,350
a while he just recovering and then all 
those wars,

2685
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:53,184
all those years of getting brawls.
Then finally got to a point where his 

2686
02:06:56,131 --> 02:06:57,720
body started feeling real good again.
It's like,

2687
02:06:57,721 --> 02:06:59,070
fuck it,
let's get back in there.

2688
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:02,820
I wonder if the aliens are still around 
the len to come to me.

2689
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:03,960
I think red light.

2690
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,833
I refuse to drink a gatorade anymore.
I used to drink a gatorade every single 

2691
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:13,640
day for the last 20 years and then the 
other day busted wine open,

2692
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:15,013
drank it,
and something that felt like a raw egg 

2693
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:22,120
went into my mouth and spit it back in 
and it was just this low lob just shot a

2694
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:28,080
this video on it.
It's apparently a thing like this.

2695
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:29,870
The gatorade gloves.
Yeah.

2696
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,370
It's actually,
I'm not the only one.

2697
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:32,840
There's Kombucha.
See that?

2698
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:34,450
That was in my mouth,
uh,

2699
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:36,100
top

2700
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:39,670
119 complaints and reviews about 
gatorade from consumer affairs.

2701
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:40,504
So.
So you got one of these brands in my 

2702
02:07:42,401 --> 02:07:43,234
mouth and I saved it up until about a 
week ago because I was going to just 

2703
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:47,980
call them.
And then I was like,

2704
02:07:47,981 --> 02:07:49,180
ah,
who cares about this hub?

2705
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:51,190
What are they saying it is?
Whoa.

2706
02:07:51,191 --> 02:07:52,540
There's a load.
So much data loading there.

2707
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:56,710
It was the grossest thing ever in it.
Seriously.

2708
02:07:56,711 --> 02:07:58,990
I have like flashbacks and I can't,
I can,

2709
02:07:59,020 --> 02:07:59,853
I will never ever drink a gatorade for 
the rest of my life and look at this 

2710
02:08:02,411 --> 02:08:04,660
crap.
This is a wow.

2711
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:06,700
That's just molded though.
That's mold.

2712
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:07,723
Mold is sugar or something,
but who knows how long that's been 

2713
02:08:09,971 --> 02:08:11,410
sitting there.
That's one thing.

2714
02:08:11,411 --> 02:08:13,720
Whenever you go to a gas station or 
stuff,

2715
02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:15,850
always look at the bottom of your 
container,

2716
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:17,740
like if you're buying like a plastic 
bottle,

2717
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:18,970
like apple juice or something.

2718
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:20,043
Because I've noticed that ever since 
then I'm so paranoid about anything and 

2719
02:08:24,041 --> 02:08:24,874
I tell you half the times I'm looking at
the bottom like that does not look 

2720
02:08:27,131 --> 02:08:27,964
right.
This looks like it's been mold or 

2721
02:08:30,251 --> 02:08:31,084
something.
Things that are go traveled around like 

2722
02:08:32,171 --> 02:08:33,004
a Mcdonald's or the.
The dude who was worried about Wendy's 

2723
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,753
with the hot trucks.
There are things that are travel around 

2724
02:08:38,890 --> 02:08:40,240
in hot trucks,
you know,

2725
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:41,103
like for real [inaudible] I wonder if 
like what temperature gatorade has to 

2726
02:08:46,871 --> 02:08:49,240
get to before shit starts growing in it.
And that's it.

2727
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:53,080
I mean I did buy,
I bought my gatorade from Amazon,

2728
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,153
you know,
so I was probably sitting in some hot 

2729
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:57,310
warehouse somewhere.
Just cooking.

2730
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,320
No.
When it's sealed,

2731
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:02,050
I wonder like what does that mean when 
they seal it,

2732
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,153
right?
Like obviously air's not get into it 

2733
02:09:04,721 --> 02:09:06,820
right now,
but there's some air in there.

2734
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,680
What happens to that air?
Right?

2735
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:11,110
How's that era effect his shit growing 
in that area?

2736
02:09:11,111 --> 02:09:11,944
Know how much.
I think there's chemicals in there to 

2737
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:17,320
make sure that nothing happens.
Like they found some 6,000

2738
02:09:17,321 --> 02:09:19,570
year old bottle of wine recently to see 
that.

2739
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:22,420
Yeah,
I think absolutely what they found was a

2740
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:23,254
6,000
year old vessel that contained residue 

2741
02:09:25,781 --> 02:09:29,020
of wine.
I don't think they found like 6,000

2742
02:09:29,021 --> 02:09:32,170
year old bottle that you can just get 
fucked up on.

2743
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:33,753
Imagine traces of 6,000
year old wine discovered in Sicilian 

2744
02:09:36,731 --> 02:09:37,420
cave.
That's my,

2745
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:40,150
my people there.
Make it a fucking night.

2746
02:09:40,151 --> 02:09:42,040
Show us.
They got a nice wine.

2747
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:44,740
This guy has been growing wine for 
16,000

2748
02:09:44,741 --> 02:09:45,574
fucking years.
You've got to get this wind and you get 

2749
02:09:48,401 --> 02:09:51,910
this whining.
You 16,000

2750
02:09:51,911 --> 02:09:55,840
years is family's been overhead.
They used to have thumbs.

2751
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:57,490
They used to pick the grapes with their 
feet.

2752
02:09:57,900 --> 02:10:00,930
That's how long ago they did this.
These motherfuckers.

2753
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:01,893
Wow.
Look at those.

2754
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:02,740
Those,
uh,

2755
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:04,780
pots that they found.
That is crazy.

2756
02:10:04,781 --> 02:10:06,730
Those are 6,000
year old pots.

2757
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:09,420
They used to hold wine.
Cool.

2758
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:10,333
Fucking find in Canada that's older than
go back to tempe or some kid found a 

2759
02:10:16,781 --> 02:10:18,460
civil.
Don't don't change that yet though.

2760
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:22,600
I want to look at this for a second that
just trips me out that those big vessels

2761
02:10:22,601 --> 02:10:24,010
or 6,000
years old.

2762
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:26,050
That is so weird.
Man.

2763
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:32,550
That is so fucking long ago to try to 
pretend what life was like 2000 years

2764
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,933
before Christ.
That's essentially what you're looking 

2765
02:10:36,771 --> 02:10:39,980
at.
Or fourth that yeah,

2766
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:41,580
4,000
years before Christ.

2767
02:10:41,581 --> 02:10:42,500
Six.
So 6,000

2768
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:44,420
years ago.
No Christ was zero,

2769
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:47,930
right?
So it's 2017.

2770
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:51,390
Two thousand years past Christ.
They,

2771
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:52,333
they,
they say current era bce be enough 

2772
02:10:54,751 --> 02:10:58,310
fooling everybody.
We know what it is before Jesus.

2773
02:10:58,311 --> 02:11:01,330
You Fuck Keith,
why aren't you.

2774
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:02,181
What'd you have it?
Oh,

2775
02:11:02,181 --> 02:11:06,500
just a coincidence that before current 
ever era just happens to land.

2776
02:11:06,501 --> 02:11:07,334
Exactly on when Jesus came back,
shut up assholes with their bce before 

2777
02:11:14,121 --> 02:11:15,770
current era.
What does that even mean?

2778
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:18,430
Why can't we just start it?
We can't.

2779
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:21,800
Can we go back and agree with zero is 
and rewrite history.

2780
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:24,900
I mean we decided that this was a,
you know,

2781
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:27,980
the BC 2,500
BC,

2782
02:11:28,010 --> 02:11:28,843
they made the pyramids like what the 
fuck does that even mean you're going 

2783
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:35,510
backwards?
So 6,000

2784
02:11:35,511 --> 02:11:39,230
BC is actually earlier than 2,500
BC.

2785
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:42,770
You guys are retarded.
What a stupid way of measuring shit.

2786
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:45,260
How about you go all the way back,
you make that zero.

2787
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:50,340
You start from scratch because the earth
doesn't know what year we're in.

2788
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:54,290
The earth has no idea what year were 
deciding it in to do,

2789
02:11:54,291 --> 02:11:58,220
make some arbitrary number and have 
everything before that.

2790
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:03,520
Start with a low number and build high.
Like you have a like a flat line between

2791
02:12:04,191 --> 02:12:07,760
reality and some new dimension or like 
water and air.

2792
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:09,230
Like you have a hot number.

2793
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:15,440
When Mr Software created zero.
One's a Christian monk.

2794
02:12:16,750 --> 02:12:18,150
Yeah.
I looked up the other day,

2795
02:12:18,151 --> 02:12:18,984
were alphabetical order came from and 
who got to decide why it was that and 

2796
02:12:23,851 --> 02:12:26,730
what made a before b or whatever the 
fuck it was.

2797
02:12:26,731 --> 02:12:28,450
Some scholars back that,
you know,

2798
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,660
when people couldn't write,
they were the only ones that could write

2799
02:12:30,661 --> 02:12:32,370
and read.
So they made it up,

2800
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,830
you know what the craziest trip is,
man,

2801
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:39,580
when people were writing an ancient 
Hebrew,

2802
02:12:39,581 --> 02:12:42,280
they wrote with letters that also meant 
numbers,

2803
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:47,850
like a word also had a numerical value.
Like there was no numbers.

2804
02:12:47,851 --> 02:12:51,060
They didn't have like numbers.
They had a and a's.

2805
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:53,530
Alcohol also won the bees also too.

2806
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:57,020
I just thought of that time period and 
no one else knew how to read.

2807
02:12:57,021 --> 02:12:59,450
So if you got a letter or whatever,
let's say if you got one.

2808
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:01,730
Is that true though?
You'd have no one knew no one.

2809
02:13:01,731 --> 02:13:03,650
But I would say most people probably 
didn't.

2810
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:06,590
You might not think you have to read for
you.

2811
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:09,190
You'd have to trust their translation.
That's all is great.

2812
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:13,170
Your race and they were making pyramids.
They could all read amazing.

2813
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:14,761
Yeah,
you might be right.

2814
02:13:14,761 --> 02:13:15,594
Right.
But that was the whole Martin Luther 

2815
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:16,980
thing,
right?

2816
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:17,980
Lutherism.
Yeah.

2817
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:23,750
He had figured out how to make the Bible
and translated into A.

2818
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:24,803
I think it was German into phonetic 
language that people could understand 

2819
02:13:28,410 --> 02:13:31,830
because before they had to like trust 
the priests or learn

2820
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:35,280
Latin.
I guess I'm Lutheran or you really,

2821
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:38,730
those are the super people.
They figured it out,

2822
02:13:38,731 --> 02:13:39,564
man.
You who were the ones that are 

2823
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:41,543
pentecostals?
Those are my favorite because they fuck 

2824
02:13:42,541 --> 02:13:46,830
with snakes and shit was my favorite.
I like those.

2825
02:13:46,950 --> 02:13:48,960
That's hot weather of southern people,
man.

2826
02:13:48,961 --> 02:13:49,794
That's what that shit is.
That's all people that live in a place 

2827
02:13:51,421 --> 02:13:52,254
where your brain is getting boiled by 
the heat and you just decided to start 

2828
02:13:54,961 --> 02:13:58,380
dancing with snakes and you know,
and fucking talking in tongues.

2829
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:00,330
Samela elemental.
Ah,

2830
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:02,640
they're sweating.
They're always sweating.

2831
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:05,310
Pentecostal guys,
they're always yelling and screaming.

2832
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:07,783
Yeah man.
That's a big conventions or something 

2833
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:13,750
where they meet every year to 
pentecostals do the meeting,

2834
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:17,610
swap snakes.
My snake and almost got me last week.

2835
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:22,110
Every now and then one of them gets got 
by a snake.

2836
02:14:23,190 --> 02:14:24,023
That's important to man.
All these people in the group have to 

2837
02:14:26,341 --> 02:14:27,174
go,
oh,

2838
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,010
okay.
Big Old party.

2839
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:30,330
Look at that.
How much?

2840
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:31,440
How much fuck,
Lord,

2841
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:34,560
Gaylord opryland resort.
Shut your mouth.

2842
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:39,030
How much butt fucking is going on?
Just Butt fucking in that room so much,

2843
02:14:39,031 --> 02:14:41,550
but fucking gold.
Go to that overhead view.

2844
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:44,520
How much pray the gay away has happened 
in that room.

2845
02:14:45,150 --> 02:14:46,670
At least 30 percent,
right?

2846
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:47,843
Thirty percent of those people are just 
trying to fight off the gay hard 

2847
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:55,640
Asheville.
There was a lawsuit that was just A.

2848
02:14:56,190 --> 02:14:58,200
I was just reading about where these,
uh,

2849
02:14:58,740 --> 02:14:59,573
this some sort of Christian cult.
They kidnap this guy and beat the shit 

2850
02:15:03,361 --> 02:15:06,570
out of him because he was gay.
They were trying to beat the gay away.

2851
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,130
Oh my God.
There's so much of that going on.

2852
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:15,803
So much that pray the gay away.
What does this mother accused of having 

2853
02:15:19,381 --> 02:15:22,200
Sun beat the gay away could face hate 
crime charges?

2854
02:15:22,230 --> 02:15:24,180
Yeah.
Look at her.

2855
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:26,640
Is that the woman?
Oh my God.

2856
02:15:27,690 --> 02:15:30,960
What is she going to talk about?
We should probably hear her talk.

2857
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:34,800
Do you think we could get yanked a 
report?

2858
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:35,723
Yeah.
Let's hear what she has to say about 

2859
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,740
beating the shit out of her son.

2860
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,190
I.
Yes.

2861
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:47,780
I think that you was going to ask you,
but like I said,

2862
02:15:47,781 --> 02:15:50,330
I reported the water bed and another was
nothing.

2863
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:51,920
Nothing was done.

2864
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:54,070
And does it bother you if he does come 
out to be gay?

2865
02:15:54,071 --> 02:15:54,904
Does that bother you?

2866
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:58,410
It bothered me because he's.
He's a young age.

2867
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:04,250
He's not.
He do not know right from wrong.

2868
02:16:05,730 --> 02:16:07,140
So yes he do.

2869
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:11,480
Yes.
Whoa.

2870
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:13,033
Is that her mugshot?
And right below the one that looks like 

2871
02:16:14,641 --> 02:16:16,490
Katt Williams.
It's like James Brown,

2872
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:19,330
Brown.
Get up,

2873
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,170
get up.
What is that?

2874
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:24,450
Oh,
it's from Whiteville,

2875
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:26,670
North Carolina.
She lives in Whiteville.

2876
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:28,320
Simulation theory.
Shit,

2877
02:16:28,321 --> 02:16:29,980
man.
North Carolina.

2878
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:34,420
She's currently being charged with a 
misdemeanor child abuse.

2879
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:36,370
That's all you get for beating the 
gateway.

2880
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:39,670
Get misdemeanor child abuse.
He's 15 man.

2881
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:45,260
That's Jesus Christ.
God Damn it man.

2882
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,380
So a,
check this out.

2883
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:52,373
That's even crazier right now.
Hurricane Irma holds about twice the 

2884
02:16:55,871 --> 02:17:00,190
destructive energy of all bombs used in 
the second world war.

2885
02:17:00,670 --> 02:17:03,460
Just 7 trillion watts of power in it 
right now.

2886
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:07,600
So why can't we get like some kind of a 
windmill up there?

2887
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:08,493
He can't collect it.
You would have to have a big one and 

2888
02:17:10,241 --> 02:17:12,310
then it will become the biggest weapon 
ever.

2889
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:13,333
Well,
why don't we design that instead of the 

2890
02:17:14,891 --> 02:17:17,420
galaxy note eight that no one wants to 
buy it.

2891
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:19,183
How about you buy a giant when windmill 
thing and put it up there and make all 

2892
02:17:24,131 --> 02:17:24,600
the power.

2893
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:27,000
I have some friends that are in Florida 
right now and uh,

2894
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:27,873
the unforeseen problem that being out 
here not knowing what to why and what 

2895
02:17:31,541 --> 02:17:32,374
people are doing,
they're outside of an uncle in Orlando 

2896
02:17:33,551 --> 02:17:34,384
who was telling me he's not leaving 
right now because the roads are 

2897
02:17:36,341 --> 02:17:38,590
gridlocked and the highway,
there's nowhere to go.

2898
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:42,040
My friends who left Tampa yesterday got 
up at like nine in the morning,

2899
02:17:42,041 --> 02:17:43,960
packed all their shit up and we're like,
all right,

2900
02:17:43,961 --> 02:17:45,010
let's go.
Where are we going to go?

2901
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:46,293
They were like,
let's take side roads because it's 

2902
02:17:47,381 --> 02:17:50,460
probably going to be busy everywhere.
So they did for awhile,

2903
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:51,453
three,
four hours of side roads and then 

2904
02:17:52,211 --> 02:17:55,690
eventually you're gonna run out of gas.
You gotta go get gas first place.

2905
02:17:55,691 --> 02:17:58,060
They stopped no gas.
They're all out.

2906
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:03,490
So they continue on to the next one,
waiting a gigantic line to fill up.

2907
02:18:03,550 --> 02:18:04,383
But now it's again,
like hopefully we can live off of this 

2908
02:18:06,731 --> 02:18:09,880
tank of gas for the next lesson until we
get where we're going.

2909
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:11,253
And everybody has to leave right now 
because the whole state could be 

2910
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:16,470
potentially under 10 feet of water the 
whole days.

2911
02:18:17,470 --> 02:18:18,303
10 foot storm surge is coming and it 
won't make it all the way to the middle 

2912
02:18:21,701 --> 02:18:23,560
probably.
But it might fucking gigantic.

2913
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:24,100
We don't know.

2914
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:24,933
Obviously the only positive if there's 
any positive thing compared to the last 

2915
02:18:28,031 --> 02:18:30,880
hurricane is that it's not going to 
stall over Florida.

2916
02:18:30,881 --> 02:18:33,900
It's going to keep on going and losing 
energy the higher it gets.

2917
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:37,450
But uh,
Orlando should be,

2918
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:40,240
might get really fucked.
That's Disneyworld.

2919
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:43,270
Disneyworld might be gone this weekend.
Right.

2920
02:18:43,271 --> 02:18:44,860
And they just.
Yeah,

2921
02:18:44,861 --> 02:18:47,410
they just rebuild it all or all this new
stuff too.

2922
02:18:47,411 --> 02:18:48,640
So.
Whoa.

2923
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:50,950
Oh yeah,
there's that.

2924
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:54,050
Ninety percent of this island of Barbuda
is gone,

2925
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:56,600
gone habitable,
habitable,

2926
02:18:56,650 --> 02:18:58,460
Shawnee daily.
Even though some of the shit too,

2927
02:18:58,490 --> 02:19:00,530
because they can't see it.
It was all happening last night.

2928
02:19:00,710 --> 02:19:03,560
That can't get over to find out what's 
going to get reports of it even.

2929
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:06,460
Yeah.
They don't know if the people are dead,

2930
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:07,430
they don't know shit.
Right.

2931
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:09,250
I mean those islands are so small.
I mean,

2932
02:19:09,251 --> 02:19:11,890
what is this the size of like Texas or 
Ohio or something like that?

2933
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:13,140
It's A.
Yeah,

2934
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:15,610
it's the size of Ohio.
The storm is 400 miles across.

2935
02:19:17,450 --> 02:19:22,450
It's how wide is Florida?
Florida's not 400 miles across.

2936
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:25,120
I don't know exactly,
but it's probably.

2937
02:19:25,121 --> 02:19:26,550
I would go $300,
$200,

2938
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,010
so it's going to be

2939
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:32,390
like a giant eraser.
It just rolls up Florida

2940
02:19:33,170 --> 02:19:35,710
and they're still not sure it could turn
this.

2941
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:38,690
Things can always turn.
It could go back and turn left and go to

2942
02:19:38,691 --> 02:19:39,524
Texas.

2943
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:44,490
Grossest people that have ever lived 
speaking for the people that go,

2944
02:19:45,210 --> 02:19:48,450
they miss,
they stay and they survive and the storm

2945
02:19:48,451 --> 02:19:50,790
miraculously turns now like I fucking 
knew it.

2946
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,080
No,
you didn't.

2947
02:19:52,081 --> 02:19:53,940
Stupid.
You didn't know it.

2948
02:19:53,941 --> 02:19:55,920
You're no better than the people that 
get killed by it.

2949
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:56,940
You just got lucky.

2950
02:19:57,290 --> 02:19:59,760
You know,
that's a lot of people in Houston.

2951
02:19:59,761 --> 02:20:01,770
That's how they feel.
They can make it a party.

2952
02:20:01,870 --> 02:20:05,130
They like,
they have hurricane parties and this one

2953
02:20:05,131 --> 02:20:08,400
really caught him off guard.
Did you know catch them off guard?

2954
02:20:08,401 --> 02:20:11,310
They saw it coming from days away.
Well,

2955
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:14,030
they,
I think they in their heads think,

2956
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:15,660
oh no,
we're fine.

2957
02:20:15,661 --> 02:20:17,050
We've been fine for years.
You know,

2958
02:20:17,051 --> 02:20:17,850
we're,
they're drunk.

2959
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:18,770
That's the problem.
Yeah,

2960
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:22,050
the fucking party and they're listening 
to kid rock or on top of the room.

2961
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:25,200
We don't care.
We'll stay up here.

2962
02:20:25,410 --> 02:20:26,420
We got a boat.

2963
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:29,310
We're going to be fine.
We'll catch phase.

2964
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:33,140
There was an episode I was,
there was an episode I was on,

2965
02:20:33,141 --> 02:20:34,760
I don't know if it was the last time I 
was on or whatever,

2966
02:20:34,761 --> 02:20:38,240
but we were talking about floods in 
Houston and I showed you that,

2967
02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:39,103
that,
that,

2968
02:20:39,590 --> 02:20:42,890
that concrete or concrete pavement that 
sucks up water.

2969
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:44,313
I wonder if that would have been any 
help if they had implemented that like 

2970
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:49,970
all over the place.

2971
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:51,513
Maybe because I'm,
but I think the amount of water that 

2972
02:20:54,551 --> 02:20:56,680
we're dealing with just so 
unprecedented.

2973
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:59,890
They showed the difference between 
Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Harvey.

2974
02:20:59,891 --> 02:21:02,290
Like the sheer amount of volume of 
water.

2975
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:06,610
It's insane.
Like this was such a big,

2976
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:09,100
big hurricane.
That's just.

2977
02:21:10,470 --> 02:21:11,303
I wish there was a definitive answer as 
to if all this is a direct result of 

2978
02:21:17,381 --> 02:21:21,430
like human behavior industry,
car exhaust.

2979
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:24,400
I wished it was a definitive result 
where you could see it like,

2980
02:21:24,401 --> 02:21:27,460
yeah,
here's the number that you can show.

2981
02:21:27,580 --> 02:21:29,770
Will you show me here that concrete.
Oh,

2982
02:21:29,771 --> 02:21:33,070
the water drinking concrete where it's 
as I do that,

2983
02:21:34,550 --> 02:21:35,383
it's mad,
crazy absorbed runoff from fast floods 

2984
02:21:38,710 --> 02:21:41,060
if you're watching it folks,
the people that are just listening to it

2985
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:41,913
doesn't even seem real.
It's like they have this giant water 

2986
02:21:43,241 --> 02:21:44,074
truck and it's fucking pouring water all
over the concrete and it's just 

2987
02:21:47,921 --> 02:21:51,130
dissipating almost instantaneously into 
the concrete.

2988
02:21:51,550 --> 02:21:52,660
It's super weird.

2989
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:53,593
I wonder if it has like a basement and 
what it does is it goes through like 

2990
02:21:56,151 --> 02:21:58,730
kind of like a concrete filter it and 
goes underneath.

2991
02:21:58,731 --> 02:22:00,820
So the actual water is just like 
underneath.

2992
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:02,910
Yeah man,
what the fuck does.

2993
02:22:02,911 --> 02:22:03,744
It doesn't even seem real.
It seems like a scene in the terminator 

2994
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:07,350
movies,
you know?

2995
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:10,050
Yeah.
Well either way,

2996
02:22:10,051 --> 02:22:12,840
like what they dealt with in Houston is 
so much water.

2997
02:22:12,841 --> 02:22:14,130
I just doubt that.
I mean,

2998
02:22:14,131 --> 02:22:14,964
maybe that would have helped a little,
but I think that they're dealing with 

2999
02:22:17,251 --> 02:22:20,340
just some insane amount of water.
Is that it shows what it is,

3000
02:22:20,341 --> 02:22:22,320
Jamie.
It's like some sort of filtration system

3001
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:24,593
so it allows the water to go through it 
and it can tell you that for us it was 

3002
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:30,330
probably too much water.
Yeah.

3003
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:31,253
That harvey was a monster hurricane.
The crazy thing is how much bigger Irma 

3004
02:22:35,131 --> 02:22:37,440
is like.
I think we're numb to it.

3005
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:40,230
I think we look at it and it doesn't 
make sense to us.

3006
02:22:40,270 --> 02:22:41,103
You know,
at 185 miles sustained winds for over a 

3007
02:22:44,431 --> 02:22:45,330
day.
No,

3008
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:46,173
no,

3009
02:22:46,290 --> 02:22:47,123
no.
It's just going to start rolling like a 

3010
02:22:49,410 --> 02:22:51,740
cat.
No,

3011
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:53,920
but here's the thing,
right?

3012
02:22:54,010 --> 02:22:56,430
Is this the strongest they can get?
No thing.

3013
02:22:56,431 --> 02:22:59,910
It's stronger than the category that 
they attract.

3014
02:22:59,950 --> 02:23:00,783
This was the highest stayed,
gone and now this one is the new bar to 

3015
02:23:03,041 --> 02:23:03,874
be basically a delta airline 
accidentally flew through it yesterday 

3016
02:23:08,591 --> 02:23:11,290
by mistake and it got out at the last 
minute.

3017
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:14,320
I forgot.
I read that this morning when I woke up.

3018
02:23:14,590 --> 02:23:15,401
Got Out.
Yeah,

3019
02:23:15,401 --> 02:23:16,234
I guess it accidentally was flew into it
and it was in somehow it got out of the 

3020
02:23:19,810 --> 02:23:22,210
hurricane.
Is the pilot piloted his way out?

3021
02:23:22,211 --> 02:23:22,471
Yeah.
Yeah,

3022
02:23:22,471 --> 02:23:22,810
yeah,
yeah.

3023
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:23,531
Oh,
I thought you meant it.

3024
02:23:23,531 --> 02:23:27,970
Got Out the pilot.
Did delta pilot flew through Irma,

3025
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:30,570
one of those powerful hurricanes 
recording all 170,000

3026
02:23:30,571 --> 02:23:32,410
factories are safe.
Why would they do that?

3027
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:33,293
A No

3028
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:35,570
on the fly to Puerto Rico.
Oh,

3029
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:37,330
they had to.
They had to fly through it.

3030
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:42,130
Did they?
Did they fucking judge it wrong?

3031
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,560
Yeah,
they went through 185,000

3032
02:23:44,650 --> 02:23:47,530
mile an hour winds.
He imagined that turbulence.

3033
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:51,130
Well it's not that fast.
It's 187 miles an hour.

3034
02:23:51,131 --> 02:23:51,964
Right,
right.

3035
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:54,070
Fuck.
That thing is giant man.

3036
02:23:54,490 --> 02:23:56,070
When you see it on the ground or you 
know,

3037
02:23:56,110 --> 02:23:58,450
in one of those overhead maps and you 
realize how big it is.

3038
02:23:58,660 --> 02:24:01,180
Big.
That is so crazy.

3039
02:24:01,510 --> 02:24:06,510
So they flew through part of it.
Does it show trying to figure it out.

3040
02:24:07,950 --> 02:24:08,840
It's like,
yeah,

3041
02:24:08,890 --> 02:24:09,723
it's going right now.
Twenty five mile an hour winds gusting 

3042
02:24:12,941 --> 02:24:13,870
for 40.
See,

3043
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:14,870
look at it.

3044
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:19,430
Whoa.

3045
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:20,903
Hmm.

3046
02:24:22,010 --> 02:24:23,180
Huh.
So they were,

3047
02:24:23,210 --> 02:24:27,610
they were following realtime,
falling on a flight tracker.

3048
02:24:28,180 --> 02:24:29,900
Got Stuck in the actual.

3049
02:24:30,730 --> 02:24:32,220
Yeah.
Flew through the hurricane.

3050
02:24:33,450 --> 02:24:36,450
Oh my God.
That is insane.

3051
02:24:37,220 --> 02:24:38,110
Oh wait.
They landed.

3052
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:38,953
Hold on.
Fifty two minutes on the ground in San 

3053
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:42,330
Juan.
They landed and turned around.

3054
02:24:43,650 --> 02:24:47,160
Oh,
they tried to make it back out of sin.

3055
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:48,173
This is the airport has to climb out sj 
you and they're doing so between the 

3056
02:24:50,401 --> 02:24:52,470
outer band of Irma and the core of the 
storm.

3057
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:54,090
They went in between the bands.

3058
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:58,440
Oh my God,
I need needs to be hugged by everybody.

3059
02:24:59,010 --> 02:25:00,150
So he went in between

3060
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:02,510
bands and in doing.
Wow.

3061
02:25:02,511 --> 02:25:04,640
That's the most incredible thing about 
weather satellites.

3062
02:25:04,641 --> 02:25:05,474
They can literally navigate this guy 
through those bands and tell them like 

3063
02:25:08,990 --> 02:25:10,960
where the storm is ahead.
Yeah.

3064
02:25:10,970 --> 02:25:11,803
They haven't

3065
02:25:11,830 --> 02:25:12,663
a portable dopplers here now in Los 
Angeles to the where it's so accurate 

3066
02:25:16,041 --> 02:25:19,840
now that you can just see your street 
level of law,

3067
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:23,970
like if there's a clouded in from above,
you look

3068
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,813
at this while it looks terrifying.
Delta maintains that their pilots had 

3069
02:25:27,521 --> 02:25:28,354
everything under control.
Our meteorology team is the best in the 

3070
02:25:31,481 --> 02:25:33,190
business.
Eric's Snell,

3071
02:25:33,191 --> 02:25:35,940
vice president for Delta operations and 
customer centered,

3072
02:25:35,941 --> 02:25:38,650
told The Washington Post dl three.
Oh,

3073
02:25:38,651 --> 02:25:39,484
two departed San Juan with 173 
passengers on board according to Delta 

3074
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:45,740
Jesus Christ,

3075
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:48,230
Pr for them.
Of course,

3076
02:25:48,290 --> 02:25:51,200
being on that airplane probably was the 
worst flight you'll ever have.

3077
02:25:51,201 --> 02:25:52,034
Any really take a hard look at the 
weather data and the track of the storm 

3078
02:25:55,221 --> 02:25:56,054
and work with the flight crew and 
dispatcher to agree it was safe to 

3079
02:26:00,141 --> 02:26:02,510
operate the flight.
Would you do?

3080
02:26:02,511 --> 02:26:03,344
If you're about to get on that plane and
they're telling you what they're going 

3081
02:26:04,801 --> 02:26:06,110
to do?
Shit.

3082
02:26:06,170 --> 02:26:07,003
All over myself.
I probably say I'll stay at the airport 

3083
02:26:09,941 --> 02:26:11,580
and risk it.
Like,

3084
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:13,580
fuck this man.
I'm going to sleep.

3085
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:15,950
I'm gonna.
Take my backpack.

3086
02:26:15,951 --> 02:26:16,784
I'm sleeping on the ground.
I assumed that you guys turn this thing 

3087
02:26:19,611 --> 02:26:20,444
into some sort of a hurricane shelter.
Have you been to the airport in Puerto 

3088
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:23,421
Rico?
No,

3089
02:26:23,421 --> 02:26:24,254
I haven't been to the San Juan one,
but I was at s one on the other side of 

3090
02:26:26,331 --> 02:26:27,670
the island.
It's made of cardboard.

3091
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:29,620
Not One of those.
You're right.

3092
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:32,710
You're right.
Getting the plane.

3093
02:26:32,711 --> 02:26:34,700
It's like a rundown Burbank airport,

3094
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:37,450
but they got away with it.
Puerto Rico didn't get totally hit.

3095
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:39,940
They only got like a little piece of it.
Yeah.

3096
02:26:40,210 --> 02:26:41,043
Well that's the thing about these kinds 
of storms so you could just get unlucky 

3097
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:44,913
and it just runs right over your spot or
you can be right next to that and go 

3098
02:26:48,581 --> 02:26:50,770
lord was looking out for us like,
okay,

3099
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:53,140
you sure are you sure?
He just didn't get lucky.

3100
02:26:53,650 --> 02:26:56,740
Like we're dealing with impossible 
forces.

3101
02:26:57,310 --> 02:27:01,750
Like a hurricane.
The size of Ohio is an impossible for us

3102
02:27:01,751 --> 02:27:02,584
like that.
I don't think we really understand what 

3103
02:27:05,291 --> 02:27:06,124
the fuck that means.
I think that's one of those things that 

3104
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:09,210
when someone says a trillion billion 
dollars,

3105
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:10,240
like yeah,
that's a lot,

3106
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:12,040
but you don't really think about it.
You know,

3107
02:27:12,041 --> 02:27:12,874
you don't really,
really understand what that means 

3108
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:17,380
because too much the size of the 
universe too much.

3109
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:20,300
The power that that thing has,
it's just too much.

3110
02:27:20,301 --> 02:27:22,600
It doesn't make sense.
You'd have to see it.

3111
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:23,560
You'd have to be there.

3112
02:27:25,070 --> 02:27:27,260
Do you see the video?
I don't know if it's real either,

3113
02:27:27,290 --> 02:27:28,123
but the video of A.
I don't know if it was today's 

3114
02:27:30,051 --> 02:27:33,200
hurricane,
this guy's trying to hold his truck,

3115
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:34,333
like he had like a pickup truck trying 
to hold it so it doesn't tip over and 

3116
02:27:38,570 --> 02:27:39,403
the winds were so strong.
He just gets squished by hard to see 

3117
02:27:42,290 --> 02:27:44,600
because it was raining so hard,
but it's got to be crazy.

3118
02:27:44,601 --> 02:27:45,434
Why would he do that?
A truck is about to flip and you think 

3119
02:27:48,531 --> 02:27:51,170
you've got to stop it with your hands.
He watched too many movies.

3120
02:27:51,171 --> 02:27:54,350
Motherfucker can pick up a truck.
Can you pick up a truck?

3121
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:56,570
No.
Then get the fuck out of there.

3122
02:27:56,630 --> 02:27:59,150
Put this on Youtube,
but we can watch it.

3123
02:27:59,270 --> 02:28:00,410
What is it?
Oh,

3124
02:28:00,411 --> 02:28:01,820
this is the guy.
Oh Jesus.

3125
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,170
Oh Dude,
that's a wrap.

3126
02:28:04,650 --> 02:28:05,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

3127
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:08,190
He's crazy.
That guy's crazy.

3128
02:28:08,610 --> 02:28:10,860
Look at that thing.
Fucking in the breeze.

3129
02:28:10,861 --> 02:28:12,420
You should've got outta there,
man.

3130
02:28:14,190 --> 02:28:15,540
Just sandwiched.
Yeah.

3131
02:28:15,541 --> 02:28:17,130
He got crushed.
He didn't handle it.

3132
02:28:17,131 --> 02:28:19,410
Well,
now you can't get out from under that.

3133
02:28:19,411 --> 02:28:20,730
That's too much weight.
You're dead.

3134
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:22,670
Fuck.

3135
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:26,590
It says fast ones.
I get me like that guy.

3136
02:28:26,591 --> 02:28:29,280
I probably just was like,
oh well my trucks and about boom,

3137
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:30,471
you're dead.
Well,

3138
02:28:30,471 --> 02:28:31,304
the thing about these kinds of 
hurricanes are how many of them can you 

3139
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:39,120
get in a row because if they're saying 
there's two more in a row behind Irma,

3140
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:45,770
2005,
I think it was they got hit for like for

3141
02:28:45,771 --> 02:28:46,604
Florida got hit like four times in a row
and like do you have a decent every 

3142
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:51,340
week?
Those were like twos and threes.

3143
02:28:51,341 --> 02:28:56,270
These are fives and you know Jose.
Jose is going right for Washington DC.

3144
02:28:57,310 --> 02:29:00,740
Hurricane Jose.
Jose is going gonna be a big one.

3145
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:03,140
Do you think so we're going to do or 
what have you been hit?

3146
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:06,260
United States I'm worried about.
I'm all man.

3147
02:29:06,261 --> 02:29:08,660
I'm worried about earthquakes.
I'm worried about asteroids.

3148
02:29:08,661 --> 02:29:09,494
I'm worried about super volcanoes.
We're dealing with a small amount of 

3149
02:29:13,701 --> 02:29:14,030
history.

3150
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:14,863
That's what's going on.
I mean especially when it comes to 

3151
02:29:16,341 --> 02:29:18,590
whether or history or the weather's like
what?

3152
02:29:18,690 --> 02:29:20,460
Couple hundred years old.
Like what's,

3153
02:29:20,490 --> 02:29:23,000
what's our recorded history of the 
weather.

3154
02:29:24,550 --> 02:29:27,710
But if you had to guess what's our 
recorded history of the weather?

3155
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:29,900
18,
78.

3156
02:29:30,110 --> 02:29:32,660
That sounds good.
I'm saying something like that.

3157
02:29:32,750 --> 02:29:34,430
I'm saying somewhere around like 200 
years.

3158
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:36,740
They started figuring it out.
Does that make sense?

3159
02:29:36,770 --> 02:29:40,790
Yeah.
Eight stuffed down around Columbus where

3160
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:44,270
they said 300 years and eight slash 18 
slash 16.

3161
02:29:44,470 --> 02:29:45,303
I wonder when that can measure though.
Like when they knew they knew when they 

3162
02:29:47,301 --> 02:29:48,380
were cold,
like fuck,

3163
02:29:48,381 --> 02:29:50,990
it's cold out one the one they knew what
that meant though.

3164
02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:51,943
Like if there was a number,
I guess we needed tools also to track 

3165
02:29:54,231 --> 02:29:55,064
that rafter I've now seen in the year.
It makes way more sense what I just 

3166
02:29:57,171 --> 02:29:58,070
found.
So,

3167
02:29:58,650 --> 02:30:01,010
um,
the invention of the thermometer.

3168
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:03,510
When was that?
I don't.

3169
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:04,520
Well,
I'll look that up too.

3170
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:07,820
I'm a guest.
Seventeen 55.

3171
02:30:08,660 --> 02:30:10,850
That's good one.
I would say eight.

3172
02:30:11,150 --> 02:30:12,110
10,
12,

3173
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:13,033
18,
12.

3174
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:16,370
You're probably right.
It's probably more a more recent than we

3175
02:30:16,371 --> 02:30:20,150
think of mercury on the Fahrenheit 
scale.

3176
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:23,390
17 and 24.
But the first recorded temperature,

3177
02:30:23,391 --> 02:30:28,300
it says here was 1880.
Oh Wow.

3178
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:29,690
In 78.
It was two years off.

3179
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:32,600
That's amazing.
She probably had to have something,

3180
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:33,493
touch it back then.
Touch the mercury and how they figured 

3181
02:30:35,961 --> 02:30:36,651
out what.
I mean,

3182
02:30:36,651 --> 02:30:39,110
look,
we can't even agree on the metric system

3183
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:39,973
versus inches.
What's interesting there then if that 

3184
02:30:41,391 --> 02:30:45,110
was the first time they get ever 
actually calculate the degrees.

3185
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:48,950
Did they have measurement for degrees 
before that?

3186
02:30:48,951 --> 02:30:51,050
Did they have like temperature 
measurements before that?

3187
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:53,023
Like what did they use?
Like when they were talking about like 

3188
02:30:54,810 --> 02:30:56,870
how hot is a fire,
like what did they use?

3189
02:30:58,190 --> 02:31:03,190
They have no idea how they touched it.
That's super hot.

3190
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:06,260
Oh that ice is cold.
Like did they have any idea?

3191
02:31:06,261 --> 02:31:08,810
Like did they even describe it in 
measurement and eight.

3192
02:31:08,910 --> 02:31:13,760
The clinical thermometer wasn't invented
until 18.

3193
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:15,440
80 18,
66.

3194
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:18,050
It was probably some dude with a regular
thermometer just stuck it up his ass.

3195
02:31:18,350 --> 02:31:21,030
Somebody caught him and he was like,
I'll probably just making sure that this

3196
02:31:21,031 --> 02:31:21,864
thing works on people.
I said five minutes instead of 20 

3197
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:27,270
because it was up his ass.
Heated it up.

3198
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:29,483
That's a 99.
They started in 1999 is when the 

3199
02:31:32,701 --> 02:31:36,180
forehead thermometer came out and that 
1999.

3200
02:31:36,210 --> 02:31:37,740
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

3201
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:40,560
I like this first temporal artery 
thermometer.

3202
02:31:40,650 --> 02:31:41,483
Nineteen 99.
That's the one you put it on your 

3203
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:43,910
forehead,
right?

3204
02:31:43,910 --> 02:31:45,900
That's nuts.
That's just happened.

3205
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:48,210
The crazy thing is

3206
02:31:48,210 --> 02:31:51,990
the idea that before the thermometer,
they didn't really have a number.

3207
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:54,450
When they were talking about things 
being cold or hot,

3208
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:56,153
like did they.
When did they invent units of 

3209
02:31:58,981 --> 02:32:02,310
measurement for temperature?
When was that invented?

3210
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,943
Right here.
Because obviously there's more than one 

3211
02:32:05,250 --> 02:32:06,083
right there.
Celsius and there's Fahrenheit and 

3212
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:09,263
Celsius is the one that's based on the 
metric system that's used by almost 

3213
02:32:11,701 --> 02:32:15,450
everybody except for us.
We're fucking assholes,

3214
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:17,430
you know,
they'll,

3215
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:18,450
they'll say something like,
oh,

3216
02:32:18,451 --> 02:32:19,710
it's 35 degrees out,
and I'm like,

3217
02:32:19,711 --> 02:32:21,060
what are you talking about?
That's not hot.

3218
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:22,171
And you're,
oh,

3219
02:32:22,171 --> 02:32:24,430
your Celsius is.
What is that like 80

3220
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,320
and 35 degrees.
It's hot as fuck.

3221
02:32:27,321 --> 02:32:28,154
Right.
That'd be cool if we all had the same 

3222
02:32:28,971 --> 02:32:30,800
name,
like currency also.

3223
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:32,940
It just costs more in different places.
I went,

3224
02:32:32,941 --> 02:32:33,774
why?
Why don't we just make everything 

3225
02:32:34,701 --> 02:32:35,534
easier?
I'm everything because everybody's 

3226
02:32:36,951 --> 02:32:37,784
corrupt and if we were all together,
someone would fuck us up and we would 

3227
02:32:42,411 --> 02:32:45,350
lose all the money.
Someone would siphon all the money up.

3228
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:46,583
They would,
they would weasel their way through the 

3229
02:32:47,481 --> 02:32:50,330
whole batch of it if we have a bunch of 
different factions,

3230
02:32:50,470 --> 02:32:53,340
a bunch of different languages.
Everybody's sort of keeps peace.

3231
02:32:53,341 --> 02:32:56,440
Hey,
and know like super wizard,

3232
02:32:56,770 --> 02:32:57,603
you know,
a despicable me character comes along 

3233
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:02,583
and hijacks the entire system.
The earliest recorded system of weights 

3234
02:33:05,441 --> 02:33:07,840
and measurements.
What does it say about temperature?

3235
02:33:08,290 --> 02:33:10,120
I don't know,
but I mean Ted temperature take awhile.

3236
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:11,003
Yeah.
But history of measurement is not what 

3237
02:33:11,641 --> 02:33:14,710
I'm asking because I know that they've 
had scales for a long time,

3238
02:33:14,711 --> 02:33:19,711
but like what about when was the unit of
measurement for temperature invented?

3239
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:23,700
Got Length,
typographical math time.

3240
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:24,743
It doesn't say temperature.
Well somebody had been like not have it 

3241
02:33:28,861 --> 02:33:32,130
and then they had.
It must be a day.

3242
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:33,003
Right?
And it probably would have started like 

3243
02:33:34,890 --> 02:33:37,590
this is the temperature of red dead 
raven or something like that.

3244
02:33:37,591 --> 02:33:41,250
And this is a snake in 16,
59.

3245
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:43,400
Wow.
England temperature.

3246
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:46,160
Wow.
So what did they use to measure it?

3247
02:33:47,270 --> 02:33:49,880
What the fuck did they use to measure it
if they didn't have thermometers?

3248
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,460
God Damn,
it's Freaky,

3249
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:54,320
right?
I mean,

3250
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:57,530
imagine not having a thermometer and 
trying to measure the heat.

3251
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:59,093
Sounds like your inner dialogue of you 
at night at three in the morning I got 

3252
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:05,380
fucking problems,
dude.

3253
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:06,283
Especially if I smoke a joint,
it's crazy how normal life can seem and 

3254
02:34:09,441 --> 02:34:10,550
then you smoke a joint.
You're like,

3255
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:12,420
oh no,
it's not normal at all.

3256
02:34:12,421 --> 02:34:17,421
It's so crazy.
A hundred percent life seems so normal.

3257
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,300
And so like,
you know,

3258
02:34:19,301 --> 02:34:20,170
hey,
what's up neighbor?

3259
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:21,033
How's everybody doing?
And then you smoke a joint and just 

3260
02:34:22,931 --> 02:34:23,764
watch a little bit of news about aroma,
about any of these things are more 

3261
02:34:28,930 --> 02:34:29,980
freaked me out.
The other night,

3262
02:34:29,981 --> 02:34:31,750
man,
I made one of them 2:00

3263
02:34:31,751 --> 02:34:32,584
in the morning instagram posts.
I was just going online and looking at 

3264
02:34:35,651 --> 02:34:36,640
storm footage.
I was like,

3265
02:34:36,641 --> 02:34:39,910
what are these?
Just keep hitting over and over and over

3266
02:34:39,911 --> 02:34:40,930
and over and over.

3267
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:42,173
Yeah.
I watched a documentary about our coral 

3268
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:44,523
and our oceans dying recently and it 
freaked me the fuck out and it's all 

3269
02:34:47,641 --> 02:34:49,940
based on like two degrees of temperature
that,

3270
02:34:49,950 --> 02:34:50,783
that it's doing.
Like the oceans are two degrees hotter 

3271
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:53,640
and I was like,
wait,

3272
02:34:53,700 --> 02:34:57,420
there's like 8 billion people.
Can we just all throw ice into the ocean

3273
02:34:57,421 --> 02:34:58,590
at the same time?
It would probably.

3274
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:01,610
It thought that through.
I said that last night it was a job.

3275
02:35:01,650 --> 02:35:02,360
Somebody,

3276
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:05,320
you know,
what we could do though for real is um,

3277
02:35:05,850 --> 02:35:10,850
apparently wearing sunscreen and the 
water is fucking terrible for coral and,

3278
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:13,560
and people don't give a shit.
Oh,

3279
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:15,300
it's like an oil.
Never thought about that.

3280
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:18,610
Chemical Sunscreen,
whatever that stuff is,

3281
02:35:19,310 --> 02:35:20,150
is,
it's

3282
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,193
weird.
It's like the face beats scrubs that we 

3283
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:24,920
can't destroy.
Right.

3284
02:35:25,170 --> 02:35:26,001
There's a little.
Yeah,

3285
02:35:26,001 --> 02:35:28,340
those things it get stuck in your drain.
Yeah.

3286
02:35:28,670 --> 02:35:32,450
But um,
that stuff that they use for sunscreen,

3287
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:37,520
like how good is that for your skin to 
spray that chemical on there?

3288
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:38,473
I never use sunscreen.
I have to use it because of my vitol I 

3289
02:35:41,211 --> 02:35:44,030
go because of the different colors in my
hand.

3290
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:44,893
Like if otherwise it's like,
it's like if you're a white guy that a 

3291
02:35:47,251 --> 02:35:50,070
logo is not nearly as obvious as if 
you're a black guy,

3292
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:51,290
right?
Black people have it.

3293
02:35:51,291 --> 02:35:52,124
It's like it's crazy.
Contrast and if I don't do it also like 

3294
02:35:55,580 --> 02:35:59,060
I wore this pigment in those areas,
so if I don't have pigment like where my

3295
02:35:59,061 --> 02:36:01,370
fingers are like and that shit gets 
cancer,

3296
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:04,760
you don't have anything that's blocking 
skin cancer.

3297
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:09,830
So we're like backwards dice gloves to 
Michael Jackson gloves.

3298
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:14,270
The conclusion from the media is 
sunscreen is killing the world's coral.

3299
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:15,543
That's laughable.
Like it says right here that 10 percent 

3300
02:36:17,871 --> 02:36:18,704
of the global reefs are at at least only
10 percent and many of them are remote 

3301
02:36:22,761 --> 02:36:24,950
and without tourists that even getting 
near them.

3302
02:36:25,460 --> 02:36:28,490
And that study was done with artificial 
seawater.

3303
02:36:28,850 --> 02:36:32,090
So that study is bullshit maybe.
And this was also a mashable.

3304
02:36:32,091 --> 02:36:32,924
So man,
I read stuff like that and the Eddie 

3305
02:36:35,271 --> 02:36:36,710
Bravo,
Alex Jones comes out,

3306
02:36:36,711 --> 02:36:37,544
me and I'm like,
who the fuck is paying for that article 

3307
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:40,610
in here?

3308
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:45,490
Fucking sunscreen industry bro.
How much money's in sunscreen bro?

3309
02:36:46,210 --> 02:36:47,043
Fucking mom,
who loves their kids put sunscreen on 

3310
02:36:49,601 --> 02:36:51,100
their baby,
Bro.

3311
02:36:52,110 --> 02:36:54,790
Tell people.
Start thinking maybe they're right.

3312
02:36:55,330 --> 02:36:58,120
It's hard to know who's fucking telling 
the truth.

3313
02:36:58,540 --> 02:37:01,630
There's too much fake news.

3314
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:05,480
That guy's crazy.
GCS Don't know why.

3315
02:37:05,481 --> 02:37:08,210
Son Ran into the,
to his death in the burning man fire.

3316
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:11,270
I'm going to guess drugs.
Definitely acid.

3317
02:37:11,370 --> 02:37:14,740
They had security around it too,
as what I was reading in bed.

3318
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:15,890
Who knows?
Man.

3319
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,900
That's sad though.
It's fucking sad.

3320
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:20,420
It's a sad way to die.
And he tripped.

3321
02:37:20,660 --> 02:37:21,400
He did?
Yeah.

3322
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:22,110
Like,
like,

3323
02:37:22,110 --> 02:37:24,290
like he was so fucked up.
Maybe he didn't see,

3324
02:37:24,291 --> 02:37:27,100
but he tripped him into the fire.
Oh No.

3325
02:37:27,170 --> 02:37:30,710
The next picture shows him like falling.
I don't want to see this out loud,

3326
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:31,603
dude.
Poor Dude said he looks like every dude 

3327
02:37:35,210 --> 02:37:38,180
at burning man has got that,
you know,

3328
02:37:38,181 --> 02:37:41,750
like new new age hippie look.
That's a sad way to diamond.

3329
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,000
That's sad.
[inaudible] story.

3330
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:48,290
And you would hope that he didn't have 
like a mental issue and then took a drug

3331
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:52,550
and then had that episode.
You know,

3332
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:53,713
people that are like,
we're reality's already slippery for 

3333
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:56,474
them.
Like really strong psychedelics not 

3334
02:37:58,431 --> 02:37:59,700
recommended.
Yeah.

3335
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:02,060
But he could've just been that fucked 
up.

3336
02:38:02,090 --> 02:38:04,910
And you have a big burning man in front 
of you.

3337
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:05,773
Like I,
I had been that fucked where I could 

3338
02:38:07,090 --> 02:38:09,620
have thought that I was running into ice
cream or something.

3339
02:38:09,830 --> 02:38:10,700
Yeah,
for sure.

3340
02:38:10,701 --> 02:38:12,500
Right.
That's a problem with psychedelics.

3341
02:38:12,570 --> 02:38:15,650
Yeah,
and it's also the problem with a look.

3342
02:38:16,130 --> 02:38:20,170
Everybody's reactions to these things 
got to be like elite,

3343
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:21,410
slightly different.
Right.

3344
02:38:21,740 --> 02:38:22,573
And some people just aren't designed for
them for maybe one style of 

3345
02:38:25,911 --> 02:38:26,744
psychedelics.
It's like some people aren't designed 

3346
02:38:27,501 --> 02:38:28,334
for alcohol.
Some people did just dish it and drink 

3347
02:38:30,410 --> 02:38:33,710
doesn't work with them.
Who knows what happened,

3348
02:38:33,711 --> 02:38:34,760
but that's fucked.
Man.

3349
02:38:34,761 --> 02:38:35,594
Imagined being there and watching that 
kid running into the fire and just be 

3350
02:38:38,571 --> 02:38:39,950
thinking like,
is this real?

3351
02:38:40,070 --> 02:38:43,600
Is it really running into the fire?
You're all fucked up anyway.

3352
02:38:43,810 --> 02:38:45,650
You're not sober.
You're not.

3353
02:38:45,651 --> 02:38:46,484
Even if you were sober,
you'd probably feel like you were on 

3354
02:38:48,111 --> 02:38:48,944
drugs.
You're around all these people that are 

3355
02:38:50,061 --> 02:38:50,894
tripping balls.
You're watching this thing burst into 

3356
02:38:52,971 --> 02:38:54,830
fire and then you watch a guy run into 
the fire.

3357
02:38:54,831 --> 02:38:55,910
You're probably like,
what is this?

3358
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:57,530
Is this a movie?
Like,

3359
02:38:57,531 --> 02:38:58,364
what the fuck is happening here?
Whenever there's like an extraordinary 

3360
02:39:02,061 --> 02:39:03,920
event like that,
you always feel like it's not real.

3361
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:05,270
Like what,
what,

3362
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:08,400
what's happening?
Like I don't expect this guy to run into

3363
02:39:08,401 --> 02:39:09,980
the fire,
see someone running the fire.

3364
02:39:09,981 --> 02:39:13,490
Did he run into the fire?
Like your brain is scrambling so hard to

3365
02:39:13,491 --> 02:39:15,710
process it.
That's why they say that.

3366
02:39:15,711 --> 02:39:17,000
Um,
people,

3367
02:39:17,070 --> 02:39:18,160
uh,
there,

3368
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:21,440
when they see something fucked up 
happened through eyewitness accounts are

3369
02:39:21,441 --> 02:39:22,274
so bad because so many people like they 
don't even remember what the hell 

3370
02:39:24,351 --> 02:39:26,540
happened there.
Just so shattered by it all.

3371
02:39:26,541 --> 02:39:27,500
Like what?
Yeah,

3372
02:39:30,790 --> 02:39:34,140
saw a story about a kid,
I think he's in the,

3373
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:37,170
like the juvenile penal system in New 
York or something,

3374
02:39:37,171 --> 02:39:41,520
but he's been used by the system to 
convict like 35 people or something that

3375
02:39:41,521 --> 02:39:42,354
didn't do anything wrong.
And like the article was about the shit 

3376
02:39:45,331 --> 02:39:46,260
he's dealing with.

3377
02:39:46,740 --> 02:39:48,360
He's being used how

3378
02:39:48,510 --> 02:39:49,343
I'll pull it up real quick because he's,
he's done something in like probably 

3379
02:39:52,021 --> 02:39:54,270
they're using him to get his sentence 
reduced.

3380
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:56,540
Oh.
So he sets other people up.

3381
02:39:56,570 --> 02:39:58,220
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3382
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:59,383
That's the weird one that they're 
allowed to have fake crime and arrest 

3383
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:02,983
you for it,
but the FBI has done that with people 

3384
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:05,173
like talk someone into making a bomb and
then they give them the parts and then 

3385
02:40:08,691 --> 02:40:09,524
they give them the bomb and then they 
like tell them to go somewhere and blow 

3386
02:40:11,361 --> 02:40:12,220
it up,
and they do it.

3387
02:40:12,221 --> 02:40:14,340
Then they arrest them.
You're not allowed to do that.

3388
02:40:14,341 --> 02:40:15,174
Right.
That's how are you allowed to fish 

3389
02:40:16,621 --> 02:40:17,730
people?
They are.

3390
02:40:17,731 --> 02:40:18,900
They're allowed to.
Man.

3391
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:21,570
That's like the old hooker thing,
like you have to.

3392
02:40:21,880 --> 02:40:22,713
Yeah,
it is.

3393
02:40:22,740 --> 02:40:24,420
Yeah.
They talk you into it.

3394
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:26,640
Yeah.
It's a.

3395
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:29,580
But they're allowed to do that now.
It's not like it used to be.

3396
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:31,350
What does that term that I'm looking 
for?

3397
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,690
The old hooker thing.
Seduction,

3398
02:40:34,410 --> 02:40:34,891
right?
No,

3399
02:40:34,891 --> 02:40:35,540
that's not even it.

3400
02:40:35,540 --> 02:40:36,480
No.
No entrapment.

3401
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:37,440
Entrapment.
Entrapment.

3402
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:38,340
Yeah.
Yeah,

3403
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:42,000
but they're allowed to do that.
Now there's A.

3404
02:40:42,090 --> 02:40:42,923
I mean the,
the slippery slope is definitely going 

3405
02:40:45,781 --> 02:40:48,420
in the wrong direction.
Like you're allowed to.

3406
02:40:48,421 --> 02:40:50,730
Like you could take a really 
impressionable guy.

3407
02:40:50,731 --> 02:40:54,390
There was one guy they did it to in 
Texas that was supposed to be.

3408
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:56,513
He was very mentally challenged.
It wasn't a very smart guy and this is 

3409
02:40:59,151 --> 02:40:59,984
the guy that they talked into a trying 
to detonate this fake bomb that they'd 

3410
02:41:03,901 --> 02:41:06,270
given them and then they arrested.
Oh Wow.

3411
02:41:06,450 --> 02:41:07,283
That's really fucked up dude.
Who was like super troubled and they 

3412
02:41:10,231 --> 02:41:12,770
just didn't need it or resigned.
Fuck them.

3413
02:41:13,690 --> 02:41:16,380
You know you can mind.
Fuck someone in the name of religion.

3414
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:17,670
You can mind.
Fuck someone.

3415
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:20,610
He's a lot of different ways.
If you were a.

3416
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:23,070
especially you got to think like the 
FBI.

3417
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:24,073
It's like super powerful organization of
people that have had decades of 

3418
02:41:28,411 --> 02:41:29,244
experience in the field know how to 
handle people know how to deal with 

3419
02:41:31,951 --> 02:41:32,784
weird shit.

3420
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:36,030
That Manson Shit's about to get 
released.

3421
02:41:36,031 --> 02:41:40,050
I wonder how she's gone about.
She's going to hurt in there please.

3422
02:41:40,070 --> 02:41:40,903
I know.
And she's not gonna know any of this 

3423
02:41:41,821 --> 02:41:43,620
technology.
Imagine that thing.

3424
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:45,360
Yeah.
She killed a pregnant lady,

3425
02:41:45,361 --> 02:41:46,194
right?
Isn't she one of the ones that was the 

3426
02:41:47,130 --> 02:41:49,290
tate labianca killings.
Yeah.

3427
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,160
Wasn't she?
She.

3428
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:52,230
She was the youngest.
She was the cheerleader.

3429
02:41:52,231 --> 02:41:54,860
How old was she?
I want to say she.

3430
02:41:54,920 --> 02:41:56,180
17.
Jesus.

3431
02:41:56,190 --> 02:41:59,340
I don't remember if it was late sixties 
now,

3432
02:41:59,341 --> 02:42:04,290
like imagine that life going from being 
a young teenager to your entire life.

3433
02:42:04,291 --> 02:42:06,030
You're in a cage and then all of a 
sudden it's.

3434
02:42:06,031 --> 02:42:07,400
You're an old lady.
They go,

3435
02:42:07,401 --> 02:42:09,330
go ahead,
get out for a little bit.

3436
02:42:09,331 --> 02:42:10,430
You're like,
fuck.

3437
02:42:10,530 --> 02:42:14,040
Like that's a crazy documentary waiting 
to happen.

3438
02:42:14,041 --> 02:42:14,874
I hope someone studying or help.
There's like a good documentary person 

3439
02:42:17,431 --> 02:42:18,600
that's on that.
Yeah,

3440
02:42:18,810 --> 02:42:19,670
because that's a curve.

3441
02:42:19,770 --> 02:42:22,230
Raisie documentary.
I mean who does she live with?

3442
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:24,180
Like maybe and filmmakers like,
hey,

3443
02:42:24,181 --> 02:42:28,620
you can stay in my van nuys one bedroom 
apartment if I can record everything and

3444
02:42:29,960 --> 02:42:31,740
have some sort of a pay site.
Right.

3445
02:42:32,110 --> 02:42:32,943
The Manson House,
she turns it into a cam whore Manson 

3446
02:42:35,311 --> 02:42:37,150
house.
To be a camera,

3447
02:42:37,310 --> 02:42:38,143
have to get out of jail for murder and 
you're going to have the tightest pussy 

3448
02:42:40,681 --> 02:42:42,840
known to man.
I don't know about all that.

3449
02:42:42,841 --> 02:42:45,870
She's probably been sticking hammers on 
there for last 20 years.

3450
02:42:47,270 --> 02:42:49,110
It's just been locked up for a long 
time.

3451
02:42:49,610 --> 02:42:53,160
Who knows what's going on in their fist 
when for sure.

3452
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:54,053
Definitely a few,
few different fists over the last 35 

3453
02:42:56,821 --> 02:42:57,654
plus years.
Like when would the see the Manson 

3454
02:42:59,161 --> 02:43:01,380
killings was probably like 45,
50 years ago,

3455
02:43:01,381 --> 02:43:02,214
right?
Wasn't it?

3456
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:04,650
It was the sixties,
Seventies.

3457
02:43:05,310 --> 02:43:06,910
Was it not?
I don't think it was a seven day.

3458
02:43:07,230 --> 02:43:11,040
It was maybe tate labianca murders 
Manson.

3459
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:12,340
Nine 69.

3460
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:13,900
Sixty nine.
A lot of shit.

3461
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:19,260
Woodstock wasn't that when Hendrix died?
Did he die in 69?

3462
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:22,960
That picture was in or that.
That thinks the 69 on it.

3463
02:43:23,350 --> 02:43:24,183
May third.

3464
02:43:25,550 --> 02:43:28,210
Want to say he died in 69 or 70,
but I don't remember.

3465
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:31,900
People really do remember that and they 
get Super Mad.

3466
02:43:31,901 --> 02:43:34,780
If you don't know bro.
July 27th,

3467
02:43:34,990 --> 02:43:35,980
19,
68.

3468
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:39,070
Don't ever fucked that up again.
It's Jimmy hunters.

3469
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:42,190
It's like John Goodman's character in 
the big Lebowski.

3470
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:47,680
Could just ask Syria,
but when he died,

3471
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:49,243
good.
Ask Siri.

3472
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:52,510
When did Jimi Hendrix die?

3473
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:57,070
Jimi Hendrix died September 18th.
Nineteen 70.

3474
02:43:57,170 --> 02:44:00,610
Who off by?
I found out recently.

3475
02:44:00,611 --> 02:44:02,380
There's a.
there's a building.

3476
02:44:02,381 --> 02:44:03,214
It's still there on Franklin and 
Hollywood where Charles Manson used to 

3477
02:44:05,831 --> 02:44:09,160
live and run his words out of which I 
didn't know he was doing.

3478
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:10,060
He was a pimp.
Yeah.

3479
02:44:10,061 --> 02:44:13,540
Pimping girls to people that are staying
at the roosevelt color.

3480
02:44:13,541 --> 02:44:14,374
Me Badd.
Right?

3481
02:44:18,830 --> 02:44:22,890
Mind.
Perfect color me badd.

3482
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:26,950
Remind.
I love click though.

3483
02:44:27,030 --> 02:44:29,040
Those are great and it can make a nice 
mug.

3484
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:32,080
Yep.
Painted a dolphin last time I say.

3485
02:44:32,320 --> 02:44:33,330
All right.
We should wrap this up.

3486
02:44:33,690 --> 02:44:35,550
I gotta get the fuck out of here.
I got a bunch of shit to do,

3487
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:38,030
boys.
It's been a lot of fun.

3488
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:39,410
Uh,
Brian got shows coming up.

3489
02:44:39,411 --> 02:44:40,221
I know you do.
Yeah.

3490
02:44:40,221 --> 02:44:41,054
November eighth.
I'll be at Marty's in Indianapolis with 

3491
02:44:42,851 --> 02:44:43,730
a club,
Quigley.

3492
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:46,670
And then the following day,
November ninth,

3493
02:44:46,671 --> 02:44:48,620
I'll be at the funny bone in Columbus,
Ohio.

3494
02:44:48,710 --> 02:44:50,030
And then maybe New York.
Dude,

3495
02:44:50,031 --> 02:44:52,530
I like that you're going out on the road
like just you and one other person.

3496
02:44:52,531 --> 02:44:53,120
I mean,
Kate,

3497
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:55,050
that's a smart move,
man.

3498
02:44:55,051 --> 02:44:56,810
That's great way to build your act to 
right?

3499
02:44:56,811 --> 02:44:57,590
Yeah.
It's fun.

3500
02:44:57,590 --> 02:44:59,420
Get Nice.
And we're doing,

3501
02:44:59,421 --> 02:45:01,190
like,
I just got back from the mall of America

3502
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:04,130
and Edmonton did seven shows in five 
days.

3503
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:06,770
That was a workout that's like the best.
Yeah.

3504
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:07,753
You get tightened up,
you know Brendan Schaub saying that to 

3505
02:45:09,501 --> 02:45:11,150
me after he got back from Dublin and he 
was like,

3506
02:45:11,151 --> 02:45:12,500
dude,
you just all those reps.

3507
02:45:12,501 --> 02:45:13,640
I'm like,
that's what it's all about.

3508
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:16,130
You get those four or five set a 
weekend,

3509
02:45:16,590 --> 02:45:17,750
weekends and you're like,
whew,

3510
02:45:17,770 --> 02:45:19,190
got it tight.
So great.

3511
02:45:19,550 --> 02:45:20,460
And every,
every,

3512
02:45:20,461 --> 02:45:21,294
you know,
sometimes you have two nights or two 

3513
02:45:21,951 --> 02:45:23,450
shows a night and then you just,
hey,

3514
02:45:23,451 --> 02:45:26,510
I want to fix this in my,
like instant gratification.

3515
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:27,800
