00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,360
Well,

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,350
one of the most interesting things
that I learned from the injury was,

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,520
was how,

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,880
how your physical health or wellbeing
alters your perception of the world.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,880
Like I um,

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,170
have you ever heard of the study?

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,670
They do like the hot and Cold Cup study
where they have someone come in to fill

9
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,570
out a survey,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,931
you know,

11
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,830
that's what they tell them.

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,730
And then a person gets
in an elevator and they,

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,120
uh,

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,541
and there's,

15
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:30,960
uh,

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,270
there's someone in there like confederate,

17
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:35,430
an actor is in there that's like,

18
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,000
here I,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,751
my hands are full.

20
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,100
Could you hold this cup for me?

21
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,560
And it's either like a hot
cup of coffee or whatever,

22
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,530
or a cold drink and the person says,

23
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,740
sure takes the drink,

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,300
goes up the elevator,

25
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,134
gets off,

26
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,580
gives it back to them,

27
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,610
you know,

28
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,570
says Bob goes in and takes the
survey and then afterwards,

29
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,400
and this is what it's actually about.

30
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,481
Afterwards they go,

31
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,320
did you meet anyone?

32
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,730
And the way in.

33
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,090
And I,

34
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,190
of actually someone I met someone
in the elevator and then they'll,

35
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,771
they'll be like,

36
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:02,604
so,

37
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,420
uh,

38
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,990
can you,

39
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,340
can you describe that person?

40
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,210
And if they had,

41
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,860
if they had the hot drink,

42
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,750
they'll,

43
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,360
uh,

44
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,590
they were more,

45
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,460
um,

46
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,000
they would more often describe them
as being like warm or friendly.

47
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,650
And if they had the cold drink they would,

48
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,610
they would describe
them as cold or distant.

49
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,003
And,

50
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,940
and the idea is,

51
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:22,774
is that,

52
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,251
that,

53
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,060
um,

54
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,680
that the way our brains
evolved kind of these,

55
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,390
these higher ideas of,

56
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,920
of what like being distant
as a personality trait or
whatever means he has to be

57
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,430
built over this preexisting kind
of a five senses kind of software.

58
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,740
And um,

59
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,680
and so,

60
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,120
so there's all these metaphors for,

61
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,470
so you call someone like bright or you
say we're having a deep conversation or

62
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,550
someone's shallow.

63
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,480
So a lot of these ways in
which we describe life is,

64
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,860
is kind of used through
these physical metaphors.

65
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,150
And I remember when I,

66
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,650
when I broke my feet,

67
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,870
I remember thinking the whole
fucking world is broken.

68
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,250
Like I remember thinking like eyes on
eyes going down this mountain for like

69
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,084
three,

70
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,043
three hours.

71
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,090
And I wasn't just worried about my feet.

72
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:20,091
Eyes also like in the political system
is like everything just seemed broken

73
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:25,371
like the whole world and then I also
remember after I got the second surgery,

74
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:28,470
after the bone infection and stuff
and having to change all of this,

75
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:33,471
I remember feeling like like something
like this nagging feeling that I couldn't

76
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:36,181
get over.

77
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:36,460
I was like,

78
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,300
something's missing from my life.

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,710
There's just this deep,

80
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:41,920
like whole,

81
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,310
like somewhere in my soul in my leg.

82
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,810
And then one day I realized I'm like,

83
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,021
oh,

84
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,370
there's a fucking hole in my foot.

85
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,220
There's an actual hole in my foot.

86
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
That's what's missing.

87
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,360
And,

88
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,930
and just how much that that your,

89
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,470
your physical senses can alter what
your perception of the world is.

90
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,400
The food denial,

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,360
floods and the food jumps out
of the ground and under the,

92
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,070
under the,

93
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,480
with,

94
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,930
with,

95
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,763
with,

96
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,590
with a series of genuinely enlightened
rulers or at least pretty close to

97
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,090
enlightened rule is ruling them.

98
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:20,890
That all lasts for 3,500
years and how did they live?

99
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,330
You'll see everything that they did.

100
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:22,691
In fact,

101
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,740
until quite recently,

102
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,130
there were no such things as jobs that
were trades and crafts and skills and

103
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,210
arts and everybody,

104
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,750
I mean,

105
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,670
yes in Europe,

106
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,270
the combination of or a repressive
church and then oppressive nobility kept

107
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,840
everybody you know,

108
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,260
immersed in serfdom in one way or another,

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,790
but what people actually did with that
lives was in some sense or another

110
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,710
transformational all of it.

111
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,230
It takes a lot of smarts
to be a good peasant.

112
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,300
All of these things that people
used to do as a matter of course,

113
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:56,891
and in Egypt,

114
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,724
you see it,

115
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,260
you see it carved into the walls and
everyone thinks these are the scenes of

116
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:06,490
daily life where they are scenes
of daily life with the decodable as

117
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:08,230
transformational activities.

118
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,090
So anything that you do on
doing doing martial arts,

119
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,580
this is a highly developed skill.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,590
You are somebody that you wouldn't
be if you didn't have that skill.

121
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:25,150
If you were doing a podcast and what you
did for a living was flipping burgers

122
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:25,984
at Mcdonald's.

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,570
You wouldn't be Joe Rogan do you've,

124
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,050
you've,

125
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,560
you've,

126
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,340
you've been doing your homework
without maybe even thinking that it was

127
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,174
homework.

128
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,450
Because anything that
you're involved in that,

129
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,110
that you go at with a quest for
perfection of whatever it is,

130
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,600
has this transformational value,

131
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,890
and when you recognize,

132
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,753
when you're not with,

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,421
let's say,

134
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,710
when you know it intellectually,

135
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,910
when you can articulate it,

136
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,120
it doesn't fit,

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,420
it implements the actually
the activity itself.

138
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,550
So it's possible even to do that.

139
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,510
You could be,

140
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,220
it could be an enlightened burger.

141
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:07,510
Flipper and the Sophie's
are very good at the Sufi is

142
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,821
in life,

143
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:13,420
but not in la by sorry is in life,

144
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,283
but not have it.

145
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,891
In other words,

146
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:15,550
you can,

147
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,550
you can practice waking up as it were
in the midst of the most mundane thing.

148
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,933
You could be.

149
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,400
You could,

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,950
you could be an enlightened garbage,

151
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,120
garbage collector as long as
you knew what you were doing.

152
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,740
It's a totally different thing.

153
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,940
I can imagine that.

154
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,140
Not Garbage collector,

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,130
that's a totally different thing
to collect the garbage consciously.

156
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,160
Men just do it resentfully because that's
the only job that they can get all.

157
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,093
Uh,

158
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,630
so when,

159
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,471
when we're talking,

160
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:44,601
it's,

161
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:45,830
it's not as though this is,

162
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,590
it's not as though this is

163
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,450
anything actually new.

164
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,880
It's the oldest idea that ever was and
it's something that people have been

165
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,980
doing for thousands
and thousands of years.

166
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,220
I had hunted

167
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,030
around that area previously and so
I knew there was elk in the area.

168
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,810
I just had never been
that far back in before.

169
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,120
And I tell you to tell you the truth,

170
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,590
it is nearly completely filed
on me because I went days
and days of out here and

171
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:12,950
I'll see an elk,

172
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,470
but the sign was there
to say that we're in,

173
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,041
in there,

174
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,910
it's just that the greys leads and the
wolves were hunting that area so hard

175
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,730
that it shut the fuck up and pushed
a lot of them out of the area.

176
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,530
Yeah.

177
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,540
And then I was nearly new food source.

178
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,603
So.

179
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,430
Wow.

180
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,120
So when you get in there and you don't
see anything for a couple of days,

181
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,661
like what,

182
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:34,841
what,

183
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,030
what is the mindset like?

184
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,530
What do you mean?

185
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,520
There's heaps of doubt and there's
always that lucky second guess yourself.

186
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:42,540
This is a stupid move.

187
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,530
You shouldn't have came in here.

188
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,060
You need to change spots,

189
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:45,894
but then it's like.

190
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,980
But at the same time,

191
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,580
your experience in this for a reason,

192
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,830
this is how hunting should be.

193
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,820
Hunting should be hard.

194
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,050
You should hunting,

195
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,070
never be unless you've done your research
going into a place and they're just

196
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:57,610
like game walking past year,

197
00:06:57,611 --> 00:06:57,990
everywhere.

198
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,890
There should always be,

199
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,491
because that's the hunt,

200
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,000
right?

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,940
Finding it or gone through
the hardship to find it,

202
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,051
tracking it,

203
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:07,380
fond and find them where's the
better spot within that area.

204
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,990
So at the same time that my mind's like,

205
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,800
you know,

206
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,120
you've made a bad decision.

207
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,590
This is a crap spot to be.

208
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,260
There's the whole experience of lock nut.

209
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,520
This is how hunting should be.

210
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Should be difficult.

211
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:21,660
You should have to work your ass
off to try and find the animal.

212
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,940
And when you actually do find that animal,

213
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:24,900
how much better is it?

214
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,190
Because you know,

215
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:27,790
it's just like if,

216
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,790
if you hunted for 11 months
and you didn't say a bowl,

217
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,661
you found a bowl,

218
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,890
you had a shot in your midst,

219
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,940
but then the next one you get,

220
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:37,590
how good's that next one that you get?

221
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,401
You know,

222
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,580
if that was the case and it was very
similar on this trip where I put in all

223
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:42,414
that effort,

224
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,680
didn't say an animal.

225
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,360
One opportunity,

226
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,440
a bull comes in.

227
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,080
I ended up calling that
bull from like a mile away.

228
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:53,910
You could just hear him coming up this
canyon and I did that shot and dude,

229
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:54,744
I teared up.

230
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,110
I was crying because I knew
how much had gone into it,

231
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,621
you know,

232
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,150
and it's not just the effort,

233
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:00,571
but you know,

234
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:01,404
like obviously I'm,

235
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids.

236
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm away from the kids for a month now.

237
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,670
There's all that sacrifice
is all the hard shit.

238
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:09,570
There's all the effort.

239
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,741
There's walking in,

240
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,530
there's putting up with that
absolutely atrocious wherever.

241
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,970
And then finally one opportunity comes
up and you kill that animal as well as

242
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:18,631
kill an animal.

243
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,620
That's a hard thing to do,

244
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:20,911
man.

245
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:21,660
I balled up.

246
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,060
I was crying like I think
I cried a dozen times.

247
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,590
Every time I thought about it
when I was standing over the ball,

248
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:27,424
I was crawling.

249
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,263
Wow.

250
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,920
And I'm like,

251
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
that's why it's got to be that hard.

252
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,520
So you can appreciate that animal so
you realize what has to go into the hunt

253
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,820
actually get someone killed.

254
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,040
Should I think everyone
should be like that?

255
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,880
I hope they're not.

256
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,031
Well,

257
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:39,480
there's.

258
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
There's a lot of elk.

259
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:40,990
Yeah.
