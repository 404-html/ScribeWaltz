00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,380
One of the most interesting things
that I learned from the injury was,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,550
was how,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,070
how your physical health
or wellbeing alters your,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:13,860
uh,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,140
your perception of the world.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,530
Like,

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,363
I,

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,940
um,

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,170
have you ever heard of this study?

11
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:19,430
They,

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,640
they do like the hot and cold cups study
where they have someone come in to fill

13
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,570
out a survey,

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,931
you know,

15
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,860
that's what they tell them.

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,790
And then a person gets
in an elevator and they,

17
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,121
uh,

18
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:30,541
and there's,

19
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:30,960
uh,

20
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,270
there's someone in there like confederate,

21
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:35,430
an actor is in there that's like,

22
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,000
here I,

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,781
my hands are full.

24
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:38,130
Could you hold this cup for me?

25
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,560
And it's either like a hot
cup of coffee or whatever,

26
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,520
or a cold drink and the person says,

27
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:42,871
sure.

28
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:43,740
Takes the drink,

29
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,300
goes up the elevator,

30
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,134
gets off,

31
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,610
gives it back to them,

32
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,610
you know,

33
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,200
says buy,

34
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
goes in and takes the
survey and then afterwards,

35
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,400
and this is what it's actually about.

36
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,481
Afterwards they go,

37
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,320
did you meet anyone?

38
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,760
And the way in.

39
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,150
And I got actually someone I met someone
in the elevator and then they'll,

40
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,771
there'll be like,

41
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,330
so uh,

42
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,990
can you,

43
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,340
can you describe that person?

44
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,240
And if they had,

45
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,860
if they had the hot drink,

46
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,723
they'll,

47
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,360
uh,

48
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,620
they were more,

49
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,460
um,

50
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,030
they would more often describe them
as being like warm or friendly.

51
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,290
And if they had the cold drink,

52
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:16,920
they would,

53
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,560
they would describe them
as like a cold or distant.

54
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,023
And,

55
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,990
and the idea is,

56
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,250
is that that,

57
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,060
um,

58
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,893
that the,

59
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,680
the way our brains evolved kind of these,

60
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,390
these higher ideas of,

61
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:34,950
of what like being distant
as a personality trait or
whatever means he has to be

62
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,770
built over this preexisting kind of,

63
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,850
uh,

64
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,220
five senses kind of software.

65
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,240
And,

66
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,900
um,

67
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,680
and so,

68
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,290
so there's all these metaphors for things.

69
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,470
So you call someone like bright or you
say we're having a deep conversation or

70
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,550
someone's shallow.

71
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,480
So a lot of these ways in
which we describe life is,

72
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,860
is kind of used through
these physical metaphors.

73
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,150
And I remember when I,

74
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,650
when I broke my feet,

75
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,870
I remember thinking the whole
fucking world is broken.

76
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,411
Like,

77
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:11,880
I remember thinking like eyes on eyes
going down this mountain for like three,

78
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,260
three hours and I wasn't just worried
about my feet eyes also like in the

79
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,010
fucking political system is it?

80
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,390
Like everything just seemed
broken like the whole world.

81
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,860
And then I also remember after
I got the second surgery,

82
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:28,470
after the bone infection and stuff
and having to change all this,

83
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,850
I remember feeling like,

84
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,990
like something like this nagging
feeling that I couldn't get over.

85
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:39,300
I was like some things
like missing from my life.

86
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,310
There's just this deep like whole
like somewhere in my soul in my leg.

87
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,780
And then one day I realized I'm like,

88
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,021
oh,

89
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,400
there's a fucking hole in my foot.

90
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,670
There's an actual hole in my feet,

91
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,280
foot.

92
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,390
That's what's missing.

93
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,350
And,

94
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,820
and just how much that,

95
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,983
that your,

96
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,470
your physical senses can alter what
your perception of the world is.

97
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,980
The food

98
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,401
denial,

99
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,360
floods and the food jumps out
of the ground and under the,

100
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,100
under the,

101
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,520
with,

102
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,910
with,

103
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,900
with uh,

104
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,380
with a series of genuinely
enlightened rulers,

105
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:17,100
or at least pretty close to
enlightened real is ruling them.

106
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,450
It all lasts for 3,500 years.

107
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,890
And how did they live?

108
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,330
You'll see everything that they did.

109
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:22,691
In fact,

110
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,740
until quite recently,

111
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,140
there were no such things as jobs that
were trades and crafts and skills and

112
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,210
arts and everybody.

113
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,750
I mean,

114
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,410
yes,

115
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,640
and in Europe,

116
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,250
the combination of an oppressive church
and then oppressive nobility kept

117
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:40,924
everybody,

118
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,100
you know,

119
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,290
immersed in serfdom in one way or another.

120
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,790
But what people actually did with that
lives was in some sense or another

121
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,810
transformational,

122
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,711
all of it.

123
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,290
It takes a lot of smarts
to be a good peasant.

124
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,290
All of these things that people
used to do as a matter of course,

125
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:56,921
and in Egypt,

126
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,754
you see it,

127
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,260
you see it carved into the walls and
everyone thinks these are the scenes of

128
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,094
daily life.

129
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,450
While they are scenes of daily life
with the decodeable as transformational

130
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,284
activities.

131
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,540
So anything that you do,

132
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,270
and boy,

133
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,250
you're doing marshal,

134
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,090
you have arts.

135
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,580
This is a highly developed skill.

136
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,520
You will are somebody that
you wouldn't be if you were,

137
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:20,590
didn't have that scale.

138
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:25,150
If you were doing a podcast and what you
did for a living was flipping burgers

139
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:25,984
at Mcdonald's,

140
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,580
you wouldn't be Joe Rogan.

141
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,650
The you've,

142
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,070
you've,

143
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,560
you've,

144
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,340
you've been doing your homework
without maybe even thinking that it was

145
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,174
homework.

146
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,741
Cause any,

147
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,450
anything that you're involved in that,

148
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,110
that you go at with a quest for
perfection of whatever it is,

149
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,600
has this transformational value.

150
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,890
And when you recognize,

151
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,753
when you know it,

152
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,391
let's say,

153
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,710
when you know it intellectually,

154
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,910
when you can articulate it,

155
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,163
it doesn't,

156
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,633
it,

157
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,420
it implements the actually
the activity itself.

158
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,550
So it's possible even to do that.

159
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,510
You could be an,

160
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,310
or you could be an enlightened Burger
flipper and the Sophie's are very good at,

161
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,730
you know,

162
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,563
the Sufi is

163
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,821
in life,

164
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,200
but not as inland.

165
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,260
Why sorry is in life but not have it.

166
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,891
In other words,

167
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:15,550
you can,

168
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,550
you can practice waking up as it were in
the midst of the most mundane thing you

169
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,083
could be.

170
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,450
You could,

171
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,950
you could be an enlightened garbage,

172
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,120
garbage collector as long as
you knew what you were doing.

173
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,740
It's a totally different thing.

174
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,821
I would imagine.

175
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,140
I'm not a garbage collector.

176
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,030
That's a totally different thing to
collect the garbage consciously than it is

177
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:41,140
to just do it resentfully because that's
the only job that they can get all,

178
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,123
uh,

179
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,610
so when,

180
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,471
when we're talking,

181
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:44,601
it's,

182
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:45,850
it's not as though this is,

183
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,620
it's not as though this is

184
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,470
anything actually new.

185
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:54,850
It's as the oldest idea that ever was
and it's something that people have been

186
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,980
doing for thousands
and thousands of years.

187
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,430
Oh,

188
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,220
I had hunted

189
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,060
around that area previously and so
I knew there was elk in the area.

190
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,403
Um,

191
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
I just had never been
that far back in before.

192
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,130
And I'll tell you to tell you the truth,

193
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:08,300
it,

194
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,600
and nearly completely failed on me because
I went days and days about here and

195
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:11,841
I'll see,

196
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:12,380
you know,

197
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,213
an elk.

198
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,460
But the sign was there
to say that we're in,

199
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,031
in there,

200
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:17,630
it's just that the grizzlies and the,

201
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,650
the walls were hunting that area so hard
that had shut the fuck up and push a

202
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:22,730
lot of them out of the area.

203
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,530
Yeah.

204
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,540
And then all those Neilia new food source.

205
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,653
So

206
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,430
wow.

207
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,120
So when you get in there and you don't
see anything for a couple of days,

208
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,601
like what,

209
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,070
what is the mindset like?

210
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:36,540
What do you mean?

211
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,850
There's heaps of doubt
and there's always that.

212
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,520
It's like you second guess yourself.

213
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:42,540
This was a Steven move.

214
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,530
You shouldn't have came in here.

215
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,030
You need to change spots.

216
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,893
But then it's like,

217
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,980
but at the same time,

218
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,560
your experience in this for a reason,

219
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,830
and this is how hunting should be,

220
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,790
hunting should be hard.

221
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,860
You should hunting should never be,

222
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,880
unless you've done your research going
into a place and there's just like gain

223
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:57,920
walking past everywhere.

224
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,520
There should always be
cause that's the hunt,

225
00:06:59,521 --> 00:06:59,990
right?

226
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,150
Right.

227
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,940
Finding it or going through
the hardship to find it,

228
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,130
tracking it,

229
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,860
fondant,

230
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,311
find them.

231
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:07,350
Where's the better spot within that area.

232
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,990
So at the same time that my is like,

233
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,800
you know,

234
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,120
you've made a bad decision.

235
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,590
This is a crap spot to be.

236
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,260
There's the whole experience of lock nut.

237
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,520
This is how hunting should be.

238
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,900
It should be difficult.

239
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,660
You should have to work your ass
off to try and find the animal.

240
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,940
And when you actually do find the animal,

241
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:24,930
how much better is it?

242
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,190
Because you know,

243
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:31,191
it's just like if you haunted for
11 months and you didn't say a bowl,

244
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,661
you found a boy,

245
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,890
you had a shot in your missed.

246
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,940
But then the next one you get,

247
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:37,590
how good is that next one that you get?

248
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,371
You know,

249
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,300
if that was the case,

250
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:42,210
and it was very similar on this
trip where I put in all that effort,

251
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,680
didn't see an animal.

252
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,360
One opportunity,

253
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,440
a bull comes in.

254
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:46,920
Oh,

255
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,070
I ended up calling that
bull from like a mile away.

256
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,910
You can just hearing coming up this
canyon and I did that shot and dude,

257
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:54,744
I tee it up.

258
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,110
I was crying because I knew
how much had gone into it.

259
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,630
You know,

260
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,150
and it's not just the effort,

261
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:00,570
but you know,

262
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,410
like obviously I'm,

263
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids.

264
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm away from the kids for a month now.

265
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,670
There's all that sacrifice
is all the hard shit.

266
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:09,570
There's all the effort.

267
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,741
There's walking in,

268
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,530
there's putting up with that
absolutely atrocious weaver.

269
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,970
And then finally one opportunity comes
up and you kill that animal as well as

270
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:18,631
kill an animal.

271
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,620
That's a hard thing to do,

272
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:20,911
man.

273
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:21,630
I bowled up.

274
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,060
I was crying like I think
I cried a dozen times.

275
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,550
Every time I thought about it
when I was standing over the ball,

276
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:27,384
I was crying.

277
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,283
Wow.

278
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,920
And I'm like,

279
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
that's why it's got to be that hard.

280
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,250
So you can appreciate their animal.

281
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,790
So you realize what has to go into the
hunt to actually get something killed.

282
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,040
Should I think every
hunt should be like that.

283
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,880
I hope they're not.

284
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,031
Well,

285
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:39,540
there's,

286
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,680
there's a lot of elk.

287
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,993
Yeah.

288
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:50,710
Okay.
