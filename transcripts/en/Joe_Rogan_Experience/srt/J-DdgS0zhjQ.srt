1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,620
Boom,
and we're live.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,110
Oh,
when you go in Australia or you move in

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:11,510
there,
I'd never been,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,060
I'd never,
never been.

5
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:14,530
I never would lead.
You love it.

6
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:15,610
That's what they say,
man.

7
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:19,510
I get a lot of Australians come to the
store and I'm going to perform at the

8
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:20,680
cellar.
A lot of Australian,

9
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:23,620
so I go fly over here to see comedy.
It's crazy.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,610
Yeah,
it was crazy.

11
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:27,130
They take comedy vacations.
It's super common.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,180
You ever see like a hot dog spot and it
says like world famous.

13
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:34,350
How does it feel?
Like when I talked to an Australian,

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,030
I can say I'm world famous,
but I've never been over there.

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,370
Well I think a lot of them come over
here just to like,

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,210
ah,
fuck it.

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,420
Let's go to Australia and get a fucking
fly over to Los Angeles and see what

18
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,320
it's like over there.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,180
They've got more people in their state.
Then we have in our entire country,

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,770
there's more people in the greater la
area then in the entire,

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,980
the entirety.
What's that feel like?

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,780
You know?
And they're as big as the United States.

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,740
Yeah.
It's huge.

24
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,640
Yeah,
it's huge.

25
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,540
So it's the size of can tick the tick
contiguous United States.

26
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,330
I think the lower 48 I don't think it's
the lasting included,

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,880
but it has less people than in Los
Angeles.

28
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,430
I learned that lower 48 term when I was
in Alaska.

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,020
I didn't even know that.
Yeah,

30
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:15,660
they barely or matter.
Yeah,

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,740
it was crazy.
You look at it,

32
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:18,574
you're like,
what?

33
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,190
How is this up here?
This is America too.

34
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,980
Huh?
How'd Y'all get in

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,520
lower?
48 yeah.

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,360
I used to have a joke about Sarah Pale
and I'm like,

37
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,640
that's a fruit frozen Puerto Rico.
That's what that is.

38
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,090
It's so not America.
That's barely America is Larry.

39
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,260
Those people are cool as fuck though.
Yeah man.

40
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,880
I loved it.
Everything was rustic.

41
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,550
That was the word for like,
it was a bug on my spoon,

42
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:43,660
man.
They got it's rustic.

43
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,580
Everbank banging on things.
I became a nerd to us.

44
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:50,920
I like the Aurora borealis night.
It was beautiful.

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,450
It was up close and whales breaching
Resurrection Bay I think is where I

46
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,740
went.
It was fun.

47
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,290
I loved it.
I went in April so it wasn't too cold,

48
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,360
but it was still cold as shit.
Yeah,

49
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,970
it's,
it's weird up there because the people

50
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:09,940
are just,
they're so accustomed to like the trials

51
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:12,100
and tribulations of nature.
They feel like they're harder.

52
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,330
Your folk.
Oh yeah,

53
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:14,170
definitely.
Know what I mean.

54
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,690
Definitely.
They're not consumed with like the stuff

55
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:18,910
that we are about it with and they,
everybody has a plane.

56
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:21,270
Like every other person had a plane in
their backyard.

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,790
Bush plane
to this Po.

58
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,820
This place is going crazy.
We lost garrison keillor and Matt went

59
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,510
down.
That's what they get crazy.

60
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,960
I got say,
man,

61
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,340
there's an Keelan.
Let me,

62
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,670
let me let them low talking.
Dude's still a slow talking.

63
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,660
He'll come to lake wobegon.
Yeah,

64
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:47,770
the whispery public broadcast radio
could use your donations.

65
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,100
We love bringing you quality content
when it comes to the price.

66
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,280
Yeah,
but the first guy to go down was that

67
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:57,050
John Ghomeshi guy who was at the NBR
president,

68
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,890
the CBC guy.
That was bitches.

69
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,783
Oh,

70
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,420
who was the mushroom?
That's the dude.

71
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,850
He was like,
Mr. Calm and progressive and I'm a

72
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,410
feminist.
I don't trust it.

73
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,470
I call myself a feminist ladies.
You can listen.

74
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,810
You can not trust,
I'm not the best human being in the

75
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,860
world,
but I swear to God,

76
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,580
what you see is what you get.
Yeah.

77
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,610
All right.
You gotta be careful with these fucking

78
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,560
male feminists that is just,
that is a sneaky ploy to get pussy.

79
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,840
What was that one?
Who Was it?

80
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,010
Was it,
uh,

81
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,070
Eric Weinstein that was telling us about
a particular type of cuddle fish that

82
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:44,101
pretends to be a female so he can get in
close with the males because the males

83
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:49,150
don't recognize him as being a threat.
What was it?

84
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,750
Sneaky sneaker male.
Like a sneaker male.

85
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,250
Hilarious.
Operate like underneath the large cuddle

86
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:01,270
fish and with all the females and bangs
on me getting on the sneak tip.

87
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,961
That's the dude.
It's like,

88
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,070
I understand you.
Yeah.

89
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,120
Is that on his dope sneaker?
Male cuddle fish of Thailand?

90
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,880
Yeah.
So it literally is like a transgender

91
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:14,590
cuddle fish tends to be a woman,
but really it's just trying to get some

92
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,371
pussy.
That's it.

93
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,010
And it hit strategy is not to be the
big,

94
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,020
you know,
uh,

95
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,020
ever present dominant male but instead
just slip around just the girls.

96
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,280
That's like,
that's like the one straight dude and a

97
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:31,270
ballet zone and he's like,
the women complained to me about all the

98
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,860
other guys and then I ended up smashing
them all like the one straight dude in a

99
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,160
church choir.
You know when you see those guys who

100
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,130
they really are,
when one of the ballerinas boyfriends

101
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,890
show up straight dudes bitchy to them.
Oh

102
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,200
fuck my girl.
You been trying to know you've got this

103
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,280
whole thing cultivated.
Your watering it all,

104
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,250
putting it fertilize,
you send it all that shit moves.

105
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:57,760
She gets the bills,
get calendar.

106
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,160
You got your fake books,
you're pretending to read that you leave

107
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,200
out a lot of shit that we do.

108
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,740
Everybody has a mood.
It was garrison keillor's.

109
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,910
He was,
he was probably to,

110
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,980
you know,
just the intellect man.

111
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:14,860
He was a professor.
He was the historial crush.

112
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:15,820
Right?
Lake wobegon.

113
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:19,080
He created this whole world to do
Minnesota.

114
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,120
It was prince and this and garrison
keillor.

115
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,450
Yeah.
So look at him.

116
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,830
Look at that dude.
Oh Dude was slinging Dick.

117
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh,
tear Gershon character in the

118
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,890
accusations.
I Dunno thing.

119
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,160
No Man.
All chick has to do with hate you.

120
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,310
That's what scary.
Yeah.

121
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,030
And then you're guilty.
Yeah.

122
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,460
The bucket is so wide.
It's like it's the Weinstein of it all

123
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,750
and then it's,
I don't know,

124
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,150
an hour of it all.
I don't know what Matt did.

125
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,730
But yeah,
I don't know what he did either.

126
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,590
But then there's like the Louis C K
angle where he doesn't even touch it.

127
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,590
He just jerked off in front of you like
the fuck.

128
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,690
Like my boys say though,
he's like,

129
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:56,980
you don't know what it's like to have a
dick

130
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,220
because you think about it like who?
Like who would put everything in peril

131
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,740
to just circle off in front of someone.
Like you know this is going to come back

132
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,550
on it.
Yes.

133
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,490
So it has to be something,
something which your Dick that makes you

134
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:14,540
go,
I have to do this.

135
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,290
I've been saying this for awhile.
I think it's one of the things that like

136
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,530
makes people funny too,
is that ridiculous way of viewing the

137
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,730
world.
You just chaotic,

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,700
impulsive,
nutty Shit.

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,030
And the next thing you know and you're
like,

140
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,170
can I drop off in front of you?
You're like,

141
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,390
what?
You push the limits?

142
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,760
And she started,
let me see how ridiculous I can be.

143
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,210
Yeah.
You want to see what people's lines are

144
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,580
and if I didn't work,
it might've worked for somebody.

145
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,230
Yeah.
That whip it out.

146
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,460
Like the whipping your dick out thing.
Like I know dudes that people tried to

147
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:44,870
get me to do that in college.
They were like,

148
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,140
Yo,
you should just pull your dick out.

149
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:47,150
And I'm like,
that works.

150
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,620
Yeah.
And I was like,

151
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,880
I never had the courage to just pull my
dick out in front of a girl.

152
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:55,100
But I know cats,
they're doing it all the time.

153
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,280
But when it does work,
like Holy Shit,

154
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:01,520
I got to figure out what the rhythm is.
What's the beets?

155
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,100
The beets?
Is it a movie first is,

156
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,970
there's some times where it can work and
you're like,

157
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,140
what?
How does that,

158
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,900
how's that possible?
But then other times where you would

159
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,710
pull your dick out and grow and be like,
what the fuck?

160
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,730
I'm sorry Jesus,
what did I do?

161
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,970
If you're Jesus,
you can't bat baseball averages,

162
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,880
which a nick polo game because he died,
it's a low acid,

163
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,270
low average,
it's a low average and now come back and

164
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:31,271
hit that one out of a hundred
it was worth it until the day man,

165
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,180
the off 99 are coming out and if you
have like a freak girlfriend,

166
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,820
yeah,
like when you're in high school or

167
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:43,030
something like that and then just ruins
your perception.

168
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,470
You know what else fucks it not to do is
up the Strip club.

169
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,160
They hang out there so they have this
false reality of what you know,

170
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,330
Oh yeah,
woman is this.

171
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:53,030
And then when they go out and just try
to talk to a regular woman and like,

172
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,590
well you got to get to know me first.
I'm like,

173
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,200
fuck you bitch.
They don't even know how to do that.

174
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,000
But it was also,
you're just getting used to dealing with

175
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:01,820
freaks.
You're dealing with freaks all the time.

176
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,680
They have a different,
different parameters.

177
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:07,490
Not like the lady in the office that
handles accounting and I take out on

178
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,324
her.
No,

179
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,640
but that is nice when you meet a woman,
you has agency over her body and knows

180
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,690
what she likes.
That could fuck you up when you go and

181
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:17,660
you dating,
dealing with somebody that's not that

182
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,310
free.

183
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

184
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,030
That could be a,
that's a problem where we're girls just,

185
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,740
they're not freeze the right word.
Right.

186
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:28,250
They're not relaxed enough or
comfortable enough in their own skin or

187
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,440
nothing.
Know what they like and just can tell

188
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:31,450
you and you're like,
yeah,

189
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,360
yeah,
yeah.

190
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,430
And that's when you have to decide if
you already liker,

191
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,460
because if you do like focus on her and,
and bring that out over and you don't

192
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,060
like her,
it's going to be hard to get all of

193
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:42,980
that.
Yeah.

194
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,360
That's a problem.
Yeah.

195
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,670
I did it a girl once a long time ago,
like way back in the day and was in and

196
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:50,480
I went to my twenties and I loved having
sex with her,

197
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,880
but I hate and hanging out with us.
I know,

198
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:53,630
man.
It's that.

199
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,740
It's that how'd,
how'd you,

200
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,510
how'd you try to like I'm ghoster when
you,

201
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,870
when she got mad at me,
that's what they always did.

202
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,670
They always want them getting mad at me.

203
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,070
They just get mad at you just so you're
not doing what they want you to do and

204
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,800
you're not marrying them.
You got this,

205
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,030
you know that you're not,
oh man,

206
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,230
that crazy.
Don't think about that.

207
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,230
You got what you wanted and then you had
to sit through that moment of her being

208
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,580
upset with,
you knew what was coming,

209
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,400
but you already got what you wanted.
He's know what I'm saying.

210
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,200
The part of her behavior was like a game
to try to get me in,

211
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,270
you know,
like part of her freak shit.

212
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,230
Yeah.
It was just like,

213
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,000
she knew that that's what I want from
her,

214
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,240
you know?
So she would act like the free kids

215
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,560
don't care deck right here.
Yeah,

216
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,310
me too.
Yeah.

217
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,730
The quote in the movie theater,
I'll suck your Dick.

218
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,573
Right?
Whoa.

219
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,610
Jesus.
Right.

220
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,580
I don't know what's on the menu,
but I'll take it and then when you go,

221
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,510
all right,
I'm good.

222
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,230
Yeah,
like watts.

223
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,500
How could you exactly.
Exactly.

224
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,130
Yeah.
Like some part of like that behavior.

225
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:54,540
It's like they know that other girls
don't behave like that.

226
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,630
If they just turn this shit up to nine,
like Whoa,

227
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,610
it's dope.
And then you think about them all the

228
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,700
time and it gets exciting.
Then after she's mad at you,

229
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,260
then that's when I would date her.
No,

230
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:07,950
dig sucks in the more angry fuck you on
him.

231
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,300
Like movies.
I like to move forward.

232
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,320
How come you don't like,
who does it?

233
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:13,050
Like movies you had,
a friend of mine was talking to me about

234
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,390
this,
about uh,

235
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,490
like a girl that has been like real open
about all the different gods she fucked

236
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:22,200
and all that.
And now she's going to settle down.

237
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:25,860
But I was promiscuous in the past and
I'm not doing that anymore.

238
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,300
And the guy's like,
hey,

239
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,730
wait a minute.

240
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,020
Wait,
I missed it.

241
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,273
I missed.
Yeah.

242
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,520
Borealis the worst.
Yes.

243
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,840
It could have been here in April.
I would have saw the lights in the sky.

244
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,700
Yes.
It's hilarious.

245
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,870
Yeah.
I hate born again,

246
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,480
virgin.
I get it though.

247
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,070
I ain't doing it no more til I get
married.

248
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,230
It's like you got,
you got two kids like you.

249
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:48,780
Have you used to fuck.
It's my turn.

250
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,810
It's my turn know to had to do to get in
this seat.

251
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,020
Just let people be who they are,
man.

252
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,450
When you see that,
the thing is like this is what men do

253
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:00,540
and with also what women do.
We tried to change the person we're with

254
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:00,941
like,
oh,

255
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:04,440
this dude doesn't dress good,
but I just get him the right clothes.

256
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,650
Just teach him how to groom his hair,
you know?

257
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,450
Get them to wear more stylish things.
Yeah.

258
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,920
Yeah.

259
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,800
They'll just start to change you.
When you started looking better,

260
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,120
you confidence gets up.
He was like,

261
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,840
why am I with you?
I want to get with her now.

262
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,150
I had a buddy of mine who would get
girls and get them to go on a diet.

263
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,480
He would date cute girls that were like
a little chubby and then take it to the

264
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,920
gym,
added value.

265
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,540
And I was like,
what are you doing?

266
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,891
He's like,
no,

267
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,360
this way.
Like they really like you.

268
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,000
You get them and then you can make them
hot and,

269
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,400
but that's a lot of work.
It's chaos.

270
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,140
You can't,
I mean it might work,

271
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,790
but it's like the whip,
the Dick out thing.

272
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,820
One out of a hundred it's going to work.
The other girl is going to be hiding

273
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:44,700
candy.
Like how can we not losing any weight

274
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,900
or the dude,
you know,

275
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,250
a girl takes a chubby dude and bring
them to the gym all the time.

276
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,910
You can't make a chubby like a fitness
freak.

277
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,170
It's like people are who they are.
They are who they are,

278
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,173
who they are.
Man,

279
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,560
I'm a,
but I am,

280
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,540
I'm trying to get to lose some weight.
Are you?

281
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm doing,
I'm trying to intermittent fasting.

282
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,230
I do that.
I mess with that.

283
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,400
Yeah,
I do that every night.

284
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,170
Oh,
word.

285
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,010
Yeah.
Walks up on vacation.

286
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,740
I can't five pounds,
even though I worked out every day on

287
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:15,400
vacation every day,
but I drank and ate everything.

288
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,400
I gained five pounds a week.
That's crazy.

289
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,200
It's crazy.
That's crazy.

290
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,011
Wow.
Yeah.

291
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:23,020
So I just went off.
How many hours do you go?

292
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:24,700
What are you an 1820,
14,

293
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,570
14.
Yeah,

294
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,950
that's probably what I'm doing,
I think.

295
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,250
Yeah,
I do a 10:00 PM at night and you know,

296
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,610
I'll do 10:00 PM at night and then um,
or 8:00 PM at night rather than an

297
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,540
antennae m in the morning.

298
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,310
Oh.
So it's not bad.

299
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,870
So I'm done eating everything.
No more food after 8:00 PM at night and

300
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:41,704
then,
uh,

301
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,420
10:00 AM in the morning and it started
eating.

302
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,680
Oh that's dope.
It's easy.

303
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,593
All right.
Yeah.

304
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,690
Just,
you know what man,

305
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,880
it's like that feeling when you come
home from the store though and you're

306
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,241
like,
damn,

307
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,960
I like to eat something.
You know,

308
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,880
but you guys got to pass that up and
then we know what else I got to pass up

309
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,760
having something to drink at night,
like glass of water or something like

310
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:58,990
that.
Cause it's always like four in the

311
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,970
morning.
God Damn it.

312
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:02,860
Yeah,
they're not that good sleep.

313
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,510
Get up,
you got to Piss,

314
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:07,210
you go back to bed again.
But in a couple of nights I've been

315
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,940
fucking good and discipline or after a
certain time,

316
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:12,700
no liquids and their sleep like a baby
all through the night.

317
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,350
Wake up at night you did something.

318
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,330
And the other thing I do now is that we
work out in the morning.

319
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,230
Yeah,
that's what I've been doing.

320
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,600
Work out in the morning before I eat.
I think I figured it out.

321
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,010
So I think I figured out how I'm going
to do it.

322
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,110
How are you going to do it?
I try to burn.

323
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
I started wearing a heart rate monitor
finally.

324
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,270
Oh.
And I tried to burn a thousand calories

325
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:33,430
in my workout.
That's what I tried to get to.

326
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,450
That's a lot.
Yes,

327
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,440
a lot.
And so,

328
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,080
but if I can get to the thousand,
then if I try to,

329
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,910
if I eat 1800 calories that whole day,
then that 800 for sure.

330
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,100
You know what I'm saying?
That's what I'm trying.

331
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,290
I'm one day three day three is do you
go,

332
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,690
do you follow a specific type of diet?
Are you eating specific foods?

333
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,543
Well,
I mean I,

334
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,110
I try to um,
be more on the plant base tip,

335
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,160
but I'm not,
I'm not a Vegan because I will let them

336
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:03,760
and all that stuff.

337
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,590
I'm not,
and I think Vegan is like,

338
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,340
I love what it represents,
but I think their marketing,

339
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,040
that's not the best word people are
running from that term.

340
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,630
So I just like,
well people run it from comments.

341
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,980
There's a lot of people that are Vegan,
they're just can't.

342
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,780
So some lecture on yesterday and you
know what?

343
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:23,660
He does know the famous power lifter,
very motivational guy.

344
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:26,370
But that dude right there,
he was saying that he,

345
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:28,720
he,
he doesn't even say he's Vegan anymore

346
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,990
because people were so goddamn military.
I'm not doing this for the animals.

347
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,310
I'm doing this shit from my health.
Right.

348
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:34,720
But if you say that people got mad at
him,

349
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,880
so he's like,
I just say I eat vegan most of the time.

350
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,260
Yeah.
That's most of the time.

351
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,900
That's what he says.
I get it.

352
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,930
But the vegans that are good people that
are just doing it because they care and

353
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,180
they're kind,
they get a bum rap because of all the

354
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:49,660
psychos and those cycles almost always
have like Vegan in their name.

355
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,990
Like vegan warrior early.
Yeah,

356
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,290
Vegan earth goddess.
Vegan first.

357
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,150
But you know,
it's funny if Vegan is last,

358
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:59,400
they tend to be cooler like this way.
It's like it's,

359
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,210
I'm this person and then Vegan,
like my man Epi,

360
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,620
Vegan,
he loves your show.

361
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,370
I'm going to do,
I'm going to do a segment when he comes

362
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,990
to town and uh,
okay.

363
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,490
I like that cat.
He's a cool,

364
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,370
I had a lot of vegans.
Yeah,

365
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,400
but I'm mocked.
I'm like,

366
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:15,410
I'm mocking myself.
I mark myself.

367
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:18,080
How the fuck am I not going to mock?
My wife isn't Vegan and try to,

368
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,260
but she'll eat stuff that I'm making
some tough.

369
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:22,011
She'll play kate.
Me.

370
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:24,410
I did.
I took a huge loss on Thanksgiving

371
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:25,700
though.
I made two pies.

372
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,780
I like to cook and stuff.
So I made to a sweet potato pies,

373
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,460
one with one with milk and butter and
all the stuff that you had growing up.

374
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,880
Boom.
And I did that and then I made one vegan

375
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:41,600
one just to see what would a,
what people would like.

376
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,330
And Man,
it was just one slight sticking out of

377
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:49,331
the Vegan
was sad slice and everybody was like,

378
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:51,830
man,
come on.

379
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,540
And they,
but they tore the other pile.

380
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,650
I of course
had to wrap it up and take it back home

381
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:00,350
with,
he was still in the fridge.

382
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,340
What's in the Vegan One?
So instead of eggs you make a flax seed

383
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,473
eggs.

384
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,610
So your pod got freckles.
I know that.

385
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,770
I don't want no freckles on my got damp
odd but,

386
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,780
but then it's everything else.
It's the same.

387
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,550
It's the same.
Uh,

388
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,740
and instead of,
I'm using half and half,

389
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:19,690
you use like,
um,

390
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,210
use a,
it'd be like almond milk mixed with like

391
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,310
coconut milk.
That's all right.

392
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,410
And then you do a,
and then,

393
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,870
but at the same all sugar flour,
all that's the same.

394
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,420
And no eggs,
no eggs,

395
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,760
but eggs.
You can't taste eggs,

396
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,860
eat them.
It's just exit is a binding agent.

397
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,370
It just holds it together.
When I was in Hawaii last week,

398
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:41,820
we made Gnocchi.
What's that?

399
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,020
We took a class.
It's a potato pasta.

400
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,400
They were talking about that at the
store.

401
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,350
I've never had that.
Which delicious.

402
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,460
Is that good?
Yeah,

403
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,650
it's good.
It makes good Gnocchi though because

404
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,960
everyone,
everyone's eye contact.

405
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,801
Divert.
Like I said,

406
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:55,420
who makes good nobody?

407
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,070
They're like,
man,

408
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,300
you out here.
It's like,

409
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,450
I want,
I want to taste it like what is this?

410
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,420
It's an Italian food.
You just got to go to a good Italian

411
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,580
restaurant and they make the number.
All right.

412
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,250
Yeah.
Just find a good Italian place that has

413
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,630
pasta and no time.
No keep.

414
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,480
Most likely,
and it's not spelled and Okai.

415
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,440
It's a gene is a gene.
From there.

416
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,640
I've always,
when you open the menu and you know,

417
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:23,660
I was like,
you know fucking with that like I

418
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,030
like lamb chops.
Then Nokia like suck none of my meals to

419
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,130
track.
It's probably been sitting there my

420
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:37,260
whole life.
Going to a fancy Italian restaurants and

421
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,560
just never,
it's an interesting pasta because it's a

422
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,230
pasta made with like they make it with
potatoes,

423
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,470
they boiled potatoes and they smash them
down and then they um,

424
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,650
they get it to a certain consistency
that it off.

425
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,020
And

426
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,620
then they add certain amount of flour.
Like we did the whole thing.

427
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:56,550
We chopped it up,
we pressed it into your roll it roll the

428
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,670
flower out until I like a little tube.
Then you cut little sections of it and

429
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:03,930
you make your Gnocchi with the sections
and do you have to then be baked that or

430
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,300
do you yeah,
they boil it,

431
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,620
boil it,
boil.

432
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,430
I think.
I didn't watch them do it and I'm pretty

433
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,930
sure they boil it though.
Make it eel sauce and then that's

434
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:12,440
awesome.
We got a bunch of different sauces.

435
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,730
We though the chef cooked it with three
different sauces.

436
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,460
He cooked it with uh,
a Bolognese sauce.

437
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:19,260
He cooked it with a,
um,

438
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,410
uh,
it was like a cheese sauce with,

439
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,360
with uh,
walnuts,

440
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,430
like a walnut.
I forget what kind of cheese.

441
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,430
And then there was another one,
one other sock.

442
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,060
A pesto.
I love.

443
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,470
I make fresh cut pesto.
Yeah,

444
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:32,500
it was good man.
Yeah,

445
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,050
it's really good.
Yeah man.

446
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,310
I just,
I think if you just cut out bread and

447
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,290
then cut out pasta,
those are the two big ones.

448
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,940
Just cut that shit.
Gnocchi.

449
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,810
Pasta dough.
Yeah,

450
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,180
but that's potato pasta.
So that's different.

451
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,200
It's different.
Yeah.

452
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,350
It's not as good for you as like some
things,

453
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:52,120
but I don't think it's nearly as bad for
you as grain brain.

454
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,530
I think green is just the terrible.
Have you gotten through,

455
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,330
I haven't gotten through night.
That dude's book,

456
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,430
wheat belly belly?
No,

457
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,440
I haven't watched the documentary on the
plane coming back from Hawaii about

458
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:06,780
wheat.
Let me see the fucking name of it is,

459
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,810
but it was a,
it was a trip and it was all talking

460
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:13,690
about the roundup chemicals that they
spray on.

461
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,400
There it is.

462
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,810
And they were talking about how people
say,

463
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,310
well,
it only affects bacteria.

464
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,931
And they were saying,
yeah,

465
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:20,820
but you have bacteria in your fucking
gut,

466
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,840
right?
Yeah.

467
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,730
What's,
what's with wheat?

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,230
Uh,
that's the,

469
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,470
uh,
the name of the documentary and it's,

470
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,580
it's not good.
I tried watching it.

471
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:31,590
That dude was talking.
I was just,

472
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,420
I couldn't,
I was all right man.

473
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,630
I was falling as droning on.
And that's the problem with all those

474
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:39,510
academics.
Like to be the type of person that could

475
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,510
sit down and do that kind of research.
Painstaking time consuming research

476
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,750
boring is five and you need those
people,

477
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,910
man.
Those people are the only ones that are

478
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:48,930
going to do it.
You're not going to do it.

479
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,950
I'm not going to do it.
No.

480
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,550
I know.
We need those people tests and then just

481
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,390
explaining to you the dangers of complex
glutens group.

482
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,350
Yeah,
man.

483
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,891
So yeah,
that's,

484
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:01,140
that's my goal.
So I'll check back in with you and like

485
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:04,020
six weeks to see if I'm away.
I need them three days in feeling strong

486
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:04,590
though.
Right?

487
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,210
I'm calm,
I'm talking about it publicly.

488
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,950
I'm usually really private about what
I'm doing.

489
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,170
Yeah.
So I think talking about it publicly is

490
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,400
important.
Hey man,

491
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,900
once you,
once you get it out there,

492
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,490
yeah.
Once you get over 40 I feel like,

493
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:21,000
I feel like you can eat whatever you
want until you're 40 because you only

494
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:25,500
get one in testing.
So then you have to start your body

495
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,110
loses enzymes that will break it down as
vigorously.

496
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,490
Cause I have a son now and I watch my
son,

497
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:32,880
my son eat anything and he's,
his energy is high,

498
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:33,691
you know,
and all of that.

499
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,450
But when you get older you lose some of
those enzymes.

500
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,700
I feel like enzymes are like government
workers.

501
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,070
Like you eat a steak.
They're like,

502
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:44,760
who's going to get that?
I mean getting that shit for 40 years.

503
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:45,571
Anybody,
somebody else,

504
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:48,190
we're going to get there.
And so then it sits in the city plus

505
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:52,240
your sons growing mustaches,
fondness for calories,

506
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,290
just turning them off.

507
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,990
He's starting to speak sign language
now.

508
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,850
Like just the little things,
you know,

509
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:03,120
he knows more and we give them some food
and we taught him more and he just

510
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:06,210
looked at us like we were silly.
And then like a couple of hours later

511
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:07,044
he's like,

512
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,550
am I bad?
Brang it.

513
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,600
You told me this when it's not working.
I'm doing it well in the beginning they

514
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:15,150
say sign language is a really good thing
to teach kids cause they can't really

515
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:16,910
formulate the words yet.
The mouth.

516
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,710
That's why they get frustrated.
They start crying because I can't tell

517
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,050
you what they want,
but they know what they want.

518
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,610
It's amazing.
They don't know a language yet.

519
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,680
Yeah.
It's interesting.

520
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,390
And he would,
he's a huge prince fan.

521
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,600
Yeah.
I love playing records.

522
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,630
And so my wife got me a dope record
player for Christmas and uh,

523
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,170
we play Prince's purple rain on the air
and if I play anything else,

524
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:39,890
he,
and you know,

525
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,760
he just wants prints really.
And I,

526
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,740
and I'll go,
you want,

527
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,360
you want to hear some music with dinner?
And he'll,

528
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,870
he'll run to the record player and he'll
start China.

529
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,770
How old is he?
He's 14 months.

530
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,611
Wow.
Yeah.

531
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:51,800
And so like he understands things like
I'd be like,

532
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:53,570
get the ball and he'll get it and then
we'll play.

533
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:58,571
But I could see him wanting to say it.
Occasionally he'll sit and just stop

534
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,280
mocking me.
I'll say get the boy.

535
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:04,350
But I like,
I could see him trying to just

536
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,990
literally just start saying,
trying to say what I just said in the

537
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:13,260
same rhythm.
Bang.

538
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,730
He starts talking to you.
That's [inaudible] wait man.

539
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,870
I have little conversations with my kids
while I'm talking to them.

540
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,480
I'm talking to them about what we're
talking about,

541
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,020
but most of my brain is like,
I can't believe you can talk.

542
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,883
Yeah,
I know.

543
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,250
I can't believe you're a person and
we're,

544
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,040
we're uh,
you're a seven year old person and we're

545
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,960
exploring the world together with
having,

546
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,070
talking about stuff.
And my kids are way too aggressive with

547
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,440
me physically though,
especially my littlest one.

548
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,150
But my seventh girl,
all girls,

549
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,410
man,
my seven year old,

550
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:49,100
she fucking tackles me all the time,
just full on charge.

551
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,280
Like I'm indestructible when she takes
mma.

552
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,570
So she will slam into me,
grab a single leg thrower's shoulder

553
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,520
into me.
If I plopped down on the bed,

554
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:01,520
she gets on top of me,
she drops on top of me and amount,

555
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,050
she'll start punching my stomach.

556
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,600
She thinks it's hilarious because I'm
like a toy.

557
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,980
She feels like she could just beat on me
cause I can just carry her and pick her

558
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:11,580
up all the time.
I put her on my shoulders and she was

559
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,160
like,
this mother fucker could just carry me.

560
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:15,300
I can't even can't even hurt him.
Right.

561
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,030
Wail on him.
That's so funny.

562
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,790
It's hilarious man.
She's so aggressive,

563
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,710
man.
I want my son to know how to do all that

564
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:22,580
stuff.
Oh yeah.

565
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,820
Get them involved early then it'll be,
it'll be a normal part of life so that

566
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,580
way,
like bullies and conflict,

567
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,590
it won't bother them because I know how
to fight.

568
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,670
I had to make bullies laugh.
You're a big dude.

569
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,421
Big Dude.
Yeah,

570
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:37,100
but I've got a short torso,
so like

571
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,710
five,
eight sitting down when I used to,

572
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:44,450
I grew up in Maryland,
so I used to,

573
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,340
you know,
we had public transit

574
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,050
and stuff,
so whenever I would be on public transit

575
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,850
I would always see the dude's like,
Yo,

576
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,220
we got one and then I will have to stand
up.

577
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,150
They were like,
oh nevermind.

578
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,540
But yeah,
my height saved me a lot and that's

579
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,500
funny.
He helped me a lot to being funny as the

580
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:00,981
good ones.
Like,

581
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,460
Oh,
this guy's not trying to be dominant and

582
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:03,840
she wants to be the silly dude.
Yeah.

583
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,773
Okay.
We like you.

584
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,350
You know what?
I used to do two though.

585
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,180
Uh,
I only,

586
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,900
I only told,
I'm Collin Quinn,

587
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:11,070
this story.
Oh,

588
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,260
when I grew up in these apartments,
pembrook apartments in Prince George's

589
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:16,094
county,
Maryland,

590
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,110
there was his mum bullied,
uh,

591
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:21,080
who would steal people's bikes and shit
and he would start fights or whatever.

592
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,480
And so I had,
I played sports,

593
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:23,900
I,
you know,

594
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,900
so one of my trophies broke and my mom
took me to some place to fix it.

595
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,020
And I did not know that there was a
place that existed when you,

596
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,850
I just thought trophies appeared,
you know,

597
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,180
I mean,
as a kid you just get a shot.

598
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:37,040
Right.
So when I saw this was the spot,

599
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,300
what I used to do because I was saving
my allowance and I would go to the

600
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,180
trophy spot and buy like a karate
trophy,

601
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,320
just walk around the neighborhood just
long enough for this one dude to see me

602
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:55,280
who I knew would be like the town crier.
And I would always act embarrassed about

603
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:55,550
it.
Like,

604
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,271
Oh,
you know what I'm saying?

605
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:57,710
Yeah.
And that's how we talk.

606
00:24:57,711 --> 00:24:59,340
We say young and stuff.
I mean,

607
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,070
my mother got me taking karate and shit.
I'm wanting to steal to,

608
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,490
oh,
you,

609
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,980
you're going to cry.
You Nice like that.

610
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,610
Don't tell nobody man,
I ain't gonna say shit.

611
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:09,090
And then I would see it.

612
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,243
So then,
uh,

613
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,230
and then like,
you know,

614
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:15,020
a couple of months ago by,
I go by and by a little bigger town,

615
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,470
dude never mess with me.
He never mess.

616
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:19,700
Thank God.
Thank God.

617
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:20,630
No one was like,
oh,

618
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:21,650
I can fight.
But I,

619
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,590
you know what I'm saying?
But it was like the word got out enough

620
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,000
because nobody knew karate.
I'm saying like if you heard the dude

621
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,410
did karate,
that was enough.

622
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,210
Like,
you didn't want to get embarrassed.

623
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:37,211
So he gave me like free passage to do
various be be my corny self,

624
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,360
be out,
you know.

625
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,850
Thank you very clever way of handling
it.

626
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:44,860
Because what I did when I saw that store
I was like,

627
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,740
and that's the piece of home,
they were like five bucks,

628
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,810
70 bucks,
big bucks and hour girl put it on.

629
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,510
And then so I was acting at an early
age.

630
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,290
There's all that shit.

631
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,540
Like just planning.
I said I know what he going to be.

632
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,300
You know,
as soon as he saw me I'd go back in the

633
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,600
house.
I didn't want like a big,

634
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,540
you know what I mean?
That's very clever.

635
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,720
Like psychologically when the right guy
that couldn't keep his mouth shut.

636
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,740
Yeah,
yeah.

637
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,280
Oh he's that guy.
You know who that guy is.

638
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:11,480
Yeah.
And He,

639
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,870
and he was so funny too cause um,
I bet he works for tmz now.

640
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,430
Probably if he,
if,

641
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,950
if he got out,
if he got out,

642
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,520
if I'm right,
because that was in our neighborhood.

643
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,600
It was,
people were afraid to dream out loud.

644
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,890
You know what I mean?
Like,

645
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,750
I wanted to be a comedian since I was
nine,

646
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,780
but I ain't tell nobody because I saw
somebody else and say,

647
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,701
I want to be here.
What?

648
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:34,600
Whatever man you ain't going to do.

649
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,990
You can't say shit.
So funny how people want to squash

650
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,520
dreams.
Yeah.

651
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,560
Because it's their fear.
But you don't realize that till you're

652
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:43,320
older.
Right.

653
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,930
There's their fear to,
they're pushing on you.

654
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,510
Yeah.
And so they and they own way.

655
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,680
They think they're helping you.
Right.

656
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,890
They give you a dose of reality.
Yeah.

657
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:53,970
Like,
and you go,

658
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:55,070
you in Boston,
so you,

659
00:26:55,071 --> 00:27:00,030
you had this too.
A lot of people yell at you helpful

660
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:00,541
Shit.
Like,

661
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,520
you know what I mean?
Like it was like a yelling community.

662
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,450
Like don't do that.
Does it?

663
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,820
You know?
So always had like,

664
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,450
uh,
people always yet,

665
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,241
oh,
I washed the street,

666
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:10,740
you know,
like they will be like really

667
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:13,350
emotionally charged like gang street to
go,

668
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,910
you know,
as opposed to,

669
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,010
hey man,
it was never calm.

670
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,690
Everything was,
you were always yelled at.

671
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:20,190
It was like a yacht.
A lot of yelling.

672
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,850
Nowhere.
I founded the weirdest as I worked as a

673
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,480
limo driver once and uh,
there's this guy that worked in the

674
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:31,590
dispatch and this guy was just like a
real bitter dude and he wasn't that much

675
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,720
older than me.
I was 21 and he was probably like 26 or

676
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:39,721
27 but he had given up and he was a
dispatch guy and I worked all day.

677
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:45,020
I had an eight hour shift and then after
I did the eight hour shift and like,

678
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,811
hey man,
I got to go,

679
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,170
I've got a show tonight.
Yeah.

680
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,530
And he's like,
a lot of guys here work 12 hours.

681
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,110
Dego that's great.
I go,

682
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:53,820
but I did my eight hours.
I'm going,

683
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,330
yeah.
And they're like,

684
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,890
well we need some airport pickups.
I'm like,

685
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,610
I did eight hours.
I go,

686
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,660
I'm not working more than eight hours a
day for you guys.

687
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,220
Like this is like a part time job.
I work eight hours a day,

688
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:05,490
I'm gone.
This motherfucker called the place where

689
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:09,510
I was supposed to be performing to find
out if I was there and something

690
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:11,880
happened and I got switched to another
place.

691
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,020
Like the book name said,
Hey,

692
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,340
why don't you work at this place
instead?

693
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,470
And so I went to north Texas and he's
like,

694
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,341
yeah.
He goes,

695
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:19,240
you weren't at that fucking place.
You said you were last night.

696
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,580
Well,
I was like,

697
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:21,181
first of all,
dude,

698
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:23,130
I'm done working right.
I'm done.

699
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,270
I go,
second of all,

700
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,370
they switched me.
The booking agents call this other

701
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,690
place.
I go call the other place.

702
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:29,850
I'll wait and we're just looking at each
other and like,

703
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:32,240
this guy just doesn't want dreams.
Yes.

704
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,821
He's like,
yeah,

705
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:35,400
you're out there doing comedy.
You can be making me real money here.

706
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,280
It's real money.
How you not see,

707
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,980
this is the thing.
They were pointed to this one dude,

708
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:45,750
there was this old dude who worked there
and I remember he was this big fat guy

709
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:48,510
who had a cadillac and that was the
thing they were saying,

710
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,790
you know John over here,
he works,

711
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,570
it doesn't bust his ass be,
he works about 60 hours a week and he,

712
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:59,450
he's got a beautiful cadillac and then
this cadillac and he's just sitting in

713
00:28:59,451 --> 00:28:59,791
there.
It was like,

714
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,200
wow,
John's got a cadillac.

715
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,210
He was like probably in his like late
forties fat dude just could tell you

716
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,960
where the best veal Scallopini is.
Huh?

717
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,130
It was just knew where the food is
because he just sat in his car all day

718
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:14,070
driving around and then I remember
thinking like this poor fuck,

719
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:18,120
like John makes about $60,000 a year.
He'll have to bust his ass.

720
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,580
It's a good living.
And they would point to him,

721
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:22,670
look at his Cadillac and we were all,
I was like,

722
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,940
Whoa,
this is prison.

723
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:25,650
This guy's working 16 hours a day.
Like,

724
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:28,850
what the fuck is going on here man?
I can't live like that.

725
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:29,820
Yeah,
yeah,

726
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,193
yeah man.

727
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,160
You got that.
You got to dream bigger than that.

728
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,030
I mean,
one of my boys,

729
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,680
he,
he's doing really well.

730
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,370
He could always sing.
So I think we used to always have little

731
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,430
singing groups and uh,
and we have,

732
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:46,330
this is a local music called Gogo music.
Go go music.

733
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,790
Yeah.
It's like a lot of percussion and horns

734
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,980
and like so cool.
It was to where it's a,

735
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:53,500
it's really local in the DC,
Maryland,

736
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,770
Virginia area.
But you've heard Gogo like,

737
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,000
um,
um,

738
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:58,780
it's,
it's,

739
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,630
it's splashed.
It has some national hits like doing the

740
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:05,990
but is a gogo song doing,
how about my experience on limited?

741
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,273
Yeah.

742
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,460
Yeah.
Um,

743
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,210
yeah that,
so in the 70s,

744
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,460
uh,
they used to be music programs in all

745
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:21,250
the schools.
So all these cats were coming out

746
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,080
learning like instrumentation,
composition,

747
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,510
like all this stuff.
But like an our era,

748
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,040
they cut that.
So,

749
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,230
but,
but google bands,

750
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:32,380
they still played like live music.
So we would all try to form,

751
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:33,071
go,
go groups,

752
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:34,960
but we couldn't read music.
So we would be like,

753
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,600
your party is boot buck a buck a ball
boy.

754
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,230
That's how he would talk to each other.
You want the horn,

755
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,670
you played fun.
We didn't know notes or anything,

756
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,820
but we would always like try to do that
or will be in a little singing group or

757
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:49,300
something like that.
And one cat cussing so well,

758
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:54,301
and I just remember when my mom,
we moved away when I was 13.

759
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,470
I remember hoping that he would keep
singing years later.

760
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm asleep on my couch,
man.

761
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,730
And I love music videos.
So I had it playing and I heard a

762
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:04,990
familiar voice in,
I wake up,

763
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,780
it was him.
Wow.

764
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,960
Started crying on my couch.

765
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,430
Yeah.
He made that out.

766
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:11,951
He,
yeah,

767
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:13,740
he's fantastic.
And He's,

768
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,510
he got nominated for a grammy,
uh,

769
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,560
two years ago.
Wow.

770
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah.
His name's,

771
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,660
uh,
boots,

772
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,160
black boots.
His name's Alford.

773
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,330
Antonio Dunkin.
He went,

774
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,580
uh,
he called black bu and that's what he

775
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:27,160
calls himself.
He and he calls himself boot black

776
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,770
boots,
a professional one.

777
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:29,470
I mean,
we were,

778
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,240
we were,
he was like my brother growing up.

779
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,560
Like he's,
I'm an only child,

780
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,120
but he,
uh,

781
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,770
his real name is Alpha,
but he,

782
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,810
so this is how we met.
Like probably,

783
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:39,820
I don't know how old I was,
but it was a knock on my door.

784
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,640
Saturday morning cartoons.
That's him.

785
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,810
That's how I,
yeah.

786
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:46,080
And so then a mambo sauce is the name
of,

787
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:46,983
uh,
Google ban.

788
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,840
He was in and a,
they have a hit song called welcome to

789
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,860
DC that I saw on the video channel.
And it plays all the time,

790
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:57,670
like in the,
in the Redskins,

791
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,040
uh,
you know,

792
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,050
with the redskins play and with the
Washington Wizards play,

793
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,730
he's dope.
And so,

794
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:07,810
and he just went viral for marrying his
wife.

795
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,680
Uh,
like he proposed to his girlfriend and

796
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,330
they're married to the same day.
My job,

797
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,263
I you say,
Dang,

798
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,100
that just happened to went viral stuff.
Oh Nah.

799
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:18,934
And so,
um,

800
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,340
but this is how we get,
like I remember he knocked on my door

801
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,770
and I'm a mom answered it and he was
like,

802
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,570
how are you doing?
My name is boo.

803
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,740
He said,
um,

804
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,850
my mother wanted know if you got a cup
of milk we could borrow.

805
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,070
And my mom was like,
okay,

806
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:33,940
yeah,
we got a cup of milk.

807
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:35,290
My mom went to get some milk and she
goes,

808
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:35,951
this is my son.
Oh.

809
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:36,491
And I go,
Hey,

810
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:37,630
I go,
why they call you boo?

811
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,310
He said,
cause they said when I was born I was so

812
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:41,960
black.
Then I looked like the sound that goes

813
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,130
makes,
so that was his name.

814
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:46,010
Boom.
So then my mom gives him a cup of milk

815
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,010
and then he walked back carefully with
it for 15 minutes later.

816
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,110
How are you doing Ms. Smith?
Um,

817
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,033

818
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,200
If you got,
um,

819
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,180
I have a cup of sugar she could borrow.
Yeah.

820
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,590
Gotta have company came back.

821
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,750

How are you doing Ms. Smith?

822
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,250
Mama know if you got one eight she could
bow you showing you all need to,

823
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,850
not just one eggs my mom gave him.
I'm going to give you two just in case.

824
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,240
So in any left came back.
How you doing Ms. Smith?

825
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,050
[inaudible] know if you've got a quarter
cup of or she could Jesus real talk my

826
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,270
mom,

827
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:18,160
minutes later.
No.

828
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,770
How are you doing Ms. Smith Mama window
if you want to come over for pancakes.

829
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,900
He was afraid.
He was became my best friend.

830
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:31,900
Like just,
just like that.

831
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,660
And my mind was like,
does she needs therapy?

832
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,550
And you can hear his mom go,
I had that.

833
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,800
Oh that's fun.
And that's how we met.

834
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:41,640
And that was kind of like indicative of
the apartment complex.

835
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:45,840
Like looking back at it,
it was like basically all single moms in

836
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:46,890
that apartment.
Ah.

837
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:51,840
And so all raising young boys and we
would all go outside and play and give

838
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:56,841
each other bad information and
that's why to finger pop girls or

839
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,120
whatever,
whatever it tried to do,

840
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,860
back flip,
whatever it was.

841
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,840
And um,
and so that was a,

842
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,380
it was a,
just a great time in my life because I

843
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:12,381
was born in The Bahamas and then when my
mom left my dad at nine months,

844
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,920
she moved to DC for like a year and then
the pembrook apartments.

845
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,440
So I was in pembrook apartments from
there until like 13 or 14 so why would

846
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:24,990
you start doing comedy?
I started doing comedy in Maryland,

847
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:29,991
man at the greenbelt comedy connection
outside was a huge picture of Martin

848
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,510
Lawrence and Dave Chappelle was just
bubbling,

849
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:40,890
starting to like pop.
And I actually saw Chappelle bomb in

850
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:44,250
there and it isn't all of this is a
negative story.

851
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:47,490
It was fantastic how it happened.
He went up and he was doing this stuff

852
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:49,770
and it was a black crowd at the time,
you know,

853
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,840
he was young man.
We were the same age.

854
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:56,841
So at the time we were both 19 and he
was like,

855
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,770
just trying to figure it out.
And I thought he was great,

856
00:34:58,771 --> 00:34:59,950
but somebody was like,
boom.

857
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,920
And they just thought it just the
collective bulger's like,

858
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:03,330
fuck yeah,
I'm going to be famous.

859
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,920
I'm going to be famous.

860
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,280
Like he literally was saying it.
Then he walked off stage and he sat

861
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,910
right next to where I was and you know,
that just bomb energy.

862
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:14,640
He was just like anyone looking nobody.
And I was just like,

863
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,910
man,
I never seen anything like that happen.

864
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:21,340
And this guy named Tony Woods went up.
I know Tony [inaudible].

865
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,840
They,
uh,

866
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,300
and so then woodsy goes up and was,
he goes,

867
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:26,850
man,
that was great standing ovation.

868
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,010
Right.
Then they walk off,

869
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,520
they walk out together getting the same
car and drive off.

870
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,730
I was like,
oh my God.

871
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:35,610
That was incredible.
Like just seeing that happen.

872
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,473
Yeah.
And,

873
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,580
uh,
and then,

874
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,463
and that,
and that's,

875
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,470
I started in that environment where I
learned how to perform first.

876
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,450
Right.
I had no substance.

877
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,120
I just knew how to,
I was trying not to get boots,

878
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:50,460
so I wasn't talking about shit.
I was just,

879
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,460
man,
you just a very active,

880
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,160
just an entertaining,
uh,

881
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,360
uh,
performer.

882
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,780
But everyone in that environment was so
nurturing.

883
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,600
Like when you got offstage,
other comments like,

884
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:04,231
you know what,
I was funny,

885
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:05,850
first slow down,
say this,

886
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,020
you know,
and it was like a,

887
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,630
it was like a weird,
I don't know,

888
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,500
I never had like other like black men be
vat,

889
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,550
like excited about something that wasn't
sports or women,

890
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,384
you know what I mean?
Like,

891
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,640
and beat that encouraging like,
yeah,

892
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:22,320
man,
you funny to Dah,

893
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,183
Dah,
Dah.

894
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,720
And so I was like,
I'm home.

895
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:25,530
This is,
you know,

896
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,230
and uh,
it was a guy I went to eighth grade

897
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:29,610
with,
cat named Mike Brooks.

898
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,730
He's like the mayor of DC comedy wise.
He had been doing it a year longer than

899
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:39,330
me and took me around all the spots.
So my goal that summer was to just get

900
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,490
paid cause I believe that you got paid.
I'm a professional.

901
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,870
So at the end of the summer,
this guy named pops gave me a crumpled

902
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:50,760
up $25 to perform in front of like six
people in this big place in the

903
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,740
Greenville,
the comedy connection of Laurel.

904
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,500
And uh,
after that you couldn't tell me nothing

905
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,110
because we had performed in,
uh,

906
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,580
it's a lot of spots called cabarets
where the audience is not facing you.

907
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,840
So you're on stage and they're at long
tables eating crabs and stuff and they,

908
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,070
after Corinne and next bat.
Oh yeah.

909
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,270
And if I would get like a laugh or
something,

910
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:12,751
I was like,
oh,

911
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:14,460
okay,
I'm doing it.

912
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,630
And um,
we would,

913
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:18,610
we would do crazy stuff,
like a headline.

914
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:23,611
It would like go short and we would go
up after a headliner and eat it because

915
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:27,870
he just had him,
he was the headliner,

916
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:31,200
but for some reason he had a issue and
we would go up next.

917
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,800
I heard a headline to do that.
Burt Christ was telling me about that

918
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,780
where he would go on after the
headliner.

919
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,710
Yeah.
Cause the headline,

920
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:39,810
I didn't want to do the drop check spot.
Yup.

921
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,090
So he would,
he would go up,

922
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,640
someone would go up and do like 10
minutes.

923
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,020
Yeah.
The headline and we go up do an hour and

924
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,720
then Bert would go up and close the
show.

925
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,850
Yeah.
Mike Brooks was amazing.

926
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,100
Like kind of shit.
Is that,

927
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:52,891
I know.
Yeah.

928
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:54,300
We one time,
this is when,

929
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,980
this is when I took another suite,
Dell,

930
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,810
it was a,
as that same summer,

931
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,210
we were at one spot and they might say,
hey man,

932
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,130
uh,
this,

933
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:02,250
go to,
uh,

934
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:06,690
go to comedy connection in law.
Chris Thomas coming down earlier,

935
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,830
something.
We going to go and close it.

936
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:08,664
And I was like,
all right,

937
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,030
I didn't know if you weren't supposed to
do that.

938
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,880
And I'd get up there.
Chris Thomas Killing,

939
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,510
he was,
uh,

940
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,540
he was the mayor of rap city used to do
this move and he does like a lot of

941
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:20,070
impressions and he was,
he was,

942
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,750
the crowd is literally like crying.
I'm still,

943
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,370
I'm a go.
I'm think I'm going to kill it.

944
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,800
I don't know what's about to happen.
And Mike,

945
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,890
uh,
I went and I had to go first.

946
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,550
That was the other thing.
He set me up like,

947
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,410
yeah,
you go up,

948
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,170
get,
I'm gonna go up.

949
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,470
So I basically had to take like what was
coming.

950
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,740
So Chris leaves and it was no ill will
to none.

951
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,190
He literally had to go do something and
they introduced me.

952
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:50,980
I come out there,
this one I used to wear slacks and shirt

953
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:53,530
was tucked in.
I just smelled like a college kid.

954
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,300
Like I was saying,
what's up y'all?

955
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,150
What's up?
All right bye.

956
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:58,510
He's like,
and the checks are dropping.

957
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:02,000
I didn't understand what that was.
People are looking at their bill man

958
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,410
power rangers,
a crazy life.

959
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,260
Ah,
eight like I'm talking about sweat,

960
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,700
you know,
to flush all terrible,

961
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,520
terrible.
I'll raise offstage and then,

962
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:16,520
um,
I don't think I got booed,

963
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,970
but it was just silence.
It was just no labs.

964
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,990
And then,
uh,

965
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,170
but Mike,
he used to do this trick where he would

966
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:29,470
pat his intro with Shitty,
never did you see them on the Martin

967
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,840
Lawrence show.
You see them opening fussin bird,

968
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,990
you seen him on def jam,
you see,

969
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,120
I was like,
you ain't doing all that.

970
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,830
And he was like,
you gotta figure to you Megan Jordan.

971
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:42,340
And then he went out and he did okay.
And then I just learned a lot of lessons

972
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:43,700
in that era,
you know,

973
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:47,300
like kind of keep going like gift the
shit ain't working,

974
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,920
you know,
just keep going.

975
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,490
And uh,
I really had so much confidence because

976
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:57,080
I feel like that area with some of the,
some of the toughest environments to get

977
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:57,770
labs.

978
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,390
So when I went,
then I went to the Midwest,

979
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,820
I went to school at Notre Dame.
I was like,

980
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:03,640
this shit.
Like I'm,

981
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,960
people are friendly.
Yeah,

982
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,070
he's just going to be so easy to make,
you know,

983
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,640
to be.
And so I started a comedy or funny bone

984
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,730
opened up in south bend and I became
like the House Mc there and I would

985
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:18,050
watch the national headlines come
through and that helps right?

986
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,300
Tremendously.
And that's when I learned substance.

987
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:20,991
Like I was saying,
okay,

988
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:23,360
I gotta,
I gotta have something to say.

989
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,660
Isn't it interesting too,
when you would,

990
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,760
if you would work at a place like that,
I remembered how it wasn't Boston when I

991
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,350
was first starting out.
If I was lucky,

992
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:30,700
I get it

993
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,700
like a hosting gig and I would go get
you to see the quality of some people's

994
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:39,250
material versus others.
You would see a guy coming in as a

995
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:40,220
headline and you're like,
hey,

996
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,570
this is a headliner.
It was just like barely adequate.

997
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,110
Yes.
And you'd watch them all weekend and

998
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,580
you're like,
this is a whack show.

999
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:50,860
And then the next week it'd be Bill
Hicks or something and you go,

1000
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:53,020
Oh fuck yeah.
Next level.

1001
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,370
It's like,
oh Jesus.

1002
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,340
Like you realize like it's the quality
of your thinking.

1003
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,910
Yes.
That'd be like peop people or chime.

1004
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,321
They're,
they're,

1005
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:02,410
they're,
they're tuning in to what you're saying

1006
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,590
and some sort of a weird way that hasn't
totally been defined yet.

1007
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,720
You know?
And when someone is up there and they

1008
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,300
just got some great material,
they've got great shit.

1009
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,170
It's like he puts a smile on your face,
like it gets your brain lights up.

1010
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,390
Like,
ah,

1011
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:16,224
I like where he's going with,

1012
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,370
yes,
I love that.

1013
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:17,900
I love,
I was like,

1014
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,840
oh,
I didn't know you could do that.

1015
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:20,760
What kind of did that with the iphone?
It is,

1016
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:23,340
it is like a,
it sets a personal thing for me.

1017
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:25,560
Like when I see somebody abusing it,
I do get it.

1018
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:26,394
Like,
ugh.

1019
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,140
But now that I'm a little older,
I just go out.

1020
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,280
I,
it doesn't affect me like it used to.

1021
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,320
I used to be like,
I know what you mean.

1022
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,250
Yeah.
When I first out I would get offended.

1023
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,550
Angry.
Yeah,

1024
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,830
yeah,
yeah.

1025
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,693
I'm like,
Eh,

1026
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,610
well whatever.
Yeah.

1027
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:43,820
I think it's just,
we realize like what's a waste of

1028
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,470
energy?
Like it's good to use.

1029
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,900
Use that on yourself.
Like to look at your own material and

1030
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:48,290
go,
oh,

1031
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,090
why the fuck am I doing this?
I fix this.

1032
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,410
Right.
That's going to benefit you.

1033
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,200
But doing it to other people,
it's just a waste

1034
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,630
waste.
But yeah,

1035
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,940
I spent some of my early twenties doing,
they're like,

1036
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,290
oh yeah.
Like I was telling you before we

1037
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,730
started,
um,

1038
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,380
when you talk about Australia,
Franklin,

1039
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:05,160
that Dji was cause I used to,
he said he lived there for a while.

1040
00:42:05,161 --> 00:42:06,360
He lived there and I asked him,
I go,

1041
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,830
why did you move to Australia?
He said,

1042
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:08,880
no guns,
no gangs,

1043
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:10,620
no god.
That's what he said.

1044
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,870
Oh Wow.
But he said the money wasn't,

1045
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,450
um,
on part of what it could be making back

1046
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:16,890
in the states.
So that's why he came back.

1047
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,120
How long did he live there?
For?

1048
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,660
Several years.
But I,

1049
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,420
I don't,
there was this,

1050
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,720
that he was there.
Yeah.

1051
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,450
I don't know.
I don't know.

1052
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:26,970
I remember I saw him in America.
Yeah,

1053
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,873
yeah,
yeah.

1054
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,630
Then he just went over there and,
um,

1055
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,040
but I remember the first comedy album I
heard of his is a picture of him.

1056
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,110
Like,
I can't think of what the name of it is,

1057
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,020
but I'm listening to it because I used
to,

1058
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,540
I was in like Oklahoma.
I can't remember the other comic I was

1059
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:46,650
with and I at that time I used to go to
flea markets to buy albums and we

1060
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:50,730
listened to it at his spot and we smoked
some weed and we were listening to it

1061
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:53,400
and I was like,
he's high.

1062
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,970
Like you can tell he's high on this
album.

1063
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,451
I was like,
wow,

1064
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:58,090
I didn't know you

1065
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:58,923
do that.
Like

1066
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,510
not
that comedian.

1067
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:05,530
Seriously.
Yeah,

1068
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,460
this dude.
But he was,

1069
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,990
he was the first

1070
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,600
a comedian,
the one,

1071
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,870
the one up there with the shirt off.
That's the album we listened to.

1072
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,560
That album right there.
Yeah.

1073
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,310
Dope fry your hair.
Yeah.

1074
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,790
It's funny man.
Smoked dope.

1075
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,410
Fry your hair.
What a strange name is.

1076
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,870
Yeah,
but you could tell he was high when he

1077
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,280
was a funny dude.
Funny Dude.

1078
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,020
I remember that they did about the
Olympics.

1079
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,620
He was on like one of those was a young
comedian specials.

1080
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,210
Is that what it was?
Yeah.

1081
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:39,080
Did that take it goes watching Olympics.
Watching the dude comes in last,

1082
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,390
I don't,
I train for this.

1083
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,600
And he goes and then reality starts to
set it.

1084
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:47,700
Man,
I don't even have a fucking job.

1085
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,600
How could it not trained?
Still came in last tastic he's

1086
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:56,510
fantastic,
but he was the first black

1087
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,530
comedian I heard who didn't grow up.
Uh,

1088
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,630
it's,
it's stick wasn't,

1089
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:02,770
I grew up poor.
Right.

1090
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,790
He was like middle class.
He went to law school and he just talked

1091
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:07,570
about,
I go,

1092
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,351
Oh,
you can talk about that.

1093
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:10,300
Because a lot of,
when I first started,

1094
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:13,120
a lot of comedians taking the stage,
they all felt like they had to fit into

1095
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:15,610
this.
It was a thing that just happened.

1096
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,600
But then when we talked to him offstage,
it's like way more interest in off state

1097
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,710
march.
You talk about that,

1098
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,573
right?

1099
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,860
Do you think it was because they felt
like they had to fit the mold of the

1100
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:28,760
popular comedians?
People wanted a certain kind of comedian

1101
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:29,541
and they felt like,
oh,

1102
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,950
I got to talk about the shit that people
want to,

1103
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,070
how you make

1104
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,910
it?
I think so.

1105
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,100
And then if you,
if you stay in it long enough,

1106
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:39,900
you start to just go because for a time
I had an act for a black room and then

1107
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:42,330
act for white room and it just got
exhausting.

1108
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,530
I used to be physical and I was like,
ah

1109
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,490
man,
I don't even stay in here and talk to

1110
00:44:48,491 --> 00:44:51,640
these people.
Like you just kind of become what you,

1111
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,760
you know already where that's why those
people that work,

1112
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:57,670
those alt rooms getting real trouble
when it comes to a real comedy club.

1113
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,990
You will see that.
Yeah,

1114
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:00,550
man,
it's fantastic.

1115
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,490
I've seen some people in alt rooms go to
the store and fall.

1116
00:45:03,491 --> 00:45:08,491
Joey Diaz and it is horrendous.
It's horrendous because they're just

1117
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:13,771
used to like witty references and clever
subject manner is yes and comedy.

1118
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,580
It's so supportive.
Very supportive,

1119
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,620
which is nice.
It's a nice to have that,

1120
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,190
but it,
but there are also like timid audiences

1121
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:24,671
too,
right?

1122
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:26,620
Like you're Joey Diaz went there.
They'd be,

1123
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,210
they'd be like,
what the fuck?

1124
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,220
Yeah.
Why are you bringing the outside world?

1125
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,160
Yeah,

1126
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,570
we like our little bubble.
But,

1127
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:33,710
uh,
I,

1128
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:37,910
I w they had all seen man,
I liked the fact that they were like,

1129
00:45:37,911 --> 00:45:40,850
I can't get any heat over here so I'm
gonna go create this over here.

1130
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,790
Yeah.
But once it started like taking off,

1131
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,000
I did.
I didn't like the day where it became a,

1132
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,970
it was us against them.
Yeah.

1133
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:49,651
It was like,
Yo,

1134
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:50,484
we all try.

1135
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,010
Yeah.
There was a lot of shitting on people

1136
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,390
that try too hard.
I was like,

1137
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,440
what's he's acting out things and moving
around.

1138
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,950
Oh,
you mean he's been a joke,

1139
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:00,120
right.
It was pretty funny.

1140
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,980
Like you don't want that.
I get it.

1141
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,540
That's kind of what people like people
get weird about like what they're doing.

1142
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:09,020
Like you should only do what I'm doing.
That's,

1143
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,030
that's more like we're talking to,
it's a waste of energy.

1144
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:11,970
It's a waste of energy.

1145
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,910
Why?
Why,

1146
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,670
why do you

1147
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,530
care?
Did you were talking about Tony Woods,

1148
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,950
Tony Woods.
I know you met Tony Way back in New York

1149
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,410
in [inaudible] 92 or some shit like
that.

1150
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,450
He was fucking funny,
man.

1151
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,950
I still is.
I'm sure he has,

1152
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,210
but there's a few dudes like him and
even Franklin,

1153
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,210
I like most people don't know who
Franklin Jaya is.

1154
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:33,120
Like how does that Carla,
how about,

1155
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,310
how'd that guy not like who takes off
and who doesn't?

1156
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,230
How does that work?
I'm trying to figure it out.

1157
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,603
Yeah.

1158
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,130
Um,
I don't know.

1159
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,900
I don't know his whole story,
man.

1160
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,210
Um,
I know for

1161
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:49,450
a lot of Comedians who are mad funny.
Usually marriage or divorce is where

1162
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:55,010
they get some,
they divorce usually like it's like,

1163
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,900
oh yeah,
I'll be away.

1164
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,900
Yeah.
Well they just someone who's fucking

1165
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:02,430
some other dude,
you've got to keep sending you check.

1166
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,820
You got,
Oh,

1167
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,140
you get to see your,
your ex wife and your,

1168
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:09,830
you pick up your kids.
Kids.

1169
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,410
Like mom says you're a loser.
Why?

1170
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1171
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,890
What the fuck?
Yeah.

1172
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,270
It says you ruined everything.
Yeah.

1173
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:17,900
Mom says you can't pay your bills.
What?

1174
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,840
Mom says you need to get a regular job
and stop chasing your dream.

1175
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:22,790
What yet?
Oh,

1176
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,680
that's it right there.
The Voice of fuck you up.

1177
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,020
I think if you married the right person,
you can,

1178
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,730
it can make you better.
Like,

1179
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,210
yeah,
that's what's happening with me,

1180
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,520
my wife.
I like my wife.

1181
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,070
Yeah.
That's a nice thing.

1182
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:34,150
It's important.
Yeah.

1183
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,383
Yeah.
I like mine too.

1184
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,640
Yeah,
I think that helps.

1185
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,690
It did.
It definitely can make you like more

1186
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,250
stable,
more comfortable,

1187
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:44,980
and you learn more about yourself when
you're like totally intimate with a

1188
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:45,590
person.
Yeah.

1189
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,440
Man.
You know somebody really knows you.

1190
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,960
Yeah.
I want to thank you for the compliment.

1191
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:53,320
You gave me somebody.
I had my wife listen to it first because

1192
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:56,580
someone said I did you mention me and
I'm always nervous when I,

1193
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,270
I don't know,

1194
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,560
my wife's a baby,
listen to it.

1195
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:04,850
So he listened to it and I was like,
oh,

1196
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:05,780
that's dope.
And I said,

1197
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,251
Oh,
I said,

1198
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,780
your top 20 baby and my wife,
you knew that already.

1199
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,070
You are?
I said,

1200
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:16,904
I think you're one of the top.

1201
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,230
Are you guys in the world?
Really?

1202
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,490
Doing that makes me feel good.
That makes it,

1203
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,680
it's so funny,
man.

1204
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,970
So many I'm doing,
I'm going to be doing like some,

1205
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,120
some things that I've always wanted to
do years ago,

1206
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,420
but I didn't know to ask for it.
Right.

1207
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,000
That was the thing.
I always thought that people see your

1208
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,180
work and then hey,
but what happened with you?

1209
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:44,040
I think,
cause you started working as a writer.

1210
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,930
Yeah.
That's when they,

1211
00:48:45,931 --> 00:48:48,930
yeah,
they give you a job and then you think

1212
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:52,260
like this is what I do now.
But that job there's,

1213
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,570
there's uh,
there's no free ride.

1214
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,140
Like to get that money for that job is
nice and it gives you stability,

1215
00:48:58,141 --> 00:49:01,110
but it takes away from the potential
earning of your standup.

1216
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,270
And then the dude that you started out
with,

1217
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,510
they're balling out of control.
They're selling out places and people

1218
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:07,770
don't know who you are.
And that to me,

1219
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:10,470
it's crazy when I see you on stage,
I'm like,

1220
00:49:10,471 --> 00:49:14,820
this guy is a world class headline.
Like everybody should know when Smith.

1221
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,581
Yeah.
You know?

1222
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:18,490
And so it just drives me nuts,
man.

1223
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,510
Working on,
and I've been trying with Ian Edwards to

1224
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,750
exact stories.
You same exact story.

1225
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:27,990
Yeah.
I remember when he had long dreads.

1226
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,380
Yes,
I remember that dreads.

1227
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,460
I love history.
Here's what I was just describing.

1228
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,630
His is documented on camera.
Like Ian used to yell at the audience,

1229
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,930
you know what was his bid on Deb?
Sam about,

1230
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:42,060
he used to be mad at 80 and Tisa and
like

1231
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,040
that's how they get you like he used to
be like yelling and then Bob not falling

1232
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:50,350
for it.
Like he was like,

1233
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,650
oh.
And then when he cut his dreads he was

1234
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:54,360
like more centered,
more zen.

1235
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:55,890
Just standing there talking.
I was like,

1236
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,830
well then he became Vegan and now he
falls asleep constantly.

1237
00:49:58,831 --> 00:50:00,080
She has no,
no dizzy.

1238
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,490
When I get on the plane with him,
I'll just take pictures of him.

1239
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,190
I have like 10 pictures on my phone of
Ian out cold.

1240
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,630
He gets US plane.
As soon as he sits down ugly,

1241
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,890
like instantly I'm like,
I got this motherfucker face and take

1242
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:17,220
pictures of us and Larry and then I send
them to him and with a bunch of z's on

1243
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:18,054
it.
That's funny.

1244
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,170
But that's,
I do that too though,

1245
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:22,170
man.
I trained myself to sleep on the plane.

1246
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,270
Yeah.
It's just kind of a thing,

1247
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,040
like when I'm old

1248
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,460
and I just make myself go sleep,
I don't know where I got it from.

1249
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,590
It's a good move.
Yeah,

1250
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,570
definitely make flying easier if you can
get really comfortable with just falling

1251
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,191
on,
you know,

1252
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:35,570
like especially those six hour across
the country,

1253
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,120
fides conk out.
Wake up.

1254
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,240
You feel refreshed.
Yeah.

1255
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:41,140
I'm about to take the first,
ah,

1256
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,200
my son now that he can walk now so I
won't be able to sleep.

1257
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,380
I know he's going to be that kid.
Oh,

1258
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,190
he's going for sure.
Yeah.

1259
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,800
Run up and down the isles getting mad if
you try to hold onto him.

1260
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,490
Kind of look forward to it though.
But I'm like,

1261
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,540
ah.
Yeah.

1262
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,840
It's sad when they get a earaches and
they start crying and you can't do

1263
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:01,110
anything about them.
I mean,

1264
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,270
you can't help them.
You can't,

1265
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,230
there's nothing you could tell him.
Give him some time to think to chew

1266
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:06,981
helps.
Okay,

1267
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,150
that's good to know.
Okay.

1268
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,350
Yeah.
Sometimes like,

1269
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,720
like gummy bears or something that they
have to chew.

1270
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:14,630
It will help pop their ears open.
I got my kid,

1271
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:15,260
these,
uh,

1272
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,380
vitamin gummy bears and gummy bears,
but there they are.

1273
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,330
They're made out of essential fatty
acids.

1274
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,290
They have vitamins in them.
And could you chew it?

1275
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,100
I said,
don't shoot shit right now.

1276
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:26,030
He everything,

1277
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,080
look,
you got to it,

1278
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:30,760
man.
Come on one at a time.

1279
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,690
14 months old man.
They don't know anything yet in this.

1280
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,820
Fascinating,
you know,

1281
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,830
it's like this,
um,

1282
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,000
you know,
you learn a lot about yourself,

1283
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:41,470
man.
I'm telling you that you learned that

1284
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:42,790
year enough.
Yeah,

1285
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,560
it was the biggest lesson.
It's like I'm enough.

1286
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,970
I walk in the door and say,
hey,

1287
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,821
you know,
yeah,

1288
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,710
I don't have to put on a shelf on,
like my wife says when he hears my

1289
00:51:50,711 --> 00:51:51,670
voice,
he lights up.

1290
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,590
Like if I call them.
Awesome.

1291
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,341
And so,
yeah,

1292
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:56,050
I just like talking to them sometimes
when I,

1293
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,820
when I first had him and see,
I didn't know what to say to him.

1294
00:51:57,821 --> 00:52:01,590
So I would just do old hip hop lyrics to
say,

1295
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,560
this kid,
I'm just wrapping stuff.

1296
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,850
Who the hell is this?
[inaudible] 46 in the morning,

1297
00:52:06,851 --> 00:52:08,140
crack of dawn and know him,
your honor.

1298
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,320
And then he'd be like,
I know what to say there man.

1299
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,460
And then I just started,
I would talk to him about my day

1300
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:17,294
sometimes.

1301
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,460
And it's cool man.
It's a very weird feeling.

1302
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,890
We see a little tiny human being that's
dependent upon you.

1303
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,470
It changes your perception of the world.
Everything.

1304
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,330
And it's also like all of us were that
age.

1305
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:29,940
So it's kind of weird when I look at
adults,

1306
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:30,870
I'm like,
man,

1307
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,800
you were 14 months.
I talk about that all time that I look

1308
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:36,390
at people,
it's grown up babies now.

1309
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,340
I used to look at people in a static
state,

1310
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:40,590
like I'd see it year old dude,
that's an 80 year old dude.

1311
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,480
That's how he is.
How he's always been.

1312
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:43,920
No,
he was a baby.

1313
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,690
Yes.
And he became this guy.

1314
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,090
Yeah.
And he had dreams and he trashed it.

1315
00:52:48,091 --> 00:52:49,860
And did it work?
Yeah.

1316
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:54,060
I'm fascinated by people's stories,
like shattered dreams and people with

1317
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:56,250
failed expectations.
There's some of the saddest people

1318
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:58,800
you'll ever get to meet if they just,
for whatever reason,

1319
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,690
it didn't work.
They didn't figure it out,

1320
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,420
whatever mental block,
whatever the problem was,

1321
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:05,250
they just never figured it out.
Yeah,

1322
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:09,360
and that's when no charlatans sneak in
that pretend to be able to sell them.

1323
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,090
Oh,
you gotta do is what you got to do is

1324
00:53:12,091 --> 00:53:14,250
push harder.
You got to dream big,

1325
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:19,140
and you got to set your goals.
What's an easy workshop that we're going

1326
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:21,120
to have?
John hit $1,300.

1327
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,550
We're going to have a workshop and talk
about it.

1328
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,110
I'm going to get out there.
I don't want to clap.

1329
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,660
We're all going to join along.
Clap together.

1330
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,280
We're going to walk on coals.
Hot coals barefoot.

1331
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,560
Ah,
yes.

1332
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,790
That's how they get you,
man.

1333
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,010
Yeah.
The motivational speaking,

1334
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,120
uh,
marketplace is a saturated cess pool of

1335
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,120
most people in it.
Having Accomplished Jack Shit.

1336
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,380
Yeah.
Most of them.

1337
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,630
Most of them.
Their accomplishment is that their

1338
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:49,980
motivational speakers.
Yeah.

1339
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,910
I know a comedian who was a terrible
can.

1340
00:53:51,911 --> 00:53:54,580
I know who you're thinking of doing it
now.

1341
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,221
Wait,
wait,

1342
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:56,841
wait,
wait,

1343
00:53:56,841 --> 00:53:58,440
wait.
Yes.

1344
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,630
That's how that Shit,
mother Fucker,

1345
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,820
and when you meet him,
when you see him out,

1346
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:04,290
he's always flinchy a little bit.
Yeah.

1347
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,900
You know he's fancy like,
like a dude with a sad for him

1348
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:17,380
family.
So flinchy Oh we had a side family.

1349
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:18,280
Okay,
I get it.

1350
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,660
Oh Man.
That's a lot of pressure.

1351
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,620
Yeah,
it's a lot of pressure.

1352
00:54:20,621 --> 00:54:21,460
Yeah,
I know that cat.

1353
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,240
Good luck man.
I hope it works out.

1354
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:24,700
Yeah,
it was a lot of those guys off there and

1355
00:54:24,701 --> 00:54:28,360
listen to this crowd.
I would like to say I'm might have

1356
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,680
be responsible a little bit and this is
very,

1357
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,540
this is,
I'm literally,

1358
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,420
this may not be true.
Okay.

1359
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,470
We did a show together a long time ago
and it was a college kid in the college

1360
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,450
gigs.
They make you both doing our right.

1361
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,830
They don't know how to just go,
hey man,

1362
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:46,120
you do have.
Right.

1363
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:50,590
And so he was harder as far as credits
cause he had,

1364
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,810
you know,
comedy central,

1365
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,650
love this guy.
And they were like,

1366
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,070
um,
so he would,

1367
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:59,080
they would like a own,
you go first and I could see in his eyes

1368
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:01,850
definitely.
I was like,

1369
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:03,770
it was like one of those quiet things
where I go,

1370
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,070
you know how you go,
Oh,

1371
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,060
I'm going to do,
I'm gonna.

1372
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,650
Yeah.
Because sometimes if it's somebody you

1373
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:10,730
like,
you'll do all right.

1374
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:12,770
And then they'd come.
I was like,

1375
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:16,700
let me go ahead and just show this dude.
Like what this could really be,

1376
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,510
man.
I'm telling you,

1377
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,413
clap,
clap,

1378
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,200
look dude,
look,

1379
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:22,930
clack glass

1380
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,890
58 minute free.
And Emma,

1381
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:24,431
thank you.
Good night.

1382
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:25,330
Just left,
you know,

1383
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,960
game of game,
a great intro or whatever.

1384
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:34,650
Like I saw him reevaluate and I think,
I feel like at that moment he was like,

1385
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,640
yeah,
just gotta be another method.

1386
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:38,530
Yeah.
He probably had like another two year

1387
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:39,430
run,
like,

1388
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,690
you know,
but that,

1389
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,360
I was at a Vegan restaurant that I eat
out occasionally.

1390
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,730
This dude was in there with all of these
people that he works with.

1391
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,900
They meet together in this restaurant.
Yeah.

1392
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,960
I saw him at a raw food spot before he
came up to me when I was with my

1393
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:58,330
daughter once and he's like,
I just love to talk to you about a

1394
00:55:58,331 --> 00:56:00,700
transformative experience that I've had.
I really would love to get on your

1395
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:01,534
podcast,
Mike,

1396
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,270
the fuck out of here,
man.

1397
00:56:04,271 --> 00:56:06,880
It's so funny.
Mason kit is it transformative

1398
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:08,470
experience?
Okay,

1399
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,930
I believe you.
Yeah man.

1400
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:11,950
Hey Man.
You know,

1401
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,060
good luck.
Keep people,

1402
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:15,280
people doing things.
People are doing things,

1403
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:19,060
but there's a real problem with people
that are just motivators.

1404
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,380
Yeah.
That's all they're doing.

1405
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,900
All you're doing is motivated and
there's a lot of,

1406
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,250
man,
there's a lot

1407
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,770
of them.
I'm always getting these fucking memes

1408
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:27,381
from people.
I'm like,

1409
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:29,080
who's this guy?
Then I'll go to this page.

1410
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:31,150
It's all filled with memes and then you
know,

1411
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:32,080
like you'll look at it,
they're like,

1412
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:33,610
he's a motivational speaker.
Oh,

1413
00:56:33,611 --> 00:56:34,720
you're a motivational speaker.
Well,

1414
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:35,930
what have you done?
Had He,

1415
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:41,250
it's weird to be a motivational speaker
who's never done a one thing.

1416
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:47,060
Like you have to start a company,
come up something or life coaches.

1417
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:50,080
Same kind of thing.
Yeah.

1418
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:55,330
But the weird thing is some of them,
like there are trainers that have never

1419
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:57,430
had professional fights and they're
great trainers.

1420
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,940
Okay,
but they have studied the game like so

1421
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:03,310
deeply.
They understand all the various aspects

1422
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:04,144
of the game,
right?

1423
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,280
And then they become just really good at
it.

1424
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:10,060
I'm really good at coaching because they
were like real legitimate analysts.

1425
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,190
Is that possible to do with life?

1426
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:16,390
Can you be a person who has never really
accomplished much in term nothing

1427
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,100
creatively,
nothing.

1428
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,920
Nothing.
Like you're not some world champion

1429
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:23,080
dude.
You're not some guy who's gone out there

1430
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:26,710
and accomplish great things.
You're not like Sebastian younger award

1431
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:27,544
journalists.
You're not.

1432
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,480
You're just some guy who's like,
well,

1433
00:57:29,481 --> 00:57:32,950
you got to do is realize that you face
fear in the eyes.

1434
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:36,880
You tell fear.
I think that's the nature of your soul.

1435
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,150
It's the approach man.
It's like they have,

1436
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,460
you can't tell people what they have to
do,

1437
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,800
but I feel like you like,
so I feel like you're a bigger motivator

1438
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,400
than a motivational speaker because you
motivate by example,

1439
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,410
but you just motivated by doing you.
You see what I'm saying?

1440
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:55,750
Like,
that's more motivational than

1441
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,400
telling people,
I'm going to tell you how I do what I

1442
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:01,480
do.
It's like I don't want to,

1443
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:02,350
I just,
Oh,

1444
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:02,950
Joe did that.

1445
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:03,550
Oh,
that's dope.

1446
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,770
Then you know what I mean?
So you just go,

1447
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,530
oh,
okay,

1448
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,510
Joe comes from comedy.
Oh Shit.

1449
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,780
Okay.
All right.

1450
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:09,750
If he did,
I let me,

1451
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,950
what am I not doing?
You know what I mean?

1452
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:14,590
Like to me that's more motivational
then.

1453
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,450
That's how I feel coming to my front
door.

1454
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,450
And uh,
you know what I mean?

1455
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,220
But you know,
when people are always looking for some

1456
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:24,880
sort of a s of course shortcut,
you know,

1457
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:27,860
like someone is going to end.
Sometimes people can give you like I

1458
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:31,390
have like these I had yesterday on the
podcast,

1459
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,780
but he's a six time world champion power
lifter and you know,

1460
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:37,450
when he talks about hard work and
dedication and you know,

1461
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:39,430
like fuck your excuses.
Like you're like,

1462
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:40,350
okay,
fuck my excuses.

1463
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,820
Like it makes sense right now.
Like you believe him.

1464
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,510
But I think there's a lot of people out
there that want to be that guy,

1465
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:48,490
but they don't want to do that kind of
work.

1466
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:52,360
They don't want to accomplish some great
task before they go out and do this.

1467
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:54,410
All this motivational stuff,
right.

1468
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,550
They want to,
you know,

1469
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,250
personal,
they want that and hippie pussy.

1470
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:59,590
That's what they,
that's what they,

1471
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,650
that's what they want.
That's what a lot of it is.

1472
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:04,690
You want those girls who are trying to
improve themselves.

1473
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,940
I'm just trying to be more spiritual.
Me Too.

1474
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,130
Vulnerable.
Vulnerable.

1475
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,290
It's not just vulnerable.
It's seeking,

1476
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,890
seeking like yoga girls,
dude,

1477
00:59:14,891 --> 00:59:17,770
yoga girls.
There are so many freaks in,

1478
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,610
in the yoga community.
You know,

1479
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,310
so funny.
I'm so,

1480
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,930
I'm so,
uh,

1481
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,540
above board.
Like I've gone,

1482
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:30,230
I go to yoga and I do my,
my thing and then I'll,

1483
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:31,550
I'll look,
but I'm like,

1484
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,480
I don't even know how to make this my
spot.

1485
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,560
You know what I mean?
Like something,

1486
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,640
some guys,
yeah,

1487
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:38,950
let's go to yoga.
Like they,

1488
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:41,750
they know,
cause I heard one of my yoga teachers

1489
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:45,350
hit on a student in middle line was so
lane.

1490
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,760
He said,
um,

1491
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,810
I feel like I've practiced.
Um,

1492
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,210
what did he say?
What was what,

1493
00:59:52,211 --> 00:59:54,020
what are you always trying to reach?
Um,

1494
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,370
and Yoga,
whatever that shit is.

1495
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,520
I feel like I've practiced something,
something,

1496
00:59:58,521 --> 01:00:00,560
something with you before.
And she goes,

1497
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:02,060
yeah,
it does feel like that.

1498
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,810
It was
terrible.

1499
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,800
They started talking,
he had his hair and shit and I was like,

1500
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:11,060
there it is.
That's,

1501
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,280
I could never,
that's not my thing,

1502
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:13,640
man.

1503
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,210
But yeah,
Yoga is when people are talking about

1504
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,130
the practice and they say,
that was an amazing practice.

1505
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,710
I can't talk to you.
Yes.

1506
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,520
Yes.
I feel like I've practiced.

1507
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,220
I forgot what he said.
I just want it to,

1508
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,030
but I'm not a cock block,
but I just thought it was something like

1509
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:32,510
that.
Something out on a mat before it's done.

1510
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:34,730
Yes.
Sonia's.

1511
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,170
Oh yeah.
What is it?

1512
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,040
I wasn't,
what's the word?

1513
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,140
It just taking the class.
I don't know.

1514
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:39,974
Yeah,
man.

1515
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:40,690
You know?
Yeah.

1516
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:43,190
It did this thing.
How often do you go?

1517
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,330
Once a day.
Once a week thing.

1518
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,150
Yeah.
I try to keep it no more than,

1519
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,830
well,
no less than once a week.

1520
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:53,000
But I've fucked up since I did a sober
October.

1521
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,310
We had 15 classes that we had to do in a
month.

1522
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,260
Did I tell you about this?
Me,

1523
01:00:57,261 --> 01:00:59,360
Thompson Guerra,
Bert Kreischer and Ari Shaffir.

1524
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,210
We made an agreement.
No Pot,

1525
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,360
no booze,
15 hot yoga classes,

1526
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:08,810
90 minute hot yoga classes in a month.
It was rough,

1527
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,690
but it broke me.
It broke me in terms of my enthusiasm

1528
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:15,860
for yoga.
I like enough because what really broke

1529
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,990
me was not just a 15 classes.
I could've done that,

1530
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:22,991
but I did nine in a row to end it.
I just said I had some days after that

1531
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:24,380
too that I could get it,
but I was like,

1532
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:25,670
no,
I'm going to burn this shit out.

1533
01:01:25,671 --> 01:01:27,980
I'm just going to bang it out.
Nine or I was going Saturday,

1534
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:30,810
Sunday,
Monday,

1535
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:30,810
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

1536
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:30,810
Thursday,
Friday,

1537
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:31,643
Saturday,
Sunday.

1538
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,110
But it,
when it was on it,

1539
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,330
when it was over,
it felt good.

1540
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:35,031
Yeah.
I feel good.

1541
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:35,900
Right?
I did it.

1542
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:41,020
What I'm Russell Simmons gave me a month
free at his Tantra Yoga spot when he

1543
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,730
went.
He does tantric yoga,

1544
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,030
Tantra,
Tantra.

1545
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,480
It's that,
what's the difference?

1546
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,530
I could tantric cause what you're
holding your comeback,

1547
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:49,670
right?
Squeeze it.

1548
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,740
Not your last longer just due to do that
all day.

1549
01:01:55,741 --> 01:01:58,370
They just
ease their,

1550
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:03,590
their Dick Muscle it.
That's like the weakest muscle I have in

1551
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:05,660
my body.
You know,

1552
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,780
if you think about if he's thinking,
if you just squeeze,

1553
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,390
hold the comeback muscle,
like use that right now.

1554
01:02:12,391 --> 01:02:14,910
Just try to slow it down right now.
Right now ready to go.

1555
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,780
Does that feel so spongy and weak?
Like if I have to squeeze my arms like

1556
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:22,770
my choke muscles like Oh yeah you could
do that.

1557
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,810
Choke the fuck out of somebody right
now.

1558
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,240
But like chuck my own Dick with my
dinner,

1559
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:32,490
with my air ticket muscles like nothing.
It's like I'm saying tires a week,

1560
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,940
Eh Jesus.

1561
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,440
Those muscles have zero conditioning.
I remember somebody told me,

1562
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,390
you know how you do dumb shit?
Like,

1563
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,840
I don't know if you ever did this,
but somebody told me if you press on

1564
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:56,100
that area like really hard for a couple
of seconds that it won't do it right

1565
01:02:56,101 --> 01:02:58,290
that you won't come.
And I tried that shit before.

1566
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,090
Didn't work.
Garden Hose,

1567
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,520
you get a bear in a gardener,
right?

1568
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,600
It came out basically choking out your
deck.

1569
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:06,990
You choking it out.
You gotta just get a gable grip and go

1570
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,850
down there.
Andrew Mash the base.

1571
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:10,660
Your Dick.
Like I just,

1572
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,600
I just come and apologize.
It's like,

1573
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:16,080
Hey,
I got what I wanted.

1574
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:18,030
I'm sorry.
Give me 20 minutes.

1575
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,550
Well we were reading about mail key
goals once.

1576
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,380
Oh,
like a mail key goals.

1577
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,310
And I'm like,
listen dude,

1578
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:25,810
I don't care what anybody says.
This is the tighten up your butthole,

1579
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,713
but sex.

1580
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,000
But they're not talking about that.
They're like sort of dancing around

1581
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,650
that.
Like all the benefits of mail.

1582
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:34,290
Key goals.
Like you can control your bowels better.

1583
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:36,210
We control your total status.
Right?

1584
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,980
What do you mean better?
Like who silo.

1585
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,290
I mean it's one thing he got diarrhea,
but right.

1586
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,560
Regular control of the bowels is pretty
much 100% it's out.

1587
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:45,000
It's coming out.
I know what I'm doing.

1588
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,660
Oh Man.
Oh,

1589
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:47,520
you know,
it was crazy.

1590
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,640
So that's fine.
This is nasty,

1591
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:53,290
but
it's,

1592
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:54,660
I'm only child,
right?

1593
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:56,130
So growing up like,
shit,

1594
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:57,360
what happened to me?
And I would just be like,

1595
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:01,160
what the fuck is that?
So when I take like really good shit's

1596
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,470
like,
I cry like,

1597
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,630
so
this is when it worked in my advantage,

1598
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:13,010
my son something,
he was doing something and me and my

1599
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:15,770
wife couldn't figure it out.
And then there's one tier was I go,

1600
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,200
I always taking a shit.
He gets that from me.

1601
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,920
Like it was accurate.
He had to shit and it's for something

1602
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:24,170
was going on.
And so then we helped them and adjusting

1603
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:25,760
them and I,
my wife,

1604
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:28,790
if she watched you watched it,
she'll find out about this.

1605
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:31,070
He does not know that about me just now
what?

1606
01:04:31,071 --> 01:04:31,904
I know.
She knows.

1607
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:34,790
That's how I was able to crack that
mystery because everything is a mystery.

1608
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,740
And I go,
what's he doing?

1609
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:38,570
He was just sitting there,
but he had this look on his face

1610
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:40,860
came.
I'm like,

1611
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,680
Oh,
I just pass that on.

1612
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:47,410
Oh,
that's so crazy.

1613
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,460
What a random level

1614
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,680
random thing,
man.

1615
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:53,380
Like it's so crazy.
Yeah,

1616
01:04:53,381 --> 01:04:54,520
I dunno.
I Dunno man.

1617
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,260
That's so strange.
Yeah,

1618
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:57,280
it's so crazy,
man.

1619
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:00,880
It's weird how though the body work,
like sometimes I'll just be driving down

1620
01:05:00,881 --> 01:05:02,350
the street and a tear rolled down my
cheek.

1621
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:03,490
I was like,
I'm not even sad.

1622
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,810
Yeah.
I'm not happy.

1623
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,040
I'm not selling.
Why am I crying?

1624
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,890
Sometimes it's just leaking.
Right.

1625
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,280
It's amazing.
May you know what else?

1626
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,133
My Body,

1627
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,810
if I'm in a room and I'm supposed to be
awake,

1628
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,400
you ever get like sleepy?
Sometimes if I get sleepy,

1629
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,600
my Dick will get home

1630
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:28,650
around that area.

1631
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:33,750
Well sometimes I'll be in writer's rooms
that I get sleepy and my and start

1632
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:34,650
getting like,
oh fuck.

1633
01:05:34,651 --> 01:05:37,200
So then I'll try to go to the bathroom
to throw board on my face.

1634
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:39,510
But now I'm slightly like a wreck
getting up.

1635
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:41,700
So making sure nobody's looking at me.
Right.

1636
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,290
Like some freak.
Yeah.

1637
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:44,550
Yeah.
So I'm like always in there.

1638
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:46,690
Always pull my shit down.
But it's not funny.

1639
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,390
You get an erection.
Everybody knows you get erection.

1640
01:05:50,391 --> 01:05:51,224
Yeah.
Right.

1641
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,840
If they get an erection near them,
like what the fuck?

1642
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,940
I know I had a boner.
Sorry.

1643
01:05:58,941 --> 01:06:00,500
Sorry.
It's human nature,

1644
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,690
but you can't,
especially in mixed company.

1645
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,553
Yeah,
yeah.

1646
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,080
Especially today.
Nah,

1647
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,620
you can't day half the day,
man.

1648
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:10,790
Just think about all the sexual
harassment that people just sort of like

1649
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,770
that was there the way they behaved.
Yeah.

1650
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,410
Yeah.
The office,

1651
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:18,910
that was their thing.
And now you see now you can't do that.

1652
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,100
Why they went to the office,
like they couldn't wait to get to work

1653
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:22,900
to

1654
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,430
chase whomever was there,
pinch the secretary and the blood.

1655
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,480
I mean it's,
you know,

1656
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:31,480
my mom had a thing like that when I was
a kid.

1657
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,060
I didn't understand it,
but somebody was,

1658
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,320
you know,
she needed the job.

1659
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:37,710
So what I will say to,
you know,

1660
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,840
um,
women watching what my mom did and she

1661
01:06:40,841 --> 01:06:45,130
just kept elaborate notes so that,
cause she knew it was gonna be his word

1662
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,500
against hers.
And you know,

1663
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:48,760
predators don't keep notes,
man.

1664
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,540
They don't keep notes.
So right.

1665
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:54,850
Mom was like October 8th Dah,
Dah,

1666
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:55,840
Dah,
Dah.

1667
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,673
They,
you know,

1668
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,110
she was protected and so,
wow.

1669
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,210
It's just don't try to go off memory
like that,

1670
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:03,820
you know,
even if you're keep notes,

1671
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:05,440
man,
still you against them.

1672
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:06,370
Yeah,
it still is.

1673
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:08,610
But back then boss,
whoa.

1674
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,630
But still once you,
cause that's how,

1675
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,630
who I think,
who had somebody else had no,

1676
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,620
the Weinstein thing.
Somebody kept like notes and that's why,

1677
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:18,454
I mean,
cause you,

1678
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:21,040
when you have a lot of money you can
definitely litigate it.

1679
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,750
Like I'm a sue under the right.
But when somebody,

1680
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,930
you know,
and I think his legal team looked at it,

1681
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:28,150
they were like,
you better go to Europe for some deep

1682
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:30,880
counseling cause however they,
you know,

1683
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,590
Europe counseling and a different level.
That's the,

1684
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,310
I believe the continent.
Right,

1685
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,150
right.
My head on straight,

1686
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:38,710
I'm gonna stay over here.
Yeah.

1687
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,900
It's to be able to do that.
It's crazy.

1688
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,010
Well like

1689
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:46,090
you look at like the Kevin Spacey thing,
like that's how he would run a set.

1690
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,670
Apparently he'd be on the set and he'd
just be grabbing dicks on the set.

1691
01:07:49,671 --> 01:07:50,650
Serious.
Yeah.

1692
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:52,410
That's what they're all saying.
I mean,

1693
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,030
I don't know if that's the truth,
but all the people in the House of card

1694
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:56,710
set,
this is what all the complaints are

1695
01:07:56,711 --> 01:08:00,880
coming out was that he would like grab
guys dicks that we're taking them places

1696
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:03,070
and he'd have like a PA that had to take
him somewhere.

1697
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:04,810
He reached in his pants and grabbed his
dick.

1698
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:08,310
He was just a dick.
Dick crab grabbed um,

1699
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,470
whose dick was it that he grabbed like
some famous dude,

1700
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,240
uh,
Richard Dreyfus.

1701
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,890
He grabbed his son's Dick and him in the
room.

1702
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,520
Ah,
he was just a crazy Dick grabber stop

1703
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:23,300
maniac.
Crazy drunk Dick grabbing,

1704
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,520
ah,
the reservation.

1705
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:30,350
And I think this is their social
environment as well as their working

1706
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:31,060
environment,
right?

1707
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,580
They're constantly around all these
people and they're,

1708
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:36,040
they're in this king roll.
Yay.

1709
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,680
Like if you're a star of a show that
you're the executive producer of and

1710
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:42,200
it's a giant hit for Netflix and you're
the king.

1711
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:46,430
I'm Frank Underwood,
the king of House of cards and all the

1712
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:49,420
people rely on you for their jobs.
This is one of the things they're saying

1713
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:53,000
about house of cards is that 2000 people
could be out of a job.

1714
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,860
Exactly.
Which is crazy.

1715
01:08:55,370 --> 01:09:00,370
So this guy was like at the epicenter,
like he was the p the king of 2000

1716
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:05,400
people.
So he would show up at work and his ego.

1717
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,740
I'm the king,
you know.

1718
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:14,730
And I think that is like natural male
predatory behavior when um,

1719
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:18,780
I think when a man gets into a position
where he's the king and all these people

1720
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:20,570
Cya,
maybe we get you something sire.

1721
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,360
Like if you're on a set and you're like
the big star,

1722
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,550
all these people are stumbling around
sire.

1723
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,770
Maybe,
maybe we get you something sire.

1724
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:31,220
Like you start thinking like a king.
Like if you're Harvey Weinstein,

1725
01:09:31,221 --> 01:09:33,020
like think about all the people that
covered up for him.

1726
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,170
He had it written in his contract was
crazy.

1727
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,300
I mean,
but also just think of that work ethic

1728
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:39,134
man.
Like,

1729
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:44,180
you know what I mean?
He like just to work that hard.

1730
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:48,620
And then the part that trips me out is
when people would show up to the victims

1731
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:50,320
ago,
tell me everything to me.

1732
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,130
We're going to,
we're going to take him down.

1733
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:54,440
And then those people were investigators
and they go,

1734
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,670
I work for Weinstein,
bitch.

1735
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:58,760
Like you better not,
you know how fucked up that it has to

1736
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,790
have you walking around in the world.
But they're predators,

1737
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:02,120
man.

1738
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,630
And they'd look for like,
you know,

1739
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:08,300
it's this weird shit,
but it's like if you,

1740
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,870
you know,
they had like a parent or somebody

1741
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,710
going,
baby do you think is safe to,

1742
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,110
you know,
meet with him at three in the morning.

1743
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:16,520
And they were like,
mama is cool.

1744
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,350
It's going to be fine.
Trust me.

1745
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:19,910
Why don't you trust me?
You know?

1746
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:23,300
And then when something happens,
they feel like they can't say anything

1747
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:27,380
because they don't want the,
I told you so they don't want to,

1748
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,010
oh,
well,

1749
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,270
whatever it is.
And then that,

1750
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:33,230
that moment can turn into two weeks and
I saying that you had six month,

1751
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,280
then you're living,
you know what I mean?

1752
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:38,020
And,
and so that's how it can happen when

1753
01:10:38,021 --> 01:10:40,460
you're just so embarrassed.
You know what I mean?

1754
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,910
Or you don't want to embarrass or hurt
other people at times.

1755
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:46,700
Sometimes people don't say anything
because they don't want to make their

1756
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,040
parents feel what type of way,
you know?

1757
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,130
Yeah.
There's a lot on a lot of women that had

1758
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:56,060
been rape victims that the,
the stigma of being a rape victim,

1759
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,950
excuse me,
publicly,

1760
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,940
is it's so hard.
It's so terrifying on tariffs.

1761
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:02,960
They don't even,
they're like,

1762
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:06,020
I'll just let it slide and it's,
it's like man,

1763
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,490
it's horrible.
Yes.

1764
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,560
I mean,
so I'm personally,

1765
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:13,620
I'm happy that people are finally
speaking,

1766
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,910
you know,
coming out.

1767
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:15,740
Cause it's,
it's,

1768
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,080
it's a lot of jobs opening up.

1769
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,440
I'm really happy that people are finding
that courage to just,

1770
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,510
you know,
speak that truth and we'll see what

1771
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:28,530
happens on the other side of it.
Will we be a healthier society saying

1772
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:31,290
this for a while that I think that
eventually we're going to get to a point

1773
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,930
where we could read each other's minds.
I really think that that's on the,

1774
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:36,330
on the horizon.
I think it's just a matter of time

1775
01:11:36,331 --> 01:11:39,510
before no one can ever do anything like
that ever again.

1776
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,650
And I think that's what you're seeing
now with like this Harvey Weinstein Shit

1777
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:45,570
and the Kevin Spacey Shit and all this
other stuff.

1778
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,540
I mean you see varying degrees of it.
Some of them seem pretty innocuous.

1779
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,850
Like Al Franken just likes to grab butts
when he takes a picture.

1780
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:55,530
It's like not the best practice,
not the worst thing in the world,

1781
01:11:55,790 --> 01:12:00,120
but I think we're going to get to a
point where all of this is look back on

1782
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:04,560
like wearing powdered wigs or slavery or
any crazy old shit that we just don't

1783
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:05,450
tolerate it anymore.

1784
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:08,220
Just nutty behavior that you just can't
do anymore.

1785
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,000
I think we're going to get to a point
where you're going to be able to talk to

1786
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:15,240
someone and you're going to be able to
see what's going on in their head and

1787
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:16,770
you,
you would have to be a real piece of

1788
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:20,220
shit to victimize them cause you're
going to get to see what their exact

1789
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:21,870
feelings.
Oh you just need this job.

1790
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:24,270
You're not really attracted to me.
You don't like me at all,

1791
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,270
like you just need this job,
but you might have let me jerk off on

1792
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:29,880
you if you could keep this job because
it's gross.

1793
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,490
I gotta stop.
You know?

1794
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,750
It was interesting too.
I think that this is a direct reaction

1795
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:36,660
to us not communicating with one
another.

1796
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,060
You know what I mean?
It's a day like today,

1797
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:41,490
like everything is texts.
Like put my boys in a single day,

1798
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:44,130
you know,
they getting girls to texts like have

1799
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:44,964
you talked to her yet?

1800
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,600
But she's sending me like all this.
So you're not really,

1801
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:50,370
yeah.
And I think can be taken out of context,

1802
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:52,680
what have you before.
But yeah,

1803
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:55,080
it is getting to the place where you're
going to have to be really clear with

1804
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:57,070
your intentions.
Like I'm married to see it.

1805
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,040
You can be able to see tensions on
people.

1806
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,840
Oh Wow.
You know another thing I think that is

1807
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:03,180
ridiculous,
and I'm not pro prostitution,

1808
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,630
but I think it should be legal.
And I think if it was legal you would

1809
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:08,640
have way less of this gone.
Oh yeah.

1810
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,180
Wait.
Hello?

1811
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,260
Yeah.
Cause that's what it is,

1812
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,090
right?
It's just that release and people need

1813
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:13,680
to craziness.
It's forbidden.

1814
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:14,550
Shit.
There's a lot,

1815
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:17,520
there's a lot of factors going on,
but I think one of the things that would

1816
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:22,170
change is that people that want like
ugly dudes like Harvey Weinstein,

1817
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:24,030
it just want sex and here you're going
to just go get it.

1818
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,490
But I think for him it's like a power
thing too definite.

1819
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:29,010
I mean,
he was banging all those really hot like

1820
01:13:29,011 --> 01:13:32,220
famous chicks.
And this drug dealer told me a long time

1821
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,690
ago,
it was two things he was talking about,

1822
01:13:33,691 --> 01:13:34,800
man,
it says two things,

1823
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:37,530
man,
understand ass whooping or a secret.

1824
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,980
And if you came with they ass,
you better get a secret.

1825
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:44,610
So,
and that's,

1826
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:46,200
uh,
you know,

1827
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:50,880
I feel like Harvey doing that shit to a
lot of people because they became huge

1828
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:51,714
stars,
right?

1829
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:54,540
There's no reason for them to ever have
to respect him again.

1830
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,760
You know what I mean?
But he was like,

1831
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:57,540
yeah,
but you,

1832
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,371
you know,
with this is,

1833
01:13:58,371 --> 01:13:59,630
you know,
take my whatever,

1834
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,120
whatever his,
well that would,

1835
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,840
apparently he,
he wouldn't negotiate it into deals.

1836
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:05,790
He would say,
if you fuck me,

1837
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,820
you'll get more lines.
You'll get part to get this.

1838
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:11,130
You get that.
And so it's like,

1839
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,390
I mean,
but that is like my main,

1840
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:15,130
he was like,
so what,

1841
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:17,920
when do you know your worth?
Right.

1842
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:18,850
And when you know,
well,

1843
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,470
the view,
you know what I mean?

1844
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:22,930
I'm good.
I don't need this here over here.

1845
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,750
Or I've already,
the work I've already done like my,

1846
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,430
my last work paid for all this shit.
Right.

1847
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:32,470
Where are you getting your money?
You're getting your money from something

1848
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:33,610
I did.
You know what I mean?

1849
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:35,560
Like instead of thinking about it like,
Oh,

1850
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:39,820
you can give me more money.
It's like you sitting on this,

1851
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,730
you got this sweet from my performance.
You know what I mean?

1852
01:14:42,731 --> 01:14:43,564
Like,
right.

1853
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,430
This dude wrote,
you didn't do shit.

1854
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:48,100
Yeah.
He literally came up with this guy wrote

1855
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,570
this guy shot it.
Yeah.

1856
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:50,310
Yeah.
You Ain't,

1857
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:51,190
that's what's interesting.
He's like,

1858
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:53,280
he's not the creative guy.
I don't know.

1859
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,360
No,
it's just the money guy that fucks the

1860
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,170
women.
Yeah,

1861
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,310
it's weird.
It's weird,

1862
01:14:57,311 --> 01:14:59,590
man.
It's weird how long you got away with it

1863
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:02,650
for it.
For decade after decade after decade.

1864
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:03,760
It's,
it's,

1865
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,880
it's crazy man.
It's almost like the,

1866
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:09,060
like every person that you look at me
like,

1867
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,140
Oh man,
that person doesn't know.

1868
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:12,640
What shocked me the most about Matt
Lauer.

1869
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:14,430
That motherfucker was making $20
million.

1870
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:20,240
25 I heard it was 2,500 2028
and they had to pay him.

1871
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,940
They had to pay him to pay him out.
Last contract,

1872
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:27,400
they said I was just reading,
they don't know if it's going to be

1873
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,110
finished through is 2018 contract,
but he also was getting flown a

1874
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:36,040
helicopter rides too,
is like a Hampton's house so he could

1875
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:39,010
spend more time with his family or
something in between.

1876
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,150
Damn Matt Lauer things.
Well,

1877
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,240
what happened?
All of them call us cats.

1878
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,990
Get paid out though.
What's the Charlie rose get when he had

1879
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:48,280
to step out?
Did he get paid out?

1880
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,490
But he was on pbs.
It probably wasn't getting paid.

1881
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:51,850
Riley got a lot of extra money,
right?

1882
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:57,660
Riley paid 30 $35 million in a sexual
harassment settlement.

1883
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,180
Like what the fuck could you have
possibly done?

1884
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,370
Just think about it.
Faculty like,

1885
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,910
okay,
okay,

1886
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:05,860
if I give you 35 million,
you shut the fuck up.

1887
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:09,400
Like 5 million is j Lo House.
Hold up though,

1888
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:10,480
Joe,
this is fucked up.

1889
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:13,930
But that victim should be a motivational
speaker

1890
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:19,530
that vic motivates to talk to other
victims that I had.

1891
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:20,250
It was,
hey,

1892
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:24,520
first thing I did was I limped around.
I pretended I couldn't walk good.

1893
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:27,580
And
I always get nervous.

1894
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:30,580
I'd have to sit down 35 I put the
vulnerable.

1895
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:31,980
It worked out.
Yeah,

1896
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,090
I mean,
I wonder what he did.

1897
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,440
I mean,
it was just one.

1898
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,320
I mean another one,
I think he paid 12 there was like

1899
01:16:38,321 --> 01:16:40,570
several different ones that he had to
pay off.

1900
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:43,720
Like this guy was on a rampage for years
and years.

1901
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:44,950
Yeah,
he's a trick man.

1902
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:47,980
He was on the streets.
He's a trick that pays well.

1903
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:52,660
He's a house money.
35,000,035 come on man.

1904
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,940
And everybody already knows you're a
freak.

1905
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:58,480
So it's like you wasted 35 million.
Like everybody knows you're a freak.

1906
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,490
Yeah.
And so who do we,

1907
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,570
where do you start?
Like is it the platform who,

1908
01:17:02,571 --> 01:17:05,390
who gave them the platform and that guy,
you know,

1909
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:08,080
I think it's a bunch of things,
but one of the things that I think it is

1910
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:10,310
is that that world

1911
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,570
is so sexually charged.
All the men are like these powerful

1912
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:18,890
wealthy men and all the women are hot as
fuck and the off short skirts on and

1913
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:23,150
they're all talking about like,
like American values and it's all

1914
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:25,910
conservative values.
That's all super,

1915
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:30,850
super breast behind closed doors as
button popping and fucking

1916
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,910
trading,
snoring,

1917
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,553
Pussy,
lips,

1918
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,400
Woo.
Maca

1919
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:45,320
being a policy.
That's what's so puritanical too though,

1920
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:46,220
man.
You know,

1921
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:49,280
they don't teach,
they don't teach six education

1922
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:54,140
to younger kids is never cool to talk
about this shit.

1923
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,860
So there's definitely that.
But it's also the suppression,

1924
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:01,190
the ones that are like super religious,
super suppressed.

1925
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,460
Like those are the ones that have this,
they have a need for an outlet.

1926
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:05,660
Of course.
Yes.

1927
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,950
Yeah.
And I feel like it's,

1928
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,440
it's equal.
Right.

1929
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,500
So the amount that you put out,
you equally have,

1930
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:13,850
right.
You know what I mean?

1931
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,400
Like that.
Who was that guy to the senator or

1932
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:19,610
congressman with the fuck or was it just
got busted like,

1933
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:20,444
uh,
having,

1934
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:23,020
he was an anti gay Oh,
Yay.

1935
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,600
And he turns out he was,
he got busted having sex with a dude in

1936
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,840
his office.
Inappropriate behavior and they called

1937
01:18:29,841 --> 01:18:30,191
it.
Yeah.

1938
01:18:30,191 --> 01:18:33,110
And they had is very convenient and it
give them the ex,

1939
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:38,270
he is anti Lgbtq lawmaker resigns over
gay sex scandal.

1940
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,890
Republican state,
Ohio state representative.

1941
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:43,840
Lastly.
Oh,

1942
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:45,440
Wesley Wesley.
Good man.

1943
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:48,110
He may have also previously assaulted an
18 year old.

1944
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,720
Uh hmm.
Hey assaulted.

1945
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:53,300
Is it like Kevin Spacey type of salt?
Like Dick grabbing,

1946
01:18:53,301 --> 01:18:55,980
no to word assaulted some weird Straw
man.

1947
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:57,380
Words are violent.
Oh No.

1948
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:00,910
Your words are violence in touch.
You No,

1949
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:01,550
no,
no.

1950
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,660
Your words are violence.
Okay.

1951
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,990
That's what comedy's had it.
Yeah.

1952
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,240
I feel uncomfortable.
I know there's certain,

1953
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:14,900
there's certain taboos now that he just
breaching them on stage.

1954
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,850
You see people say,
well,

1955
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:17,511
you know,
yeah,

1956
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:20,450
I wish they did that.
Like with comedy tickets,

1957
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:22,600
like I understand when you buy a
baseball ticket,

1958
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,800
the back is like an agreement that if
you get hit with the ball,

1959
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,270
you ain't going to lie.
Is that when it is you,

1960
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,350
you agree that if,
if some debris hit you,

1961
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:34,170
hey man,
it's a part of the experience and uh,

1962
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:37,070
they needed a little comedy.
Clubs like feelings get hurt,

1963
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:39,470
like you've already agreed to
experience.

1964
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,580
Yup.
You know,

1965
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,440
a performance,
you know what it's going to affect it.

1966
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,930
I don't know how it's going to land when
you,

1967
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:48,590
but when I think it was really a report
on it or you got a band,

1968
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:52,430
people that interrupt like,
especially like bad hecklers and

1969
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:56,660
interrupt hecklers sometimes man can,
like,

1970
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:58,820
you're,
you're setting up like for a special,

1971
01:19:58,821 --> 01:19:59,630
you getting ready.

1972
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:03,140
They can fuck up the flow of a boat for
weeks all ways.

1973
01:20:03,141 --> 01:20:04,010
And they,
it seemed like,

1974
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:07,530
it seems like they always come out when
you're setting up for something of card.

1975
01:20:07,531 --> 01:20:09,350
Right.
And then you just,

1976
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,870
you just rocking.
Yeah.

1977
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,630
Perfect.
I gotta,

1978
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:14,130
I gotta,
I gotta lay down.

1979
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:20,020
He had a comb in the moral arbiters of
what you're allowed to say and not say.

1980
01:20:20,561 --> 01:20:22,080
It's like,
you don't even understand where this is

1981
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:24,120
going.
Like you're not even allowing this bit

1982
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:25,980
to take its full.
I get to the end,

1983
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:29,130
it'll be vindicated.
Just let it play out and play out.

1984
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:31,950
Trust me in the end,
I'm the piece of shit.

1985
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:33,270
Just trust me.
Trust me.

1986
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,770
Everyone wins.
Yeah.

1987
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,140
But that's a weird thing about live
performance.

1988
01:20:37,141 --> 01:20:38,590
That's what makes it so exciting.
Yes.

1989
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:42,900
You are there to catch debris.
Occasionally it will be a tire will fall

1990
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:45,720
off one of them nascar things and
launching a crowd.

1991
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,553
Right,
right.

1992
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:47,980
Yeah,
but it's,

1993
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:49,620
it's uh,
I don't know,

1994
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:50,760
man.
You got to keep swinging that bat

1995
01:20:50,761 --> 01:20:52,620
though.
You've got to keep pushing it.

1996
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,230
Yeah.
Well then also the real terrifying thing

1997
01:20:55,231 --> 01:20:59,790
for me is the throwing away the material
and then redoing your whole act every

1998
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:01,290
two years.
Oh yeah.

1999
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,400
That's the real terrifying thing.
It's really about,

2000
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,710
for me,
it's about a year and a half,

2001
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,680
it seems like lately that's my schedule.
And at a year and a half.

2002
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,940
It's like,
yeah,

2003
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,480
like right now I'm super nervous cause
I'm like a couple months out and then

2004
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:16,710
once I film I'm fucked up.
I just figured out how to make these

2005
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:18,490
bits all work good.
I know.

2006
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,950
And it's exciting,
right?

2007
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:22,680
It's like I could grab this for five
years now,

2008
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:25,320
but I think it's healthier though.
Oh it's way healthier.

2009
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:27,720
But it is like,
but what you're talking about too is

2010
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:28,820
something that I've gone through.

2011
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,950
It's like the older you get,
the less you,

2012
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:35,610
the less you have.
Your faith isn't as strong.

2013
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:37,320
Like when you're younger you gotta I
know him to come with one boy.

2014
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:38,700
Shit,
something's gonna Happen to me.

2015
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:41,460
I'm thinking my faith is better now than
it was before.

2016
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,760
I work harder at it now.
Yeah.

2017
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,620
It's like to me it's the,
it's directly proportional.

2018
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:49,620
Like how much time I'm actually spend
writing and working on new shit and

2019
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:53,160
trying out new shit versus like whether
or not a thing I could do it again.

2020
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,410
You know like if,
if,

2021
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,880
as long as you're paying attention,
there's always subject.

2022
01:21:56,881 --> 01:21:59,820
I feel like subjects too are essentially
like scaffolding.

2023
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,890
Yes.
And once you have the scaffolding,

2024
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,550
then you've got to fill it up with jokes
and build us the phone part two and

2025
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:07,080
then,
yeah,

2026
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,780
I like,
I love the work man and it's so like I'm

2027
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:13,800
at a place why I love it even more now
than when I first started.

2028
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,770
You know what I mean?
Like it was just a blind love for it,

2029
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:20,580
just how it made me feel.
But now I've really light getting in

2030
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:25,581
there and trying to like take it places
and it's so exciting to me,

2031
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:27,930
man.
It's like I'm so,

2032
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:30,030
I feel so present and awake,
you know what I mean?

2033
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:33,750
Like when I'm on stage and I just,
I'm excited about it.

2034
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:35,400
But it is true though.
Like,

2035
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:39,360
um,
if I wished that this was all I could

2036
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:40,530
focus on,
you know what I mean?

2037
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,730
Right.
Visiting my family,

2038
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:44,790
that's all I want to do is stand up and
family.

2039
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:48,180
It's one of the reasons why it is so
exciting is because it's just slightly

2040
01:22:48,181 --> 01:22:50,790
out of your reach.
It's obviously within your reach.

2041
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:51,890
Talent wise.
Yeah.

2042
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:54,180
Just like you still have this writing
job,

2043
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:55,240
there's still good.
Yeah.

2044
01:22:55,950 --> 01:23:00,270
Yeah.
It's the reason why I never intended it

2045
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:03,270
to be a TV writer.
Um,

2046
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,980
I didn't even know that was a job,
you know,

2047
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,250
I mean like I

2048
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,720
went one day on the set,
uh,

2049
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:14,760
a friend of mine,
he was a comic and then became show

2050
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:18,930
runner of everybody hates Chris.
And he uh,

2051
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,860
called me out the blue and said,
hey man,

2052
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:23,610
you want to come read lines with Chris?
And I was like,

2053
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,740
yeah.
So I went on set in,

2054
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:29,920
the job was to be his voice because it
was a voiceover show.

2055
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:34,360
Everybody's going.
So I was his voice for the actors for

2056
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:35,980
the pacing.
So I'd be off on the side.

2057
01:23:35,981 --> 01:23:39,760
My mother always said like I was just be
reading it and uh,

2058
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,260
then I was like,
oh this is cool.

2059
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,401
This is,
I was like,

2060
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:44,920
this is like the best acting class cause
I'm seeing,

2061
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:48,140
cause at the time I was also like acting
classes and doing all of that.

2062
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:51,130
Oh Shit.
I'm seeing what it's like on set,

2063
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:53,350
how to act,
because I will watch costars come in and

2064
01:23:53,351 --> 01:23:55,270
just rumble because it's not acting.

2065
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:58,120
It's not a save acne class.
Like when you're acting on set,

2066
01:23:58,121 --> 01:23:59,440
there's a,
it was a boom.

2067
01:23:59,441 --> 01:24:00,430
Got It.
Don't give a fuck.

2068
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,070
I roll it up.
Cable.

2069
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,110
This guy,
he was saying,

2070
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,540
yeah,
you have to like,

2071
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,450
you know how to find it in these raw
environments.

2072
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:11,770
So I used to watch that and,
but because I'm a comedian first,

2073
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,570
when they would run lines,
I would hear stuff that could be funny

2074
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:18,430
and I would just write it on my script,
but I wouldn't say anything.

2075
01:24:18,431 --> 01:24:20,920
I knew better than trying to say
something.

2076
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:24,780
And then one day show runner,
his name's Ali,

2077
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:25,540
he goes,
uh,

2078
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,400
amen,
the CNA work and you got anything?

2079
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:28,330
And I was like,
do I?

2080
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,193
Yeah.
Uh,

2081
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,580
you should say this.
It was just,

2082
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,670
I just wanted to make it better.
And then,

2083
01:24:33,671 --> 01:24:36,730
uh,
he laughed and then he threw the London

2084
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,850
and she laughed and then they did it and
the whole crew laugh and then they

2085
01:24:39,851 --> 01:24:42,010
recorded it and I was like,
oh,

2086
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:42,400
that's cool.

2087
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,570
What?
I didn't even think like,

2088
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,770
oh that was great.
I was just like,

2089
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:46,220
yeah,
that's what it should have been in like,

2090
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:47,590
right.
And then,

2091
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,230
um,
Chris rock came up and he was like,

2092
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:52,390
fuck that.
You say this and change it.

2093
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,160
And they laugh.
Then I was like,

2094
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:56,740
I got another one.
And that was the first time I'd ever

2095
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,880
seen Chris like in person this day.
I go,

2096
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:00,970
I got another one,
I give it to them,

2097
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:05,080
they throw it in and they laugh louder
cause it was like you say this gave him,

2098
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,240
they laugh and not as loud.
Didn't know.

2099
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:09,880
I probably should have shut up.
I had another one cause I was like,

2100
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,710
if I,
if Chris or like me,

2101
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:12,521
this would be great,
you know,

2102
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:13,710
that kind of shit.
Right.

2103
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:14,461
I was like,
this one,

2104
01:25:14,461 --> 01:25:16,120
they laugh,
they do it,

2105
01:25:16,121 --> 01:25:17,290
they laugh loud.
Chris goes,

2106
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:18,124
I got nothing.

2107
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,480
I'm like,
yeah,

2108
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:22,270
you know,
and so then at the end everyone's in

2109
01:25:22,271 --> 01:25:25,270
line shaking Chris's hand.
When I shake his hand,

2110
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:26,400
he puts his,
uh,

2111
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,030
like does the elbow thing.
He goes,

2112
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:29,530
what's up Nigga?
I'm like,

2113
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,220
Chris Rock called me nigger.
He like,

2114
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:37,710
I was so happy I playing and did like a
college gig or whatever and came back

2115
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,080
again.
And so then that,

2116
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:43,900
that grew into me doing what they call a
punch of writing.

2117
01:25:43,901 --> 01:25:45,380
But I didn't need,
I didn't know it.

2118
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:46,450
I didn't know.
I just,

2119
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:51,190
I enjoyed helping them make the show
funnier because that's like my,

2120
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:54,520
like if I hear something,
oh that's dope.

2121
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,490
Go for,
you know,

2122
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,760
that's kind of always been my nature.
And I had this older,

2123
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:59,600
one time,
this older black dude was at the store

2124
01:25:59,601 --> 01:26:02,590
and he said,
stop helping other people get better.

2125
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,670
Keep that shit for yourself and Hossein.

2126
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,020
Alright,
who said that?

2127
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:07,160
I can't remember,
but he just,

2128
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:10,170
it's like he came out the shadows and
just said it to me because what counts?

2129
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:11,300
We get off stage.
I'd be like,

2130
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,320
Oh man,
you should do this and that.

2131
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:13,750
And then I would go do my work.
I like,

2132
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:14,900
I'm the,
I'm not doing that.

2133
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:15,281
So,
um,

2134
01:26:15,281 --> 01:26:17,180
but whatever you're doing,
I go,

2135
01:26:17,181 --> 01:26:18,020
I could hear it.
I go,

2136
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:19,210
Oh man,
maybe go here.

2137
01:26:19,211 --> 01:26:22,490
That'd be dope.
Some people will listen in and some

2138
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:24,470
people have amazing careers.
And some people were like,

2139
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,540
all right.
And then I started figuring out,

2140
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,190
oh,
they don't want me to say nothing.

2141
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:30,410
I ain't gonna say nothing.
And then I did eventually just stop

2142
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:32,920
saying stuff like that.
She's just kinda just to kind folds

2143
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,670
away.
But I used to be,

2144
01:26:34,671 --> 01:26:35,150
I was like,
uh,

2145
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:38,780
I used to just love hearing what people
were trying to do and then go,

2146
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:39,920
hey man,
I wasn't,

2147
01:26:39,921 --> 01:26:42,020
someone on the outside can see it better
than you can.

2148
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,760
And I wasn't annoying.
Like I wasn't like,

2149
01:26:43,761 --> 01:26:44,481
but I haven't like,
aw man,

2150
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:45,440
that thing,
maybe this.

2151
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:49,520
And if they laughed it was cool and I
literally didn't think about it again.

2152
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:52,690
Like I wouldn't even remember then.
Uh,

2153
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,660
so that evolved into me.
Like they used to let me rewrite scenes

2154
01:26:56,661 --> 01:26:59,150
on set because I was just,
the way this particular show runner

2155
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:02,270
work,
his whole philosophy was funniest wins.

2156
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,520
And you know,
if you got it,

2157
01:27:04,521 --> 01:27:05,630
you got it.
And then,

2158
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,750
uh,
so he would bring stuff in from the

2159
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:10,520
writer's room,
which I was rarely in,

2160
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:14,870
cause I wasn't a writer at that time.
And then when they would put it on its

2161
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:17,300
feet,
we could hear how certain people

2162
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:19,850
couldn't say they was,
they would sound funny,

2163
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:22,550
you're saying a different word or maybe
it should just take a different turn.

2164
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:24,500
And we were kind of on the same,
so he would let me rewrite.

2165
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:29,360
And uh,
that grew into,

2166
01:27:29,361 --> 01:27:33,740
then I found out about writing and like
there's a writer's guild and you know

2167
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:35,030
all this stuff.
And I was like,

2168
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,380
yeah,
I'll do it.

2169
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,120
I like to see what it's about.
Why not?

2170
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:42,080
But I didn't get a writer's job until
years later,

2171
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,200
but I had,
I had went through a bad breakup here

2172
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:46,880
and I wanted to go to New York.
You know what,

2173
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:48,650
I'm breaking it to me.
You want to change zip code.

2174
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:52,190
So I tried to,
I was so naive.

2175
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:53,300
I go,
I'm gonna write on Conan.

2176
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:55,610
So I started like sending,
because this is when he was in New York.

2177
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,760
I didn't hear anything.
I ended up having to be here for like

2178
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,630
another two years.
And then after I gave up that dream of

2179
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:05,300
wanting to just get a writing job in New
York so I could live in New York,

2180
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:07,970
I ended up getting a writing job in
Stanford,

2181
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:08,804
Connecticut.

2182
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,870
And I took it.
It was my first writer's guild job,

2183
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:15,800
but I moved to Harlem.
And so I will work on set all day and

2184
01:28:15,801 --> 01:28:19,040
then race down to the cellar and perform
at the cellar.

2185
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:23,300
So wow.
I was living a life that I always wanted

2186
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:26,420
to do at 20,
but I was afraid to move to New York,

2187
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:29,330
uh,
at 20 cause I didn't think I could

2188
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:31,610
afford it for some reason.
I'm,

2189
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:33,830
so I lived in Chicago and then I moved
to La.

2190
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,440
For some reason I felt like I could do
those towns.

2191
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,190
But um,
so I was living in Harlem when I was a

2192
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:42,860
comedian and I would write there in the
day.

2193
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:45,530
It didn't,
I didn't even like think of it as a

2194
01:28:45,531 --> 01:28:47,690
thing.
And then that grew into,

2195
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:48,431
oh,
I'm,

2196
01:28:48,431 --> 01:28:51,260
I'm pretty good at this.
I know what this should look like.

2197
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:52,400
I don't know how to tell a story.

2198
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,390
I know,
you know what I mean?

2199
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:54,860
And then she start coming around the
store.

2200
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,200
I came around the store on everybody and
it's crisp.

2201
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:03,210
I came out the first in the 90s.
Wow.

2202
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:08,040
Spring break.
1990 for me,

2203
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,570
uh,
sunny,

2204
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:10,920
uh,
I can't think of her last name,

2205
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:13,530
but she's the one with the view now.
Uh,

2206
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,580
the,
the um,

2207
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,040
she's one of the ladies on the view.
Sorry.

2208
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:18,670
Uh,
we were all in,

2209
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:21,240
we all went to Notre Dame.
She went to Notre Dame law school.

2210
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:22,350
Um,
me,

2211
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,780
my boy floyd,
he pretended to be my manager.

2212
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,600
We were all in this,
we all did display raisin in the sun.

2213
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:31,260
And then for spring break we all came
out together and I went to all the

2214
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:34,650
comedy clubs because I was doing comedy
at Notre Dame and he pretended to be my

2215
01:29:34,651 --> 01:29:38,730
manager and I got up on like some,
some black rooms I got to do stand up

2216
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:42,840
there and we went to all the comedy
clubs and everybody was nice too.

2217
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,010
It's like I'm a comedian,
visited from the Midwest.

2218
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,170
Can I just check out the room?
Yeah,

2219
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:47,730
come on in.
I went to the laugh factory.

2220
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,020
Oh,
this is shiny as fuck.

2221
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:49,830
Okay.
This is cool.

2222
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:50,663
Nice,
Nice.

2223
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:52,560
Went to the Improv.
They let me in.

2224
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,453
Okay,
cool.

2225
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:58,790
Come to the comedy store.
A dude named Chewie is stamina and I go,

2226
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:00,900
hey man.
And some people,

2227
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:04,560
he was so intimidating.
He made me lose the bass in my voice.

2228
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:05,101
I was like,
hey man,

2229
01:30:05,101 --> 01:30:06,510
I want to just go in.
And he was like,

2230
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,850
do you know how many motherfuckers say
they a comedian?

2231
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:13,260
And like he chewed me out and it scared
me from the store and I was,

2232
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:14,760
I was like,
Yo,

2233
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:18,110
like everybody else was showing such
that I was not expecting it and I was

2234
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,710
just like,
who is this dude?

2235
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:20,780
I don't want to get nick out.

2236
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:23,310
Damn.
So I stayed away from the store.

2237
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,730
She scared me off.
Scared me off.

2238
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:28,860
Like so much science guy once you get to
know him.

2239
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:31,820
Yeah,
but so much so like almost I before I

2240
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:33,690
put like a vendetta and my head against
this deal,

2241
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:35,910
but like it's hilarious.
The student traffic,

2242
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,820
you know,
how strong you are,

2243
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:39,210
close you out on the street.
Like I was really like angry

2244
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:43,710
and I just walked away and I was like,
fuck this guy,

2245
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:45,750
fuck this place.
And then,

2246
01:30:45,751 --> 01:30:47,430
um,
I uh,

2247
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:49,770
didn't move out until 2000.
Right.

2248
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:53,160
And uh,
I was doing a lot of commercials in

2249
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:54,120
Chicago.
Right.

2250
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:59,610
And I booked 10 national commercials for
blockbuster music or something.

2251
01:30:59,611 --> 01:31:03,680
It was me and this dude named jt Jaggedy
Ilc,

2252
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:06,990
I think his name is,
he is one of the sonics guys though.

2253
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:09,600
Sonics bits of sonics commercials.
Okay.

2254
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,210
He's one of those guys and we did 10 of
them.

2255
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,060
I was getting paid twice because they
were using my hands too.

2256
01:31:15,061 --> 01:31:19,440
It was like a video game spot.
So my was a hand model getting paid and

2257
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:22,800
then my face was imposed on one of my
thumbs in his was on other than what he

2258
01:31:22,801 --> 01:31:25,320
did.
And so I thought I was going to make a

2259
01:31:25,321 --> 01:31:26,190
lot of,
uh,

2260
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:29,160
and they were supposed to air during the
superbowl 2000 super vote.

2261
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:34,760
And then I booked and then I did radio
to promote a show and they offered me

2262
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,250
the guide.
The program director liked my voice and

2263
01:31:38,251 --> 01:31:39,840
on me a radio gig.
He was like,

2264
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:41,700
Yo,
you want to do the morning radio here?

2265
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:45,420
And I t I did a test run for like a
couple of weeks and it did really well.

2266
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:49,540
Not a no way.
I get a call from Don Buchwald uh,

2267
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:51,310
how it's,
don't know if he's still Howard

2268
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,690
surrounds agent when he was like,
oh in Don Buchwald we know,

2269
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:57,300
let me negotiate your deal.

2270
01:31:58,010 --> 01:31:59,740
I was like,
I was like,

2271
01:31:59,741 --> 01:32:01,540
all right.
And so we figured you were going to be a

2272
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:05,290
big time morning Dj,
Dj guy and I did not want to be a local

2273
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:08,200
celebrity at all.
Like I had known I want to go to bed at

2274
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:10,850
eight o'clock gig too.
I know and wake up at four in the

2275
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:13,060
instance what I did,
I did that for two weeks and my body

2276
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:15,880
felt paralyzed but my numbers were
really good apparently.

2277
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:19,810
Cause you had to meet with this dude
named Gebo something and he was like,

2278
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:23,310
oh and your numbers are great.
Just don't say this word so much that I

2279
01:32:23,311 --> 01:32:24,020
was like,
Ugh,

2280
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,130
I was,
I was already like,

2281
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:28,160
ugh.
So then this guy calls me and I go,

2282
01:32:28,161 --> 01:32:31,630
all right man.
I said I want 250,000 and he was like

2283
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,350
Ha,
and this is right when I think clear

2284
01:32:33,351 --> 01:32:35,030
channel,
somebody was buying up all the radio

2285
01:32:35,031 --> 01:32:35,450
stations.

2286
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:39,800
So base salary was maybe 60 something
like that.

2287
01:32:39,801 --> 01:32:40,634
And I was like,
I ain't going.

2288
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:42,590
So I just said,
I was like,

2289
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,370
cause I had these commercials coming.
So I go on with 250,000 he was like,

2290
01:32:46,371 --> 01:32:47,660
all right,
let me see what I could do.

2291
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:52,100
So I was supposed to come out here for y
two K I suppose to come out here before

2292
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:53,480
the ball dropped,
you know,

2293
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:57,230
1999 right.
But I had to stay an extra like six

2294
01:32:57,231 --> 01:32:59,720
weeks,
maybe four weeks while they negotiate.

2295
01:32:59,721 --> 01:33:02,150
So every,
like every Friday dan would call me

2296
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:05,060
owning.
We got it up to one 20 nope.

2297
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,160
Arrogant,
26 year old eight.

2298
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:12,220
I love it all.
When we got it up to one 80,

2299
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:16,090
nope,
I've never met this man.

2300
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,370
I do.
My wasn't know him if he passed me in

2301
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:19,410
the street.
Wow.

2302
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,500
When we got it up to two 20 with your
remote,

2303
01:33:22,501 --> 01:33:25,420
your make your to 50,
where you just take the Gig?

2304
01:33:25,421 --> 01:33:27,910
No one,
no one has ever gotten this before.

2305
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:33,840
Nope.
I got my

2306
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:38,650
flip phone at the time.
And you have a razor phone?

2307
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:40,090
Yeah,
some dumb flip.

2308
01:33:40,091 --> 01:33:43,210
Some stupid ended.
I hung it up and uh,

2309
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:43,961
he was like,
all right,

2310
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:44,980
I think and maybe,
but he was like,

2311
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:46,120
alright,
you're good luck,

2312
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:47,500
you know,
hung up like that.

2313
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,260
And anyway,
I wasn't like a

2314
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:56,350
radio GIG plus remote.
You would have made a quarter million

2315
01:33:56,350 --> 01:34:00,000
dollars in 1990,
1999 smell way.

2316
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:01,930
And it was a,
it was already knew yet cause I drove

2317
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:06,931
out here and my 1991 gray Honda accord,
uh,

2318
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:11,670
drove through the southern route from
Chicago and stopped at Grand Canyon.

2319
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:12,221
Yeah.
Yeah.

2320
01:34:12,221 --> 01:34:13,510
Or Denise,
I'm going to be famous,

2321
01:34:13,511 --> 01:34:15,280
famous.
I'm gonna make it all that shit

2322
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,770
out before then.
And the copyright.

2323
01:34:20,771 --> 01:34:22,020
Yeah,
it's from,

2324
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,700
because there was a Viacom's spot from
the 10 national commercials that I did

2325
01:34:26,701 --> 01:34:28,560
called me and said,
hey man,

2326
01:34:28,561 --> 01:34:31,580
we got some bad news.
There was an in house legal dispute and

2327
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:34,290
fire kind of between your spots and the
spots called thumb wars.

2328
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:37,830
And so we're not,
there's ED already so we're not going to

2329
01:34:37,831 --> 01:34:39,490
be airing your spots,
but um,

2330
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,780
we already,
we already edited a fuse,

2331
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:44,410
we'll send them to you.
Oh.

2332
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,800
So I had like,
I just had the session fee.

2333
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,630
So the commercial money I was banking on
and nothing be,

2334
01:34:51,631 --> 01:34:54,390
so I went from thinking I was going to
at least have,

2335
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,040
you know,
super bowls,

2336
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:57,740
10 national spots,
right.

2337
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:00,380
And doing a superbowl ad.
That time when commercials actually

2338
01:35:00,381 --> 01:35:04,820
paid,
I was counting pre counting money and

2339
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:06,680
uh,
I thought I was going to lead to make a

2340
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,610
quarter of a million that year at least.

2341
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,540
And then,
uh,

2342
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,750
nothing.
And so then I ended up sleeping on my

2343
01:35:11,751 --> 01:35:14,330
boys air mattress,
a preacher moss.

2344
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,640
Shout out to preach.
Did you ever think about calling them

2345
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:18,080
back with the Radio Gig?
No.

2346
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:19,280
No.
Wow.

2347
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:20,540
I'm no good for you.
Never.

2348
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:21,261
I never,
yeah,

2349
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:22,340
it was like,
I was like,

2350
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,230
I didn't want to be a local,
I was,

2351
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,790
my,
my reasoning was if you're offering me a

2352
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:28,670
radio Gig at 26,
I can get a radio gig at 56.

2353
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:30,260
It's a voice.
You know what I mean?

2354
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:35,090
That was my thinking at the time,
my 26 year old thinking and then,

2355
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:37,190
um,
so no,

2356
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,570
cause I,
I didn't want to go back.

2357
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:43,630
I felt like I had done everything I
could do in Chicago because like,

2358
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:47,150
when shows were coming,
I would get like a coaster on it.

2359
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:49,970
So I was like,
I want dude's that tried to make it out

2360
01:35:49,971 --> 01:35:51,060
of like those local mark.

2361
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,750
Like remember man cow.
Yeah.

2362
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,590
In the morning,
get mad cow in the morning.

2363
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:55,940
He was a Chicago Guy,
wasn't he?

2364
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:56,720
Yeah,
yeah,

2365
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,670
yeah.
And then him and Howard stern of the

2366
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:01,060
crazy beef went after him.
Yeah.

2367
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:02,780
Howard stern lapped him.
Yeah.

2368
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:08,000
He was like a guy who was like a Chicago
guy that was sort of bleeding out into

2369
01:36:08,001 --> 01:36:09,950
other markets and then it all went away.
Yup.

2370
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:10,580
Yup.
Yup.

2371
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:13,790
So when I came out,
I was sleeping on an air mattress,

2372
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:18,820
got some pussy on it strong.
It was consensual and sex on an air

2373
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:21,260
mattress.
And the girl likes you that much.

2374
01:36:21,261 --> 01:36:21,921
Pretty good.
Yeah.

2375
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:24,080
It's like almost like futon sex.
Fantastic.

2376
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:25,460
But yeah,
it was,

2377
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:26,810
I told her I was,
I was funny,

2378
01:36:26,811 --> 01:36:28,570
I was like,
is like a poor man's waterbed and he's

2379
01:36:28,571 --> 01:36:29,430
not crazy,
you know,

2380
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,280
whatever.
But uh,

2381
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:32,750
I was there for 18 months,
man,

2382
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:37,751
and I would drive up and go to acting
class and acting class and crazy fucking

2383
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:39,974
people in acting class.

2384
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,960
Oh my God.
Yeah man.

2385
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:42,890
But it was,
it was great.

2386
01:36:42,891 --> 01:36:44,210
It was a great time,
right.

2387
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:48,140
To just really like learn the art form
and a different level and then just see

2388
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:50,690
who's out here.
But I didn't fuck with the store.

2389
01:36:50,691 --> 01:36:52,270
I was,
I would drive past it and not,

2390
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:55,460
I was doing the Improv,
you know,

2391
01:36:55,550 --> 01:37:00,290
once every two months and like just like
coffee houses and stuff.

2392
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,990
And then,
um,

2393
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,410
it wasn't until I was when everybody
hates Chris and Chris Rock was doing,

2394
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,340
uh,
that special way he performed in South

2395
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:12,200
Africa and he was working on that and he
just said,

2396
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,750
I'm going to the store tonight.
I was like,

2397
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:16,700
Yo,
I want to come see it in.

2398
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,110
I just come.
I was like,

2399
01:37:18,111 --> 01:37:21,200
cool.
So I sat in the Olr and I watched Chris

2400
01:37:21,201 --> 01:37:23,650
go up and at that time I was,
I wasn't in,

2401
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:27,050
I've still not at the laugh factory,
but I did the Improv and I would do the

2402
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:28,910
laugh factory on like chocolate Sundays
or whatever.

2403
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:33,020
But the Improv,
it felt like you had to have your set

2404
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:35,540
already worked out.
Like you couldn't fuck around,

2405
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,080
couldn't fuck around the or and you
couldn't really go outside the box of

2406
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:44,030
what a comedian is.
And so when I was at the store,

2407
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:47,180
I saw a few comments go up before Chris
and I was like,

2408
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:48,860
Oh shit,
you can be an artist here.

2409
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:54,160
Like that was my first instinct.
Like you can do whatever you think is

2410
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:56,640
your thing here.
And then I saw Chris go up and I was

2411
01:37:56,641 --> 01:37:57,630
like,
I have to get in here.

2412
01:37:57,631 --> 01:37:59,400
Like it was,
I was like,

2413
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:01,020
I got whatever I got,
I got to do it.

2414
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,190
I got to get him.
He wasn't around,

2415
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,340
he wasn't around and I saw it.
So then check this out.

2416
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:09,390
Uh,
so then I started coming down on Sunday

2417
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:14,391
and Monday and Tommy was doing it at the
time and I would listen to Tomi talk and

2418
01:38:14,761 --> 01:38:15,060
stuff.

2419
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:20,060
And what blew me away about Tommy was I
never met a person who ran a comedy club

2420
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:25,050
who knew that much about comedians.
And who was that passionate about

2421
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:26,040
comedy?
Like I didn't,

2422
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:27,690
I didn't know him from anything.
I just,

2423
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:32,010
I just never,
all the funny bones that I had to work,

2424
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:37,070
nobody gave a fuck about the lineups and
kind of like his process.

2425
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:39,990
So I didn't mind him talking to me.
I was like,

2426
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:40,980
Oh,
this guy likes to talk.

2427
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:41,731
And I was like,
Oh shit.

2428
01:38:41,731 --> 01:38:43,200
A lot of people probably don't talk to
them.

2429
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,150
And so then when he would talk to me
about comedy,

2430
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:49,320
I was blown away by the hits that he
knew a specific history of it.

2431
01:38:49,321 --> 01:38:51,030
And Yeah,
you didn't get a chance to see him

2432
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:53,250
emerge as a crazy fuck.
He became,

2433
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:54,180
no,
no,

2434
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,440
no.
So then,

2435
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,483
so,
uh,

2436
01:38:56,550 --> 01:38:58,710
he would give me two minutes,
the two minute spots,

2437
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:00,240
you know,
it's two minute spots and I would do too

2438
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:00,750
many things.

2439
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,250
And then he,
he was like,

2440
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,230
ah,
I'm going to give you 10 minutes.

2441
01:39:04,231 --> 01:39:05,320
And then he goes,
uh,

2442
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:09,690
I'm gonna give you a showcase for Mitzi.
And he would call me.

2443
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,340
It's going down now and I would drive,
get all,

2444
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:13,490
it just is not happening.
I'll go back home because the,

2445
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:16,530
he was still sexy with six was Belson
come in.

2446
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:18,710
She was still doing auditions then.
Huh?

2447
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,300
I don't know.
I'm bad with that.

2448
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:25,110
Um,
but the class that I was in with visible

2449
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:26,970
as a Glickman,
Steve Glickman,

2450
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,460
me and Steve for past the same year,
so maybe 2000,

2451
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,480
well,
the Chris rock thing was 2007.

2452
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:38,040
So then after I left,
I left the store 2007.

2453
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:38,540
Yup.
Yup.

2454
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,770
So it was all right,
right on the heels of that,

2455
01:39:40,771 --> 01:39:41,790
right on the heels.
And then,

2456
01:39:41,791 --> 01:39:44,490
uh,
so maybe I got passed in 2008 maybe.

2457
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,593
But,
uh,

2458
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:46,853
do you work?

2459
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:48,620
Do you work like comedy and Magic Club?
Yeah,

2460
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:50,340
that's a great,
I love it man.

2461
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:52,970
I'm going down there this weekend.
Hopefully you really hope for them,

2462
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:56,910
although the national improv's and
stuff.

2463
01:39:56,911 --> 01:39:57,660
No,
no,

2464
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:58,770
no.
I used,

2465
01:39:58,771 --> 01:40:02,340
when I was a road comic,
I used to,

2466
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:06,750
like Dave stroop used to book me in
Columbus and Columbus and he used to pay

2467
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,490
me at four feet.
Trekkies pay me well,

2468
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:13,491
and then he would code feature me Cole.
And then he just stopped bugging me.

2469
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:16,800
I tell you,
I can tell you a story.

2470
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:17,750
I don't care.
Um,

2471
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,670
he,
there was this waitress that work there

2472
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:26,180
and I fucked her
and I fucked her all weekend,

2473
01:40:28,051 --> 01:40:30,180
but I didn't approach it like she came
on to me.

2474
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:33,060
Right.
And if the waitress,

2475
01:40:33,061 --> 01:40:34,830
I don't know,
but I'm going to say when they've paid

2476
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:36,300
me,
he goes out of the blue,

2477
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:37,740
he goes,
did you fuck so and so?

2478
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,000
And I W I was like,
Nah.

2479
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,490
And uh,
and then he was like,

2480
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:43,170
okay.
And then,

2481
01:40:43,171 --> 01:40:45,180
um,
he's never booked me since that,

2482
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:48,030
but I didn't want her to know if I
would've gotten in trouble.

2483
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:50,510
What kind of a weird question is Adam
and I,

2484
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:51,450
and again,
dude,

2485
01:40:51,451 --> 01:40:55,570
this comes from like,
maybe not growing up with a dad.

2486
01:40:55,571 --> 01:40:57,040
I would have known how to handle that
better.

2487
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:58,210
But like if,
if my,

2488
01:40:58,211 --> 01:41:00,970
if my dad,
if I have some knowledge from that,

2489
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:01,990
but I,
I just was like,

2490
01:41:01,991 --> 01:41:04,400
I'm not going to get her for,
I'm leaving like I,

2491
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:05,610
so I'm not going to be like,
yeah,

2492
01:41:05,611 --> 01:41:06,850
fuck.
Like I was like,

2493
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:09,550
Nah,
I didn't know his fucking business.

2494
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:13,510
I didn't know what to do with case.
If he's the boss,

2495
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:15,510
he's the boss.
Are you a private contractor?

2496
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:19,630
You kind of a private contract.
Do you come in and it's not like you're

2497
01:41:19,631 --> 01:41:23,140
getting health and dental from him now,
but the whole thing was really your

2498
01:41:23,141 --> 01:41:23,560
boss.

2499
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,170
But it's his club.
Yeah.

2500
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,570
I used to work.
I don't know.

2501
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:29,440
I mean,
I was never told you couldn't write.

2502
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:31,210
You know what I mean?
But it's always been the case.

2503
01:41:31,211 --> 01:41:33,040
Guys have always done it.
Only one club,

2504
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:34,510
they said,
don't do it.

2505
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,850
We're in La.
It was a milwaukee,

2506
01:41:36,851 --> 01:41:39,010
the comedy cafe.
I used to do that room.

2507
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:43,190
I get how they would see it was gross
comedians hitting on the waitresses all

2508
01:41:43,191 --> 01:41:44,850
the time.
But I wouldn't never had a job.

2509
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:46,480
I would always do my,
you know,

2510
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:49,150
my energy man,
I would perform and I would sit down if

2511
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:50,920
they came over until I would talk,
you know what I mean?

2512
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:53,650
But I was never like,
I'm not growing.

2513
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:56,620
I'm not opposed to face him on deals
came onto me and it was,

2514
01:41:56,670 --> 01:41:57,970
it was,
it was rent.

2515
01:41:57,971 --> 01:42:02,971
Like I wrote a show about this,
like me and this other dude.

2516
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:07,810
We know like you,
you like we,

2517
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:11,050
if you're throwing the pussy at us,
we won't pick it up.

2518
01:42:11,051 --> 01:42:13,060
Like you have to literally be like,
will you?

2519
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:13,661
Oh,
okay.

2520
01:42:13,661 --> 01:42:14,091
Yeah,
yeah.

2521
01:42:14,091 --> 01:42:14,900
You know what I mean?
Like,

2522
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:15,780
yeah,
I'm,

2523
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:18,520
when I'm there to do comedy,
I'm not conflict.

2524
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:21,070
This is where I eat.
You know what I mean?

2525
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:22,660
So I'm not thinking of work.
I mean,

2526
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:24,430
I might see I'm,
I'm definitely gonna see you got damn,

2527
01:42:24,431 --> 01:42:25,670
you look good,
but I'm not going to,

2528
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,600
I'm not going to change up.
You know what I mean?

2529
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:30,280
So she had,
I forget,

2530
01:42:30,281 --> 01:42:32,500
I don't even know how it happened.
It was like,

2531
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,640
um,
I think she asked me if he wanted to get

2532
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:38,500
something,
eat to eat afterwards and we got

2533
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:41,260
something to eat and we were just
talking and I was like,

2534
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,250
Oh shit,
she's flirting.

2535
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:42,970
Oh,
that's cool.

2536
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:45,580
But we were away from the club,
what's up?

2537
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:48,400
And then she made,
I need to come back to the condo.

2538
01:42:48,401 --> 01:42:50,410
It was like a weird,
I was so goofy.

2539
01:42:50,411 --> 01:42:50,981
Like,
all right.

2540
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:51,940
And then,
Oh shit,

2541
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:52,774
we fucking,
and then,

2542
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,540
but it was literally,
no,

2543
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:59,140
I was no game want me that she just
picked me.

2544
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:02,620
I wasn't a lot of that weekend.
Like whoever she was mad at before,

2545
01:43:02,621 --> 01:43:04,150
she was like,
this dude,

2546
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,770
I want that.
And that's really how that went down is

2547
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:12,430
it wasn't a me thinking about it.
You know what I mean?

2548
01:43:12,431 --> 01:43:14,140
Like that's a funny thing because the
digger,

2549
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:16,440
you're kind of working together.
Yeah.

2550
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,630
When people in bars,
they always wind up hooking up.

2551
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:22,060
Like that's like the constant thing in
bars,

2552
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:24,850
bartenders and the waitresses.
Pj always doing that.

2553
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,130
I really man,
like,

2554
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:32,230
I mean,
I would say in my twenties I was more

2555
01:43:32,231 --> 01:43:34,030
like conscious,
you know,

2556
01:43:34,031 --> 01:43:36,910
I knew how to like,
I could change my act to get an audience

2557
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:37,600
member or whatever.

2558
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,171
Like,
all right,

2559
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:39,830
she's cute.
Let me talk about this topic.

2560
01:43:39,831 --> 01:43:41,080
She'll come up.
That was so crazy,

2561
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:42,130
you know?
And then I would know how to

2562
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:46,180
do all that stuff or go to the mall and
invite somebody,

2563
01:43:46,181 --> 01:43:47,570
you know that.
Right.

2564
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:53,540
But then as I got older,
I think I wasn't concentrating your

2565
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:54,500
comedy.
Yeah.

2566
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:55,450
I was like,
at this date,

2567
01:43:55,451 --> 01:43:58,130
Sam was so valuable to me and I was just
like,

2568
01:43:58,131 --> 01:44:00,740
really?
I just wanted to just,

2569
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,620
and then I was trying to figure it out
because it was at that time,

2570
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:07,550
like later on it was about DVD sales.
Like we hear Comedians,

2571
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:08,990
I sell out every time.
I'm like,

2572
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:11,960
I sell two dvds at.
So then I started going,

2573
01:44:11,961 --> 01:44:13,550
what am I not doing?
So then I,

2574
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:16,910
I would fix that and then it would be
like lines waiting for my DVD.

2575
01:44:16,911 --> 01:44:18,740
But I'm a horrible salesman.

2576
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,260
So one person want to get in the
conversation for a long time.

2577
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:24,860
I don't want to be nice.
And then you just fucked up my line.

2578
01:44:24,861 --> 01:44:26,300
Like you talk too long,
you know?

2579
01:44:26,301 --> 01:44:28,550
So I had to learn how to like,
keep it moving,

2580
01:44:28,551 --> 01:44:29,660
you know what I mean?
And then I,

2581
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:32,370
then I didn't really like talking to the
audience that much afterwards,

2582
01:44:32,371 --> 01:44:35,510
something if I'm doing like racial stuff
because it would always come back.

2583
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,150
Ah,
I used to do this joke about how,

2584
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:41,290
um,
uh,

2585
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:42,730
um,
Busta rhymes,

2586
01:44:42,731 --> 01:44:44,320
I went to a buster,
Ron's concert and he,

2587
01:44:44,321 --> 01:44:46,930
he uh,
and it was all white and he had an real

2588
01:44:46,931 --> 01:44:49,450
niggas make some noise and everybody was
like,

2589
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:50,920
ah,
so the punchline,

2590
01:44:50,921 --> 01:44:53,450
it's like white people are niggas now.
And I was like,

2591
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:56,050
ah,
oh did I say and not only can we call

2592
01:44:56,051 --> 01:44:59,600
him Nigga,
they are paying $85 for the privilege to

2593
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:00,470
be called native.

2594
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:01,303
Right.
And uh,

2595
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,140
so then my job would be like white
people.

2596
01:45:03,141 --> 01:45:08,141
I call you Nigga for $10,000 Nigga cell
Nigga clearance cash only.

2597
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:11,360
Cause I know how you niggas and all like
that was like a joke I would do on the

2598
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:15,380
road.
And then I would be out selling my DVD

2599
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,720
and always,
you know,

2600
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:20,770
a drug white person will come up and
give me $20 ago,

2601
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,400
Nigga,
oh call you nick.

2602
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:26,770
And I'm like,
ah,

2603
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:28,060
fuck.
That's a problem.

2604
01:45:28,061 --> 01:45:30,070
When you get forbid and words for the
bitten words,

2605
01:45:30,071 --> 01:45:32,590
man,
don't wait to blurt them out.

2606
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:34,180
Can't wait.
So we used to,

2607
01:45:34,181 --> 01:45:36,190
we used to joke like,
what if that was my thing.

2608
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:39,310
Like what if,
what if I didn't sell product?

2609
01:45:39,311 --> 01:45:41,290
And I was like,
y'all could just call me Nigga at the

2610
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:46,291
back for $20 and like just shake up the
whole t shirt DVD selling thing.

2611
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:49,060
Like who is this guy letting white
people calling me,

2612
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,560
you know,
it just,

2613
01:45:50,561 --> 01:45:52,440
it would it be,
got it got so,

2614
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,160
you know,
it's that growth process.

2615
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:56,210
Every comedian,
every,

2616
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:58,160
every,
I think minority comedian wants to

2617
01:45:58,161 --> 01:46:02,870
figure out race like in their twenties
and early thirties they want to fix it

2618
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:05,420
or have some clever angle to no one's
done before.

2619
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,970
But the reaction to that is you do,
you do.

2620
01:46:07,971 --> 01:46:11,930
And I'll give you work in Kentucky at
the late show Friday and you're here,

2621
01:46:11,931 --> 01:46:14,330
you come talking about,
you know,

2622
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:17,150
a black man invented the golf tee
because he was tired of holding the

2623
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:17,941
ball.
Like they're like,

2624
01:46:17,941 --> 01:46:18,950
what?
You know what I mean?

2625
01:46:18,951 --> 01:46:22,970
It's like a different,
you got to figuring it out,

2626
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:25,250
you know?
And so now it's funny when I hear like

2627
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:27,080
younger comics,
you know,

2628
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:31,010
attack and race and in that familiar
place it's like,

2629
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:32,870
yeah,
that's cool.

2630
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:34,120
But uh,
what's like,

2631
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:35,840
what's,
what's beyond that,

2632
01:46:35,841 --> 01:46:38,160
you know what I mean?
But it's also like you're dealing with

2633
01:46:38,161 --> 01:46:40,740
talking to the audience and the problem
with talking to the audiences,

2634
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:44,820
you might run into seven people that are
really cool and great to talk to you

2635
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:45,121
like,
man,

2636
01:46:45,121 --> 01:46:48,570
I'm glad I met you.
And then you run into two drunk morons

2637
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:49,980
that your entire night

2638
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,110
and then you're like,
I can't even believe I have to talk to

2639
01:46:52,111 --> 01:46:52,710
you.
Yeah.

2640
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:54,660
And I'm stuck talking to you and your,
you know,

2641
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:59,250
the problem is you think you can make
fun of why people and why people can't

2642
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:02,940
say the n word to you like you think you
think that's okay.

2643
01:47:02,941 --> 01:47:06,190
You could say it to us.
We count cheese compensation,

2644
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,070
which is draining.
I can't do this.

2645
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,140
Yeah.
It was like when you did,

2646
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:11,080
you can't pick who your meeting after
those shows,

2647
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:13,500
especially if you're trying to sell
something.

2648
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:16,280
So that was like,
I just don't want to have to sell

2649
01:47:16,281 --> 01:47:18,020
something.
I just want to put too much work.

2650
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:18,701
Yeah.
And then,

2651
01:47:18,701 --> 01:47:20,510
uh,
I'll talk to you after this cause I,

2652
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:22,100
I did what you paid for it.
That's right.

2653
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,760
I used to take march with me.
I did it a few times on the road.

2654
01:47:24,761 --> 01:47:26,530
It is grueling.
Grueling.

2655
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,450
I can't do it.
Kim Can't be,

2656
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:30,380
you get on a plane with so much promise.
If I say,

2657
01:47:30,381 --> 01:47:34,270
well at least I know due to its shit.
Their shit ahead.

2658
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:36,130
Do it.
Ship boxes ahead.

2659
01:47:36,131 --> 01:47:38,390
Tape everything down.
Yeah.

2660
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:40,990
And you'd hear about Gabriel,
Gabriel Iglesias,

2661
01:47:40,991 --> 01:47:43,480
he's selling $1 million but a tee shirts
like watch.

2662
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:44,770
I know.
Wow.

2663
01:47:45,490 --> 01:47:47,710
What's he doing?
He's got a warehouse filled with tee

2664
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:48,544
shirts.
Like what?

2665
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:49,870
Yeah,
I'm not fat.

2666
01:47:49,871 --> 01:47:51,970
I'm fluffy,
but he's killing it.

2667
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:54,400
Yeah.
It's an interesting world.

2668
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:57,400
The world of like trying to figure out
what your thing is,

2669
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:59,160
you know?
Yeah.

2670
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:02,110
But for you,
we just got to let people know.

2671
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:03,340
Just come see me.
Yeah.

2672
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:06,070
You just gotta be headlining on the
road.

2673
01:48:06,290 --> 01:48:08,440
I'd go put out special.
Any approach to you?

2674
01:48:08,441 --> 01:48:09,400
It's about,
about a special,

2675
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,900
no,
the two that I've done,

2676
01:48:10,901 --> 01:48:13,810
I've done out of pocket and I got
stories about that.

2677
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:19,300
I did one in 2007 I made a lot of money
doing colleges.

2678
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:21,970
Um,
cause I really,

2679
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:27,030
I was like I can make some money and
quick hits and I figured out what my ask

2680
01:48:28,161 --> 01:48:30,670
was for the college market and I
finally,

2681
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:33,730
my agents would never put me in Naca
nationals.

2682
01:48:33,731 --> 01:48:36,820
They would always do Naca regionals and
Naca is the National Association of

2683
01:48:36,821 --> 01:48:39,400
campus activities where you know,
you,

2684
01:48:39,401 --> 01:48:41,370
you,
you get submitted and is in college,

2685
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:42,100
you know.
Yeah,

2686
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:42,761
I did all that.
Yeah,

2687
01:48:42,761 --> 01:48:43,151
yeah,
yeah.

2688
01:48:43,151 --> 01:48:45,410
So,
but I knew I,

2689
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,090
and I never,
I rarely or never got selected to

2690
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:53,110
regional because my humor works best if
people,

2691
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:56,920
if everybody can see it at that time,
like when I was talking about,

2692
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,740
so if I did something,
someone from the south to be like,

2693
01:48:59,741 --> 01:49:01,390
that's too,
but someone from up north,

2694
01:49:01,391 --> 01:49:01,960
man,
shut up.

2695
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:02,741
That's dope.
You know what I mean?

2696
01:49:02,741 --> 01:49:04,510
So I,
I said nationals would be my spot.

2697
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:06,790
They finally put me in.
I get picked.

2698
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:08,580
I get to do it.
And I had,

2699
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:10,720
and this is right when Kobe got accused
and stuff,

2700
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:14,560
and I had this Cobi joke that I did and
my agents were like,

2701
01:49:14,561 --> 01:49:15,490
keep it clean.
And I was like,

2702
01:49:15,491 --> 01:49:16,630
man,
I'm doing this my way.

2703
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:19,060
I'm listening to you all these years.
And so,

2704
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:23,140
and I and I knew what the kids want it.
Like I knew what the students want it

2705
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,210
once I get,
once you get to that school with the act

2706
01:49:25,211 --> 01:49:27,100
that people think they have to do to get
the job,

2707
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,030
it's your act.
Just do that.

2708
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:32,120
So I did my act,
uh,

2709
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,990
duties,
these coby jokes in the middle and it,

2710
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:38,020
it changed the chemistry of the room,
you know what I mean?

2711
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:39,880
Because everyone was coming out,
you know,

2712
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:44,230
doing the safe stuff.
And then the colby joke that I told was

2713
01:49:44,231 --> 01:49:46,690
a colby,
I paid $30 million to drink sprite,

2714
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,530
$30 million,
just the drinks,

2715
01:49:49,531 --> 01:49:50,920
sprite.
I go for $30 million.

2716
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:53,440
I would drink my own.
Come I say it is on a knack of thing.

2717
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:54,110
Right?
I know,

2718
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:56,140
I know women who have done it for far
less.

2719
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:56,980
That's the joke,
right?

2720
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:59,290
Right.
Pace goes crazy.

2721
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:02,110
I get offstage,
my agent is red,

2722
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:06,280
but there's a line around the corner at
my booth because I was the only guy that

2723
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:09,280
talked about something that was
happening like right then and I had a a

2724
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:13,120
thing on it,
get over like 120 schools and I,

2725
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:16,570
and I did that burn every,
you know,

2726
01:50:16,571 --> 01:50:18,640
you know what that is.
So you saying that you made about of

2727
01:50:18,641 --> 01:50:20,020
money and then you put together a
special,

2728
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:23,980
we have made a bunch of money put
together a special called anonymous shot

2729
01:50:23,981 --> 01:50:26,650
in south bend,
Indiana because I was in these writers'

2730
01:50:26,651 --> 01:50:28,270
rooms when people are going to midwest
doesn't get it,

2731
01:50:28,271 --> 01:50:29,140
the midwest doesn't get it.

2732
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:30,340
And I was like,
I want to show them that the mini

2733
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:34,480
Wisconsin hired uh,
everybody,

2734
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,120
right.
I'm the director.

2735
01:50:37,121 --> 01:50:38,090
I want it.
Couldn't do it.

2736
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:43,030
Referred another director.
I had already purchased the place and

2737
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:46,480
air time and all that stuff and I had
people from,

2738
01:50:46,481 --> 01:50:48,490
everybody hates Chris.
They were going to do favors for me.

2739
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:52,150
So my budget was at,
say it was at like $40,000.

2740
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:57,180
Right?
Then I had to hire this other guy and he

2741
01:50:57,461 --> 01:50:58,480
said,
I don't like working with people.

2742
01:50:58,481 --> 01:51:00,400
I don't know.
You got to hire all my people,

2743
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:03,790
doubles my budget.
We took a scouting trip,

2744
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,430
uh,
met his DP.

2745
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:08,680
They had my act.
They knew all my moves.

2746
01:51:08,681 --> 01:51:10,900
Like I had this down cold,
Terry Cruz.

2747
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:15,920
Cruz flew in and introduced me.
And when we get on the plane to fly,

2748
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:19,360
the director says the DPS not going to
make it.

2749
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,000
He,
I found out later he took another gig.

2750
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:28,290
So now I'm performing my special that
I'm spending now $100,000 on in front of

2751
01:51:28,961 --> 01:51:30,940
four camera guys who have never seen my
ad.

2752
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:36,300
Oh No.
And I do the special and it went great.

2753
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:39,890
Did two shows.
I'm still hype about it.

2754
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:43,390
Get back the footage.
This guy or whatever you could.

2755
01:51:43,391 --> 01:51:45,760
This is the medium shot.
Soft focus.

2756
01:51:45,761 --> 01:51:49,470
Both shows no blurry.
So no,

2757
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:52,510
all my punchlines are over my left
shoulder.

2758
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:54,240
Oh.
Which is not high.

2759
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:58,720
So I couldn't resell it.
So I had to put it on Youtube and my boy

2760
01:51:58,721 --> 01:52:01,330
calls it the most expensive demo tape
when you,

2761
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:04,360
oh my God,
it's called [inaudible] Smith anonymous.

2762
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:06,010
And I was so,
Yo,

2763
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:07,990
I was stressed man.
I lost a patch of hair.

2764
01:52:07,991 --> 01:52:10,750
It was,
it was a DP and go,

2765
01:52:10,751 --> 01:52:12,220
what the fuck?
I never did.

2766
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:13,060
Wow.

2767
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,500
I never did.
That's crazy.

2768
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,510
I never did.
How did you not like I fucked you.

2769
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:19,900
I just,
I didn't pay the director to this day.

2770
01:52:19,901 --> 01:52:21,430
I just didn't pay him.
I pay this crew.

2771
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:24,130
I paid everybody else.
Biggest check I ever wrote at that time.

2772
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:26,140
And I never,
but I would just say to him,

2773
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,130
I said,
I'm not paying you.

2774
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,980
I go,
you know why I'm not paying you.

2775
01:52:29,981 --> 01:52:32,560
And I said,
you had two shows to see this.

2776
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:35,920
I could've done my whole act over
without an audience.

2777
01:52:35,921 --> 01:52:38,510
Like I knew it that well just to,
you know,

2778
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,800
capture this in my whole purpose was to
resell it as you didn't listen to him.

2779
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,870
It was this thing,
cause he had only done music.

2780
01:52:43,871 --> 01:52:44,920
He hadn't done comedy.

2781
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,360
I knew every special and,
and Oh and the reason in that whole

2782
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:51,111
year,
every directed,

2783
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:53,390
I came and directed everybody hates
Chris episodes.

2784
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:55,900
I would take them to lunch cause I,
if I found that they did come the

2785
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:57,440
specials and I would pick their brain on
that.

2786
01:52:57,441 --> 01:52:58,060
Right.
You know?

2787
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:00,380
Yeah.
So I was very confident

2788
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:02,570
and what I needed,
you know,

2789
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:05,300
and cause didn't work.
And so,

2790
01:53:05,301 --> 01:53:07,880
uh,
that put me like I was scared to spend

2791
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:10,400
my own money on anything else.
You had to do anything for 10 years.

2792
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,710
And then,
uh,

2793
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,580
the,
I've,

2794
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:17,090
I then I shot a special on our iphones.
I bought 10 our phones,

2795
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:19,190
we lift the place,
right.

2796
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,680
Uh,
shot economy special.

2797
01:53:21,681 --> 01:53:25,280
And then I returned the I phones,
videotape myself returning the I and got

2798
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:27,770
my money back and I released that
special,

2799
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:30,160
we sent that to Netflix.
And at the time they,

2800
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,180
the,
not the people who are there now,

2801
01:53:32,181 --> 01:53:34,280
but the people who were there before I
heard,

2802
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,450
they just said I wasn't famous enough to
have an athlete.

2803
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:40,360
There's a lot of people that aren't very
famous that have netflix specials though

2804
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:42,890
that could be argued.
That could definitely be arguing and so

2805
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,350
that was another,
you know,

2806
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:48,070
so I just put that up on Youtube.
It's called good luck everybody.

2807
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,680
Those are the two.
So those are available now.

2808
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:52,660
Go watch him.
He had the one that you shot with

2809
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:53,501
iphones.
Good.

2810
01:53:53,501 --> 01:53:54,340
Look everybody.
I just,

2811
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,090
how much that costs to shoot it all with
iphone,

2812
01:53:57,070 --> 01:54:01,210
it cost me,
I paid an editor,

2813
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:02,133
so

2814
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:05,420
if I didn't pay him,
it would've cost me

2815
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:09,140
less than a thousand dollars.

2816
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:13,040
That's a great deal with the editor
calls me in the bargain.

2817
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,940
Maybe eight grand.
Do you remember when Dave towl did

2818
01:54:16,941 --> 01:54:20,470
something where he gave the audience
cameras them film him?

2819
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:21,650
Yeah,
it was great.

2820
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,090
That's a smart move,
man.

2821
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:25,640
If you've got something to say,
it don't matter how you had a moment is

2822
01:54:25,641 --> 01:54:27,320
captured.
I feel like if just saying something,

2823
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:28,910
just doing something like that.
I mean,

2824
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:30,830
especially Dave.
Dave is at his best.

2825
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:33,440
If you've seen David tell he's at his
best in these small crowds,

2826
01:54:33,530 --> 01:54:36,590
small audiences,
like he was at the Improv last week.

2827
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:39,320
Whoa area.
See when I'm dead last to audience is

2828
01:54:39,321 --> 01:54:41,450
half gone.
Everybody's tired.

2829
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:44,810
But he's still hilarious.
He's fantastic man.

2830
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,930
I used to go up after him a lot at the
cellar and it was like prairie.

2831
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:50,210
It was beautiful.
Just the way he would.

2832
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:52,430
Yeah man.
I love watching him work.

2833
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:56,580
That's a real,
like a real master of his craft and a

2834
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,120
real veteran.
Yeah.

2835
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:01,700
Yeah.
Nothing's going to shake this dude and

2836
01:55:01,701 --> 01:55:05,000
he's got so much material always
writing.

2837
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:08,540
Constantly writing chain smoking and
writing.

2838
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,650
I know,
I know.

2839
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,210
Yeah man.
But yeah,

2840
01:55:11,211 --> 01:55:12,710
so those are the two that I've done.
But Naw,

2841
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:15,050
not yet.
Hopefully somebody approached me to,

2842
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,660
cause I have some stuff that I really
would love to.

2843
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:18,351
Yeah,
man,

2844
01:55:18,351 --> 01:55:20,570
we gotta get you out there.
We've got to get you out there.

2845
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,070
Yeah,
I mean the store right now,

2846
01:55:22,071 --> 01:55:26,180
it's so crazy how many talented people
are there and man deal von Lit that

2847
01:55:26,181 --> 01:55:28,400
place on fire last night.
He was dope.

2848
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,930
I want,
I don't want to tell any of his bits,

2849
01:55:29,931 --> 01:55:31,760
but God damn,
he had me crying.

2850
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:36,560
It's like there's so many people right
now that are so good.

2851
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,560
Weird.
It's like the level at the place.

2852
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:42,530
It's like never before.
Never before.

2853
01:55:42,531 --> 01:55:45,360
I mean I started there in 94 and the
levels terrible.

2854
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:46,880
Wow.
There's a bunch of Badass.

2855
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,920
Yeah.
A bunch of guys from the road that like

2856
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,170
they had started out there in the 70s
and they were still around,

2857
01:55:52,171 --> 01:55:55,320
but they had the same act.
I mean there was some literally some

2858
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:58,710
people that start out there and like 78
and they were still floating around in

2859
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:03,720
94 and they were just fucking terrible.
It was death and then somewhere around

2860
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:09,920
2000 and maybe like four or five started
picking back up and it was pretty good

2861
01:56:11,161 --> 01:56:14,330
for a couple of years.
Then I bolted in 2007 after the Carlos

2862
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:19,340
men see it thing and I didn't come back
until 2014 announced as a hot as fuck.

2863
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,300
It's never seen it like this.
Never seen the,

2864
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:24,810
the this,
this level.

2865
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:28,890
There's so many funny guys around the
corner too is so inspiring,

2866
01:56:28,891 --> 01:56:29,790
like,
yeah,

2867
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:30,750
is amazing.

2868
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:34,320
And the store helped me tremendously,
especially to,

2869
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:36,390
or cause,
um,

2870
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:39,120
you,
you can't show him your weight through a

2871
01:56:39,121 --> 01:56:39,871
bit,
you know what I mean?

2872
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:41,730
Like you have to know what you came to
say.

2873
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,440
Yeah.
And I love that.

2874
01:56:43,441 --> 01:56:46,140
I love that.
It sounds is it challenges you as an

2875
01:56:46,141 --> 01:56:48,210
artist to really,
all right.

2876
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,170
Yeah.
Okay.

2877
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:53,580
Like you can't giggle and be like,
you see people try to,

2878
01:56:53,581 --> 01:56:54,950
and it's ugly.
It's terabytes.

2879
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:56,910
It's a audience filled with comedy
nerds.

2880
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:57,550
Yeah.
You know,

2881
01:56:57,550 --> 01:56:58,680
there's a lot.
It's a different,

2882
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,190
it's a different place now.
Yeah.

2883
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:02,730
It used to be like you'd get away with
way more there.

2884
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:05,100
It's now at the level so high.
It's just,

2885
01:57:05,110 --> 01:57:06,820
uh,
the expectations are so high.

2886
01:57:06,821 --> 01:57:07,680
It's great,
man.

2887
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,040
It's the best place to build that muscle
because then when you go anywhere else,

2888
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:14,670
it's like,
I know it's running with weights on.

2889
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:15,690
Yeah.
But listen,

2890
01:57:15,691 --> 01:57:17,220
man,
I'm glad we got you in the air.

2891
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:18,420
Uh,
I'm gonna,

2892
01:57:18,421 --> 01:57:20,010
I'm gonna see you tonight and you're
going to be on that.

2893
01:57:20,011 --> 01:57:20,550
Uh,
the,

2894
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:22,050
the benefit that we're doing do,
what am I saying?

2895
01:57:22,051 --> 01:57:23,910
Justin rent.
That's December 6th.

2896
01:57:23,911 --> 01:57:25,150
That's sold out folks.
Yeah.

2897
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:29,160
That's for the fight for the forgotten.
They build wells in the Congo and that's

2898
01:57:29,161 --> 01:57:31,740
going to be at the comedy store.
It'd be you and me and yeah.

2899
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,470
