1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,550
Yeah.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,550
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,510
If you go to Joe,

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,403
what does that mean?

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,260
God,

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,940
170 fucking episodes and I'm
still keeping my laptop power on.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,343
It's ridiculous.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,453
Um,

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,990
we brought to you by the flashlight.

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,600
Go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link entering the code name,

11
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:21,320
Rogan,

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,741
and a,

13
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,470
you will get 15% off the
number one sex toys for men.

14
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,320
It was a tight race between
number one and number two.

15
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,511
What was the other one?

16
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,344
Ham.

17
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,083
Melons.

18
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,470
We sliced ham.

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,590
Whatever it is,

20
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,610
do it or don't do it.

21
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,780
They're just a sponsor folks.

22
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:37,430
But it's a good product if
you're into masturbating,

23
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,810
if you're going to do it,

24
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,740
and you probably are,

25
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,330
this is better than just doing it.

26
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,440
It's technology.

27
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,040
Okay.

28
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,940
Embrace the times.

29
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,350
We were also brought to you by [inaudible]
Dot Com oh and it makers of Alpha

30
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:48,801
brain,

31
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:50,720
and we have a new alpha
brain that's coming out.

32
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:54,860
It's called Alpha brain source for all
you folks in the UK that have much more

33
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,170
restrictive laws when it comes
to nutritional supplements.

34
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:00,530
Like they can't even get vitamin B six
over there and some in some places in

35
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:00,860
Europe.

36
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,440
That's right.

37
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,273
The strange rent.

38
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,201
Yeah.

39
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:05,180
So our Alpha brain was considered a drug,

40
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,530
so it takes it out.

41
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:07,570
Does it put anything else in?

42
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:07,940
No.

43
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,773
Well it's just different.

44
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,870
The alternative ingredients that have
a similar effects and so we're still

45
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:13,690
fucking with it right now.

46
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,523
Hipster ingredients.

47
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,031
It's,

48
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,361
you know,

49
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,780
it might be better for some people that
find the original Alpha brain is hard to

50
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:19,081
take.

51
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:22,530
Like some people get nauseous from it
and some people doesn't make them feel

52
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:22,741
good.

53
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:22,951
It's,

54
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:23,220
it's,

55
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,170
it's real weird.

56
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,530
Everybody has a different,

57
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,350
everybody has a different
biological setup,

58
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,760
you know,

59
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,470
I feel like I was a
little sensitive to it.

60
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:30,840
Yeah.

61
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,000
But I took a lot that was
the issue take too much.

62
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:34,920
And I took two in the morning,

63
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:36,600
two at night and I
think that was too much.

64
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,550
Three once in one dose,

65
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,200
three or four in one dose or forgotten.

66
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,130
And I did not feel good.

67
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:41,971
And I was like,

68
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,770
maybe this is what people
feel like all the time.

69
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,380
Everybody's got a different
tolerance for caffeine,

70
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:46,891
for anything.

71
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:48,870
But for me too is good.

72
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,820
I take two Alpha brains and it's uh,

73
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,683
it's just,

74
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,940
it's not that shit from that movie.

75
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,620
What is it with Bradley Cooper?

76
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,780
It's just vitamins that
enhance cognitive function.

77
00:01:58,781 --> 00:01:59,161
It's all,

78
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,130
it is enhance.

79
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,650
Just like vitamins enhance your health.

80
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,870
It's very subtle but effective.

81
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,650
I enjoy it.

82
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,190
And the most important thing about
any of the Onnit products is there's a

83
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,360
hundred percent money back guarantee.

84
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,650
You don't have to return the product.

85
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,740
Just say it didn't work for you
and you get all your money back.

86
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:16,830
And we tried to make this
thing as fair as possible.

87
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:17,910
If you think it's too expensive,

88
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,230
I urge you please,

89
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,960
if you're interested in
nootropics to go online,

90
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,980
Google the subject,

91
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,820
look into it.

92
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:28,230
There's a lot of interesting studies
behind it and I personally have been

93
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,040
studying them and experimenting with
it for a long time now and I like it.

94
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,460
I liked the effects and if
you think that that on it,

95
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,780
Alpha brain is too expensive,

96
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,940
go to the website and
steal the ingredient list.

97
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,410
Just look at it's all online.

98
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,700
The exact amounts were online.

99
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,220
Go buy in bulk and make your
own stuff and I hope it works.

100
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,300
I swear to God,

101
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,570
I am way more concerned with people
not feeling ripped off than I am up for

102
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:51,834
making money.

103
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,940
That's why we make it as easy as possible.

104
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,410
100% money back guarantee too.

105
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,303
Don't forget that,

106
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,110
so enjoy it or don't enjoy it,

107
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,070
but there's a bunch of cool
products that we have out

108
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,490
now.

109
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,630
One of them is called shroom tech sport
and it's excellent for anybody who's

110
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,680
really into working out.

111
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:06,514
If you're really in,

112
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,010
if you do anything that's
like super strenuous,

113
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,844
you know you're,

114
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,140
you know you're doing running or like
some serious weightlifting class or

115
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:14,711
something like that.

116
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,780
Anything you do will you
really exert yourself.

117
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,160
It's an amazing supplement.

118
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,420
It's great for Jujitsu.

119
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,410
I love it for,

120
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,940
for any kind of athletic stuff,

121
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,110
but if you're not in the work in Alec,

122
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,250
Bryan doesn't even take that shit.

123
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:24,821
Doesn't help.

124
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,590
Yo-Yoing does this doesn't help us.

125
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,433
Yoyo Games.

126
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,430
We also have a shroom tech.

127
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,070
What would the shrimp tech is based on
all the information that's at [inaudible]

128
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:36,520
dot com [inaudible] dot com but it's
based on the quarter steps mushroom,

129
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:41,200
which is a mushroom that actually enhances
your body's ability to process oxygen

130
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,034
and people like,

131
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,520
and a higher climates and animals in
higher climates eat it and they actually

132
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,271
get energy and they,

133
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,860
that's how they figured
out that this stuff works.

134
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Um,

135
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,560
we also have a shroom tech immune,

136
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,021
which is a,

137
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,030
an immune supplement.

138
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,390
And basically the way this one works,

139
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:56,530
what as it's been explained to me is
your body doesn't understand what this

140
00:03:56,531 --> 00:04:00,100
mushroom is when it thinks it may be
like a bug thinks you may be sick,

141
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,460
so your body's immune system fires
up for a fight that never comes.

142
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:03,850
Right?

143
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,670
And so then your immune system
is just like on full tilt,

144
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,150
you know,

145
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,450
it's,

146
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,261
it pumps it up,

147
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,220
which it's a really,

148
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,710
I'm,

149
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,170
I'm real into probiotics.

150
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,970
I drink Kombucha tea every day.

151
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,440
I take Acidophilus,

152
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:14,921
um,

153
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,420
I take live cultures.

154
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,890
That's why cutters and ever get sick
cutters and like people that can throw

155
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,000
stuff themselves and their
body thinks they're dying.

156
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,910
So really it didn't make sense.

157
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:26,480
I guess that would be amazing match
if that's what you get up to do.

158
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,401
We would never get sick.

159
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,110
Just give yourself a little cut every day.

160
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,680
Yeah,

161
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,380
I don't think it works out.

162
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,911
Let me try it.

163
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:31,470
Yeah.

164
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:31,840
Um,

165
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,160
we also have a new mood,

166
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,870
which is a five HTP supplement,

167
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:36,580
which is a little serotonin booster.

168
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,743
And uh,

169
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,440
again,

170
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,190
like I said,

171
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,750
please study all this stuff online.

172
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,520
100% money back guarantee.

173
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,630
Always end.

174
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,940
Right now you have a special coupon,

175
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:46,181
don't you?

176
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:51,181
I saw what the fuck is that even
stand for the special coupon is worth,

177
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,030
it's 2012 so it's 20.2 12%

178
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,150
20 point 12% law.

179
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,140
But what was the coupon code?

180
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,820
Actually I was trying to figure it out.

181
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:01,300
I was like,

182
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,880
like I said,

183
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
and it's in,

184
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,100
well I'll tell you right now it's,

185
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,430
and why are sending like
20 years Rogan's I dunno.

186
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,490
What the fuck is stands for?

187
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,040
Not Your New Year,

188
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,510
New Year maybe it's like texting,

189
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,100
like tech speak.

190
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:15,181
Yeah.

191
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,650
It's probably something that kids like do.

192
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:17,560
And we're like old man,

193
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,700
like let and Ayi.

194
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,001
Yeah.

195
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,080
These kids these days.

196
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,530
Well,

197
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:20,940
yeah,

198
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,250
I mean,

199
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,060
I dunno.

200
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,271
Let me,

201
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:23,380
let me make sure I get the,

202
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:23,610
the,

203
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,550
the actual thing right.

204
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,720
I got it somewhere.

205
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,940
He should never young guns now.

206
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,053
Never.

207
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:33,890
Dammit.

208
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,090
I should have this right in front of me,

209
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:35,780
but I don't,

210
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,680
it's not your tweeter.

211
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,210
I know what I can't find it.

212
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
Tweet that shit.

213
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,610
And why are and why our
2012 or just 12,012 no,

214
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,740
Nyer 12 that's it.

215
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,640
And why are 12 wow,

216
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,550
we're organized as fuck.

217
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,033
Sorry.

218
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,600
Well that's the end of
these stupid commercials,

219
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,050
right?

220
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,250
Go to Joe Rogan battling that.

221
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:57,770
Click the link and read and decode
named Rogan get 10% but don't do that.

222
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,010
Do the

223
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,790
other one and why are get
yourself 20 point 12% off.

224
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,624
That's it.

225
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,141
It's over.

226
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,620
And that was,

227
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,570
it was brutal for me too.

228
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,260
All right gentlemen and ladies and
everybody else that's tuning in.

229
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,490
Peter Joseph is here.

230
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,150
You get to the bottom of shit.

231
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,160
[inaudible]

232
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,490
we're going to get to the obvious shit.

233
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,281
First of all,

234
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:25,600
before we even started this interview,

235
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,430
I want to tell you that I'm
ready to join your cult.

236
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,220
I've gone online,

237
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:30,521
I've,

238
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,160
I've seen other cult
members and leaders before.

239
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,840
They're not nearly as charismatic as you.

240
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,850
They don't make as much sense as you,

241
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,220
I think you're on point
and I'm ready to sign up.

242
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:40,390
You just tell me what I need to.

243
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:40,890
Uh,

244
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,071
you're,

245
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:44,710
you're a utopian view of the perfect
society is fucking brilliant,

246
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:45,400
man.

247
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,941
It's a,

248
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:46,271
it's,

249
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,710
it's dead on Peter Joseph.

250
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,420
You don't know is the creative,

251
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:50,790
it's like I used the,

252
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,550
the or the original movie and then
all these followup movies and now it's

253
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:55,031
actually,

254
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:55,480
you know,

255
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,600
you refer to it as a movement
and that's not cocky in any way,

256
00:06:58,601 --> 00:06:59,351
shape or form.

257
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,400
That's just what it is.

258
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,571
It's a movement,

259
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:02,110
you know,

260
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,860
so the zeitgeists movement that,

261
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,160
you know,

262
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,980
Tz em on Twitter,

263
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:08,140
that Tz movement on Twitter,

264
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:08,890
um,

265
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,401
and it's,

266
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,234
um,

267
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,560
a,

268
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,760
a fascinating thing
that's going on right now.

269
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,060
And your movies and your movement,

270
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,421
I mean,

271
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,650
can you say it's yours now?

272
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,710
Now it's sort of like it's
become a life of its own right?

273
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,291
No owns it.

274
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:21,670
And,

275
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,940
and whether people like it or not,

276
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,120
they're a part of the zeitgeists
movement one way or another.

277
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,380
What does the zeitgeists movement?

278
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,760
It's the definition of the times.

279
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,480
It's the cultural nuance of Ivy.

280
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,850
This is all the shit that we believe
and think it's true and how we progress

281
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,301
through time.

282
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,500
Hence the Zike guys movement.

283
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,723
So whether we,

284
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,720
anyone likes it or not,

285
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,990
they're part of the Zeitgeists boob.

286
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,740
So I just brought that into
that particular context.

287
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,030
How did you become this
smooth talk bad motherfucker?

288
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,110
How did this happen?

289
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,490
How did you become this guy?

290
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,980
Because it's not just that you
have all these great ideas.

291
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,701
It's a,

292
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:54,150
you never use the word awesome.

293
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,071
All right.

294
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:59,300
You just sail through the sentences
and you're just like your musician.

295
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:00,410
Is that what your background is?

296
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,360
I am a musician with percussionists,

297
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,350
classical percussionists.

298
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:05,360
That's what I tried to
do for years and years,

299
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,960
but didn't fit in the whole orchestral
establishment percussion scene.

300
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:09,551
Now,

301
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:11,830
Brett percussion in enlightened me exists.

302
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,940
It's not just,

303
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,760
it's not drunk.

304
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,391
It's drums.

305
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,440
You have the mallet family,

306
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,180
then there's the kettle
drums like Timpani.

307
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:21,350
Then you have hand portion and
learn the mall as much as I could.

308
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,080
Given the time that I have
in my studio in Culver City,

309
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:29,030
I have full section of my little house
blocked off or whenever I can pursue my

310
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:29,900
old hobby again,

311
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,670
which seems to be less and less.

312
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,504
Unfortunately.

313
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,181
People listen to me.

314
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:34,230
Some of your stuff online,

315
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,230
so I'm,

316
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,470
I'm working on compiling.

317
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:40,160
I've been hesitant to do that because
my identity has been so bizarre as a

318
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:40,670
filmmaker,

319
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,720
which I'd never intended to be.

320
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,021
Actually,

321
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,190
I think I sent you the link of the first
Zike guys performance a performance.

322
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:49,880
It wasn't intended to be a documentary
in the sense formulaically as you would

323
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:50,661
traditionally assumed,

324
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,310
which is how did it morph?

325
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,144
What happened?

326
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,301
Well,

327
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:57,720
I had the 2007 I did a six night
run in lower Manhattan free,

328
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,410
who was a thing.

329
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,520
I spent a lot of money on prepared this
piece over the course of seven months.

330
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,020
Didn't expect it to go anywhere because
basically I had no rights to actually

331
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,340
pursue this as a film.

332
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:12,060
So this is a firm firmly one shot off,

333
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,620
fair use type of deal.

334
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,940
So I did it,

335
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:15,601
publicized it,

336
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,434
people came,

337
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,190
everything was cool,

338
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,911
everyone liked it.

339
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,960
It was very dramatic.

340
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,790
He has some people walked out
and people really liked it.

341
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,720
Some inspired Q.

342
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:21,841
And.

343
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,350
A.

344
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,460
It was a catharsis for me.

345
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,420
I was in advertising,

346
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,840
I was doing shit that I didn't
appreciate doing is what the system does,

347
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:28,021
you know,

348
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:31,260
it forces you into a particular pocket
for the most of us for a lot of,

349
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,270
we don't necessarily
enjoy what we're doing.

350
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:34,350
So this is a catharsis.

351
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,540
And the unique thing about
it is it was so honest.

352
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,400
This is a very honest work from me.

353
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,890
I didn't really think about
approaching a demographic.

354
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,110
And when I,

355
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,520
when it went online on
Google video before youtube,

356
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,820
this is when Google video was the only
Internet video site that actually had

357
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:48,940
full length stuff.

358
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,930
And very rarely you'd hear about
feature length films getting there.

359
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,000
And I just happened to hit that paradigm
right then and it went crazy viral and

360
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:00,420
the lawsuits were threatened and everyone
thought it was some big documentary,

361
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:01,141
big production.

362
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,440
They had no idea that
background of lawsuits or
threaten the people that are in

363
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:04,650
it.

364
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:04,801
You know,

365
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,600
that film was a fair use film.

366
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,400
It was not intended to be released.

367
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,170
So whenever people saw like 20,

368
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,650
30 million views in the first year of
when seeing dollar signs as though,

369
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,940
and I wasn't even selling anything,

370
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,990
I wasn't intending to.

371
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,580
And then eventually I went back,

372
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:18,721
you know,

373
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,640
the tail between my legs
with all these people that,

374
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:21,600
cause the whole thing is full.

375
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,200
The whole thing is a
montage of the zeitgeists.

376
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:27,420
It's just one big cluster of all sorts
of different personalities kind of mushed

377
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,254
together.

378
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,690
And most of them supported it.

379
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,380
And then some of them got a little greedy
but everyone got paid off for the most

380
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:34,681
part.

381
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,470
And there's still a few
rocks left unturned,

382
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,510
but the statute of
limitations is now up on that.

383
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,980
So if anyone wants to sue me,

384
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,110
you're going to have the greater,

385
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,410
uh,

386
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,010
effect the ass.

387
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,521
Yeah.

388
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,520
Well it isn't all just stuff that
is out there in the public record.

389
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,060
Essentially.

390
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,391
It is,

391
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,224
but you know,

392
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,080
and put it together.

393
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,790
Anybody can sue anybody for anything if
they think they can get money out of it.

394
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,950
Especially in the film and
the film and media industry.

395
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,950
So you obviously you surprised by
the response to the first film you,

396
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,760
you had no idea any of
this was going to happen.

397
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,870
I had no intention to make a second film.

398
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,360
I never considered myself a filmmaker.

399
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,370
It was always musically driven and then
a denim came out in 2008 and that was,

400
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,520
that was picked up by the art of his
film festivals shown here at the Egyptian

401
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:14,941
theater.

402
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,320
That had a huge response.

403
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,780
Even larger in a certain sense because
it was the first time it had been

404
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,010
publicly displayed,

405
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:23,820
this whole phenomenon and then that
carried over into the zeitgeists movement,

406
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,030
which was basically the,

407
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,730
the thought experiment I had is like,

408
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:26,941
okay,

409
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:27,751
we have these film series.

410
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,730
He had plenty of people like
Michael Moore and making films.

411
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,360
Do they really support change or are
they really doing anything to actually

412
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,360
initiate a community effort
to get something going?

413
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,470
And at that point in time,

414
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,150
I had no idea what that would actually be.

415
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,311
It was I did,

416
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:40,540
I,

417
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,071
I figured,

418
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:42,740
well it says in the
movie on if he remembers,

419
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,381
I coasted end up,

420
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,060
it says join the movement,

421
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,120
start the largest critical
mass the world's ever seen
to try and get some change

422
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,880
going and it seemed to take root.

423
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,160
And then from there it's
been this kind of bubbling,

424
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,170
changing and morphine kind
of phenomenon that's global.

425
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,700
Now the zeitgeists movement,

426
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:58,534
which is,

427
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,920
which is a shared community.

428
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:03,100
I want to make people understand it isn't
like a movement than any the world's

429
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:03,631
ever seen.

430
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:06,550
This is just the people that the group
of people would have a similar value set.

431
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,930
That's the only way I describe it.

432
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,800
It's the ultimate anti institution.

433
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,570
So I often don't even
reference the movement.

434
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,910
I referenced the ideas behind it.

435
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,070
So you make this documentary,

436
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:19,780
it gets out and then all the sudden you
realize that there's this crazy movement

437
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,111
behind it.

438
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:22,840
And how do you attempt to organize it?

439
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,610
How do you attempt,

440
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,590
do you not do just get out of its
way and let it organize itself?

441
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:28,360
Like sort of an occupy
Wall Street types of it.

442
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,510
Combination of the two.

443
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,870
We started off at a self organizing
capacity but volunteers from around the

444
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:33,500
world,

445
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,190
it was beautiful actually just getting
all this communication from different

446
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:37,851
demographics.

447
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:38,990
I mean the whole is like our spectrum.

448
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:39,890
The audience if you will,

449
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:42,380
for not just the fillings with for the
movement that it paid attention to these

450
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,910
ideas is totally vast.

451
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:44,744
Yet people that are,

452
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,140
I've met kids that are like 10 years
old with a little zeitgeists move a tee

453
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,840
shirt on up to 80 year
old men that you know,

454
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,970
they're looking for something
different so it's amazing.

455
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,590
And the ethnicity differences are massive.

456
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,510
Want to be in Israel next
month giving a lecture.

457
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,130
It's truly unique.

458
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,630
So it self organized.

459
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:02,540
As it began we started to pinpoint
different coordination positions.

460
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,374
People in charge

461
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,460
places and give lectures as well.

462
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,150
I do.

463
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,840
And what is like,

464
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,320
what is the,

465
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,310
the lecture essentially,

466
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:08,780
uh,

467
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,890
is it just you breaking down how this
got started or is it you talk about yeah,

468
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,830
your perspective while they usually it's
lectures broken into three released now

469
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,120
lecture,

470
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,990
spoken to three typical lectures broken
into the first part being what defines

471
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:23,220
awareness and logic.

472
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:24,990
And reason how we think about information.

473
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,280
We're dismissing the Messenger.

474
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,840
Gotta look at it logically.

475
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:28,091
X,

476
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,251
Y,

477
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:28,801
and Z's.

478
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:29,550
Forget,

479
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,630
forget the subjects.

480
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:33,900
It's all about the train of thought
that the process of thought is,

481
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,790
is irrespective of personality.

482
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,630
There's a huge conflict in society
between logic and psychology and they're

483
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:39,961
very,

484
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:42,210
very different and I can
expand on that as we go.

485
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,330
Second Section is the criticism of
the current socioeconomic platform,

486
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,700
which I consider to be
one massive corruption.

487
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,840
We talk about corruption.

488
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:49,890
You'll a hard drive corrupts.

489
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:51,390
It's messed up or criminal,

490
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:52,650
political and Rob's a convenience store.

491
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,120
It's a corruption of the system,

492
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:55,210
the socioeconomic system,

493
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,044
the legal system.

494
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,671
To me,

495
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,440
the entire socioeconomic system,

496
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,520
namely economic,

497
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,830
not only politics,

498
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:03,060
politics is an outgrowth,

499
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,290
but I won't jump on that.

500
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,290
One is a is one massive corruption of
what it means to live on this planet,

501
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:12,180
what it means to perfect
good public health.

502
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,030
So there's that section he had stay in Ed.

503
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,730
That's massive and it must the
criticisms and presentations I do.

504
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,550
Then there's the solution which
support the train of thought,

505
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,250
which has many different names
as far as a new social system,

506
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,960
which I don't even
really address any more.

507
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:26,730
I'd just like to go for
the train of thought.

508
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,100
And what it comes down to is
you have to have a system,

509
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,680
a system that's based on
planetary resource management,

510
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,880
very fundamental stuff.

511
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:33,510
By the way,

512
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,390
a system that's not based on
growth and all the strange,

513
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:37,440
infinite growth paradigm stuff.

514
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,640
I'm sure my resource manager,

515
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,880
whole community,

516
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,890
one giant community
gets together and says,

517
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:42,161
okay,

518
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,430
what do we need and how
do we keep everybody happy

519
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,590
globally,

520
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,130
globally?

521
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,890
And you think about it in
the broadest symbiotic sense.

522
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:49,041
You know,

523
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,990
like one of the great
psychological revelations,

524
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,800
intellectual revelations that we've had
as species is that is that we've been

525
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:58,460
living in these divisive
kind of tribalistic concepts
and we assume normality

526
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,260
with it because of how
long they persisted.

527
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,550
But we tend to find that what we find
now as far as information is concerned,

528
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,780
is that we live in a global system.

529
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,370
We live in a symbiosis.

530
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,180
There's stretches outward,

531
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,050
honest to infinity.

532
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:14,051
So the very idea of separation because
literally tangibly on applicable to the

533
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,120
way we approach our life,

534
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,050
where we approached knowledge,

535
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,730
the way we approach approach society,

536
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,260
the way we approach economics,

537
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:23,450
which is the defining
feature of our existence.

538
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:23,661
You know,

539
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,800
how we get what we need,

540
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,490
how we relate,

541
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,030
of course,

542
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,330
how it,

543
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,040
the renewable elements,

544
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:28,880
the regeneration,

545
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:29,331
if you will,

546
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:32,960
the Omni regeneration or as a
Buckminster fuller of everything.

547
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920
How do we respect that?

548
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,440
And the ultimate realization is that
we have to begin to unify all concepts.

549
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:40,790
You see this and intellectual things.

550
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,980
Consilience is a book by Edward O.

551
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,340
Wilson.

552
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,050
Early on in the 1980s he wrote about
this concept of all the the disciplines

553
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,400
starting to merge together.

554
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,000
So you can't talk about chemistry without
talking about biology or other way

555
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:53,241
around.

556
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:56,120
You can't talk about physics that
are talking about mathematics.

557
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,460
You can't separate anything anymore.

558
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,090
And that's a unique phenomenon that's
occurring and you can stretch that train

559
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:05,720
of thought backwards and forwards
in my approach as far as simplicity,

560
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,490
the economic system has to be unified.

561
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:11,300
It has to have a very simple respect
of what actually supports us.

562
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,690
I can ramble that.

563
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:14,370
How did that transition take place?

564
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:14,561
We need,

565
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:19,000
even if you were to engineer the perfect
Utopian mathematic formula for keeping

566
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:20,320
everybody no such thing,

567
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:21,910
what do you do with the
money that you have now?

568
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:23,230
Does it just dissolved?

569
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,250
We start from scratch,

570
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,491
like,

571
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:24,671
you know,

572
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:25,271
how does that work?

573
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:26,470
How does it transition from,

574
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,470
from one monetary system
that makes no sense.

575
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,410
Where there's massive amounts of
corruption and people with huge amounts of

576
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:34,330
resources that they've probably gotten by.

577
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:36,070
What would be considered immoral,

578
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,600
although legal ways.

579
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,793
Sure.

580
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,760
What do you do with their money?

581
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:40,691
Well,

582
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:42,700
there's a few few answers to that one.

583
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:42,990
Let's,

584
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,860
let's get rid of the
word that Utopian though.

585
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,120
I mean,

586
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,990
I don't mean that in a sense of a fantasy
that's impossible of being achieved.

587
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,501
I mean,

588
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,390
it is an ideal like a boulder,

589
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,021
Colorado.

590
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,730
As far as what friend
of mine said to me once,

591
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:57,250
it's a working utopia and I believe it is,

592
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:57,580
you know,

593
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,830
I don't mean it in a sense of impossible.

594
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,190
Okay.

595
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,410
You put utopia is a touchy word.

596
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,590
I like the word sometimes
it's just missed is finite

597
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,410
only the best that we know up until
now and the great flaws that we're not

598
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,410
actually doing anything based
on the knowledge we have today.

599
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:14,250
But to answer your question,

600
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,090
how do we do that?

601
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,570
You know,

602
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,590
how do we transition?

603
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:17,460
The system is failing.

604
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,110
You have an unemployment crisis,

605
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:21,300
we have a debt crisis and we have a,

606
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:22,134
um,

607
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,830
and we have a energy
crisis that's looming.

608
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:29,010
Three of the nails in the
coffin as far as I'm concerned,

609
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:30,840
that interweave in certain ways.

610
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,810
We also have another crisis.

611
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,240
And that crisis is the
way people raise children.

612
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,860
We have the crisis of,

613
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,190
you know,

614
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,890
too many people that don't give a fuck
about their kids and they're raising

615
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,270
these little problems,

616
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,830
these people that are,

617
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:43,161
you know,

618
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:46,010
and the crisis of
consciousness means for sure.

619
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:49,710
And that absolutely transmits
from parent to children.

620
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,000
You know,

621
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,191
when,

622
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:53,220
when they're not paying attention to the
kids or where they're bad parenting or

623
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:53,420
you know,

624
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,061
whatever they have.

625
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:54,811
Well that brings up the,

626
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:55,890
he gets the same sort of,

627
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,120
it's like how do we change?

628
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:57,954
They're there.

629
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,090
How do we change society
at the Cork is really,

630
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:01,080
you got to get to them too.

631
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,820
That's a big percentage of people that
are impoverished and uneducated and strip

632
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,420
clubs.

633
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,680
It's great for a lot of things.

634
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:08,610
It's great for porn too.

635
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,030
Yeah.

636
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,380
Yeah.

637
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,770
Just we want a lot of chaos,

638
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:11,081
you know,

639
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:12,840
and you want a lot of messy things.

640
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,674
Great for fighting too.

641
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,730
Um,

642
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,890
but I think that's,

643
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,060
that's a big problem,

644
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:18,301
right?

645
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:18,511
I mean,

646
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:18,861
isn't it?

647
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:18,940
Yeah.

648
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,820
Hence the nature of what the zeitgeists
wound that really defines itself as me.

649
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:23,680
You can talk about these
solution oriented things,

650
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,000
but really it's the,

651
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,250
it's the evolution of human awareness.

652
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,980
The real crisis is the
crisis of ignorance.

653
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,630
There's no energy crisis.

654
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,210
It's really just a crisis of
misunderstanding what we're doing

655
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,000
and the fact that people have become
addicted to the money that's going around

656
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,301
the,

657
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:39,511
the,

658
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,940
the people that are taking
money from corporations,

659
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,270
it's,

660
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,140
it stopped becoming a matter of
whether or not it's a good thing.

661
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,390
It's,

662
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,490
it's precedented.

663
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:48,301
There's a precedent.

664
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,230
It's already in place.

665
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,041
They're making the money.

666
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,560
They're going to continue to make the
money and then want to make the money.

667
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,790
And so anything where you say,

668
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:53,941
well,

669
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:54,361
hey man,

670
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,160
I don't think that what
we're doing is really fair.

671
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,461
I mean,

672
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,530
we're being unfairly
influenced by corporations.

673
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,400
Uh,

674
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,233
dude,

675
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,350
we're making this fucking money.

676
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,610
We've been making this money,

677
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:03,870
we're going to continue
to make this money.

678
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,100
You don't just stop,

679
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:05,881
you know,

680
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:06,330
it's,

681
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,250
it's very difficult.

682
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:07,860
Dot.

683
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,480
That's why the failure is so important,

684
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:09,901
if you will.

685
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,130
The failure that's an
on hand is not going to,

686
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,440
is not going to be altered by any new
legislations or any fail safes the

687
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,800
establishment might have.

688
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:23,730
There's no way this system can persist
for a number of different reasons I could

689
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:24,301
throw out there,

690
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:24,791
first of all,

691
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,800
the of occupy movement,

692
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:26,041
right?

693
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,770
Everyone says maybe that
at this point in time,

694
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,760
the division of,

695
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,040
of rich versus poor is
more than it ever was.

696
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:32,401
Actually.

697
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,234
It's not.

698
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,721
It's not.

699
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,000
It's always been structurally classed.

700
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,660
There's a structural classes and built
into this system occupies only been the

701
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:43,500
first to really acknowledged
that on the global scale of a,

702
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:43,991
a,

703
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:44,270
uh,

704
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,220
an issue that's been there from the very
beginning because every element of this

705
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,530
system supports that annex getting worse.

706
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,370
We live in a plutonomy now there's more
money moving amongst the upper five

707
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,890
percentile influencing GDP.

708
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,030
So much money that it makes the
lower percentiles movements and money

709
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,720
irrelevant.

710
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,940
So on it from a firmly
economic standpoint,

711
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,410
the lower classes are literally
irrelevant to the function of the economy.

712
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:08,250
Therefore to the,

713
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,540
to the powers that be,

714
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,021
if you will,

715
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:14,490
to the corporate establishment and to the
taxation fueling and big business that

716
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:15,324
fuels all government.

717
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,170
And this is all because the
system has been manipulated.

718
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,261
Yeah,

719
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:18,320
no,

720
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,500
this

721
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,480
is because the system is intrinsically
flawed base based on the need for

722
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:26,000
differential advantage and
an old form of tribalism,

723
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,700
psychological tribalism that
you have to gain advantage over.

724
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:32,060
Others is socially Darwinistic
view and what's unique.

725
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,420
Even though I hold that to be self
evident and true to the human condition,

726
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,990
if we're,

727
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,290
if we were both existing and extreme
scarcity and we had nothing to eat,

728
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,080
we end up finding each other
most likely to survive.

729
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,250
That's a natural human instinct.

730
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,410
What's happened now though is that the,

731
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,690
I'm jumping ahead here but following
me is that the entire infrastructure of

732
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:50,180
society,

733
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,760
the human population is so large,

734
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,280
their industry has become so big.

735
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,580
We have the Fukushima meltdown,

736
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,210
we have the nuclear weapons,

737
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:01,000
we have nano weapons
that are on the horizon.

738
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,240
What we have now is we can't have the
risk of this type of mentality being the

739
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,050
forefront of our psychology.

740
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,710
We can't have the self betterment of
the individual to be the forefront of us

741
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:14,140
because it goes against our
longterm evolutionary fitness,

742
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,120
which means the entire species at risk.

743
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,650
So to put it in a sentence,

744
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,830
the self interest that tends to
dominate now that's that really is the

745
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:23,620
psychological fuel of all
the motivations that you see.

746
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,730
The greed,

747
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:25,564
if fuel's degrees,

748
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,690
just an extension of the,

749
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,840
the basic motivation is
really no such thing as greed.

750
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,730
It's just they're in the system.

751
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:35,731
All of that that you see is going to
fuck us all up until we begin to realize

752
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,170
that we can't operate this way
cause it's going to destroy us.

753
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,273
Does that make sense?

754
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,440
We nuclear war was the best example.

755
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:41,621
They don't,

756
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,400
you don't need passports to a CEO.

757
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,941
The fallout,

758
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:44,061
you know,

759
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:46,420
nuclear winter would have
taken over the entire planet.

760
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,820
If the U S and uh,

761
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,270
Russia went to nuclear war,

762
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:50,770
even a minor war,

763
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,520
it would have destroyed almost
the entire human species.

764
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,420
And a few scientists realize that said,

765
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:56,080
you know what?

766
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,010
This isn't really a partisan or a
country or nationalist issue anymore.

767
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,070
This is a life issue.

768
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,750
So the greater our technology,

769
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,830
the greater our ability,

770
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,900
the greater vulnerability we have.

771
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:09,901
And the more clear it becomes how we
have to unify and make our self interest

772
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,260
become social interest if we
intend to survive as a species.

773
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,350
And this is the great paradigm
shift of all human thought.

774
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,780
So what do you do with all the weapons?

775
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,393
Well,

776
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,211
you get rid of them,

777
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:25,030
dismantle them and hope you can
regurgitate them into something defective.

778
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,060
Imagine if we were to take over the
Pentagon and use their equipment for

779
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:30,100
monitoring the earth's resources.

780
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:33,700
Use the amazing surveillance equipment
to actually have a productive use.

781
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:34,570
It would be incredible.

782
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,990
I think everything you say is brilliant
and I agree with it 100% but when I

783
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,600
think about it being
implemented in today's society,

784
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:46,650
I think of the human beings that exist
right now and how they've been running

785
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:48,830
their lives based on greed,

786
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,860
real greed based on real ignorance,

787
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,330
based on violence.

788
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,440
I mean you're going to get these people
and everybody is going to go hold hands

789
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:00,000
and sing Kumbaya together.

790
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:00,751
You know?

791
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,670
I feel like there has to be something,

792
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,371
you know there,

793
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,060
there has to be some sort
of event that unites people.

794
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,120
There's not going to be a stopping
of the separation of rich and poor.

795
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,790
The rich are only going to get
richer and smaller and smaller.

796
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,031
And when,

797
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:13,170
if you want to see anger,

798
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,093
just wait.

799
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:14,971
Just wait.

800
00:23:14,971 --> 00:23:15,211
Where are we?

801
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,670
Haven't even touched the
anger stage as it were.

802
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,870
When you say that is what's going to start
the initial transition into something

803
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:26,460
new and the point of the movement really
is not to try to initiate some step by

804
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:29,490
step logical transition to assume human
beings are rational and they're just

805
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:29,761
going to say,

806
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:29,911
oh,

807
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:30,511
that sounds better.

808
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:33,480
That sounds more efficient now that that's
not the way the human being works at

809
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:33,751
all,

810
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:34,620
at least at this stage.

811
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,100
So the failure will happen is like I said,

812
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,910
movements on the sidelines
as far as I'm concerned,

813
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:43,020
trying to spread information about what
a new social system may be exposing the

814
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:47,000
roots of this system and as
this tipping point occurs,

815
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,590
those that are on the outs will slowly
become on the end and you'll have a very

816
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,150
powerful large,

817
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:56,570
complicated revolution that
will happen one way or another.

818
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,610
I had this and it's an
inevitability to me,

819
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,640
so all the rich 1.0% doesn't matter.

820
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,550
Many billions of dollars they have the
police are not going to protect them.

821
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,930
There's going to be a very unique
unpredictable shift in the human social

822
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:09,390
structure.

823
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,440
It's a fucking movie,

824
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:11,130
isn't it?

825
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,640
It is.

826
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,421
Isn't it an a movie?

827
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:15,960
I mean really a great time in the movie
of its time when things get really

828
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:16,794
exciting.

829
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,900
I've said about the occupy
movement that to me,

830
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:20,220
they're like white blood cells.

831
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,960
They don't know exactly why they're there,

832
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,730
but they know that there's an issue
and they've the immune system,

833
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,470
there's a beer,

834
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,940
there's a sickness here.

835
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,060
Social Disorder.

836
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,910
It's a social immune system response.

837
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,780
It really is.

838
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,630
I mean they just clogged up all
the areas where there's corruption.

839
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:33,980
Yeah,

840
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,641
it's fascinating.

841
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,840
It was a beautiful action.

842
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,201
Too Bad,

843
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:40,040
the majority of the occupy movement
hasn't been able to really put a train of

844
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,930
thought forward that others can grasp.

845
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,830
They have all this media,

846
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:43,401
all this press.

847
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:43,880
I tried to,

848
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,620
I don't know if you've seen anything
that I've tried to do with them.

849
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:46,190
I've done,

850
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,790
I've done some talks in La in New York
and just really trying to get some seeds

851
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,680
planted as far as what a
new social structure may be.

852
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:55,250
Cause he can complain all day until you
put down to some fundamental logical

853
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,450
elements that people can grab,

854
00:24:56,451 --> 00:25:01,370
expand and get into the
public consciousness into
the Zeitgeists we're doomed

855
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:02,100
until that happens.

856
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,090
This is going to be one iteration of,

857
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,953
of rogue.

858
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,213
You know,

859
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,730
the idea would be amazing to have uh,

860
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,620
an entire culture filled with cool
people and everybody works together.

861
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:12,980
Like,

862
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,813
boy,

863
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,683
you feel like,

864
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,010
could that work?

865
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,150
Is that possible?

866
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,840
And if it was possible when
anybody ever get anything done,

867
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,790
would there be any more competition?

868
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,060
Would they be any more
creativity with everybody just be

869
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,110
banging each other and
giving each other hugs.

870
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,080
The Fun thing about modern,

871
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:35,830
a sociological research is that a great
number of studies have been done in

872
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:36,590
those issues.

873
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:36,950
Yeah.

874
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,020
Incentive is a,

875
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:41,920
has been a large forest of the market
system to assume if we're doing mechanical

876
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:45,040
stuff yet I'm going to be on a conveyor
line which can easily be automated now.

877
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:45,620
And you know,

878
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,630
be on a subway line.

879
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:47,620
It just blows my mind.

880
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:50,410
I'm walking into like a subway restaurant
and there's this conveyor belt of

881
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:54,370
people that you could automate in five
seconds if you want to wasting their

882
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:54,731
lives.

883
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:54,881
Yeah,

884
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,060
you have to pay people for that.

885
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:57,310
But when it comes to creativity,

886
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,280
very few are actually motivated by
money and money actually inhibits.

887
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,220
There's longer studies that are done
by man named Daniel Pink called drive.

888
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,810
I recommend that book to
anyone that's interested.

889
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,631
I would think that,

890
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:05,931
yeah,

891
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,910
if you were just concentrating
on money and you would,

892
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,030
that you would lose part of your
mental resources that you could have

893
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:12,320
concentrated on creativity.

894
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,660
So deep in inhibition,

895
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,800
everything I've ever done creatively
have never money's a pollutant to me.

896
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,340
You know,

897
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,250
for anything that I've done pollutant,

898
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,570
it hinders my creative response.

899
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,600
Really.

900
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:23,980
A fucker.

901
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,650
You a hundred percent fucking love money.

902
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,260
I love buying cool shit.

903
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,640
I like going to movies.

904
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,730
I like going to dinner and I don't
have to worry how much it costs.

905
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,631
You hate money,

906
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:34,170
period.

907
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:34,681
I hate money,

908
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:35,101
period.

909
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:38,520
I hate not to do limitless resources.

910
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:38,910
Yeah.

911
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,110
If I just didn't have,

912
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,830
well,

913
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,670
we're dealing with it.

914
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:42,780
I hate dealing with bills.

915
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,800
You hate it.

916
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,040
I

917
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,290
hate having money.

918
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,420
I hate getting motherfucker.

919
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,750
I hate having to deal with that part.

920
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:50,640
I just like waking up
doing what I wanted to do.

921
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:51,670
Creativity like,

922
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:51,910
like,

923
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,690
like not having to worry about
that at all would be amazing

924
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,430
because they'll just go somewhere and
give them your pictures and they give you

925
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:58,120
some meat.

926
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,511
Well,

927
00:26:58,511 --> 00:26:59,201
I mean again,

928
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,740
like of course that you
have to get paid he to live,

929
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,110
but if that I could take
that whole part out,

930
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:05,980
that'd be amazing.

931
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,550
Exactly.

932
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:06,881
Yeah.

933
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:08,080
It's the system that we're,

934
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:08,471
it's not,

935
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:10,870
it's absolutely not the best we can do.

936
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,500
You know?

937
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:11,651
There's,

938
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:13,240
there's no way this is the best we can do,

939
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,860
especially the stock market.

940
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:15,250
Man.

941
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,930
I don't give a fuck if
you understand it or not.

942
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:17,471
I watch it.

943
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,630
Sometimes I watch those numbers scroll
through the bottom of screen and there's

944
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,820
some fucking dude with his,

945
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,500
his classical attire has traditional
attire that he's wearing with his tie and

946
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,890
his his and he's moving
around and pointing totally.

947
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,360
These different stocks are
going up and down and you know,

948
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:33,150
it's all based on confidence though.

949
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,000
What kind of a shitbag
system have you put together?

950
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,030
What kind of a Goofy fucking number game?

951
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,050
What's all going up and down
and shorts and derivatives?

952
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,480
You tell me what the fuck did
derivative market is again,

953
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,730
why is it a hundred times
bigger than the real market?

954
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:49,470
What?

955
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:49,561
Well,

956
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:50,460
as much as I hate to admit it,

957
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,960
I was a private equity trader for
about six years after I left was like,

958
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,211
well,

959
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:56,700
it was a personal choice to
get out of the establishment.

960
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:56,850
You know,

961
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,690
the only occupation in existence we don't
have a boss or a client or reliant on

962
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,670
an audience is in the equity trading.

963
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,140
So were you,

964
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,441
uh,

965
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,150
is it like being an educated guesser?

966
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,380
Is that what it's like?

967
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,640
There's a huge strategy that's called
technical analysis that people use.

968
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:15,600
It's now it's automated behind the scenes
by groups like Goldman Sachs that are

969
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,351
raping.

970
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:17,910
Everybody's slowly but surely.

971
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,110
But no,

972
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,010
there's it from Ted.

973
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:23,010
I had a lot of respect for the traders
independently because of their mindset.

974
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:23,910
It's a great discipline.

975
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,860
It's like a sport you really
have to know you're doing.

976
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:26,641
You can't just wing it,

977
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:27,391
it's not gambling.

978
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:28,530
And then he kind of sense like that.

979
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,750
But as an institution,

980
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,760
those stock market and the whole concept
of these representations of equity and

981
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,070
finance and how and how much
influence it has in society,

982
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:41,160
and of course the Dalit driven is blow
out and everything else that we've seen,

983
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,370
it's the most cancerous thing
on the face of the earth.

984
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,941
It stock market.

985
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:45,774
It's just unbelievable.

986
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,280
That's why it even exists at all.

987
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:48,114
I have no clue.

988
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,590
It's the ultimate manifestation of
the worst concept of having no social

989
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:56,730
contribution and invariably making
more money than any other sector of the

990
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:57,331
population.

991
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,500
Even though you create nothing,

992
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,334
you'd do nothing.

993
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,320
And it's just like Wall
Street and Michael Douglas.

994
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:01,740
He's like,

995
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,130
you know,

996
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,230
it's like I create nothing I own.

997
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,281
Yeah,

998
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:08,100
it's amazing that it's been able to
get to the point where it is now.

999
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,890
It's just what a what an out
of control ride and you guys,

1000
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:14,430
they may like $40 million
a year doing nothing.

1001
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,960
Nothing.

1002
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,591
And you say to yourself,

1003
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:16,681
well,

1004
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:17,461
here's the market system.

1005
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:18,660
This is the capitalist concept,

1006
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:18,840
right?

1007
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,673
Oh everyone.

1008
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,430
If you do the most contribution,

1009
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:22,470
you supposed to get the most reward.

1010
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:23,890
That's the underlying tone.

1011
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:27,220
So if you work really hard and didn't
really want to and make that invention,

1012
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:28,740
then you can contribute to society.

1013
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,570
Now it's you better go.

1014
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:31,980
You're only off of yourself.

1015
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,240
Fuck everybody else.

1016
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,920
That's what's rewarded in the system
across the board and the market system is

1017
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:41,250
just the highest level of that
psychological manifestation.

1018
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,130
Did it grow

1019
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,370
too fast for our little monkey minds?

1020
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,420
Is that what it is?

1021
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,650
Did Technology and the concept of
being able to control money and all the

1022
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:54,340
different things that we have to deal
with is variables didn't exist when our

1023
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:55,780
minds are were created.

1024
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:58,840
Our DNA is essentially the same
as it was 10,000 years ago.

1025
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,681
It's our DNA.

1026
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,130
It's really essentially set up for the
natural world and then all of a sudden

1027
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:07,030
we've shoved it into this weird new
dimension where we're dealing with an

1028
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:08,440
incredible amount of variables.

1029
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,450
You're dealing with
all kinds of craziness.

1030
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:10,691
I mean,

1031
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:11,081
it's just,

1032
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:16,081
I don't know if the mind is set up to
deal with the world that we've created,

1033
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,870
which is why it's like a
kid at the helm of a car.

1034
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,990
It does not drive and he
stopped on the fucking gas,

1035
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:26,980
but he's too small to look over the over
the dashboard so it is even know where

1036
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:27,880
the fuck he's going.

1037
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,860
He's trying to figure this
thing out as he goes along.

1038
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,170
It's like all of a sudden
this little kid has a car,

1039
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,771
you know?

1040
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:33,910
And that's what it's like with us.

1041
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:37,060
Like we're like these dumb
fucking monkeys and we're,

1042
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:42,061
we're still evolving out of that dumb
monkey primal soup and popping out where

1043
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:42,701
we're at.

1044
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:44,200
This monkey that's aware of itself.

1045
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,300
And then in the process of
becoming aware of itself,

1046
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:48,100
barely getting our shit together,

1047
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,260
we've created everything.

1048
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:55,261
We've created nuclear fucking bombs and
cell phones and video that you can get a

1049
00:30:55,871 --> 00:31:00,280
little screening your pocket and the
ability to do things that we would have

1050
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,750
never thought possible.

1051
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:04,060
Just 50607080100 years ago.

1052
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,010
Sure.

1053
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,310
It's almost like no one
could have managed this.

1054
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,240
It's almost like it blew up sure.

1055
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,910
Faster than our reasoning.

1056
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,130
Evolution is always
natural one way or another.

1057
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:18,340
Whether we destroy ourselves well
then I guess the human species was

1058
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,500
evolutionary culdesac
it's one way or another.

1059
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:21,430
Everything is always right.

1060
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:21,851
You know what I mean?

1061
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:22,930
There's no wrongs here,

1062
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,250
but you know the,

1063
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:27,460
the disorder that's in place
in society is what concerns me,

1064
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:29,020
which is what you alluded
to at the beginning.

1065
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,310
You have this huge disorder based on
the system that's basically a self

1066
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,121
destructive system.

1067
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:34,871
It's not respected.

1068
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:36,730
Any general variables
of resource management,

1069
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:37,564
it's not respecting,

1070
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,723
you know,

1071
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,300
I saw a recent status at,

1072
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:40,451
Oh,

1073
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:41,910
China has less uh,

1074
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:44,890
unemployment than America
because they're lax EPA,

1075
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:46,000
if you were wherever they have in China,

1076
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:47,740
the lax environmental issues,

1077
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:50,410
like we should be more like China and
reduce our environmental things and they

1078
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:53,950
have like huge smog thing and it's
just disgusting destroying ourselves.

1079
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:57,700
One town where they say it's like
smoking two packs of cigarettes a day,

1080
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:58,600
just living there.

1081
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,180
The skies were like dark gray.

1082
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,073
So it's,

1083
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,030
it's a disorder that we don't even see
it and we just keep killing ourselves.

1084
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:07,500
Whether it's

1085
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,190
why is that?

1086
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,030
Is it because we still recognize ourselves
as individuals and we still haven't

1087
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,250
realized that we are a part of a giant
super organism that is the human race.

1088
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,490
So because people are acting as
individuals and then they could do so as a

1089
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,920
corporation and do so without guilt.

1090
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,190
They act as individuals
all going towards one goal,

1091
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:29,790
but under the guise that the company's
doing it in the best interest of business

1092
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,670
and then they're able to get away with
a lot of shit that you just can't get

1093
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:33,351
away with in a,

1094
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,620
in a one on one basis

1095
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,030
instead of thinking of
human beings as a whole.

1096
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,010
Putting that at the front

1097
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,843
of your ethic,

1098
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,500
that's like not even a consideration.

1099
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,030
It's like what can we get away with?

1100
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:44,890
What's legal?

1101
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,260
Yeah.

1102
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:45,561
You know,

1103
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:46,820
and it's not our fault if it's legal,

1104
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,041
go back.

1105
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,400
I go back to my early life.

1106
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,250
I had a normal upbringing,

1107
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:51,760
but I,

1108
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,500
I did all sorts of shit out of college
that was highly illegal reselling things.

1109
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,030
Just it was whatever you
can do to make money,

1110
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,900
it didn't matter.

1111
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,920
And everyone did too.

1112
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,920
It was whatever you
needed to do to get money.

1113
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:05,650
And what's happened now with the value
system disorder is that since that's the

1114
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:06,400
pursuit,

1115
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,020
that's the divine drive of the system.

1116
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:12,100
That's what status is defined by its
what your success is defined by that.

1117
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,190
Everyone can blindly look the other way
with how much destruction is occurring

1118
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:15,581
in the world.

1119
00:33:15,581 --> 00:33:18,340
They can look the other way with
the wars and the cancers and,

1120
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,480
and the just every natural phenomenon
that we've come to to disintegrate the,

1121
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:24,740
all the trash that's surrounding
the planet right now.

1122
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:25,220
And

1123
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,510
like in the war too,

1124
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,040
the way people react,

1125
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,180
if you know that someone in their
family has been molesting someone,

1126
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,320
it's almost like they don't want
to know the Lord looking away.

1127
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:38,880
They don't want to think about it.

1128
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,110
They don't want to do it that way.

1129
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,670
If there was right next door,

1130
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,200
we'd be thinking about
it every fucking day.

1131
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:46,660
The fact that people can just commonly
accept the fact that there's no for,

1132
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,380
for no reason whatsoever that
you could ever argue we're,

1133
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:54,381
we have thousands of dudes with guns
in some other part of the world and it

1134
00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:55,591
seems normal,

1135
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:55,971
doesn't it?

1136
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:58,830
And it seems normal because it's a part
of life and people are born into this

1137
00:33:58,831 --> 00:33:59,311
normality.

1138
00:33:59,311 --> 00:34:00,031
They don't know any better.

1139
00:34:00,031 --> 00:34:00,864
So exactly.

1140
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,460
So it is what it is because we feel
like the system must be smarter than us.

1141
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:05,841
I mean it's,

1142
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:06,331
it's big,

1143
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:06,751
it's huge,

1144
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:07,584
it's gigantic,

1145
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:07,980
you know,

1146
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,280
but it's a,

1147
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,700
but it's a group of Goddamn individuals
with their own personal interest at hand

1148
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,960
and their personal interests will extend
to killing people and profiting off of

1149
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:17,310
it if they can get away with it.

1150
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,220
My favorite example of that concept
was remember the movie network,

1151
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,440
which I have little skit mad as hell
number when they got frustrated the very

1152
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:28,440
end because they were losing money with
the character and they sit around and

1153
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,220
they go,

1154
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,060
well we could kill him.

1155
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,030
And he you think is the audience
member that they're just joking.

1156
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,170
You think someone that runs on the go,

1157
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,651
yeah,

1158
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:35,484
whatever,

1159
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,300
but then they're like,

1160
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,541
well,

1161
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,051
if we do it,

1162
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:38,070
we have to be very careful.

1163
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,320
Then the film ends right there.

1164
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,910
So you think about that logic,

1165
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:43,790
a human life becomes quite
secondary to the most,

1166
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,371
the motivations,

1167
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:47,490
especially the higher you go up in
this sort of corporate neuroses.

1168
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,281
Well,

1169
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:48,611
you know,

1170
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:51,070
it's why I've argued
before with people about,

1171
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:51,430
you know,

1172
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,881
this,

1173
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,430
this September 11th especially that the,

1174
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,040
I mean I've heard more
conversations about,

1175
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,640
you know,

1176
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,260
what people think happened September 11th
and I believe this and I believe that.

1177
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,700
And from,

1178
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,410
from the very moment I've said,

1179
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,150
you don't believe that they'd be willing.

1180
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm not saying that people did orchestrate
any sort of attacks on America.

1181
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm not saying they let,

1182
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:12,610
I'm not saying anything,

1183
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,760
but what I am saying is that we know
that they went to war and they said that

1184
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:20,020
there was weapons of mass
destruction when there weren't.

1185
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:22,480
So they're willing to kill some
people that they don't know.

1186
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,230
They know.

1187
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,920
They know that the very least they're
willing to kill some people that they

1188
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:29,050
don't know in order to
push their own agenda.

1189
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:29,710
We know that

1190
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,230
just like when they opened Wall Street,

1191
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,950
the toxic air and the thousands
that have gotten sick since then,

1192
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,380
my take on it is they
don't know you either,

1193
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,040
so you

1194
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,360
don't think they would kill you.

1195
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,600
Right.

1196
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,520
You really think that the p anybody
that would orchestrate death for profit,

1197
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,750
you don't think they would kill you.

1198
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:48,170
You really think that they would
because you're a US citizen.

1199
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:48,890
Just the nature of the,

1200
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,400
of the team,

1201
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,730
the entire and the entire military,

1202
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,690
industrial establishment.

1203
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,310
I mean this is a killing machines.

1204
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,590
Yeah,

1205
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:53,790
wink.

1206
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,120
They wouldn't use that in
domestic purposes and not
to mention there's so many

1207
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:57,931
examples of that,

1208
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:59,850
their history that people would
blindly look at where the quorum,

1209
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,810
it's just so sad.

1210
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,410
That's why it's offensive when someone
says that you're unpatriotic when you see

1211
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,700
that and when you see that
and you point that out,

1212
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:05,821
no,

1213
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,470
you gotta know that is patriotic.

1214
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,400
That is very patriotic because that's
not what we're supposed to be about.

1215
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,980
That's not what this country was
supposed to be founded for this,

1216
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:15,960
this country was supposed
to be the best alternative.

1217
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,750
This country was supposed to be
the people that got it together.

1218
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:18,901
Say,

1219
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:19,131
listen,

1220
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:20,340
we have to fucking rules,

1221
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:20,611
man.

1222
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,091
Here's the rule.

1223
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,290
We separate this from that.

1224
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:22,861
We do this,

1225
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:23,460
we do that.

1226
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,720
We don't let anybody do this.

1227
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:24,901
You know,

1228
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:25,920
don't give up your liberties.

1229
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,480
You have to have essential liberties.

1230
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:28,230
You have to have guns.

1231
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,501
Okay?

1232
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:29,880
You gotta protect yourself from enemies,

1233
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:30,810
foreign and domestic.

1234
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:31,290
You know,

1235
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,430
it was all set up.

1236
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,360
It was all set up.

1237
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,230
Sure.

1238
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,890
They knew.

1239
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,900
We could argue a little
nuances of the founders,

1240
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,150
but I understand your point.

1241
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:39,721
That was one thing.

1242
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:39,961
Did you,

1243
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:42,240
did you hear this fucking
dummy Newt Gingrich?

1244
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,430
This would be king fat headed clown.

1245
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,600
This guy actually said that he believed
that the founding fathers would be much

1246
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:52,740
more aggressive in the way they would
prosecute people for marijuana and that

1247
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:55,000
they would do it probably more violent.

1248
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,370
They were growing it themselves.

1249
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,020
When they growing it themselves.

1250
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:03,021
It's says in George Washington's fucking
diaries that he was separating the mail

1251
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,980
from the female plant.

1252
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,060
It's very clear that he says he was
separating the mail from the female plant

1253
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,340
for people don't know when
you're growing marijuana,

1254
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:14,940
you've got to separate the mail from the
female plant so that the female grows

1255
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,130
the buds and that that
becomes psychedelic.

1256
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,420
That's how you make it.

1257
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,500
So you'd get high from it.

1258
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,740
Right.

1259
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,950
So George Washington is essentially
saying he likes to get high,

1260
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,730
right.

1261
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,210
And he said,

1262
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:24,481
oops,

1263
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:25,171
a little too late.

1264
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:26,490
So he's a fucking stoner.

1265
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,950
He separated them too late.

1266
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,311
I mean,

1267
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,420
what did you have to do back then?

1268
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,231
I mean,

1269
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,840
how many different things that you have
going on with George Washington was a

1270
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:34,980
fucking stoner dude?

1271
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,980
Almost a hundred percent
God bless for sure.

1272
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:38,814
They grew it.

1273
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,631
And by the way,

1274
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:40,970
they grew hemp and they,

1275
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:41,281
they,

1276
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:41,581
you know,

1277
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:44,340
they grew hamping cause they used it
for a lot of things outside of the

1278
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:45,480
psychoactive effects.

1279
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,400
They used it for all
sorts of different things.

1280
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:48,420
And there's all these different,

1281
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,280
this is all z d different passages.

1282
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:51,900
People smoking on their hemp pipe.

1283
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:55,560
It's written in so many different people's
diaries and George Washington said

1284
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:58,320
that he did mean his slaves
were separating it forum.

1285
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:58,740
Right.

1286
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,400
Probably.

1287
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,750
But it definitely did.

1288
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:01,520
George have slavery.

1289
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,490
You must've had of course.

1290
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:03,150
Right?

1291
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,660
They all did.

1292
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:03,991
Yeah.

1293
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:04,471
They all did.

1294
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:04,770
Right.

1295
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,603
So hot right then.

1296
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,361
It was,

1297
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:06,510
yeah,

1298
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,261
it's a different time,

1299
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:07,531
Brian.

1300
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,221
It's a different time.

1301
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,054
He was a good man.

1302
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,660
Um,

1303
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,091
but the,

1304
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:10,681
the point is,

1305
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:10,921
man,

1306
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:11,281
that these,

1307
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:13,680
these fucking people that
are in the positions of,

1308
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,071
you know,

1309
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:16,110
wanting to be at the helm of this monster,

1310
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:16,681
you know,

1311
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:17,030
it's like,

1312
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,340
man,

1313
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,120
what a shitbag group of people
we have to choose from getting,

1314
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,023
what do you expect?

1315
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,371
You know,

1316
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:23,161
what do you expect?

1317
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:24,870
I was go back to one of my great heroes,

1318
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:25,591
George Carlin,

1319
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:26,130
and he's like,

1320
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,791
garbage in,

1321
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:27,570
garbage out.

1322
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:27,930
Yeah.

1323
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,010
What do you expect from this system now
you can argue where these people came

1324
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:32,341
from,

1325
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:33,980
which is where the scam comes in of,

1326
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,950
of the entire election.

1327
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:35,741
I mean,

1328
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:35,990
where do

1329
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,030
these people come from?

1330
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:37,481
Seriously?

1331
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:37,721
You look at,

1332
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:38,160
he's like,

1333
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,500
I don't know.

1334
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,540
I don't remember that guy that did.

1335
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,383
I don't remember

1336
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,830
one Iowa.

1337
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:42,790
They found out that he won.

1338
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,750
He beat Mitt Romney,

1339
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:46,210
the crazy religious dude Santorum.

1340
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,840
I was.

1341
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,111
Right,

1342
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:47,321
right,

1343
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:47,740
right.

1344
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:47,951
Oh,

1345
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,784
he's alone.

1346
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,960
He's a fucking,

1347
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,580
he's a,

1348
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:50,950
uh,

1349
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,783
he's a good one.

1350
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,400
He's full helm.

1351
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,031
Jesus.

1352
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:55,420
He's,

1353
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,320
he's Jesus.

1354
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,300
Like Leonardo Dicaprio in titanic.

1355
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,420
He's at the front of the Jesus
ship with his arms up in the air.

1356
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,890
This guy's a,

1357
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,360
yeah,

1358
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,210
no abortion.

1359
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,021
No nothing.

1360
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:06,490
Sue Super Jesus.

1361
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,510
He's pushing it hard,

1362
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,810
but an amazing group of humans
we have trying to be at the helm.

1363
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,540
Michele Bachmann and
a gay husband to this.

1364
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,291
If it's really good.

1365
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,700
It's a Goddamn Coen brothers movie.

1366
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,070
We're living in a Coen brothers
movie and a real good one.

1367
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,690
No satirical one at that.

1368
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,330
Yeah.

1369
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:24,400
It's a big football game and it's sad to
me to see how you can't watch the news

1370
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:27,490
at that than covering this as though
it's relevant or important to anything.

1371
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,270
There's no any decision processes that
these people will have the power to take

1372
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:36,271
hold of will actually accomplish anything
when it's obvious from our last great

1373
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,500
hope Obama,

1374
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,170
that big business isn't going anywhere.

1375
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,031
Yeah,

1376
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:42,190
I,

1377
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,330
it doesn't matter who's in Pa,

1378
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,500
even Ron Paul,

1379
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,270
if he was magically to be swept in with
bulletproof vest on and everything else,

1380
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,100
you'll see some dramatic shifts in his
policy the moment he comes in because he

1381
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:54,820
knows,

1382
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,680
he knows what's actually possible in that
environment before the shitstorm hits

1383
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:00,640
them from all sides,

1384
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,520
all the examples of what
they did to Ralph Nader.

1385
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:04,920
You know with the
prostitution thing on it.

1386
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,370
Remember that the car company,

1387
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,170
there was a basically a car company set
up Ralph Nader and in a hotel room with

1388
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:14,710
a prostitute and then documented it
cause he was doing all this publicity

1389
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,700
against this car company.

1390
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,920
How unsafe they're there.

1391
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,250
They're cutting costs
on their car production.

1392
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,000
He found out very
discreetly how bad it was.

1393
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:26,200
People were dying and they'd try to set
them up and to make them look bad with

1394
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:28,000
this prostitute was incredible.

1395
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,250
That's just the tip of the iceberg of
all sorts of games that are played.

1396
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:32,950
You can go straight down the whole
political spectrum and looked at all the

1397
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:34,210
things that seem random,

1398
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:35,410
the wind ski and all these things.

1399
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,491
There's a,

1400
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:38,650
there's a subtle orchestration
happening to that.

1401
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,420
Not to be conspiratorially oriented,

1402
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:41,590
but that's just the way it is.

1403
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,540
You don't mess around.

1404
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,920
It's a mafia system.

1405
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,040
I want to know where to get casting for
that cause I would love to be a part of

1406
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:48,790
the next one.

1407
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,090
You know,

1408
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,860
like I'm found in Obama's locker room

1409
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,980
and I can't walk and

1410
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,330
well they must hire it through craigslist.

1411
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,100
I mean at this point in time they can
easily pay someone to just fuck up your

1412
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:02,810
life.

1413
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,061
You know,

1414
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:07,380
pay someone like this is
your job be $250,000 your
job is to seduce that guy and

1415
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,700
go and get it into his life.

1416
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:09,420
Somehow or another.

1417
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,070
They're called PR agencies.

1418
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,150
Is that what they do?

1419
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,983
Well

1420
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,701
can go both sides.

1421
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:16,440
They can be positive towards you or
they can be hired to be completely black

1422
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:16,641
lifts.

1423
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,690
Do gonna make you look like shit.

1424
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,770
I know that from my own experience of the
weird things that have happened to me,

1425
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,440
which I wonder where the roots
of some of these things are.

1426
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,090
There's people that blog
and anti psychiatry,

1427
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,050
Peter Joseph matters every single day
and follow everything I did like how do

1428
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:33,680
they possibly have time do that

1429
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,710
and it makes me think
they're being paid to do it.

1430
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,010
Maybe I just know of some companies
that were listed to me that do the exact

1431
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,340
same thing to other people and you
don't see them on the forefront.

1432
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,800
There are these PR firms
that you can use to,

1433
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,910
you've probably seen the ones that you
can go and use to get bad things removed

1434
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:50,990
from your name on the Internet.

1435
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,790
I've heard that on the radio
or something like that.

1436
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,251
So there's,

1437
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,850
there's ones that worked
the other direction.

1438
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,910
The more of a black op kind of way.

1439
00:41:59,580 --> 00:41:59,810
Yeah,

1440
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,770
and they're paid to do so.

1441
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,311
Wow.

1442
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,080
That's really an
important stars right now.

1443
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,600
Really go after porn stars.

1444
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,023
There was a,

1445
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,200
this one person broke into a word.

1446
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,460
They get tested once a month.

1447
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,670
I think I might've talked about this
before in broken and still all the records

1448
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:18,650
from all the porn stars and then put
them online and then that shit got taken

1449
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:21,950
down eventually and it found out
it was just this male porn started.

1450
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:26,951
I did it and then now there's like groups
of people that use all those things

1451
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,060
that were put online and attack every
single porn start online by putting their

1452
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:33,170
information everywhere.

1453
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,690
Oh fuck is with people.

1454
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:36,620
Why would they want to do that?

1455
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,960
I don't know.

1456
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,130
A few different motivations there.

1457
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:42,760
No,

1458
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,420
just so it's a weird thing man
to we're thing that you know,

1459
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,840
people want to hurt other people that
badly self appointed guardians of the

1460
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:51,300
status quo that could be labeled a lot.

1461
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:52,860
I picked up a man named jock fresco.

1462
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,820
These people that they have,

1463
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,600
they're not,

1464
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,420
the only thing they have is
their identity preservation.

1465
00:42:57,421 --> 00:43:01,080
They will fight tooth and nail to make
sure whatever they believe is held true.

1466
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,640
Whether it's political or religious.

1467
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:03,571
I mean I could,

1468
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:06,600
I can't count how many death threats
I got since the first film came out.

1469
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:06,781
Well,

1470
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:08,580
you're quite just
questioning the status quo.

1471
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,080
All they're doing is fucking on camera.

1472
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,190
Why would somebody want to jet harm?

1473
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,631
Well,

1474
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,021
because if,

1475
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:17,190
say some deeply religious individuals
sees a porno or catches this sun with it

1476
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:18,150
or something like that,

1477
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,700
they feel a huge threat
there for whatever purpose.

1478
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,690
You'd be surprised what
motivations people,

1479
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,240
that's the root cause.

1480
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:24,720
The root,

1481
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,110
the root issue is how fucking dumb
people are and what a giant percentage of

1482
00:43:28,111 --> 00:43:30,270
them are just so off the
tracks and in the woods,

1483
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,600
misinformed a condition.

1484
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,520
How do you turn those folks around?

1485
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,670
Cause I think you can't really have this
next level society until you get those

1486
00:43:38,671 --> 00:43:39,860
folks to uh,

1487
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,040
on track.

1488
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,890
Look if that's one of the things
about living in a nice neighborhood.

1489
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,390
If you live in a nice neighborhood,

1490
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:45,721
you know,

1491
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:48,060
there's generally a lot
less financial strife.

1492
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,950
So people are a little bit more calm.

1493
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,281
You know,

1494
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:52,530
it's one of the things that people
don't like about living in neighborhoods

1495
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:53,364
where people are poor.

1496
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,240
You know,

1497
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,790
there's a lot of tension and
sometimes shit goes down.

1498
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:57,500
Sure.

1499
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:57,750
Well,

1500
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,960
you got to get everybody
to the level of no tension,

1501
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,000
you know,

1502
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,340
in order to have a,

1503
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,620
a beautiful society.

1504
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,940
How the hell do you do that?

1505
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,380
As you pointed out earlier,

1506
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:08,400
you start with the kids,

1507
00:44:08,401 --> 00:44:08,791
you make,

1508
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:09,000
uh,

1509
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,510
there's,

1510
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,250
there's a deeply religious,

1511
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,450
uh,

1512
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:16,030
anti structure thing going on in the
world where everyone thinks they can just

1513
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:16,960
keep having kids.

1514
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:18,760
And it doesn't matter what
the resources of the planet,

1515
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,480
you know,

1516
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:19,950
it's,

1517
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,770
it doesn't matter that no.

1518
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:20,930
Dot.

1519
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,870
Don't you dare tell them
how to raise their kids,

1520
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:24,100
forget any kind of instruction.

1521
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:24,390
You know,

1522
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,240
that he kids,

1523
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,070
people have natural pre-programming.

1524
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,750
It's pretty obvious what the men did.

1525
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,060
You Watch that guy's
moving forward a whole,

1526
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,240
and that's the very beginning.

1527
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,460
I was like us moving forward on the
development of kids now it little small

1528
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,410
nuances can mess them up
for the rest of their lives.

1529
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,730
Whether it's goes to drug addiction,

1530
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:42,540
whether it goes to mental disorders or
even physical disorders and no attention

1531
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:43,141
has been put on there.

1532
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:47,220
If there's anything that I would like
to see put in the public educational

1533
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,181
fountain,

1534
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:50,640
it would be how to really
think about your kids,

1535
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,750
how important it is,

1536
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:54,810
how the earliest things that happened
to them all fucked them up the rest of

1537
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:55,291
their lives.

1538
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,430
If they're not carefully,

1539
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,300
carefully collard or carefully
orchestrated Lawan vulnerability.

1540
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,850
We're not talking about like holding
kids down and making them do things in a

1541
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:03,684
structured way.

1542
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,230
It's allowing the vulnerability of this
natural organism to come to fruition.

1543
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:07,651
A Horse,

1544
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:08,101
for example,

1545
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:10,640
falls right out of the
horse that Boren faltered.

1546
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,550
They can walk boom,

1547
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,500
humans because of evolution,

1548
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:14,910
they come out way too early.

1549
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,110
So the susceptibility of the,

1550
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:16,800
of the,

1551
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,130
the infant is so massive
and so misunderstood.

1552
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:23,820
Up until now that people have done things
to their kids that have really fucked

1553
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,700
them up for their whole lives at the
infancy stage because of how much

1554
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:28,560
developmental requirements are actually,

1555
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:28,711
they're,

1556
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:29,790
the protections are gone.

1557
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,430
So it's a huge topic and there's
a lot of people I could list,

1558
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,550
uh,

1559
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:34,050
that can,

1560
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,150
that can describe those issues in tax.

1561
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:36,841
The got him gathered.

1562
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:37,950
Mateo has a really good one.

1563
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,700
So what is the best case scenario?

1564
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:43,540
It was the best case scenario that the
[inaudible] movement takes place after

1565
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:48,541
some sort of a collapse and we develop
a new society that's based on using of

1566
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:52,300
natural resources universally
and across the board,

1567
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:54,950
and there's no hierarchy
of citizenship and,

1568
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,430
and then the people are on the outside.

1569
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:57,851
What do we do?

1570
00:45:57,851 --> 00:45:58,720
We fight them off.

1571
00:45:59,340 --> 00:45:59,581
Well,

1572
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,710
you would want to hope
it's hard to put join.

1573
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:06,480
You'd want to hope that whatever the
cataclysmic may manifest itself to be,

1574
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:07,350
that's pending,

1575
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,510
that those on the sidelines,

1576
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:11,700
that barbarians at the gate
as they might have been,

1577
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,970
would eventually turn it around to
see the folly of their ways as well.

1578
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,511
You know,

1579
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:16,350
it's hard to predict.

1580
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,300
It's like I smooth.

1581
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,170
It was really a movement
of logic and reason.

1582
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:19,381
It's like,

1583
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:19,591
okay,

1584
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:19,810
here's,

1585
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:20,011
we have,

1586
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,450
we have technological automation.

1587
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,410
You know what?

1588
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,810
People are being replaced by automation.

1589
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,121
In fact,

1590
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:26,340
the great driver of
unemployment now is automation.

1591
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,203
They won't admit it.

1592
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,230
Most economists will not,

1593
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,990
a few are coming out now in the medium
that you can go back to the Roosevelt

1594
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:31,561
administration.

1595
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:36,000
They actually wanted to have a stop
on technological invention during the

1596
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,480
industrial revolution because of how
fast people were being replaced by

1597
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:40,314
machines.

1598
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:44,100
And that is the core driver of all
unemployment you see in the world today

1599
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,330
period.

1600
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,111
So what does that mean?

1601
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:46,950
What is the logic say?

1602
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,540
Well we can produce more with less.

1603
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,960
We don't need people to slave over
some shitty factory job anymore.

1604
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,030
We automated no vacations,

1605
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:54,450
higher,

1606
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,590
much higher degree of accuracy.

1607
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:56,550
Machines can do things.

1608
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,480
There's all sorts of a modular machines
now that can do things like scientific

1609
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:01,290
research,

1610
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,000
extremely specific things,

1611
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,320
thinking machines,

1612
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,740
people like Ray Kurzweil and all this
massive evolution I could ramble on for a

1613
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,400
long time.

1614
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,750
What does that mean for Human Labor?

1615
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,290
Do we keep human labor as a requirement
to live your right to life is to get

1616
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,360
income or do you create
a new system that says,

1617
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:16,080
okay,

1618
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,090
let's go full forward
with machine automation,

1619
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:22,800
all sectors possible and fill in the
gaps with whomever is willing to do so.

1620
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,940
And I think the abundance produced
when enable US society to exist without

1621
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,470
people needing money
every minute of the day.

1622
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,160
What happens

1623
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,290
to all those people that were
working on those assembly jobs?

1624
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,780
Well,

1625
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,050
they at this stage they wouldn't
know what the fuck to do,

1626
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:35,620
right?

1627
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,180
But if you evolve it out,

1628
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:38,980
if you really think about
this for long periods of time,

1629
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,470
you get the problem we're going
to have to face eventually.

1630
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,780
Well face it now tell until later,

1631
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:45,490
until you see someone in power say,

1632
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:45,791
okay,

1633
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:49,660
we're going to start to
automate and basically do a
form of socialization if you

1634
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:49,901
will,

1635
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:53,910
giving people free food free energy in
order to supplement them for their law,

1636
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,300
their lack of purchasing power,

1637
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:58,300
which is what's happening and tell
someone starts to do that in government or

1638
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,410
having the workday.

1639
00:47:59,650 --> 00:47:59,831
Like,

1640
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:02,560
if Obama was smart and good Bunch
of Roosevelt administration,

1641
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,340
they would have put in uh,

1642
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,610
a mandate or whatever
you'd want to call it,

1643
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:10,450
where the corporations received some
type of subsidy where they would have the

1644
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,420
work day and they would hire twice the
amount of people for that corporation,

1645
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,880
giving them the sustenance income.

1646
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,110
The that would be,

1647
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,970
that would be applicable would
be probably a little bit reduced.

1648
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:19,960
But what else do you do?

1649
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,750
They're not going to do that
because the core motivations,

1650
00:48:21,751 --> 00:48:22,584
so against it,

1651
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,730
corporations responsibilities
to the shareholders.

1652
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,530
Shareholders don't want
to see anything like that.

1653
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,020
What happens when someone lays a whole
bunch of employees and stock market and

1654
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:29,854
the stock goes up?

1655
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,510
Remember it's just sick.

1656
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:32,321
The whole things backwards.

1657
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,690
So back to my point and tell automation,

1658
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,553
uh,

1659
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,740
no one's going to stop automation
cause it's a profit driven thing.

1660
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,320
It costs less money to automate
than it does to use people.

1661
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:44,080
And that's what you call the
contradiction of capitalism.

1662
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:45,280
And the words of Karl Marx,

1663
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:46,114
believe it or not,

1664
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,440
he recognizes this logo and all you
have is this thing collaging together.

1665
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:51,940
That is unreconcilable.

1666
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,520
And tell a new social system
system is put in place,

1667
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,040
what do you think is going to
happen with the current system?

1668
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,600
How much time do you think we have before?

1669
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,340
It's just chaos in the streets and I mean,

1670
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:02,530
it's already chaos and most
of the world in pockets,

1671
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:03,364
I think,

1672
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,450
I think 2012 was in,

1673
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:05,560
it'd be prophecy side,

1674
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,170
I think 2012 and be a
very interesting year.

1675
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,290
It's amazing that things
have accelerated this far,

1676
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,930
this close to 2012 when
you look at it from a,

1677
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,430
the standpoint,

1678
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:15,700
sure,

1679
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,010
everybody thinks well,

1680
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,340
it's like the boy who cried wolf.

1681
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:21,820
It's like at a certain point in time like
y two K and this and that and you know

1682
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:23,860
the fucking Pleiades and where's Nibiru?

1683
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,360
And at a certain point in time like,

1684
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:25,571
ah,

1685
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:25,841
right,

1686
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,140
well you're fucking apocalypse talk,

1687
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:27,974
stop it.

1688
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,270
But then as you get closer and
closer to 2012 you're like,

1689
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:32,104
man,

1690
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:32,381
you know,

1691
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:33,950
maybe the Mayans were on assumption.

1692
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,220
Well,

1693
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,051
I doubt that.

1694
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:35,570
But uh,

1695
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:35,740
what,

1696
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,550
what does scare me is
the self feeling shit.

1697
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,610
And then people are gonna be jumping out
of windows and shooting things up and

1698
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:45,280
all the ones that have convinced
themselves if some diluted idea,

1699
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,410
that's going to be very interesting.

1700
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:47,650
Well,

1701
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,010
the other,

1702
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:48,380
oh,

1703
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,130
the other thing is like no one is saying
it's going to be the end of the world.

1704
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,460
It's just the end of this
calendar could be a new era.

1705
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:55,510
That's awesome.

1706
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,410
You know,

1707
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,580
it very easily could it,

1708
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,630
my personal analysis,

1709
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:01,300
the end of the Mayan calendar
is the end of the age of Pisces.

1710
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,223
That's it.

1711
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,490
That's the great year.

1712
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,890
Starts again with the age of
Aquarius is too hard to predict.

1713
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,260
You have like a 1500 to 3000 year buffer.

1714
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:12,220
It's 2020 6,000 year cycle in
the procession of the equinoxes.

1715
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,140
And that's what I think it is.

1716
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,040
Um,

1717
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,491
but whatever,

1718
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:16,680
I don't pay attention to those things,

1719
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,593
but as far as,

1720
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,450
I don't pay attention to it,

1721
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:23,290
but I do pay attention to the fact that
so many people pay attention to it.

1722
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:23,561
Well,

1723
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:24,010
of course,

1724
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:24,240
you know,

1725
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,050
I'm fascinated by astrology.

1726
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,110
I don't know if I,

1727
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:27,441
I'm,

1728
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:31,400
I'm a believer in it 100% but I
think it's amazing that they can,

1729
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:31,970
you know,

1730
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,840
halfway nailed down personalities and
different traits when they're really good

1731
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:36,141
at it.

1732
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:37,310
And we could argue on that one.

1733
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,260
The power of suggestion is a,

1734
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,450
is quite phenomenal in the world today.

1735
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:42,081
You'd be amazed.

1736
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,500
And then as far as like structuring
questions as far as structuring,

1737
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:45,890
leading people into,

1738
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,251
yeah,

1739
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:46,911
I've seen that.

1740
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,320
I've seen like psychic stuff,

1741
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,550
people do shit like that,

1742
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:50,810
but I'm not even talking about that.

1743
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:53,570
I'm talking about like somebody giving
you a date and some of those real

1744
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:56,130
astrologists they want to know
like what time you were born.

1745
00:50:56,131 --> 00:50:57,440
And I don't know if it's real,

1746
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,800
but it's amazing that it's
been around so long it,

1747
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,160
I do not know if it's real,

1748
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,910
but it's amazing that at one point in
time someone actually dedicated enough

1749
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:09,911
time to writing down some sort of a system
to figure out which different things

1750
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,930
that are in line when you're
born in the [inaudible].

1751
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,300
It's kind of amazing really.

1752
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,500
I think it's beautiful.

1753
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,910
Beautiful from the standpoint,

1754
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:19,010
a cultural standpoint to find
your place in the universe.

1755
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:19,791
Think other people are doing,

1756
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:20,630
they're looking at the sky,

1757
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:23,930
it looks flat and two d they
think about associations.

1758
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:25,490
They want to feel like
they're connected to it.

1759
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:26,660
The whole definition of God,

1760
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:27,920
and if you go back to my first film,

1761
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,360
most natural phenomenon,

1762
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:30,860
stellar cults originated,

1763
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,230
merged into the Islam.

1764
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,110
Judeo Christian Islamic religion by
symbolism just became his historize

1765
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:38,993
basically.

1766
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:39,980
But you know,

1767
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,960
the beauty of it is that people
are trying to relate to something.

1768
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,823
That's what I see.

1769
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,300
But they still thought the sky was flat,

1770
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:44,851
right?

1771
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,340
So the constellations don't even exist.

1772
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,750
They don't actually know actually there.

1773
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,430
They just looked that way.

1774
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,060
You know,

1775
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:50,601
they thought,

1776
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:51,230
who was,

1777
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,460
they thought this guy was flat.

1778
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:52,941
Well,

1779
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:53,810
if you look at the sky,

1780
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,600
it looks perfectly flat
and the constellations and
the depictions are actually

1781
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:57,320
flat.

1782
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,153
That's how they're important.

1783
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,940
That's why they have a little
animal things and things like that.

1784
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,300
And the Sun rising.

1785
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:02,930
Let's say there's summer solstice,

1786
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,510
I believe that's the birth note
or most the spring equinox,

1787
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,344
you can't remember.

1788
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,500
It's a completely to Di Prima Fascia
is surface flatland view and it doesn't

1789
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:15,950
hold any actual validity because they
had no idea that it was actually the

1790
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:16,300
depth.

1791
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,870
You know the depth of the stars and their,

1792
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:19,190
their radiants is so far away,

1793
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:20,390
they're burning out there changing.

1794
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:21,050
There's morphine,

1795
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,883
there's expansion.

1796
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,180
So you know,

1797
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,070
so they just looked at it as like almost
like a picture of flat two dimensional

1798
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:30,020
picture stance is going to fall down.

1799
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,270
It's amazing that they did
that for so long though.

1800
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:34,010
They really studied the constellations.

1801
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:35,570
I guess that's a beautiful art form.

1802
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,800
It's a beautiful concept

1803
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,503
that's outside.

1804
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,670
Where's that outside?

1805
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:41,930
Who?

1806
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:42,380
Who,

1807
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,710
who's the mother beating?

1808
00:52:43,711 --> 00:52:44,544
Nice kid.

1809
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,413
Her Kid.

1810
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,580
Lovely Pasadena culture.

1811
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,660
Well this is the only thing that's the
worst you have to worry about Pasadena.

1812
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:51,330
You know,

1813
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,163
this is not like,

1814
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,390
you know what's funny
is jungles of Africa.

1815
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,480
I know this girl that I was a stripper
a long time ago and she found out about

1816
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:02,130
you from the green room of a strip club.

1817
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:04,770
There was a hairdryer
hair designer that was,

1818
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,080
he was a gay guy that was
in love with your shit.

1819
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:11,010
And so he used to tag you throughout San
Francisco and in this green room of a

1820
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:11,830
strip club,

1821
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,191
your,

1822
00:53:12,191 --> 00:53:13,250
your tag is all over.

1823
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,000
He just tagged the fuck
out of this green room.

1824
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,600
That's how she found out about it.

1825
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:21,570
And then she got so moved by your movie
that she started posting flyers around

1826
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:22,500
San Francisco,

1827
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:22,951
uh,

1828
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:25,890
to promote your movie because
she was so moved by her.

1829
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,130
That

1830
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,710
was what it was so phenomenal on the,

1831
00:53:27,711 --> 00:53:27,870
uh,

1832
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,703
the original owner.

1833
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,720
It still persists to this day on its own.

1834
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,820
I did know publicity
for any of these things.

1835
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:34,020
It's always been self driven.

1836
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:34,501
It somehow,

1837
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:39,180
it seemed to tap into some element of
people that they appreciate it and felt

1838
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:41,070
the need to re communicate
to other people,

1839
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,110
which is inadvertent to me.

1840
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:44,490
I certainly didn't anticipate that,

1841
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:45,030
but yeah,

1842
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,211
it was,

1843
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:46,080
it blown your mind.

1844
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:46,501
Well,

1845
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:46,980
I get these,

1846
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,930
I get these marketing calls occasionally
or emails from these marketing jackass

1847
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:51,151
is like,

1848
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:51,984
how did you do that?

1849
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,500
What kind of,

1850
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,050
what kind of algorithms are
you using in your viral media?

1851
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:56,760
Like it's just word of mouth,

1852
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:57,270
man.

1853
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,200
That's hilarious.

1854
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,040
Yeah.

1855
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,671
Highly envy.

1856
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,010
The film series is a highly
envied by a lot of people.

1857
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:02,490
They're trying to,

1858
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,300
there's a lot of films trying to duplicate
the idea to duplicate the concept and

1859
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:08,860
build kind of a farce community out of it.

1860
00:54:08,861 --> 00:54:10,860
And the same way that was
natural to the movement.

1861
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:11,551
So,

1862
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:12,060
but anyway,

1863
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,893
what do you expect?

1864
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:13,980
It's amazing.

1865
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,350
Everyone assumes dollar signs and
there's a lot of people around.

1866
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:16,941
Yeah,

1867
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:17,500
of course.

1868
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,470
Well there's um,

1869
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:23,530
there's always been someone at the helm
of something at different points in

1870
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:24,501
time,

1871
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:24,711
you know,

1872
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:25,550
different cultures,

1873
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:26,361
different religions,

1874
00:54:26,361 --> 00:54:27,080
different,

1875
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,470
you know,

1876
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:27,861
different,

1877
00:54:27,861 --> 00:54:30,860
different kingdoms has always
been someone with a new idea.

1878
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:35,660
And I think everybody's sort of recognizes
that this thing is falling apart.

1879
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:36,910
No one's buying anymore.

1880
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,840
And a new things going to come along,

1881
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:39,200
man.

1882
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,760
And we've got to jump on it.

1883
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,170
We're going to jump on it because this is,

1884
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:43,670
this really is the future because this,

1885
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:45,710
this dying animal that you see this,

1886
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,190
this fucking elephant and
donkey system is stupid.

1887
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:49,911
It's stupid.

1888
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,770
And everybody recognizes
it's destroying us.

1889
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:52,791
Just look around.

1890
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:56,210
It's destroying the fabric of almost
everything that you see around you.

1891
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:58,340
You have every life
support systems in decline.

1892
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,890
Our psychology is really fucked up.

1893
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:02,750
And if he's taken a look around
what coach was doing today,

1894
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,610
I mean the public health
issue is bad enough.

1895
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:06,560
I'm just waiting for
the tipping point where,

1896
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:07,394
where uh,

1897
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,250
the lifespan starts to tip cause I
think it's just a matter of time.

1898
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,810
I have a friend that has a 10 year old
and she has her 10 year is in school and

1899
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,260
uh,

1900
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:15,561
you know,

1901
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:19,850
he's an active kid and the
psychologist or psychiatrist,

1902
00:55:19,851 --> 00:55:20,960
I guess it would be for school,

1903
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,870
is trying to give the
kid trucks and he says,

1904
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,250
well he's a good kid.

1905
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:25,880
He's not,

1906
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,510
he's not a,

1907
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:30,140
he just gets bored in class and he acts
up a little bit but he doesn't need to

1908
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:30,974
be drugged.

1909
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,551
And she goes,

1910
00:55:31,551 --> 00:55:32,301
you're so easy.

1911
00:55:32,301 --> 00:55:33,710
You're so quick to drug them.

1912
00:55:33,711 --> 00:55:35,960
Like how many kids in his classes are,

1913
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:36,291
are,

1914
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:36,561
are,

1915
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:37,430
are on drugs.

1916
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,061
And he says,

1917
00:55:38,061 --> 00:55:41,960
well I am not an liberty to give
that it's confidential information,

1918
00:55:41,961 --> 00:55:43,430
but let me tell you it's
somewhere near half.

1919
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:46,280
So I don't know why the
fuck he would say that.

1920
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:47,300
He's not at liberty.

1921
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,200
So,

1922
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,921
and then she goes,

1923
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:49,371
wait a minute,

1924
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,050
a half,

1925
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:51,200
half.

1926
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,460
Do you know you think half of the kids
in school have a mental problem to the

1927
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:56,960
point where they need drugs?

1928
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,520
Wow,

1929
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,750
that's amazing.

1930
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,350
That is amazing that there's someone
out there that is a professional that's

1931
00:56:03,351 --> 00:56:04,430
able to do something like that.

1932
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,920
Now this is a woman
telling me about her child.

1933
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:08,870
I do not know for numbers were correct.

1934
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:09,471
You know,

1935
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,861
I mean she,

1936
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:10,700
she might've just,

1937
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,060
I don't see she's adding
marijuana on a dummy though.

1938
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,960
She's not a dummy,

1939
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:15,291
you know?

1940
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:15,681
And she was,

1941
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:18,500
she was telling me this and it made a
whole lot of sense to me and I was like,

1942
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,630
that is amazing that they're just,

1943
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,800
they're so willing to drug
people and that's a of sickness.

1944
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:25,510
Absolutely.

1945
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,440
I mean,

1946
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,850
it's fucking sucks.

1947
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,420
Okay.

1948
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,850
There's a reason why
you kids moving around.

1949
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,693
He's healthy.

1950
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,830
He's healthy as brainworks great creative.

1951
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,101
Yeah.

1952
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:33,281
He's,

1953
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:37,270
and he's getting all this input that
blows and he knows he can get out of that

1954
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:40,940
class and play video games and
have laughs with his friends and,

1955
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:42,130
and say hi to girls.

1956
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,270
And that would be awesome,

1957
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:45,490
but right now this sucks and it just,

1958
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:47,470
I can't take the suck any longer.

1959
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:47,921
It's like,

1960
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:51,250
it's like you're telling me that the
only way to learn is to be board into a

1961
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:56,251
fucking coma and just accept this really
low frequency of memorizing shit that

1962
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:58,540
some other asshole
figured out and so that's,

1963
00:56:58,541 --> 00:56:58,841
that's,

1964
00:56:58,841 --> 00:56:59,211
that's it.

1965
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,460
That's what school is every day.

1966
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:03,390
Just pounding it into you that the only
way to get through this is you're going

1967
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:07,000
to have to hate it when
meanwhile everything else you
get good at every game you

1968
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:07,810
get good at,

1969
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,490
you get good at because you love it.

1970
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,121
You know,

1971
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:12,220
and get good at video
games because they're fun.

1972
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,660
When you get to be a bad asset,

1973
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:14,181
a video game,

1974
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,011
it's because that video games.

1975
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:15,820
Awesome.

1976
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,290
Why do you guys get good at basketball?

1977
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:19,180
Because it's fun to be good at basketball.

1978
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,440
When you hit that three pointer,

1979
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,610
it's fucking fun.

1980
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,260
Everything else that you get good at,

1981
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:26,740
it's fun except the shit that
you have to deal with in school.

1982
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,240
Unmotivated people,

1983
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:32,410
they're underpaid and you want to talk
about like the symptom of a sick society.

1984
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,830
The fact that we put so
little emphasis on schools,

1985
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,750
so little emphasis on teaching.

1986
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:39,400
It should be an honor

1987
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,210
fields from the plant to let
guard over people's children.

1988
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:46,511
Man,

1989
00:57:46,511 --> 00:57:48,040
you should be the most honorable,

1990
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:50,260
respectable people available.

1991
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,840
Super Intelligent and super well paid.

1992
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:55,480
We should be paying
teachers fuckloads of money,

1993
00:57:55,481 --> 00:57:55,841
man.

1994
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:56,141
You know,

1995
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:56,974
they should be,

1996
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,440
it should be like a prestigious position.

1997
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:03,220
It should be something that
you like really aspire to
instead of something where

1998
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:04,031
it's a passion,

1999
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:05,650
but you're getting fucked by the system.

2000
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:05,771
We,

2001
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:07,270
you barely have enough money to eat.

2002
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:07,871
You know,

2003
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:10,780
you look at how much a teacher
makes in a public school system,

2004
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:12,430
it's it fucking deplorable.

2005
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,410
It's amazing that it's accepted.

2006
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,390
It's like for whatever reason,

2007
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:18,040
we don't step out of boundaries and,

2008
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,450
and look at it objectively and go,

2009
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:23,650
we've got some core problems and a big
part of it is our children and they

2010
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:28,420
developed to become shitty fucking human
beings against their own intentions.

2011
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,580
It's not like they want to suck out.

2012
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,970
The kids don't want to suck his,

2013
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:34,300
his are just balls of potential

2014
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,070
victims.

2015
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,110
The victims of a system
that really doesn't care.

2016
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:37,963
It doesn't understand,

2017
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,540
doesn't put any resources towards it.

2018
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:43,930
It's like you have so much money to go
to war and you have so little to go to

2019
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:44,530
school.

2020
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:45,311
That's amazing.

2021
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:45,640
Yeah.

2022
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,770
It's amazing that you've worked
out the numbers that way.

2023
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,950
What level of a imposition you
can have is to go to college,

2024
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:53,080
get $80,000 worth of
debt and then guess what?

2025
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:55,660
You ripe to be enslaved and
some hideous corporate estate

2026
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:58,770
you just hoping you can
afford a Lexus next year.

2027
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,330
You know,

2028
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,550
every day just live in a slave.

2029
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,010
But back to the drug issue just
preps kids now so they can,

2030
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,800
when they get to be adults and try to
figure out why they're so miserable,

2031
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:09,970
why they hate their job,

2032
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:11,650
while they have no
contribution to society,

2033
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:14,440
why they don't have any
artistic energy anymore.

2034
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:17,530
Well that's perfect cause then you can
give them the PROZAC and give them all

2035
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:22,250
the other drugs that will nullify them
to make them adhere to this process.

2036
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,230
Yeah.

2037
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,280
Poor little guys.

2038
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,130
So if you analyze all that
and use statistical view,

2039
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:31,090
public health from a psychological
and mental health standpoint,

2040
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,140
you look at depression rates,

2041
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:32,901
you look at everything.

2042
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:35,030
Then you look at the environmental
problems you look at,

2043
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,420
you just go straight down the spectrum
of public health to physical health too,

2044
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,580
to environmental health.

2045
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,250
You have one massive drop off.

2046
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,660
It's ridiculous,

2047
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:45,401
and that's,

2048
00:59:45,401 --> 00:59:47,390
that's the data idea with far too often,

2049
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,240
and that's why I think the system
can hold up for that much longer.

2050
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:50,781
I mean,

2051
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:52,490
the cancer rates are
out of control for one.

2052
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:53,480
As a general rule,

2053
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,630
there's more cancer occurring
now than ever before.

2054
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,040
There's too many of us.

2055
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,240
Well,

2056
00:59:59,240 --> 00:59:59,510
no,

2057
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,590
it's not too many of us know.

2058
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:00,861
Nope.

2059
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:01,641
I don't agree with that at all.

2060
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:01,860
That's,

2061
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,770
that's some people intuitively speaking,

2062
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:04,640
you'd want to say that.

2063
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:06,560
I think the board can hold many,

2064
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,800
many more times the number of people
if it was properly structured,

2065
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,950
but we have to also deal with something
different as far as like fuel,

2066
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:13,310
right?

2067
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,150
We can't be,

2068
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,610
we can't be a carbon

2069
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,310
fossil fuel base.

2070
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:19,760
Not Great.

2071
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Paradigm shift is we've been
living off of fossil deposits,

2072
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:24,680
which is one of those
ignorant things possible.

2073
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:27,440
Since we're surrounded by the
movement of energy from the Sun,

2074
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:28,310
new everything else,

2075
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,211
we have these,

2076
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:30,044
uh,

2077
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:30,321
we've,

2078
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:30,860
we've,

2079
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,300
there's no crisis in the energy.

2080
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:33,370
There's no energy problem.

2081
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:35,510
There's only the crisis of
ignorance as I stated before.

2082
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,010
And that's really the big thing.

2083
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:39,110
We have plenty of energy.

2084
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:39,891
So you think,

2085
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:40,280
um,

2086
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:40,451
uh,

2087
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:41,450
ideally,

2088
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,980
especially in southern California,

2089
01:00:42,981 --> 01:00:44,990
we should have like solar domes,

2090
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:45,610
right?

2091
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,071
It should be like,

2092
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:47,540
should be solar.

2093
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:48,000
They're there.

2094
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,440
Well you should.

2095
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:48,681
Well,

2096
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:49,491
if you really want to hear it too,

2097
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:49,591
it,

2098
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:50,870
you should hovering in the sky,

2099
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,733
all solar,

2100
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,341
you just go with it.

2101
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:52,941
You go local,

2102
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,870
you take this block which has plenty of
sun exposure and you apply for the forte

2103
01:00:56,871 --> 01:00:58,010
paints and high,

2104
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,280
high quality advancements and does not,

2105
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,270
it does very little money
going into the research.

2106
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,103
By the way.

2107
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,430
It's hard to get any kind
of funding for those things.

2108
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:09,770
So if you imagine how fast we could
advance with these renewable mediums

2109
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,700
localized,

2110
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:13,220
if we actually put the energy into them,

2111
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,400
you can do the extrapolation on how
far we'd become cause technology just

2112
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:18,350
continues to move beyond our expectations.

2113
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,030
Don't you need batteries though?

2114
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:20,864
For Solar?

2115
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,840
Between super capacitors and and hydrogen,

2116
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:24,740
which is the new idea.

2117
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:28,340
You could store it at these things for
easily overcome the intermittency of

2118
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:30,050
solar easily through battery technology.

2119
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:31,160
The problem with battery technology,

2120
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:31,341
again,

2121
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:32,001
in the market system,

2122
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:32,900
you want constant turnover.

2123
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:33,734
You want scarcity,

2124
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,160
you want people to go back and buy
more batteries because that's what this

2125
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:41,360
entire system and also the
problem minerals to create
the batteries like lithium

2126
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:43,460
ion and they get to go for hydrogen.

2127
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,030
But uh,

2128
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:48,620
now I think hydrogen batteries
or hydrogen storage storage.

2129
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,260
So this would not be a solar
issue then because you can't,

2130
01:01:51,261 --> 01:01:52,880
usually you bring the solar into it,

2131
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,630
you bring solar power and then
you convert that into hydrogen.

2132
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:56,860
Somehow it's stored.

2133
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:57,860
It's stored in the water,

2134
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,330
stored in the hydrogen.

2135
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:00,590
How's that?

2136
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,900
That's a new technology
that's been internal.

2137
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:04,220
So no need for batteries,

2138
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,310
no needs for better my on nothing,

2139
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,090
no need for the minerals
that they get in the car.

2140
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:12,120
You might have to have some lithium ion
in intermittent sense dependent on how

2141
01:02:12,121 --> 01:02:14,480
the battery is constructed
or but super capacitors,

2142
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,340
which is another concept
which isn't utilized.

2143
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:18,200
You know how you like your
computer as capacitors,

2144
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,034
that store energy,

2145
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,340
a very different technology

2146
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,140
than the standard battery,

2147
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:23,580
which is kind of like a,

2148
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,010
you fill it in there.

2149
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:28,860
There's many different forms and there's
a great deal of advancement there and

2150
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,950
there's really nothing that I can
find that would inhibit storage for an

2151
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:33,960
admitted NSI from solar.

2152
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:35,280
If you really put your mind to it.

2153
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,760
There's to say that would
take some more deep analysis,

2154
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:40,980
but I can't imagine we'd run
out of minerals just for that.

2155
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:41,951
Well,

2156
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:42,290
it's just,

2157
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,050
it's always been ironic to me that the,

2158
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:44,890
the,

2159
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,390
the chain from minerals coming out
of the ground to the super advanced

2160
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:50,224
technology,

2161
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,760
just such a barbaric chain,

2162
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:56,160
and they look down at the people
in no shoes with pick axes,

2163
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,360
pulling the minerals out of the ground,

2164
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,340
the Congo and how that eventually
gets to your apple laptop.

2165
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:00,970
I was like,

2166
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:01,241
wow.

2167
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:02,800
It's pretty fascinating that,

2168
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,000
that that is all,

2169
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,950
I mean that that's a part of the equation.

2170
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:07,870
The part of the equation
for high technology,

2171
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,180
whether it's solar power,

2172
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,500
anything is you need the
minerals from Africa of course,

2173
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,630
and that's how they're
extracting those fucking things

2174
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:14,081
and tell him.

2175
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,240
Molecular engineering comes into play
and we've begin to synthesize these,

2176
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,210
these raw materials from scratch
through molecular engineering,

2177
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:23,330
which is around the corner probably
within the next 50 60 years.

2178
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:24,860
It's already small advancements in that.

2179
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:25,491
See,

2180
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:26,680
the more you just liked,

2181
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,010
that's alchemy.

2182
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:29,620
It is kind of kind of,

2183
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:29,880
yeah,

2184
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,713
sure.

2185
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,840
That's what people had predicted.

2186
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:33,471
Well,

2187
01:03:33,471 --> 01:03:35,630
you remember probably
the old many years ago,

2188
01:03:35,631 --> 01:03:36,560
it was one of the companies,

2189
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:40,400
they spelled their name and little Adams
and they showed it in the magnifying

2190
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:41,390
glass at big feet.

2191
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:45,890
We've come a long way since then and
there's a lot of great futurist ideas out

2192
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:49,520
there that can basically
create replicators for your
home where you're not going

2193
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:51,830
to be like me going to
a store to buy anything.

2194
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:54,050
You're going to be creating
these things in your home.

2195
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,960
And if there's anything that will
destroy the market system quite rapidly,

2196
01:03:56,961 --> 01:03:58,100
it will be advancements like that.

2197
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,450
How do you possibly maintain labor systems
where you can synthesize a laptop in

2198
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:03,200
one swoop,

2199
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,760
download the model from your computer,

2200
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,020
it goes into this vat,

2201
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,873
it's in this,

2202
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,670
this dust,

2203
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:11,240
and then the Milan molecular element
is released just like you print into a

2204
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:12,620
printer or three d printing,

2205
01:04:12,621 --> 01:04:15,650
which I had in my feel moving forward
as a primitive notion of that they can

2206
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,450
print for cars now in one swoop.

2207
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:21,860
There's so much advanced technology out
there that is not known that would solve

2208
01:04:21,861 --> 01:04:23,240
so many problems.

2209
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:23,870
Uh,

2210
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:24,703
it's frustrating.

2211
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:25,580
It's very frustrating.

2212
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:30,320
And the very fact that these efficiencies
are there and not being pushed as fast

2213
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:30,911
as they should be,

2214
01:04:30,911 --> 01:04:31,910
as even more frustrating.

2215
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,080
But you see why?

2216
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:33,441
Why?

2217
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:37,430
Because efficiency is the
enemy of everything that
turns a profit that we want.

2218
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:38,510
We want to serve this everything.

2219
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:39,590
We don't want to solve problems.

2220
01:04:39,591 --> 01:04:42,300
We want people with cancer not
to cure the cancer we want.

2221
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,620
That's an ethic though
that they think about that.

2222
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:45,160
No,

2223
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,300
it's subconscious.

2224
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,660
It's syntax of thought.

2225
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,190
They don't necessarily think that way.

2226
01:04:50,191 --> 01:04:54,030
Just like guys sitting around a room and
the Pentagon start to justify killing

2227
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:55,080
3000 people.

2228
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:58,080
They're not thinking in terms of
being murderers or anything else.

2229
01:04:58,081 --> 01:04:59,550
They're thinking in terms of business.

2230
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,430
So you know,

2231
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:00,870
if you,

2232
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,180
if you want to make a laptop and
you want people to buy it again,

2233
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:06,120
that things die probably three years
from the time you buy it in different

2234
01:05:06,121 --> 01:05:07,190
component problems that will go on.

2235
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:08,340
It doesn't mean it has to know,

2236
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,110
but the turnover is so important.

2237
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,170
Efficient efficiency is
the driver of this system,

2238
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,970
which is why we had
the pollution problems,

2239
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:16,590
the waste problems and
the health problems.

2240
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:19,960
And why did they feed in together and
while you are whole GDP is literally

2241
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:24,130
driven by sickness and
inefficiency and waste.

2242
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,440
That's the,

2243
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,220
if there's anything that blows my mind,

2244
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:28,990
it's how anti economic,

2245
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:31,600
our current system
really is on all levels.

2246
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,040
So if you want to solve problems,

2247
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,260
you want to make a car
that lasts 60 years,

2248
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:36,220
that's easily interchangeable.

2249
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:36,580
That can be,

2250
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:36,851
excuse me,

2251
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:37,241
more than that.

2252
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:38,074
Bailey a hundred years,

2253
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:38,891
easily interchangeable.

2254
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:39,724
They can be updated.

2255
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:42,250
You want to make a smart phone that
has the longest lasting components.

2256
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:43,150
They don't need to throw away.

2257
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,130
These things could be done
if we wanted to do it,

2258
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:49,180
but the be the be an enema to what the
market system requires for constant

2259
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:49,930
turnover,

2260
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:50,890
constant turnover,

2261
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,591
constant money.

2262
01:05:51,591 --> 01:05:53,410
Circulation means more jobs.

2263
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,600
So it's planned obsolescence you think?

2264
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:57,340
Is this like a business model?

2265
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,630
It's planned and intrinsic.

2266
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,400
Another level level is in
transactions that people,

2267
01:06:01,401 --> 01:06:01,790
you know,

2268
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,730
they build things the best
they can and they don't last.

2269
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:05,950
They just break two levels to it.

2270
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,300
Planned obsolescence is very real.

2271
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,790
You can go into historical archives
of car companies to know that they

2272
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,560
strategize.

2273
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,570
I can guarantee you the people behind
apple sit there and their rooms and they

2274
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:16,360
had full on statistics
kind of operating systems.

2275
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,780
Oh you have an operating
system update the software,

2276
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:23,620
the software scan is even worse cause
that's just numb ones and Zeros.

2277
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:26,350
The fact that they even charge over
and over for that more hilarious.

2278
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,110
That's planned obsolescence.

2279
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:31,870
Intrinsic obsolescence is even more
fucked up if you think about it.

2280
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:35,830
That computer for it to be built has to
go through the engine of the industrial

2281
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:36,700
profit complex,

2282
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,870
which means all the components,

2283
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:38,771
the extraction,

2284
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:42,160
everything else someone's taking off
the top throughout the entire thing.

2285
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:42,880
Right.

2286
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,950
And there's cost
efficiency at the very end.

2287
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:46,090
So if you're apple computer,

2288
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,460
you bought a by the components
to make your computer.

2289
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:53,350
You can't buy necessarily the highest
grade level stuff in order to remain

2290
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:56,530
competitive against the other people
that are selling computers similar like

2291
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,640
windows or whatever.

2292
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,750
So you have to constantly be a little
bit behind in order to be competitive so

2293
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,040
you can drop the price.

2294
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:03,731
But there was,

2295
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:07,570
the quality of the product has
to be diminished immediately
for people to afford

2296
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:07,990
it.

2297
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,250
The equation of,

2298
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:14,610
of cost efficiency refuses to allow the
best possible goods to be produced at

2299
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:16,810
any one time period.

2300
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:17,644
It's a rule.

2301
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,210
It's a natural evolution,

2302
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,160
natural and natural dynamic,

2303
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:21,970
if you will,

2304
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,940
of what it means to save
money and to make profit.

2305
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,760
So everything's a piece of
shit the moment it's produced.

2306
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:28,930
Yeah.

2307
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,270
Well that's separate.

2308
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,780
The shit like Ferrari's.

2309
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:33,220
Even a Ferrari though.

2310
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:34,480
Think about the price of a Ferrari though.

2311
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:36,000
That's why it's so expensive part.

2312
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,280
I mean they really make
the best shit they can,

2313
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:40,840
but it's not really the best.

2314
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:41,531
Oh fuck yeah,

2315
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:42,940
it is four or five,

2316
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:43,571
eight Italia.

2317
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:44,404
Have you seen that thing?

2318
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,870
Twin clutch gearbox,

2319
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,660
ridiculously powered VA mid engine.

2320
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:50,980
Supercar come on man.

2321
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:52,840
That's about as good as human
beings have ever created.

2322
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:54,101
It really is.

2323
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:54,221
It's,

2324
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:54,581
it's the,

2325
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:55,840
the peak of engineering,

2326
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:56,350
the there,

2327
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:56,770
you know,

2328
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,350
they use race car driving to,

2329
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,190
to,

2330
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:01,240
to engineer their cars.

2331
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:05,770
They push cars to the limit and every
year they go around the Newburg ring like

2332
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,290
a couple of seconds faster and everybody's
like straining for like the new

2333
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:11,020
Porsche is a seven minutes and 40 seconds.

2334
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:13,060
The new nine 11 and that's
like this is an electric,

2335
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:13,781
no,

2336
01:08:13,781 --> 01:08:14,471
it's not electric,

2337
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:15,140
but they have,

2338
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,040
they have cars that they

2339
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,470
have developed that are electric.

2340
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,800
Porsche has a,

2341
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:19,611
they had a um,

2342
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:24,260
a gt three cup car that they raced
in the 24 hour race that was a,

2343
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,310
that was an electric car.

2344
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,730
They're definitely trying to come
up with electrical technology,

2345
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:31,530
but they're are making the
best cars they can make.

2346
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:31,671
Well,

2347
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:32,211
let's define,

2348
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:35,360
get to like there's certain things
that are being done right now.

2349
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,370
They're at the peak of production.

2350
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,170
Even though they are being produced,

2351
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,950
they're essentially making like some
high end shit that's the best they can

2352
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:43,784
make.

2353
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,400
We could probably argue that one
because if you look at all the advanced

2354
01:08:47,401 --> 01:08:49,530
propulsion technology that's used in NASA,

2355
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,630
why aren't they applying
such things like that?

2356
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,820
You can try to thought not exactly,

2357
01:08:53,821 --> 01:08:56,850
but there are all sorts of things that
could be that are probably more advanced

2358
01:08:56,851 --> 01:08:57,620
than either of us,

2359
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,830
either of us know that could be applied
to that Ferrari but they're not because

2360
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,120
I actually sense of therefore
no one will be able to anyway

2361
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,730
gas that you could get a pump either
you have to work within no skin strains

2362
01:09:06,731 --> 01:09:10,560
cause our gas is actually
really low compared to a,

2363
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,480
like our octane's late [inaudible]
91 in other parts of the country.

2364
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:15,400
I know you can get like 93 or four.

2365
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,120
Sure.

2366
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,580
So I guess it's bad to have more octane.

2367
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,150
But you see my point though,

2368
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,400
you can't make something
really that people can buy it.

2369
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:23,060
But I see what you're saying.

2370
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:23,910
Demograph heart.

2371
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:25,650
It's demographic targeted too.

2372
01:09:25,651 --> 01:09:26,970
So what's the majority,

2373
01:09:26,971 --> 01:09:28,230
what are the majority of people?

2374
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,300
Majority of people are
lower and middle class.

2375
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,960
You make shit that doesn't work very
well so they can afford it and invariably

2376
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,660
it breaks and they suffer
in the end because they have
to deal with the constant

2377
01:09:36,661 --> 01:09:40,470
cyclical turnover and the need to
constantly repair and everything else.

2378
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:44,910
When everything hits the fan
and you start your calls,

2379
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:46,140
what,

2380
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,150
what will everyone do for a job?

2381
01:09:48,151 --> 01:09:49,260
How does everyone get?

2382
01:09:49,261 --> 01:09:50,340
You'll be doing my laundry.

2383
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,110
I'll be doing your laundry.

2384
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,540
I'm not good at laundry done and you're
not going to want me to do your laundry,

2385
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:55,374
right?

2386
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:56,430
Um,

2387
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,080
what did she do?

2388
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59,970
What does everybody get a job?

2389
01:09:59,971 --> 01:10:00,211
I mean,

2390
01:10:00,211 --> 01:10:00,751
what does it become?

2391
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:01,390
Communism.

2392
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:01,591
I mean,

2393
01:10:01,591 --> 01:10:04,140
how do you figure out what
the fuck everybody does to
contribute to this thing?

2394
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:05,071
What if you,

2395
01:10:05,071 --> 01:10:06,750
you know what if you're a lazy cunt,

2396
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,800
how do we deal with Lacey,

2397
01:10:07,801 --> 01:10:08,420
consonant

2398
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:08,630
number,

2399
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:10,430
that lazy concert victims of culture,

2400
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:10,700
right?

2401
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:10,970
And you know,

2402
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:11,250
that's,

2403
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,870
that's the threshold here is where
do we take them on mushroom trips and

2404
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,370
straighten them out who we do?

2405
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:17,610
Well,

2406
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,441
think about it this way.

2407
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:21,170
If you had a kid go into a store and they,

2408
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,060
there's a kid in his mother and the kid,

2409
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:27,170
it's today and the kid goes and grabs
some stuff and shoves it in his pockets.

2410
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:27,651
The mom says,

2411
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:27,861
no,

2412
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:29,780
that's stealing slaps the kid's hand.

2413
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:32,330
The kid learns a valuable lesson
in his values are altered,

2414
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:33,164
right?

2415
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,100
Think about the same type of
idea where we go into a store,

2416
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:36,963
there's no money.

2417
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,150
It's not even a store.

2418
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:38,600
It's a,

2419
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,920
it's a supply house.

2420
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:43,970
And a kid goes in and grabs whole
handfuls of shit that is completely

2421
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:46,520
unnecessary because
there's no utility for it.

2422
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,421
And the mother says,

2423
01:10:47,421 --> 01:10:47,661
no,

2424
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:50,600
that's not what we do because
we don't need all of that.

2425
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:53,540
It has to be there and we'll come back
and get it later as we need it because

2426
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,560
the systems that efficient.

2427
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:58,190
So you see how the value
programming is very easy to adapt.

2428
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,370
So throughout time you'd begin
to change people's values,

2429
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:02,600
how they relate to their environment.

2430
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,370
Imagine if you didn't
have to worry about money,

2431
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:05,204
Joe,

2432
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:09,710
imagine the extent that you could pursue
in your life the interest that you

2433
01:11:09,711 --> 01:11:11,000
found interesting.

2434
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,860
And invariably I guarantee you,

2435
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,010
if you look

2436
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,090
at how people respond,

2437
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:17,730
especially in their later years
when they get more introspective,

2438
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,520
everyone wants to feel like
they're contributing to society.

2439
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,890
Everyone wants to feel like
they've done something social,

2440
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:24,240
so that kind of greed,

2441
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,140
self absorbed share,

2442
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:28,020
that's a very adolescent immature thing
and it's probably there to a certain

2443
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:31,740
effect and the evolution of the
adaptation of the human being as he grows.

2444
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:34,740
But if you have a system doesn't
support or reinforce those issues,

2445
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,970
the then the miserable cock suckers and
dimwits and assholes and jerk off small

2446
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,080
won't materialize.

2447
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:40,620
They need,

2448
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,520
but they're here.

2449
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,150
We need to figure out how to get rid of
them either to get rid of him or to fix

2450
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,140
them and bring them up.

2451
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,290
That's going to be very difficult
because that's a real issue.

2452
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:49,770
It's a real,

2453
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,690
it's super real issue at
the core of everything.

2454
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:52,940
It's an educational problems.

2455
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:53,340
Why Doug?

2456
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:53,791
Stan Hope,

2457
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,440
how to stop doing as
parties in the desert.

2458
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:57,663
It is what it is.

2459
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:58,530
I didn't hear Doug,

2460
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,221
Doug,

2461
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:00,054
Stan hope,

2462
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:04,920
my buddy and a hilarious comedian used
to have these parties in the desert.

2463
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,500
But you would have like,

2464
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:08,010
you know,

2465
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:10,110
anybody could come and
everybody knew about it online.

2466
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:15,170
So you would have like a thousand really
cool people and to just unbearable

2467
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:15,830
Douche.

2468
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:16,650
Sure.

2469
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,990
And the too unbearable
douchebags would make the,

2470
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,940
make the whole party useless.

2471
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,320
And those guys need to be,

2472
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:22,980
you have new,

2473
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,360
you have to figure out
what to do with them.

2474
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:24,781
They,

2475
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:27,270
there's some people out there
that are off fucking mess,

2476
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:30,450
not an issue of having
this beautiful solar dome.

2477
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:32,730
Where y'all all this hippie pussy inside.

2478
01:12:32,731 --> 01:12:33,780
Just line it up for you.

2479
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,020
We're still going to have to deal
with the barbarians at the gates cause

2480
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:38,550
otherwise they liked the,

2481
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:39,630
like the New Orleans,

2482
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,210
it's stormed Egypt and
took over the pyramids.

2483
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,040
They're going to come
in and rush this bitch.

2484
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,360
Well I don't,

2485
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,120
I don't see this materializing
in some isolated place,

2486
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:48,360
uh,

2487
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,640
where the barbarians are
waiting on the sidelines to uh,

2488
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:51,160
there,

2489
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,160
there are people.

2490
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:53,070
Yeah,

2491
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:53,791
the power went out.

2492
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:57,150
Right now there'd be hordes
of our bearings on the
street with hockey sticks and

2493
01:12:57,151 --> 01:13:00,840
guns and whatever the fuck they could
look at whatever the fuck you had.

2494
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:02,470
And that would last for
a little while until,

2495
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:03,930
until someone said,

2496
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,101
yeah,

2497
01:13:04,101 --> 01:13:06,720
you don't have to do that if
we just calm down a moment.

2498
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,330
So the transition can happen.

2499
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:13,320
Even with the people that we have now
that seem to be the creme de la creme,

2500
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:14,610
the victims of this culture,

2501
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,830
it just going to take
a great deal of care.

2502
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,660
And I think as a natural consequences,

2503
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:19,620
the system fails.

2504
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,500
There'll be a great number of people that
will turn around faster than you would

2505
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:22,830
believe.

2506
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,810
Once their needs are
pulled away from them,

2507
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:28,230
they realized that their needs have to
come from some other process or somewhere

2508
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:29,064
else.

2509
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,870
Then the adaptation becomes natural.

2510
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,111
Well,

2511
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:34,710
one of the things about the occupy Wall
Street movement that's fascinated me is

2512
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,440
the idea that all these
people sort of lived together.

2513
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,190
You know,

2514
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:38,730
they don't,

2515
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:39,960
they're not just,

2516
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:40,800
you know,

2517
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,820
protesting together.

2518
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:44,010
They have fucking tents and
they have a community there.

2519
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,380
They have books you could like go to
their little library and read their books.

2520
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:49,500
They have,

2521
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,370
I'm all set up there,

2522
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:51,570
you know that's so,

2523
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:56,340
I mean it's essentially right now it's
not really a commune but it's on its way

2524
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,091
and they could easily,

2525
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:58,050
it's one of those guys said,

2526
01:13:58,051 --> 01:13:58,661
listen man,

2527
01:13:58,661 --> 01:13:59,190
my car,

2528
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:03,210
my cousin has a hundred acres out in
the wilderness and they have fruit trees

2529
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,880
and they have the grow vegetables and
it's animals and we can hide and we can

2530
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:06,840
make a fucking culture.

2531
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:08,160
Let's do this.

2532
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,160
As long as we don't show any
aggression towards the government.

2533
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,360
Certainly been done before,

2534
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,270
but then they shut you down and they go
Waco on your ass and fucking toys the

2535
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,113
building.

2536
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,540
Or if you're a whole nother country,

2537
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:22,600
like the attempts of the Bolshevik
revolution of some something new,

2538
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:24,370
despite what anyone ever
thought of communism,

2539
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:28,570
that was quickly shut down as a
concept by the western powers.

2540
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:30,340
You gotta be totally nonthreatening.

2541
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,580
If you want to start this cult,

2542
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,030
we have to like get a
nice piece of property,

2543
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:36,460
but it's got to be real pretty
and there's no property.

2544
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:36,981
This isn't a,

2545
01:14:36,981 --> 01:14:38,310
this is an evolution of ideas.

2546
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,130
We're not going to,

2547
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,780
we're not going to set up any shit on me,

2548
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,261
man.

2549
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:42,060
You're going to need a car,

2550
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:42,893
a camp.

2551
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,380
Can they get an EAD camp,

2552
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:45,214
Peter?

2553
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:46,793
Right.

2554
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:47,911
Come on man.

2555
01:14:47,911 --> 01:14:48,730
Right,

2556
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:50,390
right outside of Arizona and my Jim,

2557
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,460
Jim Jones glasses.

2558
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:52,570
You don't need glasses,

2559
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:52,781
dude.

2560
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:54,130
You're going to be fine.

2561
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,090
You're really good at this.

2562
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:57,760
You can make it back to
these people and just,

2563
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:03,090
and just run the whole big solar dome
right there from a Sonoma Sonoma's a good

2564
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:04,661
spot.

2565
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:05,494
They're prepared.

2566
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,611
They're accepting it.

2567
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:07,070
They're ready.

2568
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:10,570
They've got the crystals out
there ready to take the vitamin.

2569
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,583
Yeah.

2570
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,030
Led is going to happen,

2571
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:13,271
man.

2572
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:13,481
Do you,

2573
01:15:13,481 --> 01:15:14,314
you think that,

2574
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:14,950
um,

2575
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:18,280
we're going to have a situation where
money is going to lose all of its value,

2576
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:18,980
um,

2577
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:23,980
where it's going to be so bad and the
economy's going to get bankrupts so

2578
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:28,780
inextricably that we're going to be
stuck in a situation where we're like,

2579
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,570
like Russia was at one
point in time or you know,

2580
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,890
where they were waiting on line with
bales of money to buy a loaf of bread.

2581
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:36,341
Well,

2582
01:15:36,341 --> 01:15:36,850
you're already do you see

2583
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:38,410
in the military realization of the police,

2584
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:43,570
you're already seeing the
social destabilization
spread because of the faulty

2585
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,020
economic premise that is creating the
unemployment that is creating the debt

2586
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:52,021
crisis that will invariably highly be
very inhibited by the energy crisis if

2587
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:53,920
massive moves aren't met.

2588
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,060
So the three issues,

2589
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:55,930
as I mentioned before,

2590
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:57,700
is the unemployment crisis.

2591
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,200
And I can expand on that.

2592
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:00,490
Let's think about this for a second.

2593
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,220
If you have technology
replacing human labor,

2594
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:07,630
which is emitted across the board
now mostly by colonists as opposed to

2595
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:08,151
economist,

2596
01:16:08,151 --> 01:16:12,550
because economists market economists are
an extreme denial on this one and many

2597
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:13,384
a debate.

2598
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,460
You replace people,

2599
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:18,430
but you're not just replacing their job
to replacing their ability to purchase

2600
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:22,900
other stuff and circulate the
economy and that that's even worse.

2601
01:16:22,901 --> 01:16:23,150
And it,

2602
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,370
it's farthest extension.

2603
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,400
That means that the entire fuel of
growth is being slowly shut down,

2604
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,980
which means that the system
will lose more and more,

2605
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,730
and the system will eventually just
stifled to a point that it can't operate

2606
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:40,900
anymore apart from common or medial
jobs or problems that might arise.

2607
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:44,130
But there's no way you're
going to continue employing
people on this planet and

2608
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:45,280
numbers that we have in the past.

2609
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,790
It's all downhill from here because the
profit motivation to replace people by

2610
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:51,820
machines is inherent to
the interest to save money.

2611
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:57,030
Mcdonald's has had systems on the shelf
for 20 years now that would replace

2612
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,380
everyone in their kitchen.

2613
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,160
Now they are the front
kiosk systems as well.

2614
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:04,540
They don't do it only because they're
corporate view is to be social and as an

2615
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,460
employer they have a stake in that.

2616
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,350
Even though it's built the contrary
to logic and if you look carefully,

2617
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:10,610
they are automating very,

2618
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:11,241
very slowly.

2619
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:13,040
Just like all the grocery
stores are automating,

2620
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:15,830
you're reducing purchasing power and
there's no way this system's going to

2621
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,664
maintain itself.

2622
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,380
Once that continues and accelerates,

2623
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,780
it's the contradiction of capitalism,

2624
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:23,870
so the idea of human labor
is becoming obsolete.

2625
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:28,900
That in its own right is going to
inspire some serious reflection and some

2626
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,200
massive upheavals.

2627
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:31,190
It's going to be

2628
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,690
calling everybody contribute.

2629
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:35,660
Is it possible that everybody can find
their own unique way to contribute

2630
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:40,661
outside of manufacturing things outside
of working menial jobs outside of fast

2631
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:41,990
food supermarkets,

2632
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:42,830
retail,

2633
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,611
when you remember that,

2634
01:17:43,611 --> 01:17:44,090
uh,

2635
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,020
it's a lot of jobs.

2636
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:50,230
Consumption is twice what it was
now than it was in World War II.

2637
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,670
Advertising as completely
fucking per capita,

2638
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,551
twice per person,

2639
01:17:54,551 --> 01:17:55,360
per person.

2640
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,890
The average person's in America,

2641
01:17:56,891 --> 01:17:59,470
since World War Two consumes
twice the amount of shit,

2642
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:02,620
which obviously means something's askew.

2643
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:03,011
Why?

2644
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:03,551
Why is that?

2645
01:18:03,551 --> 01:18:06,100
Why do we feel the need to have
all this other excess stuff?

2646
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:07,540
Socially speaking?

2647
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,510
If you go to a small tribes that aren't,

2648
01:18:09,511 --> 01:18:10,810
don't have access to television,

2649
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:11,231
they're very,

2650
01:18:11,231 --> 01:18:11,891
very happy with it,

2651
01:18:11,891 --> 01:18:12,860
very minimalistic life.

2652
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:13,320
They don't,

2653
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:17,620
their happiness isn't contingent upon
how they compare themselves to others or

2654
01:18:17,621 --> 01:18:20,290
any type of notion of
value that they live in,

2655
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:23,020
the culture that's been manifest
within the resources around them.

2656
01:18:23,021 --> 01:18:26,500
And they happier than any American
with the multimillion dollar house and

2657
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,220
everything else,

2658
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,630
which is usually an antidepressants.

2659
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,670
So we have as a neuroses
that's been built,

2660
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:34,360
which is fueling all of this industry
that's completely irrelevant basically.

2661
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,370
And the more that happens,

2662
01:18:36,371 --> 01:18:37,900
the more we try to invent new jobs.

2663
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:38,081
You know,

2664
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:38,621
I had one guy,

2665
01:18:38,621 --> 01:18:39,401
economist tell me that,

2666
01:18:39,401 --> 01:18:39,491
oh,

2667
01:18:39,491 --> 01:18:41,350
we're just going to end
up using Facebook money.

2668
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:45,100
Say we'll have everybody on the Internet
doing something with Facebook or some

2669
01:18:45,101 --> 01:18:48,340
other network was somehow they gain
credits and they'll use those credits as

2670
01:18:48,341 --> 01:18:49,540
currency now.

2671
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:49,900
Is that right?

2672
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:50,141
Yeah.

2673
01:18:50,141 --> 01:18:50,441
Something,

2674
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:50,840
I dunno know,

2675
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,160
I was talking about this like a year ago.

2676
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:53,621
Remember this,

2677
01:18:53,621 --> 01:18:54,880
just remember Joe,

2678
01:18:54,881 --> 01:18:59,410
we talked about where the future's
going to be post with your buddy.

2679
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,040
And my point is it wouldn't surprise me
if we reached that point where you have

2680
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:05,640
a whole group of these freaks like
straight out like idiocracy or something

2681
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:10,680
where they're all doing the most
relevant actions are relevant.

2682
01:19:10,681 --> 01:19:11,461
Waste of life,

2683
01:19:11,461 --> 01:19:15,150
waste of the human brain does nothing
to contribute just to maintain the,

2684
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:16,800
the idea of employment.

2685
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,200
So I don't think that's going to happen.

2686
01:19:19,201 --> 01:19:20,310
I think it's going to self destruct.

2687
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:22,690
Once the energy crisis
hits and the debt crisis,

2688
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:24,630
which continues to strangle
hold the entire planet,

2689
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,280
these three things will combine.

2690
01:19:26,281 --> 01:19:27,450
I can't predict the future,

2691
01:19:27,451 --> 01:19:30,180
but I think within a couple of
years you're going to see some very,

2692
01:19:30,181 --> 01:19:32,520
very radical shifts in a lot
of governments on this planet.

2693
01:19:32,521 --> 01:19:33,990
I think a lot of detachment will occur.

2694
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,160
You're going to see an
extension of military invasions.

2695
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,050
They got out of a rock,

2696
01:19:37,051 --> 01:19:39,630
they're going to go into a raw and they
gotta get their energy resources there.

2697
01:19:39,631 --> 01:19:43,440
They've got a secure in the Middle East
for other resources as far as minerals

2698
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:44,970
and gold and other things
that are there too.

2699
01:19:44,971 --> 01:19:45,620
There's a,

2700
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,230
there's a,

2701
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:47,760
the faster collapses,

2702
01:19:47,761 --> 01:19:52,140
the more criminal the meltdown becomes
and that's something too I think people

2703
01:19:52,141 --> 01:19:54,270
should pay attention to and
we haven't even seen shit yet.

2704
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,470
Now that we have time holes.

2705
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:55,891
By the way,

2706
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:56,161
Joe,

2707
01:19:56,161 --> 01:19:58,500
did you see that Pentagon
created some time

2708
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,360
and now they can make it Vince disappear?

2709
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:02,081
Well No.

2710
01:20:02,081 --> 01:20:06,100
First of all you're dealing with like
a nanoseconds you're dealing with right

2711
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:06,371
now.

2712
01:20:06,371 --> 01:20:07,800
This is version one

2713
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,250
and this is only what they're
telling us about they they,

2714
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,510
they could have been having
these time holes for some time.

2715
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:16,430
I think so because essentially the
Pentagon is using guys that are at the

2716
01:20:16,431 --> 01:20:19,250
forefront of science and the
forefront of science is pretty,

2717
01:20:19,251 --> 01:20:20,061
it's published.

2718
01:20:20,061 --> 01:20:21,740
It's pretty much out there.

2719
01:20:21,741 --> 01:20:23,570
Everybody knows pretty much
what everybody is working on.

2720
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:24,201
I mean not,

2721
01:20:24,201 --> 01:20:24,700
and they mean there are,

2722
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,390
there's some definitely
some black op projects,

2723
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:27,240
but uh,

2724
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:27,801
you know,

2725
01:20:27,801 --> 01:20:31,790
these guys is that there's not a whole
lot of these dudes and the way they stay

2726
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:32,900
at this level of,

2727
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:33,341
you know,

2728
01:20:33,341 --> 01:20:37,680
of being a bad superintelligent
motherfucker have to exchange information.

2729
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,140
How far,

2730
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:38,711
how long is it?

2731
01:20:38,711 --> 01:20:39,640
Just a few seconds.

2732
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,590
Like some athletic my
nipple and I'd be like,

2733
01:20:41,591 --> 01:20:42,221
who did this?

2734
01:20:42,221 --> 01:20:42,670
No,

2735
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:43,760
you wouldn't even believe

2736
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:44,530
receive it.

2737
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:45,970
There's no way you'd
be able to perceive it.

2738
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:49,780
But the idea is that this is
just one full 40 pico seconds.

2739
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,040
That's what it is.

2740
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,873
It's what it's,

2741
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,270
the research is admit there's a big
difference between human hiding.

2742
01:20:55,271 --> 01:20:58,240
Laser means 40 picoseconds and
hiding military operations.

2743
01:20:58,241 --> 01:21:00,040
Lasting minutes or even several seconds.

2744
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,450
But the idea is that they've,

2745
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,350
they've started it.

2746
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,010
Wow.

2747
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:03,760
Yeah.

2748
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,810
They started some interesting,

2749
01:21:04,811 --> 01:21:05,261
exciting.

2750
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:06,430
That is really exciting.

2751
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:07,051
You know what,

2752
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:07,331
man,

2753
01:21:07,331 --> 01:21:07,541
it's,

2754
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:07,991
it isn't.

2755
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:08,480
It isn't.

2756
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,880
I mean everything is military.

2757
01:21:09,881 --> 01:21:12,250
It's the Pentagon is the one
that fucking came up with this.

2758
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:13,510
That's the most incredible thing.

2759
01:21:13,511 --> 01:21:17,290
Like when you look at our
capacity for innovation,

2760
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,900
they're the really impressive shit
is all the stuff that blows things.

2761
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:20,800
The fuck up course.

2762
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:21,071
You know,

2763
01:21:21,071 --> 01:21:21,310
look,

2764
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,260
cell phone cameras are really impressive.

2765
01:21:23,261 --> 01:21:25,990
It's really impressive that you can make
a little video and make a movie from

2766
01:21:25,991 --> 01:21:26,620
your phone.

2767
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:26,831
You know?

2768
01:21:26,831 --> 01:21:28,060
It's way more impressive.

2769
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:31,480
You drop a little box out of
a plane and a city evaporates.

2770
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:32,830
That's incredible.

2771
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:33,221
You know?

2772
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:33,851
And what is that?

2773
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:34,451
That's just,

2774
01:21:34,451 --> 01:21:35,030
that's,

2775
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,370
you know,

2776
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,970
that's the peak of our technology,

2777
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:40,150
the peak of our technology and it's the
most impressive as a fucking laser beam

2778
01:21:40,151 --> 01:21:41,290
to cut the earth and half.

2779
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:42,423
You know,

2780
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:43,010
if there's any,

2781
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:44,420
any better proxy,

2782
01:21:44,421 --> 01:21:45,530
I'm not quite sure what is,

2783
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:45,801
you know,

2784
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:49,070
if you look at how much energy and
ingenuity is going into these things,

2785
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:50,990
what if we apply that
idea to feeding people?

2786
01:21:50,991 --> 01:21:53,060
What if we apply that idea
to doing actually relevant

2787
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:56,230
the hard nose folks that
occasionally I agree with.

2788
01:21:56,231 --> 01:21:56,501
Would say,

2789
01:21:56,501 --> 01:21:57,610
we know what these fucks.

2790
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,990
They don't feed themselves.

2791
01:21:58,991 --> 01:22:00,100
This is evolution out there.

2792
01:22:00,101 --> 01:22:01,420
They're supposed to be figuring it out.

2793
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,340
It was supposed to be getting it together,

2794
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,570
which I don't.

2795
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,110
I don't a hundred percent agree with it.

2796
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:09,080
They should pick like a year or something
where like the whole year they're

2797
01:22:09,081 --> 01:22:09,290
like,

2798
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:09,561
all right,

2799
01:22:09,561 --> 01:22:11,990
every scientist you're this year,

2800
01:22:11,991 --> 01:22:12,824
it's cancer.

2801
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:16,760
You have one year and just every single
scientist like devote on something

2802
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:20,640
because scientists have particular
fields that they're scientists.

2803
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:21,501
Yeah,

2804
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:26,501
but you're all scientists see scientisty
nuclear physicists to go after aids.

2805
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:27,681
Well,

2806
01:22:27,681 --> 01:22:29,240
if you think of another example

2807
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:34,730
system so inhibiting through
its competitive mechanisms
that the Prima Fascia

2808
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:34,891
Association,

2809
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:39,090
the assumption is that basically everyone
competing amongst themselves within

2810
01:22:39,091 --> 01:22:41,040
the same sector will
produce better results,

2811
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,560
but that's cognitive leap erroneous.

2812
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:46,020
You want to get people
together to share their ideas,

2813
01:22:46,021 --> 01:22:47,190
not get proprietary.

2814
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:48,330
You want to do it actually,

2815
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:48,601
if what?

2816
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:51,930
They really have the interest to cure or
solve a problem or create something of

2817
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:54,000
the highest efficiency or utility,

2818
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,750
there's no better way to do that than
to get them with that creative drive.

2819
01:22:57,751 --> 01:22:58,584
In one setting.

2820
01:22:58,650 --> 01:22:59,940
So you take all the cell phone companies,

2821
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:00,774
put them together,

2822
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:05,080
diminish them into one holding company
for all of humanity that produced the

2823
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,130
best goddamn cell

2824
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:06,490
phone.

2825
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:06,790
Right?

2826
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:09,430
You could do that for anything and I'm
sure if we actually thought about that

2827
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,540
cancer would be be cure.

2828
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:13,240
Well it was actually cancer
cures out there already,

2829
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:16,150
but cancer as we note in the establishment
would have been cured a long,

2830
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:16,990
long time ago.

2831
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:20,770
There's way too much money being made
through this competitive practice though,

2832
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:24,490
and of course the allegation of cancer
and that goes back to the inefficient

2833
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,990
inefficiency mechanisms.

2834
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:26,770
What drives it all?

2835
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,240
If I could give you the wheel,

2836
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:30,490
if I could give you the wheel,

2837
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,420
this great,

2838
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,950
great world,

2839
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:34,750
this great society,

2840
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:35,441
there's one,

2841
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:37,540
one giant global culture,

2842
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,351
what would you do?

2843
01:23:38,351 --> 01:23:40,330
What would your first move if we Peter,

2844
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:40,571
Peter,

2845
01:23:40,571 --> 01:23:41,021
Joseph,

2846
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,670
just throw in one the electrons.

2847
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:43,510
It's the wrong logic.

2848
01:23:43,511 --> 01:23:43,991
Doug is as well.

2849
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,160
There wouldn't be any elections.

2850
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,300
There's no greater high insulin online
poll you want and you get to be king.

2851
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,090
I would,

2852
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:53,230
there wouldn't be a place for that.

2853
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:53,720
How do you mind?

2854
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,760
Tague was a close second.

2855
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:55,923
You would,

2856
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,610
she didn't get as much pokes,

2857
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,960
which is fortunately it
is when he pokes his you,

2858
01:23:59,961 --> 01:24:03,060
but you know there's like ice
move and prevailed and you're,

2859
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,110
you're in charge of putting
this thing together.

2860
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:06,100
You don't want to be right.

2861
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:08,170
You want it all to like
figure it out itself.

2862
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,730
No one single person.

2863
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:14,470
It's the greatest insult to fucking have
like a president of the United States.

2864
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:16,680
What do we in the dynasty and yes,

2865
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:20,200
we still are monk primitive Lynita
we need an Alpha and Alpha month.

2866
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,690
It's apparently it is culturally.

2867
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:24,550
We're just still still monkeys,

2868
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:26,440
but we can percent chimpanzee
or whatever we are.

2869
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,320
We can adapt pretty quickly that we have
that cerebral cortex that popped out

2870
01:24:29,321 --> 01:24:31,250
that can override all
those lower brain reacts,

2871
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,720
butterfly along his wig.

2872
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:33,520
Gated.

2873
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,031
We grow up.

2874
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:34,560
Well,

2875
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:34,731
we're,

2876
01:24:34,731 --> 01:24:34,961
we're,

2877
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:37,390
we're taught how to squash our instincts.

2878
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,250
Those stupid instincts are still there.

2879
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:41,380
The instincts dominate
the instincts to Gel,

2880
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,071
be jealous,

2881
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:43,450
the instincts to want to fuck other dudes,

2882
01:24:43,451 --> 01:24:44,230
girlfriends,

2883
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:45,580
those instincts or our primal,

2884
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:45,791
you know,

2885
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:46,501
they're all in there.

2886
01:24:46,501 --> 01:24:46,970
Yeah.

2887
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:47,480
Maybe.

2888
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,460
Maybe not though every,

2889
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,981
every film,

2890
01:24:48,981 --> 01:24:51,800
every film you see out there
reinforces such things like that.

2891
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:55,100
It's hard to say just
even elm reinforces it,

2892
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,970
but also does every you,

2893
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:57,831
your instincts,

2894
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:58,790
your own nature.

2895
01:24:59,170 --> 01:24:59,360
You know,

2896
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,440
we are clearly some sort of an
animal and conscious being hybrid,

2897
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,040
you know,

2898
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:04,511
and we,

2899
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:06,830
we battle with these very primitive,

2900
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,020
I mean you ever be in front of somebody
and you just want to punch them in the

2901
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:09,854
fucking head.

2902
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:10,071
Well,

2903
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:10,851
if you are a champion,

2904
01:25:10,851 --> 01:25:11,810
you were living in the jungle,

2905
01:25:11,811 --> 01:25:12,480
that's what you would do,

2906
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,550
would just punch him in the head.

2907
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:15,020
That chimp is pissing you off.

2908
01:25:15,021 --> 01:25:15,854
He just bite it,

2909
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:16,281
you know?

2910
01:25:16,281 --> 01:25:16,461
I mean,

2911
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:17,294
that's what they do.

2912
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:22,420
That's what we have this thing going on
in our head where we're trying to squash

2913
01:25:23,031 --> 01:25:23,870
all that nonsense.

2914
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:24,990
Just their poop on him,

2915
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,210
on him.

2916
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,021
You're a Bonobo.

2917
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:28,370
That's why I'm much more,

2918
01:25:28,371 --> 01:25:29,520
a much more peaceful.

2919
01:25:29,521 --> 01:25:30,354
It's right.

2920
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,870
Most of their fights with
carrying around sticks.

2921
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:33,801
So they do,

2922
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,300
whoever picks up the biggest stick,

2923
01:25:35,301 --> 01:25:35,511
it's like,

2924
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:35,781
oh,

2925
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:36,770
he's a bad motherfucker.

2926
01:25:36,771 --> 01:25:37,520
Look at that stick.

2927
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:37,820
Right.

2928
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:38,001
You know,

2929
01:25:38,001 --> 01:25:41,630
they don't actually like go to blows
like the regular chimpanzees fuck each

2930
01:25:41,631 --> 01:25:41,991
other out.

2931
01:25:41,991 --> 01:25:42,824
They kill each other,

2932
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,240
but Benobos really,

2933
01:25:44,241 --> 01:25:46,160
they're mostly solve
their issues through sex.

2934
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,833
Is that you?

2935
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:48,740
Yeah.

2936
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:51,290
How do you saw your boob on you?

2937
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:52,303
Okay.

2938
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,750
There's no universal,

2939
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,480
there's no universal is no king.

2940
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,190
I know what you're saying and I know
you're very sensitive about this because

2941
01:25:58,191 --> 01:26:02,450
that is that what happens
in every situation where one
person gets an inordinate

2942
01:26:02,451 --> 01:26:03,230
amount of attention.

2943
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,100
I'm sure you're getting

2944
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,660
and you're very charismatic dude.

2945
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:06,620
You're very intelligent,

2946
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,940
you're very well spoken.

2947
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:12,050
There must be some sort of a push in one
sense or another to get you to kind of

2948
01:26:12,051 --> 01:26:12,681
lead things,

2949
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:13,010
right?

2950
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:13,251
I mean,

2951
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,030
you must feel,

2952
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:14,811
well that's why I'm here.

2953
01:26:14,811 --> 01:26:16,520
I'm just trying to
communicate these ideas.

2954
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:18,290
Do you feel responsible?

2955
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:21,230
Does it mean you've created a movement,

2956
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:21,560
right?

2957
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,780
I mean essentially you press
the button movement created,

2958
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:24,591
it's created south,

2959
01:26:24,591 --> 01:26:25,900
but you did press start,

2960
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:26,870
press start.

2961
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:27,321
But then again,

2962
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:27,520
you know,

2963
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,760
in a sense of cause Audi,

2964
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:30,440
who of us really trigger anything?

2965
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,140
I could go back and take the
Zeit geist film and I could say,

2966
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:35,200
well this is an influence
of all these other people.

2967
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,040
I can say Bill Hicks and
George Carlin needs like guys,

2968
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:38,320
you know,

2969
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,610
this is the values just spread.

2970
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:40,970
It was like a,

2971
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:44,820
there's an evolution and the organism
of knowledge that we really hold on to.

2972
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:46,220
But you are part of it as well.

2973
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:46,550
No,

2974
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,941
I understand.

2975
01:26:46,941 --> 01:26:48,590
I know you're being humble
and understand your point.

2976
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,480
If you didn't create that video,

2977
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:52,010
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

2978
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:53,420
You wouldn't have had this movement,

2979
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:54,254
you wouldn't have.

2980
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,920
So you've charged up a lot of
people's brains with that man.

2981
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:57,754
And it was uh,

2982
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,800
there's been a lot of
inspiration out there,

2983
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:02,270
which has come from many
different directions.

2984
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:07,680
So I had an issue with the nine 11 stuff
that when you guys did the first video,

2985
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:09,980
it essentially,

2986
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:13,400
you were saying that nine 11 was an
inside job and then you knew that the

2987
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:15,470
buildings could not have
come down any other way.

2988
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:15,801
Right.

2989
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:18,590
Isn't that something that was
said with creative license?

2990
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:18,741
Yeah.

2991
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:23,150
That's what was definitely implies to
for for a fact because it was your,

2992
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:24,850
this was the you,

2993
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:28,700
you did not anticipate this ever being
what it was and you were just trying to

2994
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:31,910
get an effect on the assumption that the
audience would of course make up their

2995
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:35,150
own mind because before that there's a
great deal of evidence and the opinion of

2996
01:27:35,151 --> 01:27:35,960
the creator.

2997
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,030
Then all probabilities moving forward.

2998
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:38,211
Yeah.

2999
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:39,800
That statement was made declaratory.

3000
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:43,640
You think that when you see
like tower one tower two,

3001
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:48,641
do you think that they were detonated
Taiwan and tell her to most probably where

3002
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:50,061
it's all x,

3003
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:50,720
Y and Z's.

3004
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,930
To me we'll trade center
seven by all means,

3005
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:56,960
the World Trade Center seven is the
only one that when you look at it,

3006
01:27:56,961 --> 01:27:59,420
it fell into its foundation,

3007
01:27:59,421 --> 01:28:01,360
which is exactly what happens.

3008
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:04,880
Even beyond that eye witness testimony
of people that were stepping over bodies

3009
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:07,580
from pre weakening
explosions that were there.

3010
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:12,581
You have all sorts of things that do
not add up seismic elements that were

3011
01:28:12,771 --> 01:28:13,370
brought into play.

3012
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:16,220
Mostly no one died and tower seven no,

3013
01:28:16,221 --> 01:28:17,360
there was a whole sea of people.

3014
01:28:17,361 --> 01:28:19,340
There was one of the guy
that that mysteriously died,

3015
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:21,080
I believe of some illness.

3016
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,801
His name was,

3017
01:28:21,801 --> 01:28:22,130
um,

3018
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:22,670
it was a black man.

3019
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,071
What class?

3020
01:28:23,071 --> 01:28:23,361
It was like,

3021
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:24,200
oh I know what you're talking about.

3022
01:28:24,201 --> 01:28:25,820
He was the guy who said
that he saw bodies.

3023
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,820
One other person were in the elevators
that blew out and the eighth floor and he

3024
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:31,550
basically,

3025
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:35,060
he was the only eyewitness
testimony to that in the lobby.

3026
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,770
And he actually worked for the mayor too,

3027
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:37,880
which was even more interesting.

3028
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,120
Well that one certainly looks like
a demolition w the way it fell.

3029
01:28:41,121 --> 01:28:41,601
But the other,

3030
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:42,620
the other towers,

3031
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:47,300
I've never seen a controlled demolition
where it starts from the top and sort of

3032
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:48,590
pancakes down like that.

3033
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,390
It usually falls into itself.

3034
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:51,310
You know it too.

3035
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:51,791
Did you do,

3036
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:52,550
do it goes,

3037
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:54,080
it goes and collapse into the space.

3038
01:28:54,081 --> 01:28:54,291
I mean,

3039
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:54,591
I don't know.

3040
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:55,910
Maybe there's another way to do it.

3041
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,160
Maybe they can do it
where it pancakes down,

3042
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,840
but it also couldn't,

3043
01:28:59,841 --> 01:29:01,950
it isn't it possible that
a structural failure,

3044
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:04,320
cause they were hit by
giant jet jet engines,

3045
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:05,543
jet planes,

3046
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,500
not since they were awesome.

3047
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:11,340
They were designed to take the
impact of some faulty engineering,

3048
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:13,070
like they thought it was the
idea that we were having,

3049
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:13,770
they were wrong.

3050
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,970
A cold structure,

3051
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,500
law of conservation of momentum.

3052
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:20,130
You have a cold structure
down here regardless of how
hot it is up here to see a

3053
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:21,450
systemic collapse.

3054
01:29:21,451 --> 01:29:23,130
If you look at the NIST
studies and everything else,

3055
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:25,140
which didn't even explain
the collapse by the way,

3056
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,260
it's beyond in probable.

3057
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,500
And I've yet to meet one structural
engineer that could ever explain that,

3058
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:34,620
especially given the free
nature of it when it hit,

3059
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,810
not to mention all the
other characteristics,

3060
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:37,351
fallen nature,

3061
01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:41,190
meaning it fell a very
similar to free fall speed,

3062
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,450
very close to free fall speed.

3063
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:43,284
Of course,

3064
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:45,180
not to mention the pre
weakened in explosions,

3065
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:46,460
the subbasement explosions,

3066
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:49,590
the recipe of it was perfectly in
order with everything that you'd see in

3067
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:52,410
controlled demolition except this was
just extremely advanced and it's an

3068
01:29:52,411 --> 01:29:53,850
implosion instead of an explosion.

3069
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:54,420
Um,

3070
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:58,260
I've had this conversation with several
people who believe his exact same thing

3071
01:29:58,261 --> 01:30:00,900
and one of them was Michael
[inaudible] who's on last week.

3072
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:01,621
And,

3073
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:02,220
um,

3074
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,630
I always ask the same question,

3075
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:04,464
how many people,

3076
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:06,060
how many people know about this?

3077
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:08,880
If you believe that that is the case and
you believe that it was some sort of an

3078
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:10,800
inside job coordinating explosions,

3079
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:11,011
well,

3080
01:30:11,011 --> 01:30:12,330
if you were an engineer that could,

3081
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:13,710
to have access to the elevator shafts,

3082
01:30:13,711 --> 01:30:16,200
which would have led you to all the
pivotal structural beams that would be

3083
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:17,220
required to do this,

3084
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:19,890
you could probably do it over the
course of time with 15 people,

3085
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:21,481
15 people,

3086
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:22,740
and then we'll shoot them all.

3087
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:26,150
I've no idea if those words think about
how long did it take for people to come

3088
01:30:26,151 --> 01:30:27,420
out about the Kennedy assassination.

3089
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:28,350
How long did it take for,

3090
01:30:28,351 --> 01:30:28,621
you know,

3091
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:30,900
all these other events that have occurred
that people had been tight lipped

3092
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:31,711
about for so,

3093
01:30:31,711 --> 01:30:34,860
so long thing about any historical
event of black operation.

3094
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,340
There's,

3095
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,140
it's a tight club in that world.

3096
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:37,650
Tight,

3097
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:38,281
tight club.

3098
01:30:38,281 --> 01:30:38,820
It doesn't,

3099
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:40,800
it doesn't surprise me at all
that no one would come forward.

3100
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:41,551
My God,

3101
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:42,570
no one would come forward.

3102
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:46,110
And they would set up explosions and
bring down two gigantic skyscrapers.

3103
01:30:46,111 --> 01:30:47,130
Why the world watched.

3104
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,920
And none of those assholes
wanting to claim credit for that.

3105
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:54,060
No one wants to step up and say they
had something to do with that based on

3106
01:30:54,061 --> 01:30:55,020
historical precedent.

3107
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,000
Precedent doesn't surprise me at all.

3108
01:30:57,001 --> 01:30:59,460
Just go back and look at all
the history of black operations,

3109
01:30:59,461 --> 01:31:00,330
CIA and FBI.

3110
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:01,770
Look at the names that were under it.

3111
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,090
Where did those people go?

3112
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:05,370
Why didn't they talk about the
things that are involved in before?

3113
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:10,380
It's interesting that I know you know
about Hitler burned the rice stag and Nero

3114
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:13,140
burned Rome and we know that
this situation has been,

3115
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,380
it's happened in history before where
someone has created some sort of an

3116
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:20,100
artificial dilemma to resolve
it and they've done it,

3117
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:20,910
you know,

3118
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:24,090
to pass laws to impose their agenda,

3119
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:24,780
whatever.

3120
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,630
But then when someone tells
me that Oklahoma City,

3121
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:30,450
they blew it up just to
pass new terrorism laws,

3122
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:30,990
I go,

3123
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:32,000
get the fuck outta here.

3124
01:31:32,001 --> 01:31:32,121
I mean,

3125
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:32,330
yeah,

3126
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:32,881
it's hard of me.

3127
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:34,650
Doesn't want to accept that.

3128
01:31:34,651 --> 01:31:35,700
Part of me is,

3129
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,520
even though I know that
it's been done before,

3130
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:39,150
there's,

3131
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,170
there's a certain,

3132
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,000
it's a more complicated web.

3133
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:47,050
It was recently released that the FBI has
been involved in over 50% of terrorist

3134
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:49,590
acts that have occurred on us soil.

3135
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:54,510
What they do is they infiltrate and
then they enable in certain ways and

3136
01:31:54,511 --> 01:31:58,320
sometimes they busted him in the
middle or they let it go forward.

3137
01:31:58,650 --> 01:31:59,010
It,

3138
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,040
I think the first

3139
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,910
World Trade Center bombing,

3140
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:01,744
you had the guy with the,

3141
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,190
the recording of the,

3142
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:03,790
with the,

3143
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:04,150
the,

3144
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:04,541
excuse me,

3145
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:05,020
the uh,

3146
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,900
the agent that was there that was working
with a terrorist and sided with the

3147
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:11,710
FBI and the FBI told him to
go forward with the explosion.

3148
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:13,660
They gave him the bomb to do so,

3149
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,550
so that that didn't need to happen.

3150
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:16,900
That's public record really.

3151
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:19,540
So they knew he was going to
blow up the World Trade Center.

3152
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:22,810
They had infiltrated the
group long before noon.

3153
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:24,610
So suspicious.

3154
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:24,791
Yeah,

3155
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:25,091
they led,

3156
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:25,990
they gave him the explosion.

3157
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:26,980
They gave him the detonator,

3158
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:29,190
the FBI handed Salaam,

3159
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,060
it was his name and they,

3160
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:34,780
the guy recorded these conversations
because he was so upset by what the FBI

3161
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:35,620
wanted him to do.

3162
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,450
All that.

3163
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,670
All of that's in the Zike
guys moving companion guide.

3164
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:40,041
By the way.

3165
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:40,781
It's perfectly honest.

3166
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:42,430
I'm so sick of talking about that shit.

3167
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,070
Really?

3168
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:43,330
Oh,

3169
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:44,620
it's always the drill there.

3170
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:45,910
God Damn though.

3171
01:32:45,911 --> 01:32:46,840
That's unbelievable.

3172
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:50,010
I know about the guy and I
believe it was Dallas where um,

3173
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:52,120
they talked him into blowing something up,

3174
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:53,470
gave him a fake bomb,

3175
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:55,960
set him up and he went and did
it and then they were of them.

3176
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,401
I'm like,

3177
01:32:56,401 --> 01:32:57,220
that is just,

3178
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,800
you found some really dumb guy.

3179
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:00,970
It's easy to see.

3180
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:03,760
If you look at all the warnings
of a Solomon Law and an al Qaeda,

3181
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,410
easy to see how that CIA,

3182
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:08,500
FBI agents infiltrated a rogue group
that we're planning to do a terrorist

3183
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:13,450
attack in the world trade center
infiltrated and aided and to make sure it

3184
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:15,040
worked in the way that they wanted it to.

3185
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:19,000
Even after the fact with
industrial industrial organizing,

3186
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:21,610
perhaps with the die in the
first World Trade Center bombing,

3187
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,410
I believe a couple of people did.

3188
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,280
It wasn't that big though.

3189
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,510
I think it was seven people or something.

3190
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:28,180
So they're responsible
for those seven deaths.

3191
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:31,360
And the only reason that didn't bring
down a major been by the way is cause

3192
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:33,460
there was another van
parked in the wrong spot.

3193
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:35,200
It was supposed to be right
by this one support beam.

3194
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:35,591
If it did,

3195
01:33:35,591 --> 01:33:37,300
it would have partially imploded down,

3196
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,120
partially collapsed again in a whole
lot more people would have died.

3197
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:44,920
So you believe that they could 15
people could have rigged the World Trade

3198
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,080
Center towers and over
the course of many months,

3199
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:47,914
yes.

3200
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,340
And they could have been planning
this thing out the whole time and Dick

3201
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:55,090
Cheney's got all these don't go so
far to say it has anything to do with

3202
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:56,160
presidents are in like that.

3203
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:57,003
I think it's,

3204
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:58,690
it's a standard operating procedure,

3205
01:33:58,691 --> 01:33:59,810
black operation that's,

3206
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:02,020
that's telltale back in time.

3207
01:34:02,021 --> 01:34:04,900
And just look at how they operate it
before and they just did it again.

3208
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:05,770
Who uh,

3209
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:06,760
who sets it up?

3210
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:08,523
No,

3211
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:09,880
it's not that obvious.

3212
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:12,520
Corporate interest in Wall
Street are highly intertwined.

3213
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,380
CIA and Wall Street
are highly intertwined.

3214
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:19,600
You can't speculate on how this
idea would really come to fruition.

3215
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:22,000
All you could think of is that yes,

3216
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:25,210
you have the options there and you have
the Preston to do so I have no idea

3217
01:34:25,211 --> 01:34:26,021
where the source would be.

3218
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:26,481
It it,

3219
01:34:26,481 --> 01:34:28,870
it had so many benefits and
so many different levels.

3220
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,050
Namely benefit though is
to the administration,

3221
01:34:32,051 --> 01:34:35,290
the interest of the oil industry to move
in on the power's in the Middle East

3222
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:38,410
and give the ultimate
precedent and as a side effect,

3223
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:41,740
they were going to orchestrate it though
wouldn't they orchestrated with some

3224
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:43,300
people like if we're going to go to Iraq,

3225
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:44,223
that's the plan.

3226
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:46,720
Would they have Iraqi's attack us?

3227
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:48,220
I don't think they could
have infiltrated it,

3228
01:34:48,221 --> 01:34:49,900
but they tried their
hardest dependent on Saddam.

3229
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,640
I had one of the first
publications by the way,

3230
01:34:51,641 --> 01:34:53,830
that was produced the day
after nine 11 by Time magazine.

3231
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:56,080
It's the most amazing piece of propaganda.

3232
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:56,914
You flipped through it.

3233
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:00,200
You have every horrible shot as
exaggerated as possible and then boom,

3234
01:35:00,201 --> 01:35:00,890
you hit,

3235
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,120
you hit Osama bin Ladin.

3236
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:03,043
There he is.

3237
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:04,100
Next page,

3238
01:35:04,101 --> 01:35:05,570
Saddam Hussein.

3239
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,130
Next page,

3240
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:07,930
the uh,

3241
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:09,170
the guy from Korea.

3242
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:13,970
So they just lined them up psychologically
and he could easily have seen Saddam

3243
01:35:13,971 --> 01:35:14,541
was a highlight.

3244
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:15,374
He was sitting there with a big,

3245
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:16,310
big,

3246
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,240
big bazooka.

3247
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:18,260
It was hilarious.

3248
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:18,621
I mean it was,

3249
01:35:18,621 --> 01:35:22,430
there was this planted as you could
possibly get and which is not a new thing

3250
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:23,264
either.

3251
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:26,300
It's just sad to see how people
have no sense of history.

3252
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:31,250
They don't really understand how
business has been covert for so long.

3253
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:32,121
And then again,

3254
01:35:32,121 --> 01:35:32,990
what would you expect?

3255
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:34,280
Big government is a business.

3256
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:35,090
That's what it runs.

3257
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:36,260
It's one big business.

3258
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:40,070
We expect more transparency because
we have so much more information.

3259
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,750
Transparency was never
there to begin with.

3260
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:43,640
The only reason that we thought
we'd never had the internet either.

3261
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,151
Exactly.

3262
01:35:44,151 --> 01:35:47,600
But the reason we think is because now
it starts to leak because of how powerful

3263
01:35:47,601 --> 01:35:49,520
than the wikileaks and
people with consciences,

3264
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:49,760
you know,

3265
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,450
coming forward and trying to help
and make these things come out.

3266
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:54,853
But um,

3267
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,710
it's really going back to the,

3268
01:35:56,711 --> 01:35:57,830
the social system,

3269
01:35:58,190 --> 01:35:58,790
you know,

3270
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:59,361
flaw.

3271
01:35:59,361 --> 01:36:01,430
If it's a survival of the fittest concept,

3272
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:03,080
if it's a competitive system,

3273
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:06,050
doesn't matter whether it's two people
competing for a job to corporations

3274
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:10,760
competing for market share
or two countries competing
for resources and their

3275
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:13,490
own esteem or whatever their
interests are as an empire.

3276
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:15,410
It's the same fundamental logic.

3277
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:18,080
When Julian Assange,

3278
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:18,830
uh,

3279
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:20,810
came out with all this information,

3280
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:22,040
released all this shit,

3281
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:24,350
and what did you think was
gonna Happen to that guy?

3282
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:29,720
I was just disappointed that he chose to
put himself in the forefront because it

3283
01:36:29,721 --> 01:36:32,480
painted a picture of a
personality cult of personality,

3284
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:33,920
which I just can't stand.

3285
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:34,700
I didn't know what,

3286
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:34,920
what I,

3287
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,290
I figured he would just be,

3288
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,150
he would be character
assessed the left and right.

3289
01:36:38,151 --> 01:36:39,830
I doubt they would try to do
anything to him physically.

3290
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,300
Why do you think he did it?

3291
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:44,310
It was an ego moved to put
himself and it was inadvertent.

3292
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,811
I think he had,

3293
01:36:44,811 --> 01:36:45,561
he was a spokesman.

3294
01:36:45,561 --> 01:36:46,221
It was inadvertent,

3295
01:36:46,221 --> 01:36:46,820
but if,

3296
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,670
if I had was in that position
of such massive attention,

3297
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:53,480
I would gotten a team to take the
reins and not have one entity that way.

3298
01:36:53,481 --> 01:36:54,860
There's less for them to attack.

3299
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,420
There's anything that I do in my work,

3300
01:36:56,421 --> 01:36:58,970
even though I don't consider
myself to be that famous is I,

3301
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:03,710
I'm always dispersing and getting other
people to do lots of other things and

3302
01:37:03,711 --> 01:37:07,010
take the attention away from
myself for many different purposes.

3303
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:07,281
For one,

3304
01:37:07,281 --> 01:37:08,720
I don't really feel comfortable with that.

3305
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:10,000
Any type of role as you've,

3306
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:10,940
you've joked about,

3307
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:13,590
it's really not in my
character whatsoever.

3308
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:17,260
Never that you've gotten to this point
that I just feel like I've been pushed.

3309
01:37:17,261 --> 01:37:17,321
I,

3310
01:37:17,321 --> 01:37:18,770
it's sold like little
Martin Luther King thing.

3311
01:37:18,771 --> 01:37:18,951
He's like,

3312
01:37:18,951 --> 01:37:21,090
he just felt like a big
Martin Luther King Fan.

3313
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,550
He was felt like he was pushed.

3314
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:25,820
So I kind of allow myself to be just be
pushed and I kind of go with the flow,

3315
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,350
but there's nothing more important to me
than showing a larger face to this type

3316
01:37:30,351 --> 01:37:33,890
of concept and not get caught up
in the cult of personality issue.

3317
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:35,600
So it has a few different psychological,

3318
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,240
are you making a living
doing lectures now?

3319
01:37:38,241 --> 01:37:39,074
Like what are you doing?

3320
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:40,790
I have never been paid for a lecture.

3321
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:45,791
I make a modest living trying to
commercially now exploit zeitgeists and

3322
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:48,840
occasionally I believe in and I still
do some equity things and we do it.

3323
01:37:48,841 --> 01:37:51,950
We have to do in this
system but I so you're out.

3324
01:37:51,951 --> 01:37:55,590
They're scamming the people
now I I'm scamming traders.

3325
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:55,980
That's what you

3326
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,310
do.

3327
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:57,080
Is that what you do?

3328
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:57,841
It's a little,

3329
01:37:57,841 --> 01:37:59,100
it's like a game you play.

3330
01:37:59,190 --> 01:37:59,611
It is,

3331
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:00,444
it's all it is.

3332
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,061
You do it.

3333
01:38:01,061 --> 01:38:01,850
You have to do,

3334
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,960
you know I could just be
a bartender somewhere.

3335
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:04,261
You know,

3336
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:04,561
you pick,

3337
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:05,430
you pick your poison,

3338
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:06,750
charge money for lectures.

3339
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:08,030
It seems like I don't like it.

3340
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,560
I don't like doing that because people
would be nice to compensate me for

3341
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:11,070
travel.

3342
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:11,791
I appreciate that.

3343
01:38:11,791 --> 01:38:13,890
I can't afford to just
flagrantly go out there.

3344
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:16,470
I'll be fly all over the country for free.

3345
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,150
Not usually,

3346
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:20,760
but if there's an event I try to hope
that they give me at least something.

3347
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:21,411
It depends on,

3348
01:38:21,411 --> 01:38:22,380
it depends on the nature of the event.

3349
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,960
Are you guys going to have like
some sort of an annual thing,

3350
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:26,520
like some sort of as like guys party?

3351
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:27,181
We have,

3352
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:27,391
well,

3353
01:38:27,391 --> 01:38:28,224
we have,

3354
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,580
we have a site guys today,

3355
01:38:29,581 --> 01:38:32,880
which is a very intellectual day with a
series of lectures about a dozen of us

3356
01:38:32,881 --> 01:38:34,830
that give different lectures
in different subjects.

3357
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,720
What do you do that we're
doing this one in Vancouver.

3358
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:37,880
Last year we did it in London.

3359
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:38,740
The before New York.

3360
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:39,511
See,

3361
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:40,890
that's pretty bad ass.

3362
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:41,191
Yeah,

3363
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:41,491
that's a,

3364
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:44,250
that's a big pivotal part of the
kind of wellness program we had.

3365
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:45,690
We have had great turnouts.

3366
01:38:45,691 --> 01:38:47,130
That's how you meet the guy with the land.

3367
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:47,780
That's how,

3368
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:48,830
that's how the story starts.

3369
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:50,610
You bring it into my laundry.

3370
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:52,500
The guy who does your land.

3371
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,210
I was going to fucking set up your,

3372
01:38:54,211 --> 01:38:55,560
can you draw a compound?

3373
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:57,030
Who Do you think killed biggie

3374
01:38:58,830 --> 01:38:59,371
rampart,

3375
01:38:59,371 --> 01:38:59,730
bro.

3376
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,110
My captain conspiracy here.

3377
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,560
Who killed you?

3378
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:02,770
A,

3379
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,900
you're not a conspiracy guy,

3380
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:04,380
are you?

3381
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:04,530
No,

3382
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:04,620
no,

3383
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:04,740
no.

3384
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:05,573
I don't.

3385
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:06,683
I don't care for those.

3386
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,160
I see the causality of it.

3387
01:39:08,161 --> 01:39:10,830
I don't care for the
idea of conspiracy on,

3388
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,780
certainly not into the concept.

3389
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:13,614
As a theme,

3390
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:17,310
people misunderstood the first film as
far as what was said and it became quote,

3391
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:21,150
the greatest conspiracy film of
all time and some press media,

3392
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:22,620
which I thought was a bad,

3393
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:23,191
it was it,

3394
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:25,410
the idea was uncultural fallibility.

3395
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:25,920
Yeah,

3396
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,030
religious force.

3397
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:30,570
You have the nine 11 forests and
the of the entire banking more scam.

3398
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:34,460
It was all really a matter of how
publicly manipulated everyone is into to

3399
01:39:34,461 --> 01:39:37,560
believing that these things are actually
legitimate and hold up the social

3400
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:42,210
zeitgeisty well I think what you did to
his package it all together in a really

3401
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:45,480
easily absorbable form that
really likes sent the point home.

3402
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,081
You know?

3403
01:39:46,081 --> 01:39:46,411
And again,

3404
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:50,310
a lot of people started on a path of
thinking that they might not have ever

3405
01:39:50,311 --> 01:39:50,971
started on.

3406
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:51,481
Exactly.

3407
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:53,250
That's the watching that
seem to be so amazing.

3408
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:53,401
You know,

3409
01:39:53,401 --> 01:39:55,170
you get emails like
you've changed my life.

3410
01:39:55,210 --> 01:39:57,480
It's just amazing to
see the response again,

3411
01:39:57,481 --> 01:39:58,500
completely inadvertent.

3412
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,740
But you have a certain amount of
responsibility because that you feel it.

3413
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,401
You know,

3414
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:03,330
I of course I feel it.

3415
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:03,820
I had,

3416
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:04,220
you know,

3417
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:06,570
I don't take myself that seriously though.

3418
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,220
I'm just like anybody else.

3419
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,670
So anytime I run into somebody that has
a kind of a cult of personality thing,

3420
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:14,700
I really try to shut that
down as fast as possible.

3421
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:16,800
I can't stand being complimented.

3422
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:17,111
Oh,

3423
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:17,460
it's on.

3424
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,091
Gets crazy.

3425
01:40:18,091 --> 01:40:19,620
You are my hero like that.

3426
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:19,821
Yeah,

3427
01:40:19,821 --> 01:40:20,521
I really try.

3428
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:23,790
It meant any chicks with tattoos
your face on yet are out there?

3429
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:27,240
Not that I've seen is a couple of
girls who have your face on their calf.

3430
01:40:27,241 --> 01:40:29,790
Definitely the hippie pussy you get.

3431
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:30,990
Must be unbelievable though.

3432
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:31,740
Thrown your way.

3433
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:32,820
I don't know if you're in a relationship,

3434
01:40:32,821 --> 01:40:33,780
girls with tattoos.

3435
01:40:33,781 --> 01:40:37,670
I think for some reason like
tad tad curls with crystals.

3436
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:38,543
Yeah.

3437
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,391
Girls Ready,

3438
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:40,800
ready for you to start that cult.

3439
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,310
It's not,

3440
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:41,491
I don't,

3441
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:44,460
I don't have a rock star life
unfortunately or fortunately.

3442
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:46,260
You need to fucking
manage this shit better.

3443
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:47,700
If you need a podcast,

3444
01:40:47,701 --> 01:40:49,530
it's not in my character to come on,

3445
01:40:49,531 --> 01:40:50,160
man.

3446
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,240
That's all well and good.

3447
01:40:51,241 --> 01:40:52,470
Let's pretend no one's listening.

3448
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,670
Let's pretend no one's listening.

3449
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:59,080
Let's pretend that this may be just one
frame and an infinite movie that goes on

3450
01:40:59,081 --> 01:41:00,160
forever and makes no sense.

3451
01:41:00,161 --> 01:41:03,160
You should be enjoying the shit out of
this and you can enjoy the shit out of

3452
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:04,780
this with rivers of Hippie Pussy.

3453
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:05,670
Let me tell you that Matt.

3454
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:06,513
Fortunately,

3455
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,040
unfortunately we do for Peter Joseph,

3456
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,060
take them to the olive garden.

3457
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:10,591
If we get,

3458
01:41:10,591 --> 01:41:11,890
gave him a podcast.

3459
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:14,080
Peter Joseph every week.

3460
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:14,341
Yeah,

3461
01:41:14,341 --> 01:41:15,090
that'd be awesome.

3462
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:15,621
You tell mom,

3463
01:41:15,621 --> 01:41:16,490
you got to give me a podcast.

3464
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:16,920
Yeah,

3465
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:17,753
you can have.

3466
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:19,093
All right.

3467
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,190
I do a radio show.

3468
01:41:20,191 --> 01:41:20,680
I do a radio.

3469
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:21,380
That's okay.

3470
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:21,640
Yuki,

3471
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:22,400
what'd he do?

3472
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,480
Is it on regular radio,

3473
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,840
blog talk radio that
we do for the movement?

3474
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:26,733
It's just a free,

3475
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:27,880
is it online?

3476
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,331
It's online,

3477
01:41:28,331 --> 01:41:29,920
so it's a essentially a podcast as well.

3478
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,813
It is a podcast.

3479
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:32,590
Just you do more.

3480
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:33,671
Yeah.

3481
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:33,941
Dude,

3482
01:41:33,941 --> 01:41:34,510
you could.

3483
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:36,100
You could go on for hours and hours.

3484
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:37,530
I've got to sex squad podcast.

3485
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:39,071
I know you do,

3486
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:39,940
but I mean it's amazing.

3487
01:41:39,941 --> 01:41:44,140
You never say you're like one of the most
eloquent guys I think I've ever talked

3488
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:44,261
to.

3489
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:44,770
It's amazing.

3490
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:45,581
I was,

3491
01:41:45,581 --> 01:41:48,780
one of the things I was paying
attention to when I was watching your

3492
01:41:48,781 --> 01:41:49,311
presentation,

3493
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:49,541
I'm like,

3494
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:50,620
he's speaking so clearly.

3495
01:41:50,621 --> 01:41:51,160
He's like,

3496
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,660
he's always so good with getting as I,

3497
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:53,140
that's not,

3498
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:57,460
that's not the easiest thing to do for
a person like me who's essentially lived

3499
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:00,880
at least half of my life
doing public speeches,

3500
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:01,630
you know,

3501
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:03,380
either standup comedy or you know,

3502
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:03,551
or,

3503
01:42:03,551 --> 01:42:04,870
or acting stuff or

3504
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,000
it's not natural to me.

3505
01:42:06,001 --> 01:42:07,020
I guess cause I was a musician.

3506
01:42:07,021 --> 01:42:09,450
I'm not too afraid to
speak in front of people.

3507
01:42:09,451 --> 01:42:12,060
I guess that's part of it just
to be a performer if you will.

3508
01:42:12,061 --> 01:42:16,530
But do you feel like at this point you
have like a Zike guys act all and I say

3509
01:42:16,531 --> 01:42:16,970
act,

3510
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:17,850
not that it's bullshit,

3511
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:19,290
but almost like with standup comedy,

3512
01:42:19,470 --> 01:42:19,681
you know,

3513
01:42:19,681 --> 01:42:22,320
you have subjects that you know you're
going to go into and then once you get

3514
01:42:22,321 --> 01:42:24,120
into those subjects you have
stuff that you already said.

3515
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:24,781
Oh sure,

3516
01:42:24,781 --> 01:42:25,081
sure.

3517
01:42:25,081 --> 01:42:25,950
Well it depends on the,

3518
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:27,330
depends on the circumstance.

3519
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,190
It's a vast range of stuff.

3520
01:42:29,191 --> 01:42:32,610
And I could ramble on about a lot of
other different issues if you want to go

3521
01:42:32,611 --> 01:42:33,000
back for it.

3522
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,121
I mean,

3523
01:42:33,121 --> 01:42:33,310
yeah,

3524
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:34,590
so it's formulaic obviously.

3525
01:42:34,591 --> 01:42:34,681
Like,

3526
01:42:34,681 --> 01:42:36,390
if I'm addressing occupy Wall Street,

3527
01:42:36,391 --> 01:42:38,940
I have a very specific kind of gesture,

3528
01:42:38,941 --> 01:42:40,950
I'm going for a little
more anarchic oriented,

3529
01:42:40,951 --> 01:42:41,141
you know,

3530
01:42:41,141 --> 01:42:44,640
trying to get relate to their value is
a little more angry cause everyone wants

3531
01:42:44,641 --> 01:42:45,780
to get routed up and you know,

3532
01:42:45,781 --> 01:42:49,980
you really can't be a fired up speech
that we can give the angry Peter Joseph

3533
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:52,800
again.

3534
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,200
That's a great way to get to that hip.

3535
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,840
He Pussy you gotta be a leader that's
pissed off in any communication you need

3536
01:42:57,841 --> 01:42:58,451
strategy.

3537
01:42:58,451 --> 01:42:59,284
So I,

3538
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:03,030
I try my best to call or my strategy
just like I'm doing right now with you.

3539
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:03,481
Yeah.

3540
01:43:03,481 --> 01:43:03,810
Well

3541
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:04,170
your,

3542
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:04,741
so your,

3543
01:43:04,741 --> 01:43:06,300
your main Gig is this now,

3544
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:07,710
I mean this is essentially
what you're doing.

3545
01:43:07,711 --> 01:43:09,180
You do your musical Manga,

3546
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,930
you said the music's on the sidelines.

3547
01:43:10,931 --> 01:43:12,250
I do that as a hobby.

3548
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:12,970
I do,

3549
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:16,630
we do these art festivals and things like
that to kind of make a little fun out

3550
01:43:16,631 --> 01:43:17,051
of things.

3551
01:43:17,051 --> 01:43:18,880
The socially conscious art
festival we had a while back,

3552
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:19,860
but you know,

3553
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,830
the music's on the sidelines.

3554
01:43:20,831 --> 01:43:21,620
The film is,

3555
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:23,560
I have a new film coming
out at the end of this year,

3556
01:43:23,561 --> 01:43:24,110
so what does that,

3557
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,800
it's like I just beyond the Pale and
hopefully by the end of 2012 I'm not

3558
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:28,840
completely set on that,

3559
01:43:28,841 --> 01:43:31,750
but it's going to be the
fourth to be a live action one.

3560
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:33,400
I'm not going to give
away too much about it,

3561
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:36,610
but like live action one meaning
it's going to be a documentary,

3562
01:43:36,611 --> 01:43:39,190
but it's going to be a very
untraditional documentary.

3563
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,383
Um,

3564
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:40,721
again,

3565
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:41,940
I don't want to talk about it because,

3566
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:42,971
but it's going to be,

3567
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:44,440
it's going to be very interesting.

3568
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,840
I do a lot of characterised
stablish went with this one.

3569
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:48,100
Um,

3570
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,660
this is going to actors in this one.

3571
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,110
It's the same ideas,

3572
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:53,930
same pushing forward with
this broad social expansion.

3573
01:43:53,931 --> 01:43:58,700
The idea of what a rational society is
and kind of did you see moving forward.

3574
01:43:58,701 --> 01:44:01,430
It's going to be a similar
portrayal of the third film,

3575
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:03,650
but in a gestural sense,

3576
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:06,170
which I think I'm excited to do because
I've never done something like that.

3577
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:10,970
Kind of a cool concept to actually
show people as actors moving forward,

3578
01:44:10,971 --> 01:44:12,470
creating some new society.

3579
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,210
It's not exactly like that.

3580
01:44:14,211 --> 01:44:16,610
Now the the fifth film I'll do theirs,

3581
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:17,550
the trilogy,

3582
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:18,470
we're not the trilogy.

3583
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:20,570
The whole series will end
and in the fifth film,

3584
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:23,240
this is building up to the fifth film,

3585
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:25,770
but at the film's going to be
a puppet show we do in a cave,

3586
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:26,623
but

3587
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,730
she never fucking marry that Ag.

3588
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,350
We're going to have a nice fire.

3589
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:33,780
We're going to lay over some
bear that we just killed a,

3590
01:44:33,781 --> 01:44:34,800
as we cleaned the meat,

3591
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:35,910
you'll do your public show,

3592
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:36,941
you'll,

3593
01:44:36,941 --> 01:44:39,950
you'll explain [inaudible]
post apocalyptic,

3594
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:41,183
right.

3595
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,360
Explain how it all went down.

3596
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:43,140
Right.

3597
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:43,620
Do you think,

3598
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:43,921
uh,

3599
01:44:43,921 --> 01:44:44,271
we're,

3600
01:44:44,271 --> 01:44:45,210
we're in danger of that.

3601
01:44:45,211 --> 01:44:46,770
Do you think we're in
danger of nuclear war?

3602
01:44:46,771 --> 01:44:51,771
Is it within our grasp that we're that
stupid that we might start bombing Iran

3603
01:44:51,901 --> 01:44:53,010
and they start bombing us?

3604
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,960
Big argument is how mature a society is.

3605
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:57,531
You know,

3606
01:44:57,531 --> 01:45:01,310
if you have molecular engineering which
has come into fruition and you can have

3607
01:45:01,311 --> 01:45:03,010
someone using nanotechnology,

3608
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:06,230
create a off the shelf
with a very small lab,

3609
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:07,940
a very destructive piece of equipment,

3610
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:12,080
the size of this bottle that can wipe
out or poison or do whatever the hell

3611
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:14,060
knows to a very large landmass.

3612
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:17,870
What does that say about the culture
that feels the need to do that?

3613
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,720
Because now we have a
rebellion across the world in,

3614
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:20,860
in real terrorism,

3615
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:21,890
not the farce terrorism,

3616
01:45:21,891 --> 01:45:26,120
but there really is this angst that's
emerged from all this deprivation from

3617
01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:29,180
abuse blow back if you want to look
at it in a Chomsky hundred view.

3618
01:45:29,181 --> 01:45:32,630
I think it's a little more complicated
than that psychologically and what's

3619
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:33,051
going to happen.

3620
01:45:33,051 --> 01:45:36,320
We have a whole group of people that are
so pissed and they're so deprived that

3621
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:40,100
they begin to have abilities with
technology that far exceed anything like a

3622
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:41,720
grenade or a suitcase bomb.

3623
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:45,320
So nuclear war as an extension
of that seems almost inevitable.

3624
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,200
Not to mention the small destructive
patterns that we can have.

3625
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:51,710
I don't think people even realize that
that potential is on the horizon because

3626
01:45:51,711 --> 01:45:56,711
our world is so programmed by our daily
experiences were so used to certain

3627
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:59,960
experiences and a level of
those experiences and we're not,

3628
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:00,471
you know,

3629
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:00,961
we're we,

3630
01:46:00,961 --> 01:46:01,550
we,

3631
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:05,630
the idea that we're at war to us as some
sort of a vague thing that you see on

3632
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:07,940
television unless you've
actually been over there.

3633
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:12,590
It goes back to the point I made earlier
about the broad collective social

3634
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:14,450
conscious versus the individual.

3635
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:17,450
Until we begin to look at
society in a social way,

3636
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:19,880
when you look at each other as
yourself talking and poetic here,

3637
01:46:19,881 --> 01:46:23,540
it's just you can't have social
stability until everyone's taken care of.

3638
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:25,520
If someone's deprived and
go this side of the world,

3639
01:46:25,521 --> 01:46:27,770
I'm not safe because they can be dementia.

3640
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,970
Dementia can kick in.

3641
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,130
Who knows what biases they might emerge,

3642
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:32,930
who they might trigger and boom.

3643
01:46:32,931 --> 01:46:35,720
Suddenly a suitcase bomb explodes
behind me at some restaurant.

3644
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,430
No one's safe anymore.

3645
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:39,500
With with the technological advancement,

3646
01:46:39,501 --> 01:46:41,150
we have the risks because
she meant power plan.

3647
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:41,960
Again,

3648
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,870
you have to have a world
conscious view at this stage,

3649
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:47,420
especially with the age of
modern technology and warfare,

3650
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:50,670
or it's just as in the
words of Albert Einstein,

3651
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:52,530
our technology has exceeded our humanity.

3652
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:54,050
He said that when he experienced the,

3653
01:46:54,051 --> 01:46:54,210
you know,

3654
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:56,400
the nuclear bomb that he helped engineer,

3655
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:56,980
you know,

3656
01:46:56,980 --> 01:46:59,070
you seed saw how bad this was.

3657
01:46:59,071 --> 01:47:00,420
Even even the,

3658
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:01,254
uh,

3659
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,850
the great scientist,

3660
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:03,684
um,

3661
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:04,381
uh,

3662
01:47:04,381 --> 01:47:05,460
that's been in the wheelchair.

3663
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:06,443
Hawking,

3664
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:09,470
hawking has stated that he wants
to see everyone get off the planet.

3665
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:09,720
He's,

3666
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,340
he feels that we're already doomed.

3667
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:12,271
We have to get in,

3668
01:47:12,271 --> 01:47:14,370
populate it for the extension
of the human species.

3669
01:47:14,371 --> 01:47:18,210
We have to populate another planet because
there's no way we're going to survive

3670
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:19,410
in this one based on what we're doing.

3671
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:19,770
That's,

3672
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:22,950
these are very smart people
that think these ways.

3673
01:47:22,951 --> 01:47:27,951
So a smart people who are studying the
human race as if we're studying a colony

3674
01:47:28,171 --> 01:47:29,160
of ants are studying.

3675
01:47:29,161 --> 01:47:31,060
Anything else that you
can clearly see where the,

3676
01:47:31,061 --> 01:47:31,850
where they're headed.

3677
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:32,683
Yeah.

3678
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:36,030
It's scary unlike anything.

3679
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,080
Is it natural?

3680
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:39,180
It's all natural.

3681
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,530
It is all natural.

3682
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,500
Natural that the,

3683
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:44,334
you know,

3684
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:44,790
I,

3685
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,623
someone said this,

3686
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:47,250
I believe it was Mckenna,

3687
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,650
that every parasite is a failed Sambia.

3688
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:51,940
Interesting.

3689
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:52,440
Um,

3690
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:52,741
you know,

3691
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:57,630
what they're all trying to do
is find some sort of a mean,

3692
01:47:57,631 --> 01:48:02,070
every body is filled with other
sorts of living organisms.

3693
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:03,900
These living organisms,

3694
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:05,640
they work together in synergy.

3695
01:48:05,641 --> 01:48:06,480
They work together.

3696
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:07,563
They're,

3697
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:08,640
they're symbiotic.

3698
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:13,230
And that every parasite is like one that
didn't quite work out and just fucked

3699
01:48:13,231 --> 01:48:15,870
up and killed the host or jack the host,

3700
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:17,010
or does something terrible to those.

3701
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:20,460
Isn't it possible that
that's what technology is?

3702
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:23,130
The technology is all sort
of sort of some sort of a,

3703
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:26,760
it's some sort of a parasitic
symbiotic thing where it's,

3704
01:48:26,761 --> 01:48:28,920
it's in the middle of,

3705
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:31,590
in the middle of helping us.

3706
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:31,881
It's,

3707
01:48:31,881 --> 01:48:34,650
it's enlightening us
and it's allowing us to,

3708
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,000
to move forward.

3709
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,290
It's allowing us to,

3710
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,080
to exchange information or
rate never possible before.

3711
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:42,540
But it's also when you,

3712
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:45,330
when you establish the
highest levels of technology,

3713
01:48:45,331 --> 01:48:50,190
the often are destructive and it's going
to feed the need for people to try that

3714
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:51,360
shit out and use it.

3715
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:52,860
Well,

3716
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:57,480
there's the flaw of the broad human
psychology isn't this defense posture that

3717
01:48:57,481 --> 01:48:57,721
we've,

3718
01:48:57,721 --> 01:48:59,010
we've groomed so well.

3719
01:48:59,480 --> 01:48:59,790
You know,

3720
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:01,320
it's not the technology
that's the problem.

3721
01:49:01,321 --> 01:49:03,620
It's the fucking people
behind the technology store.

3722
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:04,301
Absolutely.

3723
01:49:04,301 --> 01:49:04,470
Let,

3724
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:04,651
I mean,

3725
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:05,484
isn't it,

3726
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,570
I mean it,

3727
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:09,340
is it almost inevitable that we,

3728
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:10,140
we,

3729
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:11,580
with this kind of power,

3730
01:49:11,581 --> 01:49:13,170
we will have this kind of behavior.

3731
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,960
Is it almost inevitable that
with ultimate power like that?

3732
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:16,680
Well,

3733
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:20,820
if there isn't a very dramatic change
in the way people think about themselves

3734
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:21,840
and how they relate to the world,

3735
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,250
it seems inevitable to me.

3736
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:25,590
How did you develop this line of thinking?

3737
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:27,540
Did you have some sort of a,

3738
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:30,000
a life changing experience
where you're always like,

3739
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:31,980
this just had great influences from,

3740
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:34,430
from Carl Sagan too,

3741
01:49:35,530 --> 01:49:40,530
to even even George Carlin and Bill Hicks
and the comedy spectrum coupled with

3742
01:49:40,891 --> 01:49:41,940
the scientific community.

3743
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:43,080
It was very influential with me,

3744
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:45,900
both from a cultural standpoint
and a progressive standpoint,

3745
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:49,480
if there's any that's most influential
would have been Carl Sagan as far as

3746
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:54,220
values because he was so in line the
guy and he smoked weed every day Sun.

3747
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:58,390
Which know that I didn't know that Carl
Sagan would smoke weed and just think

3748
01:49:58,391 --> 01:49:59,224
about space.

3749
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:00,371
It's what he did.

3750
01:50:00,371 --> 01:50:01,990
And he wrote some brute beautiful,

3751
01:50:01,991 --> 01:50:03,940
eloquent essays on cannabis use.

3752
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,370
Did it.

3753
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:05,190
And I wasn't aware of that.

3754
01:50:05,190 --> 01:50:05,480
Yeah,

3755
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:06,940
it was brilliant golf [inaudible] seconds.

3756
01:50:06,941 --> 01:50:07,774
Amazing.

3757
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:08,500
So you know,

3758
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,120
it's a long value shift and I,

3759
01:50:10,121 --> 01:50:10,331
you know,

3760
01:50:10,331 --> 01:50:13,270
I went through the same stuff of anger
and everything else and I think a lot of

3761
01:50:13,271 --> 01:50:13,750
people do.

3762
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:17,500
And then I met even more people that
fascinated me and a lot of authors,

3763
01:50:18,390 --> 01:50:22,330
there's so many brilliant minds out there
from Joc Fresco at Buckminster Fuller

3764
01:50:22,331 --> 01:50:23,410
to Nicola frescoes.

3765
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,180
The guidance ahead of that Venus project,

3766
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:25,961
is that who he is,

3767
01:50:25,961 --> 01:50:27,130
the director of the Venus project.

3768
01:50:27,131 --> 01:50:27,430
Yeah.

3769
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:28,850
And the Venus project is,

3770
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:30,460
explain that to me cause they,

3771
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,191
this is a,

3772
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:34,450
they are a resource based
economy and is probably,

3773
01:50:34,451 --> 01:50:34,901
it is a,

3774
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:35,590
is a,

3775
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:36,910
is a concept,

3776
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,460
a encapsulated concept
put forward by Jock,

3777
01:50:39,490 --> 01:50:41,650
which goes farther than
a train of thought.

3778
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:45,100
It actually in Po design actually has
design issues that he's come up with

3779
01:50:45,101 --> 01:50:45,671
throughout the years.

3780
01:50:45,671 --> 01:50:48,010
He's about 95 now and very brilliant,

3781
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,060
very brilliant guy.

3782
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:54,810
They basically are promoting very specific
systems and the zeitgeists movement

3783
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:58,810
promotes long trains of thought
without being specific to a design.

3784
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:00,430
We used to be in partnership,

3785
01:51:00,431 --> 01:51:03,310
the Venus project in the zeitgeists
movement and you guys fell apart.

3786
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:04,750
There was a falling out
there unfortunately.

3787
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,613
What happened?

3788
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:06,581
Hard to explain,

3789
01:51:06,581 --> 01:51:11,581
it was a kind of a personality dropoff
of motivations of code for Hippie Pussy.

3790
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,391
That's what it was.

3791
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:15,940
They were fighting over
Hippie Pussy Jack Fresco's.

3792
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:18,670
You should be at the top of the
heap when you're 95 years old.

3793
01:51:18,671 --> 01:51:21,310
You've been doing this forever and this
young whippersnapper comes along making

3794
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:22,540
it's fucking films like pitch.

3795
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:23,290
I've got a map,

3796
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:24,490
I've got a map for the future.

3797
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,051
So this,

3798
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:26,410
uh,

3799
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:29,590
he's very specific as
far as like engineering,

3800
01:51:29,591 --> 01:51:31,000
this sort of a society,

3801
01:51:31,001 --> 01:51:32,860
industrial designer and social engineer.

3802
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:33,291
Ah,

3803
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:37,300
so he spent a great deal of time doing
it and it's just like Buckminster Fuller,

3804
01:51:37,301 --> 01:51:38,740
which I think is a good counterpart.

3805
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:42,820
These are prominent guys that have really
tried to push forward with new ideas

3806
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:43,990
and many different genres.

3807
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:46,750
Not to mention approaches
to the entire social system.

3808
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:47,490
Hi.

3809
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:48,150
Um,

3810
01:51:48,150 --> 01:51:48,511
you know,

3811
01:51:48,511 --> 01:51:53,130
I watch a lot of things online
and when I sit in front of it,

3812
01:51:53,131 --> 01:51:54,010
I do tooth.

3813
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:54,411
I mean I'm,

3814
01:51:54,411 --> 01:51:54,610
yeah,

3815
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:57,180
I absorb whatever someone's putting out.

3816
01:51:57,181 --> 01:51:58,860
Of course I listened to their message,

3817
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:00,120
but I also,

3818
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:02,700
when I see something like
what Chunk Fresco is saying,

3819
01:52:02,701 --> 01:52:02,880
oh,

3820
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,750
I tried to look at it as if I was someone.

3821
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:07,643
Uh,

3822
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:13,310
I was someone who is in some sort of
a position of power in government.

3823
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:14,161
You know,

3824
01:52:14,161 --> 01:52:16,530
I was someone who was in some
sort of a position of power,

3825
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:17,600
of political influence,

3826
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:18,001
you know,

3827
01:52:18,001 --> 01:52:18,721
running the banks,

3828
01:52:18,721 --> 01:52:19,411
running the world,

3829
01:52:19,411 --> 01:52:20,340
the IMF,

3830
01:52:20,341 --> 01:52:22,200
whoever the fuck it is that
pulls the strings for the world.

3831
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:23,041
And I would say,

3832
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:24,240
how do I deal with this guy?

3833
01:52:24,930 --> 01:52:25,350
What do I,

3834
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:25,920
what do I,

3835
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,210
does this guy a problem?

3836
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,190
Is this guy ever going to be for real?

3837
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:31,760
Is this ever going to be an issue
that I have to deal with this,

3838
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:32,551
this guy,

3839
01:52:32,551 --> 01:52:35,730
and debate him as to how the
world's resources should be used?

3840
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:36,361
I mean,

3841
01:52:36,361 --> 01:52:37,194
is this a,

3842
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:39,780
is that a concern for a guy like that?

3843
01:52:39,781 --> 01:52:40,021
I mean,

3844
01:52:40,021 --> 01:52:41,010
do you use,

3845
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:45,500
do you think that a guy like him or
like you do you guys have to with

3846
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:47,690
someone?

3847
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,890
It depends on how far we go.

3848
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:49,940
I think anyone in the,

3849
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,260
you think that right?

3850
01:52:51,261 --> 01:52:52,880
Do you think like as far
as like moving forward,

3851
01:52:52,881 --> 01:52:53,151
let me give,

3852
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:55,910
you did buy the land and get the
people to start living there.

3853
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:57,260
That's when you would have an issue.

3854
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:57,460
Well,

3855
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,011
well I don't,

3856
01:52:58,011 --> 01:52:58,311
again,

3857
01:52:58,311 --> 01:52:59,420
I don't advocate such a thing.

3858
01:52:59,421 --> 01:53:02,510
I don't advocate running from this
system big is your file the FBI file?

3859
01:53:02,511 --> 01:53:03,344
They have idea.

3860
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:04,730
If you had to guess.

3861
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:06,230
I thought it was fucking massive.

3862
01:53:06,231 --> 01:53:06,590
Right?

3863
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:07,221
I don't know.

3864
01:53:07,221 --> 01:53:10,040
I don't know what you don't care if you
started running your very young right

3865
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:10,281
now.

3866
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:11,114
Like how old are you?

3867
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:12,400
39 no,

3868
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,660
30 to 32 that's amazing.

3869
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,320
Oh,

3870
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,940
you're 32 that's incredible.

3871
01:53:16,941 --> 01:53:18,500
So when you came out
with the first site guys,

3872
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:19,334
how old were you?

3873
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,510
When I was four years ago.

3874
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:22,070
So it was 20 holy Shit.

3875
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:24,470
So you were in your twenties
when you put that together.

3876
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:26,010
That's a very unusual man.

3877
01:53:26,011 --> 01:53:27,470
And you're a very unusual talker.

3878
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:27,821
You know,

3879
01:53:27,821 --> 01:53:27,970
if,

3880
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:30,350
if you're only 29 that's what you said.

3881
01:53:30,351 --> 01:53:34,370
32 32 32 so that's very unusual man.

3882
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:35,120
So what does it,

3883
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,730
what do you have to be to be
president 36 something like that.

3884
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,760
I'm not going to be president,

3885
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:40,380
but now,

3886
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,270
but we for real,

3887
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,490
you say that there's someone come along.

3888
01:53:43,491 --> 01:53:45,010
I don't believe in the system
that I don't believe in.

3889
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:46,850
The system changes a little bit.

3890
01:53:46,851 --> 01:53:47,331
Listen man,

3891
01:53:47,331 --> 01:53:48,290
you could run this shit.

3892
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,160
Well,

3893
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:51,980
the next project is something called
the global redesign institute,

3894
01:53:51,981 --> 01:53:53,450
which can be a nonprofit I'm founding,

3895
01:53:53,451 --> 01:53:56,000
which is going to basically
take artists and engineers,

3896
01:53:56,001 --> 01:53:59,340
get them together to show how to
redesign and the infrastructure.

3897
01:53:59,341 --> 01:54:02,750
But for particular regions in
the most sustainable nonmonetary,

3898
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:03,531
most sustainable,

3899
01:54:03,531 --> 01:54:05,120
practical and efficient way possible.

3900
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:06,201
So for example,

3901
01:54:06,201 --> 01:54:07,340
you could take Los Angeles,

3902
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:10,280
you could show the public and
conference it completely new,

3903
01:54:10,281 --> 01:54:12,740
redesigned that didn't say
have cars sitting at a gas,

3904
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:13,401
excuse me,

3905
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:14,810
sitting at stop lights,

3906
01:54:14,811 --> 01:54:14,991
you know,

3907
01:54:14,991 --> 01:54:15,741
wasting gas.

3908
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:16,850
How much gas is based in,

3909
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:18,950
but the inefficiency of
the stoplight system,

3910
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,410
at least Europe has those
roundabouts semi better.

3911
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:25,130
But you could think of all sorts of
creative means up and over systems.

3912
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:25,431
You know,

3913
01:54:25,431 --> 01:54:28,520
a lot of cars they stop and they
shut off actually at red lights.

3914
01:54:28,521 --> 01:54:28,970
Now.

3915
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:29,750
That's good.

3916
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:30,381
That's smart.

3917
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:31,011
But then when you leave,

3918
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:32,030
when you want off the gas,

3919
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:32,864
they start again.

3920
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:33,701
New Technology.

3921
01:54:33,701 --> 01:54:35,330
I've seen that with a
couple with batteries stuff.

3922
01:54:35,331 --> 01:54:35,810
Yeah.

3923
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:36,051
Yeah.

3924
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:37,670
It's a engines as well.

3925
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,330
Um,

3926
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:39,260
so the machine engine,

3927
01:54:39,261 --> 01:54:41,490
we see how the concept of efficiency is,

3928
01:54:41,491 --> 01:54:45,020
is vast pressure transducers and
streets that can power the lights.

3929
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:45,270
You know,

3930
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:48,170
he'd grab pressure transducers and
these walls that could help power the

3931
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:49,910
lighting system in the building.

3932
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:53,600
There's so many things that
could be applied to society
to make it so grandiose,

3933
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:57,200
efficient that would rule out
the market system by default.

3934
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:01,370
But it would solve so many problems of
poverty and hunger and even conflict and

3935
01:55:01,371 --> 01:55:03,830
petty crime and most
crimes related to money.

3936
01:55:03,831 --> 01:55:03,951
You know,

3937
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:05,660
you can eliminate so many massive things,

3938
01:55:05,661 --> 01:55:08,810
not a utopia if you just applied
the most efficient means.

3939
01:55:08,811 --> 01:55:09,470
And give people,

3940
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:09,590
you know,

3941
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:13,250
vertical farms with the coast of Los
Angeles running d sound as processes from

3942
01:55:13,251 --> 01:55:14,390
the water boom,

3943
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:16,850
organic vertical farms
feed everyone locally.

3944
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,380
Forget globalization.

3945
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:20,690
Think of how much energy
is wasted on globalization,

3946
01:55:20,691 --> 01:55:21,760
moving shit back and forth.

3947
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:22,820
Product made here in China,

3948
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,500
assembled over here in Uganda.

3949
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:24,911
You know,

3950
01:55:24,911 --> 01:55:25,551
it's nuts.

3951
01:55:25,551 --> 01:55:26,384
What we're doing.

3952
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:27,710
When you take that stand point,

3953
01:55:27,711 --> 01:55:28,760
you begin to see how yes,

3954
01:55:28,761 --> 01:55:30,140
you can feed everybody on this planet.

3955
01:55:30,141 --> 01:55:31,910
You can have everyone
having access abundance.

3956
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:32,990
We call it on this planet.

3957
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:35,060
It doesn't mean you have
everything you want.

3958
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:36,410
That's impossible.

3959
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,930
The very idea of having
everything possible,

3960
01:55:38,931 --> 01:55:39,700
which is the catalyst,

3961
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:40,730
everybody can't be the salt.

3962
01:55:40,731 --> 01:55:41,564
Number nine,

3963
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:44,520
well everyone can have a 50 room mansion
or two jets parked in the front lawn.

3964
01:55:44,521 --> 01:55:45,840
That's actually an act of violence.

3965
01:55:45,841 --> 01:55:46,651
If you think about it,

3966
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:47,550
social violence,

3967
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,610
it is.

3968
01:55:48,610 --> 01:55:51,120
There's an act of violence to think
that way because you're the amount of

3969
01:55:51,121 --> 01:55:53,220
deprivation you're
imposing on somebody else.

3970
01:55:53,221 --> 01:55:54,600
By that acquisition of resources,

3971
01:55:54,601 --> 01:55:58,350
which was so excessive is in fact
inhibiting other people's lives one way or

3972
01:55:58,351 --> 01:55:59,184
another.

3973
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:00,053
So wait a minute.

3974
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:02,550
By having a jet or whatever,

3975
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:05,460
how big that is of such an such access.

3976
01:56:05,461 --> 01:56:06,840
And you can be subjective on this,

3977
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,580
but anything that has no utility,

3978
01:56:08,581 --> 01:56:13,260
it's of such access and vanity such as
one guy living with his small family and

3979
01:56:13,261 --> 01:56:17,880
a 40 room mansion and having to massive
gas guzzling jets parked in the front

3980
01:56:17,881 --> 01:56:19,770
lawn just because he can.

3981
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,540
Who does that Travolta Travolta.

3982
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:22,360
Does he do that?

3983
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:23,170
Yep.

3984
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:23,881
Well listen,

3985
01:56:23,881 --> 01:56:27,500
you got to fly that Dick in from
all over the world to make sure,

3986
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:31,140
but we'll have to keep quiet
fox magic and he goes so far,

3987
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,250
I get that argument though.

3988
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:32,941
Someone says to me,

3989
01:56:32,941 --> 01:56:36,750
well I don't like your system cause
what if I want to have four Ferrari's as

3990
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:38,100
though that's a utility need.

3991
01:56:38,101 --> 01:56:39,150
It's a complete value orientation.

3992
01:56:39,151 --> 01:56:39,331
I say,

3993
01:56:39,331 --> 01:56:41,790
well what if I want to
have Africa is my backyard?

3994
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:42,653
Is that okay?

3995
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:44,550
What if I want to block off Africa?

3996
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:45,440
Africa is might be,

3997
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:49,440
that's this form can buy Africa if you
have so much money that you could slowly

3998
01:56:49,441 --> 01:56:51,090
buy up the entirety of Africa.

3999
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:52,650
But you see the point by Africa.

4000
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:53,551
So is there a,

4001
01:56:53,551 --> 01:56:57,040
is this a competitive society as
their competition in this society?

4002
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,100
Competition would be within
one square development,

4003
01:56:59,101 --> 01:57:01,800
which is when real competition
is about accelerating yourself,

4004
01:57:01,801 --> 01:57:02,940
not against somebody else.

4005
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:03,361
You know,

4006
01:57:03,361 --> 01:57:07,550
I could completely see how people in like
a sports it advanced society and like

4007
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:08,440
a sports context,

4008
01:57:08,441 --> 01:57:10,470
they're not really thinking
about beating somebody else.

4009
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:11,910
They thinking about beating themselves,

4010
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,010
thinking of improving
their own betterment.

4011
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:15,010
It doesn't become something.

4012
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,710
The process somebody gets beaten up.

4013
01:57:16,711 --> 01:57:17,760
That is a lot of the,

4014
01:57:17,761 --> 01:57:19,200
a lot of the motivation,

4015
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:19,391
you know,

4016
01:57:19,391 --> 01:57:20,520
if you ever talked to anybody,

4017
01:57:20,521 --> 01:57:21,390
very competitive,

4018
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:24,690
it's not just about them
performing at their best,

4019
01:57:24,691 --> 01:57:25,524
it's about winning.

4020
01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:26,250
I'm sure it is.

4021
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:26,521
Sure it is.

4022
01:57:26,521 --> 01:57:27,570
If that's what the culture be enforced,

4023
01:57:27,571 --> 01:57:30,420
everything's about winning
culture definitely reinforces it.

4024
01:57:30,421 --> 01:57:31,051
But it's also,

4025
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:33,780
I think a piece piece of human
nature is involved in that as well.

4026
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:34,950
It's two universal.

4027
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:36,270
It's not just this culture.

4028
01:57:36,271 --> 01:57:39,420
It's pretty much any culture where
any sort of competition starts going.

4029
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:40,051
You know,

4030
01:57:40,051 --> 01:57:40,471
people,

4031
01:57:40,471 --> 01:57:41,970
people want to win.

4032
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:42,361
You know,

4033
01:57:42,361 --> 01:57:42,751
it's a,

4034
01:57:42,751 --> 01:57:46,650
it's a natural thing and I think it might
be one of the reasons why it's driven

4035
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:49,680
innovation to such a
radical tipping point.

4036
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:52,920
You talked to anyone who knew Steve
jobs or anybody who knows Bill Gates.

4037
01:57:52,921 --> 01:57:55,830
One of the things I'll tell you is how
incredibly competitive these guys are.

4038
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:57,000
Very competitive.

4039
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,130
I think it exists on a
different level though,

4040
01:57:59,131 --> 01:58:00,540
and it was a lot of flexibility to it.

4041
01:58:00,541 --> 01:58:02,700
I'm not denying that it exists,

4042
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:03,540
but for me,

4043
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:03,660
I'm,

4044
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:04,590
I'm not competitive.

4045
01:58:04,591 --> 01:58:05,900
I have no interest in the,

4046
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:08,130
but you're also not the head of Microsoft.

4047
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:09,870
You're not putting out computers.

4048
01:58:09,871 --> 01:58:10,441
You know what I'm saying?

4049
01:58:10,441 --> 01:58:10,741
You know,

4050
01:58:10,741 --> 01:58:12,390
done an amazing thing creatively.

4051
01:58:12,391 --> 01:58:14,880
But in order to push innovation,

4052
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:18,180
in order to push a company to
push success and achievement,

4053
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:21,460
if you must feel like you have to have
some sort of a sense of competitive on a

4054
01:58:21,461 --> 01:58:22,860
market system in variable,

4055
01:58:22,861 --> 01:58:23,581
you have to be competitive.

4056
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:24,414
If you're going to fail,

4057
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,380
you're gonna fail financially.

4058
01:58:25,381 --> 01:58:26,490
You're going to fail in your status.

4059
01:58:26,491 --> 01:58:29,910
If you look at Steve jobs writings and
his talks and the guy was a very creative

4060
01:58:29,911 --> 01:58:32,220
individual that you could
tell that as money aside.

4061
01:58:32,221 --> 01:58:34,260
He wasn't motivated by
that incentive for one.

4062
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:35,760
And I think his interest
to be competitive,

4063
01:58:35,761 --> 01:58:40,350
it was really just to make the best he
could for whatever demographic or concept

4064
01:58:40,351 --> 01:58:42,460
or idea and of course to
compete against Microsoft

4065
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,900
to make sure he maintains
his market share.

4066
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:46,810
So competition is inherent to
the game that they're playing.

4067
01:58:46,811 --> 01:58:47,081
That's,

4068
01:58:47,081 --> 01:58:47,950
I guess that's my point.

4069
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:48,903
Who knows though,

4070
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:49,710
you know,

4071
01:58:49,710 --> 01:58:51,910
am I competitive with other people?

4072
01:58:51,911 --> 01:58:56,911
It depends on the context of and also
the conditioning within that context of

4073
01:58:57,011 --> 01:58:57,844
what I'm doing.

4074
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:00,430
If I have to survive and have to
go into a fight with somebody,

4075
01:59:00,431 --> 01:59:01,900
well that's an obvious competition.

4076
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:04,090
That's something that my
life might depend upon.

4077
01:59:04,091 --> 01:59:07,930
So obviously there's something ingrained
there that means we respond that way.

4078
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:08,471
But again,

4079
01:59:08,471 --> 01:59:08,920
back to the,

4080
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:09,101
you know,

4081
01:59:09,101 --> 01:59:09,301
the,

4082
01:59:09,301 --> 01:59:11,230
the later existence of
the prefrontal Cortex,

4083
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:13,030
we don't have to operate that.

4084
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:15,820
When someone goes into a bar and steps
on my foot or insults my girlfriend,

4085
01:59:15,821 --> 01:59:17,290
I don't have to beat the shit out of him.

4086
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:17,990
I could say,

4087
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:18,430
Huh,

4088
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:19,270
there's another dip shit,

4089
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:22,690
one of many and walk away or I can save.

4090
01:59:22,691 --> 01:59:23,740
There's another victim of cultures,

4091
01:59:23,741 --> 01:59:27,040
all sorts of responses that we could
have that are not based on that reaction.

4092
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:27,221
Yeah,

4093
01:59:27,221 --> 01:59:28,600
there's certainly a lot of fights.

4094
01:59:28,601 --> 01:59:29,250
You're going to void.

4095
01:59:29,250 --> 01:59:31,960
I was having that conversation
with someone today.

4096
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:32,600
It's like,

4097
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,310
you know,

4098
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,570
avoid everything you can.

4099
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,310
If you can get out of something,

4100
01:59:36,311 --> 01:59:37,510
talk to someone and get out of it.

4101
01:59:37,511 --> 01:59:37,991
Get out of it.

4102
01:59:37,991 --> 01:59:40,030
What are you crazy and you want
to get in fights with people.

4103
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:40,401
Oh,

4104
01:59:40,401 --> 01:59:41,234
it's amazing.

4105
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:44,240
This guy interviewed James Giligan
who was like guy moving forward.

4106
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:45,083
He's one of the most,

4107
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:46,641
one of the most,

4108
01:59:46,641 --> 01:59:47,090
uh,

4109
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:47,211
uh,

4110
01:59:47,211 --> 01:59:51,860
claimed a criminal psychologist and he
would talk about shame and the issues of

4111
01:59:51,861 --> 01:59:55,880
shame and why people behave so violently
spent his whole life analyzing violent

4112
01:59:55,881 --> 01:59:56,361
behavior.

4113
01:59:56,361 --> 01:59:59,960
Grave gave a great insight into serial
killers and a lot of people that you

4114
01:59:59,961 --> 02:00:01,580
think are natural outgrowths,

4115
02:00:01,581 --> 02:00:04,160
they're just typical of the
system or typical of humanity,

4116
02:00:04,161 --> 02:00:04,994
if you will,

4117
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:06,950
and he found it on those
throughout the entire thing.

4118
02:00:06,951 --> 02:00:09,080
It was based on a form
of humiliation and shame,

4119
02:00:09,081 --> 02:00:12,590
and what was so fascinating is that the
majority of the instances of violence

4120
02:00:12,650 --> 02:00:15,200
happened in the most mundane
and arbitrary circumstances.

4121
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:16,250
It wasn't life threatening.

4122
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:20,660
Someone would literally insult somebody
else and they would get really upset by

4123
02:00:20,661 --> 02:00:25,370
that and the shame that they would feel
from being so small from getting upset

4124
02:00:25,371 --> 02:00:26,031
from someone saying,

4125
02:00:26,031 --> 02:00:26,864
fuck you,

4126
02:00:27,140 --> 02:00:31,320
caused that much more reinforcement of
their anger to get into a physical brawl.

4127
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:32,211
It was fascinating.

4128
02:00:32,211 --> 02:00:33,140
It's a fascinating subject.

4129
02:00:33,141 --> 02:00:35,440
I recommend anyone that's interested
in violent behavior to look up.

4130
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:36,293
James Giligan.

4131
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:37,500
Well,

4132
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,080
you know,

4133
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:41,700
I am a huge student of human nature,

4134
02:00:41,701 --> 02:00:46,590
especially human contact and conflict
and aggression and retrain as a fighter,

4135
02:00:46,591 --> 02:00:46,830
right?

4136
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:47,041
Yeah.

4137
02:00:47,041 --> 02:00:51,450
I've done martial arts my whole life and
I think that's a huge part of being a

4138
02:00:51,451 --> 02:00:52,284
human being.

4139
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:53,790
I think every man,

4140
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:57,270
if you're going to have to deal with
some form of aggression in your life,

4141
02:00:57,271 --> 02:01:00,780
you're going to ultimately worry or
wonder what happens if this becomes

4142
02:01:00,781 --> 02:01:01,614
physical.

4143
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:05,520
And I think taking that off the table
and learning martial arts as it just as

4144
02:01:05,521 --> 02:01:08,730
the animal human being is
a great way to prevent m.

4145
02:01:08,731 --> 02:01:09,870
Anybody ever fighting?

4146
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,420
I've never seen a fight at a Dojo.

4147
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:13,960
I've never seen a fight at a,

4148
02:01:13,961 --> 02:01:15,030
at a Jujitsu gym.

4149
02:01:15,031 --> 02:01:16,080
I've never seen a fight.

4150
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:16,950
I mean I,

4151
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:17,610
I've,

4152
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:19,680
I've never seen a fight between fighters.

4153
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:20,541
You know,

4154
02:01:20,541 --> 02:01:21,780
Mo for the most part,

4155
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:26,400
most fighters they can communicate better
because they know that they don't want

4156
02:01:26,401 --> 02:01:26,790
to fight.

4157
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:27,990
Like they don't have anything to prove.

4158
02:01:27,991 --> 02:01:29,060
They know exactly what they can

4159
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:29,551
look at.

4160
02:01:29,551 --> 02:01:30,840
The philosophy of Bruce Lee.

4161
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:31,501
I mean,

4162
02:01:31,501 --> 02:01:32,290
he was amazing.

4163
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:32,681
There's a few,

4164
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:35,420
I mean there's been a few brawls
post-fight brawls cause the people get an

4165
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:39,830
emotional and there's a famous one on
cvs a while back where mayhem Miller and

4166
02:01:39,831 --> 02:01:42,010
the Diaz brothers went at it on CBS.

4167
02:01:42,011 --> 02:01:42,890
It was kind of ridiculous.

4168
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,180
But yeah,

4169
02:01:44,181 --> 02:01:46,850
I mean for the most part though,

4170
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:50,510
the amount of altercations that you're
going to get if you're hanging around

4171
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:52,280
train martial artists are way fewer,

4172
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:52,881
you know,

4173
02:01:52,881 --> 02:01:54,380
a amongst themselves,

4174
02:01:54,381 --> 02:01:58,550
they're very rare and it either you put
them amongst any other group of athletic

4175
02:01:58,551 --> 02:01:59,580
aggressive individuals,

4176
02:01:59,581 --> 02:02:01,130
you're going to have much more conflict.

4177
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:03,530
I think you take it
off the table once you,

4178
02:02:03,531 --> 02:02:03,711
uh,

4179
02:02:03,711 --> 02:02:05,120
address it and you understand it.

4180
02:02:05,121 --> 02:02:07,220
It's like with a lot of people,

4181
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:10,640
the idea of kicking someone's ass really
a big part of it is that they don't

4182
02:02:10,641 --> 02:02:11,810
want their own ass kicked.

4183
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:13,101
It's a fear.

4184
02:02:13,101 --> 02:02:14,020
It's like an overconfidence

4185
02:02:14,970 --> 02:02:15,990
initial fear.

4186
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:16,320
Yeah,

4187
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:16,471
no,

4188
02:02:16,471 --> 02:02:17,100
totally.

4189
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:17,371
Totally.

4190
02:02:17,371 --> 02:02:18,204
It is.

4191
02:02:18,330 --> 02:02:20,040
We need to figure this fucking thing out.

4192
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:20,790
Peter Joseph,

4193
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:21,623
goddammit,

4194
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:22,920
we're closing in on it.

4195
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:24,990
We're clone is closing in on some,

4196
02:02:24,991 --> 02:02:25,681
some real,

4197
02:02:25,681 --> 02:02:26,250
uh,

4198
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:27,210
interesting lessons.

4199
02:02:27,330 --> 02:02:27,451
Well,

4200
02:02:27,451 --> 02:02:28,140
if you want them,

4201
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:29,780
I can go back to your question,

4202
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:33,450
I guess from like 20 minutes ago regarding
what the system would be if I was the

4203
02:02:33,451 --> 02:02:34,284
leader of it,

4204
02:02:34,290 --> 02:02:35,760
which is a farce notion,

4205
02:02:35,761 --> 02:02:36,800
but what would the firing,

4206
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:38,400
I said King,

4207
02:02:39,090 --> 02:02:39,630
what would,

4208
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:42,000
what would define a new value system?

4209
02:02:42,001 --> 02:02:44,400
What would define a new sense
of operation and if you track,

4210
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:46,080
you track a fundamental train of thought.

4211
02:02:46,081 --> 02:02:47,760
You arrive at a series of conclusions.

4212
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,090
The first is he get rid of the property
system as we know it and you create an

4213
02:02:51,091 --> 02:02:52,020
access system.

4214
02:02:52,230 --> 02:02:54,270
Best example is the Zipcar New York.

4215
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:55,133
Amazing.

4216
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:55,661
I love that.

4217
02:02:55,661 --> 02:02:56,494
I love the ZIP car.

4218
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:57,151
People don't know.

4219
02:02:57,151 --> 02:02:57,661
Explain it.

4220
02:02:57,661 --> 02:02:58,070
It's amazing.

4221
02:02:58,070 --> 02:03:00,860
Zipcar is just a rental car
that's very easily accessible.

4222
02:03:00,861 --> 02:03:02,820
It would be special keys
and they come and they'll,

4223
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:07,170
they'll drop the car off or they'll
leave it at a place that's close to you.

4224
02:03:07,171 --> 02:03:08,400
It's all proximity oriented,

4225
02:03:08,401 --> 02:03:12,150
computer generated and basically you can
have a car and drive it and then return

4226
02:03:12,151 --> 02:03:14,970
it and it's like a rental car
except it's more convenient.

4227
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:15,991
That's beautiful.

4228
02:03:15,991 --> 02:03:18,270
Most people's cars sit and driveways
for the majority of their life.

4229
02:03:18,630 --> 02:03:19,560
That's a great idea.

4230
02:03:19,561 --> 02:03:24,561
Access access system versus a system of
property is the most efficient concept

4231
02:03:25,231 --> 02:03:25,771
of social,

4232
02:03:25,771 --> 02:03:26,101
excuse me,

4233
02:03:26,101 --> 02:03:27,120
of environmental management.

4234
02:03:27,121 --> 02:03:27,954
You can have think about it.

4235
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:29,700
It's so stupid for everyone.

4236
02:03:29,701 --> 02:03:29,851
I've,

4237
02:03:29,851 --> 02:03:32,550
I've so much film equipment
stuffed in like closets.

4238
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:33,900
I would love to just to rent it,

4239
02:03:33,901 --> 02:03:35,460
but I can't do it cause I had no value.

4240
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:36,570
I have to get to resell it.

4241
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:39,210
I'd spend much more money renting this
stuff over and over again and then owning

4242
02:03:39,211 --> 02:03:40,410
it so it goes against it.

4243
02:03:40,411 --> 02:03:41,360
And then monetary sense,

4244
02:03:41,370 --> 02:03:42,550
monetarily inefficient

4245
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:46,850
car concept is a great idea for someone
who wants to live in a place like New

4246
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:50,000
York City where it's just prohibitively
expensive to try to have a parking spot

4247
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:50,621
anywhere.

4248
02:03:50,621 --> 02:03:51,190
If you had,

4249
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:52,600
if you had a society designed,

4250
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:53,021
first of all,

4251
02:03:53,021 --> 02:03:53,741
if you're in an inner city,

4252
02:03:53,741 --> 02:03:57,130
you really want to get public transit
working well because that's the best way

4253
02:03:57,131 --> 02:03:57,431
to do it.

4254
02:03:57,431 --> 02:03:57,701
Anyway,

4255
02:03:57,701 --> 02:03:57,900
we,

4256
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,200
there's so many failures.

4257
02:03:59,610 --> 02:03:59,980
I,

4258
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:00,141
I,

4259
02:04:00,141 --> 02:04:03,820
my great grandfather was an engineer
and he had designed the system in Los

4260
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:04,540
Angeles years ago,

4261
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:05,380
many years ago,

4262
02:04:05,381 --> 02:04:07,120
which was a trolley system that was above,

4263
02:04:07,121 --> 02:04:07,751
above ground,

4264
02:04:07,751 --> 02:04:08,050
wasn't,

4265
02:04:08,050 --> 02:04:08,830
wasn't uh,

4266
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:11,290
susceptible to two earthquakes.

4267
02:04:11,291 --> 02:04:12,011
It was brilliant.

4268
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:12,401
And I was like,

4269
02:04:12,401 --> 02:04:13,870
why didn't they put this in back then?

4270
02:04:13,871 --> 02:04:16,300
It was like one of the first
transit ideas for Los Angeles.

4271
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:17,351
And even to this day,

4272
02:04:17,351 --> 02:04:17,600
you have a,

4273
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:18,430
you know you have the,

4274
02:04:18,430 --> 02:04:20,050
you have the subway,

4275
02:04:20,051 --> 02:04:20,861
but that's nominal.

4276
02:04:20,861 --> 02:04:23,890
It doesn't really go anywhere and
you have these cars just coming here.

4277
02:04:23,891 --> 02:04:26,710
I was just want to blow my brains
out in traffic and cars and he said,

4278
02:04:26,711 --> 02:04:27,910
you can't keep operating like this.

4279
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:28,181
Eventually.

4280
02:04:28,181 --> 02:04:29,410
They're gonna do what
they do in Latin America.

4281
02:04:29,411 --> 02:04:31,370
They're going to have you
driving by license plate number.

4282
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:31,511
You know,

4283
02:04:31,511 --> 02:04:32,770
they do that in Latin America.

4284
02:04:32,771 --> 02:04:35,380
You can't even drive and uncertain times.

4285
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:36,551
I mean,

4286
02:04:36,551 --> 02:04:37,230
what's going to happen,

4287
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:39,930
population can use to increase and we
had these inefficient systems in place.

4288
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:40,531
We need it to.

4289
02:04:40,531 --> 02:04:42,000
Mexico City's like that right now.

4290
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:42,863
No sure.

4291
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:43,720
Mexico City.

4292
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:44,740
It's just unbelievable.

4293
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:45,541
Always traffic.

4294
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:46,530
Just traffic all day.

4295
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:46,960
Yeah.

4296
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:47,793
It's ridiculous.

4297
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:49,030
Even in China,

4298
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:52,980
they've been moving out the
bikes or they've been trying
to motivate consumerism

4299
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:54,930
in China to get people to buy cars.

4300
02:04:54,931 --> 02:04:56,040
Why is this good for GDP?

4301
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:56,461
Oh Great.

4302
02:04:56,461 --> 02:04:58,920
So they can create more air pollution
and create more congestion on their

4303
02:04:58,921 --> 02:04:59,754
streets as well.

4304
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:01,690
Everything is antithesis.

4305
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:02,431
The opposite.

4306
02:05:02,431 --> 02:05:03,510
It's an anti economy.

4307
02:05:03,511 --> 02:05:06,630
It ass backwards from top to bottom
with the way we approach our economic

4308
02:05:06,631 --> 02:05:07,464
structure.

4309
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:08,880
So how do we fix it?

4310
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,100
We have to wait for it to fall apart.

4311
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:13,680
It's wait for him our own shit and
then we have to show the audit show.

4312
02:05:13,681 --> 02:05:14,101
As I mentioned,

4313
02:05:14,101 --> 02:05:14,970
the global redesign institute.

4314
02:05:14,971 --> 02:05:18,420
You have to show the world and alternative
that they can understand to see how

4315
02:05:18,421 --> 02:05:19,560
these problems can be resolved.

4316
02:05:19,561 --> 02:05:23,880
And then I advocate a parallel government
system as radical as that statement

4317
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:24,714
sentence.

4318
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:27,400
I have her low government
one government well appear.

4319
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:30,750
Well you have the existing government
in whatever region or in its holistic

4320
02:05:30,751 --> 02:05:32,970
sense as far as say the United Nations,

4321
02:05:32,971 --> 02:05:33,804
if you will.

4322
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:36,570
The parallel system would be a group of
people that are not politicians and not

4323
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:40,340
jockeying for public support and public
opinion manipulating the values and

4324
02:05:40,350 --> 02:05:41,790
abortion and gay rights,

4325
02:05:41,791 --> 02:05:43,520
this and gay marriage that they,

4326
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:46,950
those to become nominally obsolete
because they are completely irrelevant

4327
02:05:46,951 --> 02:05:48,180
culturally compared to
what the problem is.

4328
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:52,980
We have the group of technicians and
engineers and thinkers and creators that

4329
02:05:52,981 --> 02:05:56,280
want to simply design the infrastructure
of society correctly to meet the needs

4330
02:05:56,281 --> 02:05:57,300
of the human population.

4331
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,430
And with that train of thought,

4332
02:05:59,431 --> 02:06:01,320
I guarantee you people will
be chomping at the bit,

4333
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:06,360
volunteer to show what they can do to
make society more efficient and as a side

4334
02:06:06,361 --> 02:06:07,680
product of that money,

4335
02:06:07,681 --> 02:06:08,550
it goes out the window.

4336
02:06:08,551 --> 02:06:11,040
Because if you really
detailed the issue of money,

4337
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:14,910
you can't have an efficient system
in the market model of economics.

4338
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,930
Truly efficient.

4339
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:16,853
It's impossible.

4340
02:06:17,130 --> 02:06:17,851
One final point,

4341
02:06:17,851 --> 02:06:18,511
green economy,

4342
02:06:18,511 --> 02:06:19,590
everyone must up a green economy,

4343
02:06:19,591 --> 02:06:20,040
right?

4344
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:21,870
The green economy books
written on green economy.

4345
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:27,030
Green economy is impossible also in a
monetary system because of the inherent

4346
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,330
flaw of cost efficiency,

4347
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:34,380
needing to cut corners to get the right
product to make it so people can buy it.

4348
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:36,900
The inherent flaws of
cyclical consumption,

4349
02:06:36,901 --> 02:06:38,490
the need to have constant turnover.

4350
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:39,290
Our Sis,

4351
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:42,600
our economic system is in one big
paradox and the old economic theory,

4352
02:06:42,601 --> 02:06:43,680
it says there's scarcity.

4353
02:06:43,681 --> 02:06:44,790
Therefore we have to have it.

4354
02:06:45,150 --> 02:06:48,180
The assumption of Social Darwinism that
some people who can have the right to

4355
02:06:48,181 --> 02:06:51,600
this through their equity and some
cannot never enough to go around as the

4356
02:06:51,601 --> 02:06:52,740
assumption simultaneously.

4357
02:06:52,741 --> 02:06:54,720
It's based on infinite
growth simultaneously.

4358
02:06:54,721 --> 02:06:58,860
It assumes that we have to constantly
keep consuming so people can stay employed

4359
02:06:58,861 --> 02:07:02,100
and with the growing population where you
have to have more and more consumption

4360
02:07:02,101 --> 02:07:02,371
to keep.

4361
02:07:02,371 --> 02:07:06,930
Everyone that's populating employed
clearly hasn't been planned out.

4362
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:07,910
There's no planning.

4363
02:07:07,910 --> 02:07:08,743
It's all been,

4364
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:10,500
which is understandable and our evolution,

4365
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:11,393
this is weird,

4366
02:07:11,490 --> 02:07:14,250
we are a monkey cells trying to
figure out what the fuck's going on,

4367
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,010
but luckily we can begin to assess.

4368
02:07:17,011 --> 02:07:21,150
We can see the the light and now it's
the big conundrum of how to get the fuck

4369
02:07:21,151 --> 02:07:24,660
out of this system and it is something
that actually works without seeing too

4370
02:07:24,661 --> 02:07:26,040
much destruction without,

4371
02:07:26,041 --> 02:07:27,270
without seeing too much breakdown.

4372
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:29,910
I don't want to see the system fail
and the infrastructure completed be

4373
02:07:29,911 --> 02:07:30,361
demolished.

4374
02:07:30,361 --> 02:07:31,920
I want to see terrorists
come out of the woodwork.

4375
02:07:32,370 --> 02:07:33,510
I don't want to see a,

4376
02:07:33,710 --> 02:07:35,860
we've got to get people on mushrooms stat.

4377
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:37,450
That's what's going on,

4378
02:07:37,451 --> 02:07:37,660
man.

4379
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:39,090
The only way we're going
to fix these fluxs.

4380
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:40,300
We've got to get them on mushrooms.

4381
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:41,081
No Way.

4382
02:07:41,081 --> 02:07:43,720
People are gonna make some
just radical leap of change.

4383
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:44,800
They're going to recognize,

4384
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:47,650
just like they recognize right now in
other parts of the country where there's a

4385
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,150
leadership vacuum,

4386
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:50,950
you know whether it's in Iraq right now,

4387
02:07:50,951 --> 02:07:53,050
there's a rack going
through a fucking civil war.

4388
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:54,490
Congratulations from America.

4389
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:56,290
We just fucked up another
spot in the world.

4390
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,900
One of many dictators
going to move into place.

4391
02:07:59,020 --> 02:08:02,080
Some new ruthless motherfucker
who dominates the situation.

4392
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:03,190
Meet the new boss.

4393
02:08:03,191 --> 02:08:04,390
Same as the old boss,

4394
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:05,290
right?

4395
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:07,690
As long as they're in favor
of western geopolitics,

4396
02:08:07,691 --> 02:08:08,410
there'll be safe.

4397
02:08:08,410 --> 02:08:08,950
Yeah,

4398
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:09,640
maybe.

4399
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:10,473
Right?

4400
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:11,830
What the fuck do we do,

4401
02:08:11,831 --> 02:08:12,101
Peter?

4402
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:12,551
Joseph?

4403
02:08:12,551 --> 02:08:13,570
Do we wait for the aliens?

4404
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:15,190
Are They not real god?

4405
02:08:15,191 --> 02:08:16,360
I really wished aliens would come.

4406
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:17,620
They would have set a great precedent,

4407
02:08:17,621 --> 02:08:18,430
wouldn't it?

4408
02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:23,170
We'd actually be able to see another
entity that that actually was beyond us

4409
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:27,400
that could actually give us the obvious
awareness that we're one species.

4410
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:28,600
I wouldn't have one family.

4411
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:30,340
That's the Ronald Reagan's speech.

4412
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,030
Is it?

4413
02:08:31,030 --> 02:08:31,880
Do you remember Ronald Reagan?

4414
02:08:31,881 --> 02:08:32,140
So I don't,

4415
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:32,980
I don't remember that one now.

4416
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:36,880
He gave a speech during the middle of
the Cold War saying that a how quickly we

4417
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:38,290
would unite as a,

4418
02:08:38,291 --> 02:08:38,860
as a,

4419
02:08:38,860 --> 02:08:40,120
as a race once,

4420
02:08:40,121 --> 02:08:43,570
if we were faced with a threat from
another world and everybody got crazy.

4421
02:08:43,571 --> 02:08:45,550
Like damn the fucking aliens are coming.

4422
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:47,080
Ronald Reagan just letting us know.

4423
02:08:47,230 --> 02:08:47,561
I agree.

4424
02:08:47,561 --> 02:08:48,180
Nothing happened.

4425
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:49,510
I had a great idea for a film.

4426
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:50,710
It was a bunch of hackers.

4427
02:08:50,711 --> 02:08:51,071
They go,

4428
02:08:51,071 --> 02:08:52,300
and I shouldn't give this away,

4429
02:08:52,301 --> 02:08:52,711
but I doubt it.

4430
02:08:52,711 --> 02:08:54,280
I'll give it a wedding would make it,

4431
02:08:54,281 --> 02:08:54,431
well,

4432
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:55,600
I'll give you the premise cause it's fine.

4433
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:57,160
I'll do it and it'll be online.

4434
02:08:57,190 --> 02:08:58,023
They're going to steal it.

4435
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:59,470
Well I hope they steal it.

4436
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:00,360
Okay,

4437
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:00,671
there you go.

4438
02:09:00,671 --> 02:09:01,660
Put that information out.

4439
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:02,830
We have a whole group of hackers,

4440
02:09:02,831 --> 02:09:03,101
right?

4441
02:09:03,101 --> 02:09:05,890
So they hack into the u s Pentagon and
hack into the military systems that are

4442
02:09:05,891 --> 02:09:10,120
interconnected around the world and they
find gay porn and they plant a fake,

4443
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:14,020
a fake asteroid attack
coming towards the earth.

4444
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:17,890
So all the media now thinks there's a
ginormous asteroid coming towards earth

4445
02:09:17,891 --> 02:09:19,330
that will destroy all of humanity.

4446
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:20,560
What happens?

4447
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:21,880
The motivation of all the continents,

4448
02:09:21,881 --> 02:09:22,640
they come together,

4449
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:24,280
they try to combine their resources.

4450
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:26,950
They try to create some type
of anti asteroid weapon,

4451
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:30,310
and then suddenly someone figures out
that these are just a bunch of hackers and

4452
02:09:30,311 --> 02:09:34,180
they're brought in chains and then they
give this nice speech at the end of how

4453
02:09:34,181 --> 02:09:36,770
this was their attempt to unify
humanity before it was too late.

4454
02:09:36,770 --> 02:09:38,110
It's like a Scooby doo episodes.

4455
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:40,683
It's going to be duped.

4456
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:42,820
They're hackers trying to save humanity.

4457
02:09:42,910 --> 02:09:43,810
It'd be a good ploy.

4458
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:44,290
I think it would.

4459
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:45,490
I think the audience would like that,

4460
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:47,950
especially if the audience didn't know
they were hackers at the beginning.

4461
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:50,260
They thought it was all real until
they came forward and I could work.

4462
02:09:50,261 --> 02:09:52,780
Who Do you think was how you
don't play the leading Broderick?

4463
02:09:52,990 --> 02:09:55,720
Would you go with Kristin from twilight?

4464
02:09:55,721 --> 02:09:56,121
What's her name?

4465
02:09:56,121 --> 02:09:56,954
Kristen Stewart.

4466
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,180
She would be good right here.

4467
02:09:58,181 --> 02:09:59,920
These to be one of your good stars.

4468
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:00,610
Who's this?

4469
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:02,510
Matthew Broderick and more games.

4470
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:05,620
Of course.

4471
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:05,831
You know,

4472
02:10:05,831 --> 02:10:06,520
it's amazing.

4473
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:08,050
I like watching the alien,

4474
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:09,010
the original alien,

4475
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:13,130
what they thought that the cockpit of
a like a sophisticated computer setup

4476
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:14,003
would look like.

4477
02:10:14,230 --> 02:10:15,640
This is so wonky.

4478
02:10:15,641 --> 02:10:16,001
No,

4479
02:10:16,001 --> 02:10:16,420
no.

4480
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:18,350
A graphic user interface at all.

4481
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:22,030
I'll just like numbers and
letters and it's interesting.

4482
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:24,910
It's interesting to see what people think
about the future and what it ends up

4483
02:10:24,911 --> 02:10:25,590
being.

4484
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:27,160
We can do it predicting space,

4485
02:10:27,161 --> 02:10:28,420
travel to other planets,

4486
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:29,283
no problem,

4487
02:10:29,390 --> 02:10:31,990
but but figuring out a
graphic user interface.

4488
02:10:31,991 --> 02:10:34,020
It just really never then whatever

4489
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:37,490
wrapped their head around it yet so hard
to predict what the future may hold.

4490
02:10:37,491 --> 02:10:37,880
Man.

4491
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:39,800
Do you think the technology can save us?

4492
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:44,840
Is it possible that there's going to be
something that comes along that creates

4493
02:10:44,841 --> 02:10:49,841
some sort of a connectivity with
human beings that allows us to be more

4494
02:10:50,241 --> 02:10:55,241
empathetic to the idea or or
more accepting to the idea
that we are really truly

4495
02:10:55,491 --> 02:10:56,330
one species,

4496
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,040
that we are a super organism?

4497
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:01,640
Well in the words of Carl
Sagan when he was approaching,

4498
02:11:01,641 --> 02:11:01,911
you know,

4499
02:11:01,911 --> 02:11:05,090
the nuclear fallout possibility
during the Cold War.

4500
02:11:05,091 --> 02:11:05,421
He said,

4501
02:11:05,421 --> 02:11:07,340
if there's anything like positive
that could come out of this,

4502
02:11:07,341 --> 02:11:12,290
it will be the unification of humanity
on the level of really realizing that

4503
02:11:12,291 --> 02:11:15,320
they are all at risk by the
actions of just two small,

4504
02:11:15,321 --> 02:11:16,790
seemingly small superpowers.

4505
02:11:17,330 --> 02:11:18,770
This is a pivotal thing.

4506
02:11:18,771 --> 02:11:19,461
Someone's breakdown,

4507
02:11:19,461 --> 02:11:22,520
a society occurs once people see
how interconnected things are in the

4508
02:11:22,521 --> 02:11:23,780
infrastructure of society.

4509
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:26,840
In fact that computers
run everything already.

4510
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:27,351
You know,

4511
02:11:27,351 --> 02:11:31,010
it's very obvious the symbiosis and I
think come to fruition if there's any

4512
02:11:31,011 --> 02:11:33,380
pattern that's become more of a trend now.

4513
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:35,090
It's the oneness poetry.

4514
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:36,620
I'd look at it very literal,

4515
02:11:36,621 --> 02:11:38,900
but a lot of people would like to
take it into a metaphysical sense.

4516
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:43,340
The unification of the species is not
just the unification of us as a family in

4517
02:11:43,341 --> 02:11:44,151
a gestural sense.

4518
02:11:44,151 --> 02:11:45,050
Even though you can go back,

4519
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:45,291
you know,

4520
02:11:45,291 --> 02:11:48,170
to the mitochondrial eve
many thousands of years ago,

4521
02:11:48,171 --> 02:11:50,780
we all have the same basic
mitochondrial DNA construct.

4522
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:53,210
We all come from that basic
kernel one way or another,

4523
02:11:53,211 --> 02:11:54,170
the entire species.

4524
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:58,490
But the entire association of values
in our minds is utterly symbiotic.

4525
02:11:58,491 --> 02:11:59,510
It's the group mind.

4526
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:00,770
It's a collective consciousness.

4527
02:12:00,771 --> 02:12:01,760
If you want to use that old term,

4528
02:12:01,761 --> 02:12:02,531
I use the group mind.

4529
02:12:02,531 --> 02:12:04,820
It's no more practical
everything you think.

4530
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:07,310
Everything I think has been
communicated to us one way or another.

4531
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:12,350
Filtered through a basic
genetic preprogram combined
with all sorts of other

4532
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:13,460
data coming from other people,

4533
02:12:13,820 --> 02:12:15,680
so no one originates any may anything.

4534
02:12:15,681 --> 02:12:18,020
No one thinks in any kind of novel sense.

4535
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:21,740
It's all an illusion and is anything
that could show the unification of the

4536
02:12:21,741 --> 02:12:22,730
species on that level.

4537
02:12:22,731 --> 02:12:24,530
As far as what we think we are,

4538
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:28,250
we can only be everything because
there are very constructive thought is

4539
02:12:28,251 --> 02:12:30,200
determined by what
everyone else is thinking,

4540
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:32,150
feeding into us through information,

4541
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:33,440
whether it's your parents,

4542
02:12:33,441 --> 02:12:36,020
whether it's your educational
system so there's no,

4543
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,450
there's no way to rationalize separation,

4544
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:39,284
you know what I mean?

4545
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:40,850
And other molecular quantum field level,

4546
02:12:40,851 --> 02:12:41,960
if you want to jump to that route,

4547
02:12:42,230 --> 02:12:44,350
it's all a big sea of molecules
moving around just this.

4548
02:12:44,351 --> 02:12:45,410
This is all a big illusion.

4549
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:46,580
I think we all know that by now,

4550
02:12:46,610 --> 02:12:46,830
right?

4551
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:47,011
Well,

4552
02:12:47,011 --> 02:12:47,841
if you get to that,

4553
02:12:47,841 --> 02:12:50,540
how much do you think that you can
manipulate your environment and with

4554
02:12:50,541 --> 02:12:51,374
thinking,

4555
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:52,101
how much do you think?

4556
02:12:52,101 --> 02:12:52,281
Well,

4557
02:12:52,281 --> 02:12:55,340
the beauty of the tech technology
as an extension of ourselves,

4558
02:12:55,341 --> 02:12:59,030
is it the ultimate tool with mean
thinking really is a technological idea,

4559
02:12:59,090 --> 02:13:00,110
logic and reason,

4560
02:13:00,111 --> 02:13:03,140
which came to us just a couple thousand
years ago with Aristotle with finally

4561
02:13:03,141 --> 02:13:04,310
figured out how to think.

4562
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:06,860
Even though most of the
is still doesn't do that,

4563
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:11,210
these tools will lead to something
and if the values are right,

4564
02:13:11,211 --> 02:13:12,230
if we see the rationale,

4565
02:13:12,231 --> 02:13:13,041
if we see the reason,

4566
02:13:13,041 --> 02:13:16,460
if we see what it means to relate
to the environment is very,

4567
02:13:16,461 --> 02:13:17,180
very simple.

4568
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:19,460
If we see the benefit of automation as a,

4569
02:13:19,461 --> 02:13:20,810
as an isolated example,

4570
02:13:21,110 --> 02:13:23,270
we naturally adapt and adjust.

4571
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:24,530
And what's happened now though,

4572
02:13:24,531 --> 02:13:26,270
I mean frankly there isn't a crisis.

4573
02:13:26,350 --> 02:13:28,370
There's only the crisis
of the way we think.

4574
02:13:28,730 --> 02:13:32,100
There's no reason you couldn't turn
all this around tomorrow if he wanted

4575
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,780
it to somebody who makes a terminator.

4576
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:35,221
Well,

4577
02:13:35,221 --> 02:13:38,880
the older fantasy a take over by machines.

4578
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:39,031
I,

4579
02:13:39,031 --> 02:13:40,920
I'm certainly amused by,

4580
02:13:40,921 --> 02:13:42,960
but amused were already taken over.

4581
02:13:42,961 --> 02:13:44,550
We're already taking everybody I know,

4582
02:13:44,551 --> 02:13:44,941
but I mean,

4583
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:46,020
what if it's like literal?

4584
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:47,220
Yeah,

4585
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:47,670
there's no,

4586
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,270
you don't think so?

4587
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:52,110
There's nothing in there that that I could
see programming wise that would allow

4588
02:13:52,111 --> 02:13:52,910
for such a thing.

4589
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:53,040
The,

4590
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:55,290
the ultimate expression of
that was that hideous film I,

4591
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:56,400
robot at the very end,

4592
02:13:56,401 --> 02:13:57,210
the computer goes,

4593
02:13:57,210 --> 02:14:00,630
we add to exterminate all of humanity
because they are a threat to the planet.

4594
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:03,790
So are logical calculation that
humanity can no longer exist.

4595
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:07,950
That's the ultimate Scifi fantasy of
artificial intelligence wasn't necessary,

4596
02:14:07,951 --> 02:14:08,910
but that's a big budget.

4597
02:14:08,911 --> 02:14:10,770
Will Smith Film and they got
to do what they gotta do.

4598
02:14:10,771 --> 02:14:11,161
Of course,

4599
02:14:11,161 --> 02:14:12,750
as as an idea of,

4600
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:16,440
but that's that catered to the long
standing assumptions of artificial

4601
02:14:16,441 --> 02:14:19,230
intelligence and automation
and technological singularity.

4602
02:14:19,530 --> 02:14:20,363
You sure?

4603
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:21,690
And as Curtis ballpoints though,

4604
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:24,390
we don't really know what will happen
with the technological singularity,

4605
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:28,230
but technology becomes sentient and
as the ability to move and manipulate

4606
02:14:28,231 --> 02:14:28,680
things,

4607
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:29,400
who knows?

4608
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:29,581
Well,

4609
02:14:29,581 --> 02:14:30,031
if there are,

4610
02:14:30,031 --> 02:14:31,200
if they are extensions of us,

4611
02:14:31,201 --> 02:14:32,190
they become our tools.

4612
02:14:32,191 --> 02:14:35,910
Who's to say we want to program
them to kill it says who says us?

4613
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:39,220
That's what we were talking about earlier
about failed symbiotic show that the,

4614
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:41,130
the parasitic relationship between,

4615
02:14:41,410 --> 02:14:42,960
I mean the symbiotic right now,

4616
02:14:43,170 --> 02:14:45,210
relationship between human
beings and computers.

4617
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:49,660
It's very similar to if you look at
like other organisms that have a,

4618
02:14:49,690 --> 02:14:49,921
you know,

4619
02:14:49,921 --> 02:14:51,420
lampreys on sharks or whatever.

4620
02:14:51,421 --> 02:14:53,070
I mean we're almost separable.

4621
02:14:53,071 --> 02:14:54,960
We're a part of the same
sort of ecosystem now.

4622
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:56,190
We need the lights to stay on,

4623
02:14:56,191 --> 02:15:00,000
we need their refrigerator to stay cold
so that we can preserve the meat better.

4624
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:00,611
I mean we,

4625
02:15:00,611 --> 02:15:05,160
we have it sort of set out so we're
almost completely intertwined with

4626
02:15:05,161 --> 02:15:07,680
technology and habitable
and then we give birth,

4627
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:08,520
the live one,

4628
02:15:08,521 --> 02:15:11,910
we give birth to technology where it's
sent in and we're could figure shit out

4629
02:15:11,911 --> 02:15:13,890
on own and it becomes another life form.

4630
02:15:13,890 --> 02:15:14,970
It becomes a life form.

4631
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:17,740
Much like a biological
carbon based life form.

4632
02:15:17,770 --> 02:15:20,910
Just completely different and unexpected
and something we didn't see coming.

4633
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:22,020
Just like,

4634
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:22,350
you know,

4635
02:15:22,350 --> 02:15:23,280
it's all very possible.

4636
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:24,211
You mean,

4637
02:15:24,211 --> 02:15:26,400
do you ever like look at look
broken computers and shit?

4638
02:15:26,401 --> 02:15:27,061
Those are bodies.

4639
02:15:27,061 --> 02:15:27,811
It was a dead body.

4640
02:15:27,811 --> 02:15:28,041
Sure,

4641
02:15:28,041 --> 02:15:28,540
sure.

4642
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:29,550
It's fucking dinosaurs.

4643
02:15:29,551 --> 02:15:32,250
But they're happening really quickly
at this stage of our evolution.

4644
02:15:32,251 --> 02:15:32,701
Either we,

4645
02:15:32,701 --> 02:15:33,210
uh,

4646
02:15:33,210 --> 02:15:36,960
utilize technology to help us and hope
for the best or we're going to perish

4647
02:15:36,961 --> 02:15:37,351
anyway.

4648
02:15:37,351 --> 02:15:38,790
So if it happens to be,

4649
02:15:38,791 --> 02:15:40,810
we become enslaved by a
bunch of machines in the NFL,

4650
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:41,361
so be it.

4651
02:15:41,361 --> 02:15:42,690
That must be a natural evolution.

4652
02:15:43,290 --> 02:15:46,470
So you're cool with that
given what's at stake today.

4653
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:47,304
I'm cool with that.

4654
02:15:47,970 --> 02:15:49,260
Given what we have to deal with.

4655
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:52,200
I'm perfectly happy to be robots like
that is now I'm going to be on the

4656
02:15:52,201 --> 02:15:52,650
Internet.

4657
02:15:52,650 --> 02:15:53,431
Peter Joseph.

4658
02:15:53,431 --> 02:15:55,560
Cool with robots taking over.

4659
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:56,310
Hey,

4660
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:57,143
I'm cool with that.

4661
02:15:57,610 --> 02:15:57,820
Cool.

4662
02:15:57,820 --> 02:15:58,290
This is,

4663
02:15:58,290 --> 02:15:59,880
this is like ice movements,

4664
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:00,990
primary premise.

4665
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:02,320
We're cool with robots taken.

4666
02:16:02,330 --> 02:16:04,050
I will say this if the Fallis,

4667
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:09,100
the f the problem of human psychology
is so vast now that I can only dream of

4668
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:16,430
the cold quality of calculation coming
forward to save us because we've fucked

4669
02:16:17,401 --> 02:16:18,720
up just about everything so far.

4670
02:16:18,721 --> 02:16:21,480
We are way beyond our
sense of self control.

4671
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:23,970
That's what calculated society is.

4672
02:16:23,971 --> 02:16:24,930
That's what our brain does.

4673
02:16:24,931 --> 02:16:28,020
It's a calculation
process and it's too bad.

4674
02:16:28,021 --> 02:16:30,090
We're so clouded these us and

4675
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:30,911
them issues.

4676
02:16:30,911 --> 02:16:34,120
And all these things that
are evolutionary baggage.

4677
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:35,013
Exactly.

4678
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:36,430
And again,

4679
02:16:36,431 --> 02:16:38,020
it's easy to see an amazing,

4680
02:16:38,021 --> 02:16:41,470
beautiful society and marriage if we
simply wanted to construct one correctly

4681
02:16:41,471 --> 02:16:44,860
cause we have that power
now and we have mushrooms.

4682
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:47,500
That's important.

4683
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:48,970
That's an important part of the equation.

4684
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:52,180
I don't think you're going to fix people
without some sort of a large scale

4685
02:16:52,181 --> 02:16:53,530
psychedelic experiment.

4686
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:57,130
I did see an evolution special that
alluded to that old Bill Hicks joke,

4687
02:16:57,131 --> 02:17:01,390
which may be came true that mushrooms
could have been that link that pushed

4688
02:17:01,391 --> 02:17:01,931
forward.

4689
02:17:01,931 --> 02:17:02,770
The human brain.

4690
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:04,031
Just theory,

4691
02:17:04,031 --> 02:17:05,170
the stoned ape theory.

4692
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:06,480
Exactly what you probably saw.

4693
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:06,730
Yeah.

4694
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:09,720
He said that it was in a more
academic circle too though,

4695
02:17:09,721 --> 02:17:11,560
is actually more than just Mckenna.

4696
02:17:11,770 --> 02:17:11,981
Yeah.

4697
02:17:11,981 --> 02:17:14,740
There's a bunch of scientists that
have speculated it because you know,

4698
02:17:14,741 --> 02:17:15,220
the,

4699
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,980
the incredible powers
of psychedelic plants.

4700
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:19,300
I mean as far as like,

4701
02:17:19,301 --> 02:17:20,050
uh,

4702
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:21,160
powers of experience.

4703
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:22,840
I mean if you don't know,

4704
02:17:22,841 --> 02:17:23,680
if you never had it,

4705
02:17:23,681 --> 02:17:25,320
there's a lot of people
ignorant to the experience.

4706
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:26,290
You've done mushrooms before.

4707
02:17:26,650 --> 02:17:31,650
I have you just wink if you're worried
about the PR you everything in high

4708
02:17:31,751 --> 02:17:32,471
school and college.

4709
02:17:32,471 --> 02:17:36,220
So if you've had a real big experience,

4710
02:17:36,221 --> 02:17:37,054
a big trip,

4711
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:40,360
you realize how humbling
it is first of all,

4712
02:17:40,361 --> 02:17:42,280
just to know that that's possible.

4713
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:46,060
That that's even an experience that a
person can have and that they're not dying

4714
02:17:46,061 --> 02:17:46,571
from it either.

4715
02:17:46,571 --> 02:17:47,520
And then I know,

4716
02:17:47,521 --> 02:17:47,641
oh,

4717
02:17:47,641 --> 02:17:50,770
we have a lot of friends that have had
gone through crazy psychedelic trips and

4718
02:17:50,771 --> 02:17:51,604
everyone's okay.

4719
02:17:51,700 --> 02:17:52,480
But the,

4720
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:52,871
the,

4721
02:17:52,871 --> 02:17:53,350
the,

4722
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:55,390
the experience itself,

4723
02:17:55,450 --> 02:17:56,950
to someone who's uninitiated,

4724
02:17:57,160 --> 02:18:01,570
it's almost impossible
to imagine like you,

4725
02:18:01,571 --> 02:18:05,050
you can't imagine that it's really
possible that this could exist.

4726
02:18:05,250 --> 02:18:09,040
And then this is not discussed every day
on CBS evening news that someone's not

4727
02:18:09,041 --> 02:18:09,281
saying,

4728
02:18:09,281 --> 02:18:09,701
listen man,

4729
02:18:09,701 --> 02:18:11,110
you need to get on mushrooms.

4730
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:11,651
Okay,

4731
02:18:11,651 --> 02:18:14,500
you need to find a fucking place where
you're comfortable and you need someone

4732
02:18:14,501 --> 02:18:15,520
who gets you the good shit.

4733
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:17,290
And he need to go there with clear tent.

4734
02:18:17,291 --> 02:18:20,710
And you need to do yoga and need to
find yourself because life can be way

4735
02:18:20,711 --> 02:18:21,250
better.

4736
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:25,360
And this recent John Hopkins study
with a dark talked about one dose.

4737
02:18:25,361 --> 02:18:29,260
They had one large dose of Psilocybin and
they had measurable increases in their

4738
02:18:29,261 --> 02:18:29,741
happiness,

4739
02:18:29,741 --> 02:18:32,590
their personality over a
period of like 20 years

4740
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:36,100
reset their whole life.

4741
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:36,970
Right?

4742
02:18:36,970 --> 02:18:40,560
So could we need [inaudible]
add mushrooms to the psyche

4743
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:45,260
in harmony and Fox match?

4744
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:46,953
We Need Fox.

4745
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:47,980
It was so weird,

4746
02:18:47,981 --> 02:18:48,431
by the way,

4747
02:18:48,431 --> 02:18:48,550
I,

4748
02:18:48,550 --> 02:18:49,990
I'm still trying to figure it out.

4749
02:18:49,991 --> 02:18:53,920
Rupert Micro Rupert as our whole Fox
magic thing where he believes in Fox and

4750
02:18:53,921 --> 02:18:54,221
well,

4751
02:18:54,221 --> 02:18:54,560
let's,

4752
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:55,630
let's be real honest.

4753
02:18:55,631 --> 02:18:56,650
He was high as fuck.

4754
02:18:56,651 --> 02:18:57,590
I'm not familiar with time.

4755
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:59,620
And if you get that guy sober,

4756
02:18:59,621 --> 02:19:01,060
we probably would've never said that.

4757
02:19:01,060 --> 02:19:02,200
He knows Fox magic.

4758
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:03,880
He's an interesting cat,

4759
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:04,361
you know,

4760
02:19:04,361 --> 02:19:05,980
but you have to be that guy.

4761
02:19:05,981 --> 02:19:06,360
You know,

4762
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:07,193
he's not,

4763
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:07,800
he's,

4764
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:08,081
he's a,

4765
02:19:08,081 --> 02:19:08,711
he's out there,

4766
02:19:08,711 --> 02:19:09,040
man.

4767
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:09,311
He's,

4768
02:19:09,311 --> 02:19:11,170
he's not following any of the status quo.

4769
02:19:11,171 --> 02:19:15,400
That guys out there trying to expose
corruption in the government at every,

4770
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:16,810
every step of the way.

4771
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:18,130
You have to be a little,

4772
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:18,881
a little,

4773
02:19:18,881 --> 02:19:19,714
uh,

4774
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:20,680
I dunno.

4775
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:21,070
Loony.

4776
02:19:21,070 --> 02:19:21,491
He's got a,

4777
02:19:21,491 --> 02:19:22,151
here's a hero.

4778
02:19:22,151 --> 02:19:23,060
Quality to him is,

4779
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:23,651
he's out there.

4780
02:19:23,651 --> 02:19:24,281
He's doing it.

4781
02:19:24,281 --> 02:19:25,780
You can't really fuck with amazing.

4782
02:19:25,810 --> 02:19:26,840
It's a good guy too.

4783
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:28,220
You could tell he's a good guy.

4784
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:28,791
He's a good guy.

4785
02:19:28,791 --> 02:19:31,190
When you talk to him and
he's not an asshole south,

4786
02:19:31,191 --> 02:19:32,330
they're doing the right thing.

4787
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:33,980
You need people like that.

4788
02:19:34,610 --> 02:19:34,851
Right?

4789
02:19:34,851 --> 02:19:36,290
Brian Fox,

4790
02:19:36,291 --> 02:19:37,500
magic bitches,

4791
02:19:38,410 --> 02:19:40,130
12 Fox magic t shirts.

4792
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:42,230
Send them out there and then Peter,

4793
02:19:42,231 --> 02:19:43,250
Joseph and quotes.

4794
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:44,990
I'm cool with the robots taking over.

4795
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:48,540
That's how we're going to
make you some money man.

4796
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:50,080
Market you.

4797
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:50,913
All right.

4798
02:19:51,060 --> 02:19:51,500
Um,

4799
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,760
this is very cool conversation.

4800
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:53,930
Is there anything else you want to say?

4801
02:19:53,931 --> 02:19:55,700
Is there anything that
people need to know about?

4802
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,960
Well,

4803
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:57,793
shit,

4804
02:19:58,170 --> 02:20:00,200
there's tons of things I
could say and tons of things.

4805
02:20:00,201 --> 02:20:00,351
I mean,

4806
02:20:00,351 --> 02:20:01,520
we got events coming up.

4807
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:02,930
I'm going to be in New York.

4808
02:20:02,931 --> 02:20:06,400
If anyone's in New York at the end
of this month in Colombia to hook up,

4809
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:07,340
go for some drinks.

4810
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:13,640
What is the best way to
find out information?

4811
02:20:13,641 --> 02:20:14,900
What is your number one website?

4812
02:20:14,901 --> 02:20:15,620
I know it's,

4813
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:19,670
it's Tz movement on
those like guys movement,

4814
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,320
[inaudible] movement on Twitter.

4815
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:22,460
That's for the movement.

4816
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:24,140
What is the best way to be informed?

4817
02:20:24,141 --> 02:20:26,120
What website can people go to?

4818
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:29,300
May Movement side is just simply the
zeitgeists movement.com and then the movie

4819
02:20:29,301 --> 02:20:33,020
side does zeitgeisty movie.com and then
you can link to all the other sub sites

4820
02:20:33,021 --> 02:20:37,770
for the films and there's a bunch of scam
sites that like they said like I guess

4821
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:42,140
film series has been subject to more
manipulation and scam and resellers.

4822
02:20:42,141 --> 02:20:47,141
I've been screwed over so extensive by
attempting to be altruistic with the

4823
02:20:47,181 --> 02:20:48,320
distribution of that film.

4824
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:50,260
People buy things from me,

4825
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:50,841
resell it,

4826
02:20:50,841 --> 02:20:51,890
profit all over the place.

4827
02:20:51,891 --> 02:20:55,760
I just now stopped doing a lot of things
I used to do after four years cause I,

4828
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:56,600
I'm running out of money.

4829
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:58,700
I can barely see myself
making this new film.

4830
02:20:58,701 --> 02:21:01,190
It's going to be quite the
quite the difficult venture,

4831
02:21:01,191 --> 02:21:04,940
but it's like just has
attracted just about everything,

4832
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:07,850
whether it's people that want to abuse it,

4833
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:08,870
people that hate me,

4834
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:11,060
people that like it does.

4835
02:21:11,061 --> 02:21:11,331
No,

4836
02:21:11,331 --> 02:21:15,020
no more strange phenomenon I've come
across recently and in the Zike guys

4837
02:21:15,021 --> 02:21:15,381
phenomena.

4838
02:21:15,381 --> 02:21:16,490
As far as a cultural issue.

4839
02:21:16,491 --> 02:21:19,880
It's really strange and I'm just imagining
it must be a pretty big life change

4840
02:21:19,881 --> 02:21:22,760
to go from just being
a classical musician,

4841
02:21:22,790 --> 02:21:23,480
right?

4842
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:26,750
To all of a sudden at the head of
some crazy movement where you're being

4843
02:21:26,751 --> 02:21:30,290
critiqued and criticized for every
single word that comes anyway,

4844
02:21:30,410 --> 02:21:31,340
probably were critiqued.

4845
02:21:31,460 --> 02:21:34,520
People gonna be mad at you for
even doing this stupid show,

4846
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,760
this ridiculous show.

4847
02:21:35,770 --> 02:21:36,890
We make fun of everything.

4848
02:21:36,891 --> 02:21:37,350
You know?

4849
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:41,150
I think it's important to realize that
we're all just people and no one should

4850
02:21:41,151 --> 02:21:43,430
take any of them said
anyone that seriously.

4851
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,290
I,

4852
02:21:44,290 --> 02:21:46,460
I have a great deal of
humor with all of this.

4853
02:21:46,461 --> 02:21:46,621
I,

4854
02:21:46,621 --> 02:21:48,020
I have the Carlin level,

4855
02:21:48,021 --> 02:21:51,800
I call it sitting on the sideline and
that's something I don't readily admit,

4856
02:21:51,801 --> 02:21:52,700
but the Carlin level,

4857
02:21:52,730 --> 02:21:55,970
George Carlin is where you
just don't give a shit anymore.

4858
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:58,430
And as much as I push
forward with all of this,

4859
02:21:58,431 --> 02:21:59,450
there's a side of me that says,

4860
02:21:59,451 --> 02:22:00,050
you know what?

4861
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:01,160
It is what it is.

4862
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:02,410
If myself,

4863
02:22:02,710 --> 02:22:04,020
if my partial,

4864
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:04,431
excuse me,

4865
02:22:04,431 --> 02:22:08,060
if I become just deeply unhappy
and he get tired of what I'm doing,

4866
02:22:08,570 --> 02:22:09,403
then I'm gone.

4867
02:22:09,650 --> 02:22:10,401
And it is what it is.

4868
02:22:10,401 --> 02:22:10,641
I'm not,

4869
02:22:10,641 --> 02:22:12,080
I don't owe anybody anything.

4870
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:14,390
If people out there support such ideas,

4871
02:22:14,660 --> 02:22:17,420
they need to become their own
leaders and really push this forward,

4872
02:22:17,421 --> 02:22:17,811
learn,

4873
02:22:17,811 --> 02:22:18,644
educate,

4874
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:20,930
and do the same process
that I had been doing.

4875
02:22:20,931 --> 02:22:22,220
There's nothing special here.

4876
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:24,710
So there's anything I would leave to the
audience that actually has an activist

4877
02:22:24,711 --> 02:22:25,500
bone.

4878
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:26,160
It's that don't,

4879
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:27,270
don't follow anybody.

4880
02:22:27,271 --> 02:22:28,380
You got to get out there and do it.

4881
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:30,570
Cause a lot of these people
that are at trying to lead,

4882
02:22:30,571 --> 02:22:31,260
if you will,

4883
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:32,460
are not going to be around forever.

4884
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:33,900
I could hit the car loan level and say,

4885
02:22:33,901 --> 02:22:34,710
fuck it.

4886
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:39,030
Evolutionary called Osac goodbye
humanity and I can go live on the moon

4887
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:41,760
somewhere after I do
something on the fly there

4888
02:22:42,430 --> 02:22:44,490
at the compound outside Sanoma,

4889
02:22:45,850 --> 02:22:46,290
the car,

4890
02:22:46,290 --> 02:22:49,840
the zeitgeists compliment their
growing hippie pussy on trees.

4891
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:51,190
Well,

4892
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:52,130
