1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,670
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,700
so we're approaching like the place
we're going to do the afternoon,

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,180
you know,

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,871
landing spot,

5
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:08,060
which is just kind of sky
deck overlooking the jungle.

6
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,830
And I wanted to take my shoes
off as I walked up there.

7
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,740
So I just fucking did it.

8
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:13,610
I took my shoes off,

9
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,800
didn't worry about the
mosquitoes and that felt great.

10
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,750
Just feeling the grass
and the mud on my feet.

11
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,650
It was a short walk.

12
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,980
So there wasn't any crazy
shit going on in the,

13
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,910
in the brush or anything
I had to worry about.

14
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,970
We get up there and um,

15
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,190
I go to lie down and I had taken again,

16
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,450
I'd taken the most,

17
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:32,540
what you might've taken at any point ever.

18
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,900
So I'm more blasted than I had been the
whole trip because I got eight ounces

19
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:36,734
instead of six.

20
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,750
And I go to lie down and I'm pondering
this idea of choice a lot and fears and

21
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,790
feeling pretty good because
everything that's happened,

22
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:47,660
I was passed these tests and I see this
little ant crawling towards me to my

23
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,560
right hand side and I look and I go,

24
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:49,991
fuck,

25
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:50,900
there's an aunt coming.

26
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,120
And so I totally broke
my train of thought.

27
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,320
Stood straight up,

28
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,140
and then I look back at
that and I just realized,

29
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,130
Holy Shit,

30
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,310
I just let that little fucking aunt have
the power over me to make me sit up.

31
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,940
I lose my train of consciousness
and completely move on his behalf.

32
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,510
And it wasn't like a deadly poisonous
and it was just an ant and I.

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,530
Then I thought to myself,

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,910
how many other these little things
that are truly ants in our existence,

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,721
fears,

36
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:18,370
worries,

37
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,910
Paranoia's relationships that you feel
crunchy about in this certain way or

38
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,510
crunchy.

39
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,950
I like something that's uncomfortable
to you in a situation or that you're

40
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:31,910
projecting and you're simulator is
worried about these little things when in

41
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,270
reality or no more than these
ants which are harmless,

42
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,820
caused you to make,

43
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,870
to choose actions that
aren't in your best interest,

44
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,450
you know,

45
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:41,840
and we,

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
because we give them power,

47
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,100
we give them the power
over us to make us move.

48
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,330
They do have power

49
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,580
and they could do just as good.

50
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,900
I mean they can have a show.

51
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,560
You did it from your fucking living
room 12 years ago and look at you today

52
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,140
and if let's say that they
somehow coopt us and we sell out,

53
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,660
right?

54
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,100
They'll some,

55
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,350
someone else's company
also replaced Alex Jones.

56
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,951
He's waiting.

57
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:02,641
He's in Austin,

58
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,360
Texas.

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,500
You say you're the number one,

60
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,700
but I've got the statistics.

61
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,230
I've got the documents right here,

62
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,430
but show you're a liar.

63
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,160
You're a new world order puppet.

64
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,490
He seems like he's out there
working for the people.

65
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,570
He's not working for the people.

66
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,130
He worked for MSNBC.

67
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:17,940
Ladies and gentlemen,

68
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,710
you don't get to Msnbc unless you sell
your soul to David Ickes reptilians.

69
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,080
That was awesome.

70
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,090
I've never,

71
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,640
I've never heard you do that.

72
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:27,940
That's,

73
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,130
that was amazing.

74
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,100
I've known that dude for a long time.

75
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:31,910
I've,

76
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,450
Alex Jones in 1999.

77
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:36,590
I did a,

78
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,330
a DVD in Austin,

79
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:41,450
Texas and Alex Jones
and I put on Bush masks.

80
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:42,710
I was a Bush Jr.

81
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,240
He was bush senior and we,

82
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:44,560
uh,

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:44,720
we,

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,340
we were these outfits and ran around the
capital and it was called the live from

85
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:50,210
the belly of the beast.

86
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,310
It was rigHt before
bush senior got elected.

87
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,451
And uh,

88
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:53,671
I've,

89
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,490
I've known him for even before then.

90
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,960
I've known that guy for a long time.

91
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,860
My theory is that alex
is a false operation.

92
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,890
Really?

93
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,390
Yeah.

94
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,020
Is there a real,

95
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,853
a real theory?

96
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,450
Kind of half kidding.

97
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,230
Half serious.

98
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,240
But you say that because
you're trying to fuck with me.

99
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,300
What he's trying to do right
now is coal up my mind.

100
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,170
I'm sitting here in austin,

101
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:11,561
Texas.

102
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,510
I'm smoking cigarettes
and drinking whiskey.

103
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,860
I'm getting fucking crazy.

104
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,950
I'm trying to protect people from
the government as black helicopters.

105
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,990
Their flight over my dodge charger.

106
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,380
That's fucking funny.

107
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,180
Tom rhodes pissing this thing.

108
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,201
That's not the bathroom.

109
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:25,301
Yeah,

110
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,310
that's not the bathroom.

111
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,353
He's in there.

112
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,770
I've done that a lot.

113
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,281
Have you?

114
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:34,260
Bingo is caught me so many times trying
to go into the closet and the hotel room

115
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,360
to take a piss that you go,

116
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,470
well that's the amount of times you've
woken up and found me how many times

117
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,040
they've pissed off over my own
shit and never knew about it.

118
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,150
I'm trying to remember.

119
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,100
I do it all the time.

120
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,921
The humidity,

121
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,400
I guess.

122
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm trying to remember
who told me this story,

123
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:52,650
but somebody opened up the drawer
and they pissed on their sock drawer.

124
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,670
They open up,

125
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,550
they went to their dresser and they pulled
their sock drawer open and they just

126
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,890
pissed in there and I'm like,

127
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,880
what the fuck did you
think your sock drawer was?

128
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:00,714
The toilet.

129
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,461
I've been on the.

130
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:04,290
I'm sure you've done this dog
peed in the corner of a hotel.

131
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,670
That's why we're talking about.

132
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:10,130
We saw you go through the wrong door
thinking you're going to win when you peed

133
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,690
in the corner of a lot of hotel.

134
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,980
A few of them just being plastered,

135
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,940
like signed it.

136
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,280
I was there.

137
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,840
How many times bingos caught me doing
that versus how many times she didn't wake

138
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,180
up that I did that and
didn't know I did that.

139
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,830
That's those extra two shots.

140
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,301
Well,

141
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:27,990
your brain says it's over.

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,950
doug stanhope you say,

143
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,813
fuck it is.

144
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,880
I was plastered in Ireland years
ago and I went out the room door.

145
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:33,730
I thought I was going into.

146
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,340
I was just drunk and half awake.

147
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,880
I just needed to pee and I'm in the
fucking hallway naked and I was banging on

148
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,520
the door and my hand girlfriend get come.

149
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,190
What the fuck are you
doing out there again?

150
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,830
Did that mother fucking door?

151
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,490
We already have this on a podcast.

152
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,590
Hennigan did that right there.

153
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,150
My manager and Henry Phillips both have
stories walking out thinking they're

154
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,470
going into the bathroom,

155
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,430
walking out naked and the door shuts me.

156
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,980
Amanda both naked in the
fucking hallway going.

157
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,810
Then you instantly become john ritter.

158
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:04,644
I haven't been.

159
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,061
There's no way.

160
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:07,230
That's not comedy.

161
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,180
You know?

162
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,350
I don't have identification.

163
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
If you do like a 20 year bid in a hotel,

164
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,140
you're working in a hotel for 20 years.

165
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,970
Some who's coming down naked.

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,640
How many dudes come down naked during
your entire career holding their cock and

167
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,474
balls is going?

168
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,450
Brian,

169
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,680
when he went into a like a locker,

170
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,800
a housekeeping door that was open,

171
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,770
grabbed a a sheet or whatever,

172
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,860
put it over his dick.

173
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,620
I walked down to the hotel and
they just gave him the key.

174
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,260
He didn't.

175
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,080
They didn't say id or anything.

176
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,360
Ideology is.

177
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,150
I mean,

178
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,340
I,

179
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,030
I don't remember who said it,

180
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:45,560
but it's,

181
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,610
it's the enemy of free thinking,

182
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,190
[inaudible].

183
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,190
You get in these ideological clusters
and then anything outside of this thing,

184
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,580
these predetermined patterns of behavior
that you've done to subscribe to

185
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,340
anything becomes forbidden.

186
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,590
It becomes you.

187
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,950
You can't even entertain it.

188
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,110
You can't even approach the idea.

189
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,500
You see it with everything
you see with atheism.

190
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,490
You see it with,

191
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,190
you see it with any isms,

192
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,390
with feminism,

193
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,130
with the men's rights.

194
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:19,520
You see it with people who
subscribe to the right people,

195
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,354
subscribed to the left.

196
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,630
Any variables that don't fit into their
equation that they've already suBscribed

197
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,000
to,

198
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,230
they don't want to be labeled as that
other side and anytime they don't want to

199
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:30,720
be labeled,

200
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,720
they start ignoring any evidence or any
ideas that don't fit within this really

201
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,330
rigid description.

202
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,560
That's exactly right.

203
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,513
I mean that is.

204
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,790
You hit the nail on the head,

205
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,460
joe.

206
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:42,920
Weird.

207
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,753
Exactly right.

208
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,310
People get locked into these ideological
paradigms and then from that point on,

209
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:54,311
basically their perspective as modified
more by emotion and rationality more by

210
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,250
their feelings rather
than real information.

211
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,330
You're the only person
that's ever come in,

212
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,670
sat down and said,

213
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:01,971
oh,

214
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:02,511
this is good.

215
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm getting a cortisol rush.

216
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,541
He said,

217
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,540
you're getting a cortisol rush
from the feeling of about.

218
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,100
Actually,

219
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,870
I could have gotten a little more detail,

220
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,870
but please do.

221
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,483
You know,

222
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,820
so that feeling of anxiety,

223
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:17,171
you know,

224
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,430
that lIke you get before you go onstage,

225
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:19,671
I mean,

226
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,271
you're a comedian,

227
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,830
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

228
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,240
You actually are expressing a
chemical called dane orphan and uh,

229
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,070
this is an endogenous chemical in your
brain and it binds to something called

230
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,210
the kappa opioid receptor.

231
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:37,100
It's kinda like the counter of the
endorphin which binds to the new opioid

232
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:37,521
receptor.

233
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,000
So the endorphins are the feel good.

234
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,951
Well,

235
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,080
it's nemesis is the dynorphins,

236
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:43,010
which is that anxiety,

237
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,090
like feeling.

238
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,841
So,

239
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,040
but here's the interesting part,

240
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,790
that anxiety,

241
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,570
like feeling that you feel before
you're going to do something like you're

242
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,550
really,

243
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,750
that you care about or that's
kind of anxiety provoking for me.

244
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,650
Public speaking does it,

245
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:57,780
I,

246
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,690
I get it right before I'm going to do it,

247
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,290
you know,

248
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,340
give a talk or something,

249
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:01,910
um,

250
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,530
or do a podcast in front of,

251
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:03,830
you know,

252
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,700
500,000 people.

253
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,570
Um,

254
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,320
so that dynorphins binding
to the cap opioid receptor.

255
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:14,321
What it does is it upregulates the mule
opioid receptor so that after you get

256
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:15,770
that anxiety feeling,

257
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,600
you have a better endorphin rush because
you upregulate the new opioid receptors

258
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,860
which bind to the endorphins,

259
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,694
the feel good ones,

260
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,560
and you actually become
sensitized to them.

261
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,800
So there's a biological mechanism by which
having that anxiety actually does you

262
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:31,280
good.

263
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,070
So it's kind of like a stress at first,

264
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,500
but then later on you're,

265
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,060
you get,

266
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,610
do you feel better and
you're more relaxed.
