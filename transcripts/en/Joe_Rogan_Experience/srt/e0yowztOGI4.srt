00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,850
Hello Freak bitches fruit.
That's why I'm.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,240
That's why I'm the champ because I 
survived that.

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:07,230
This overcoming,
it'd be like,

4
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:08,610
you know what?
I lost a hundred 60 pounds.

5
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:09,690
Look at me.
You're a great.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,110
Look at me.
What gave me champ?

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,760
And you're 44,
45,

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,650
45 in a week or two and people are 
ducking you like crazy.

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,190
Interesting.
David Haye said he was all in software.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,680
I'm sorry,
I curse.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,150
Curse away.
Let's go chat.

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,410
David Haye was all in at one point,
so not too many left hooks.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,380
So pissed.
Yeah.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,660
What happened?
I went over to England,

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,494
which I love with my uk.
Had went over there just to fuck with 

16
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:44,781
him till he got an apartment again.
That's the field that's the field.

17
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:46,674
Like honestly,
I was down and now Chambliss listen so 

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:49,800
many days,
you know,

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,611
I was like,
man,

20
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:52,500
you know what?
I'm trying to think man.

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,320
And no one's giving me a shot.
And I'm like,

22
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,830
you know what man,
maybe I should get a job and shit.

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,350
I'm like,
Nah,

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,390
you know what?
Then I woke up one day and guess what?

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,660
Snoop Dogg said,
let's go champ.

26
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,000
He's smoking weed.
I'm fucking with you.

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,190
Let's go champ champ.
That was the night before.

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,480
I was like,
Bro,

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,760
the night before was like,
Yo bro,

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,250
you really try and champion have fights 
man,

31
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,930
and maybe it's never going to happen for
you.

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,890
You know what I mean?
I was like,

33
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,724
Yo.
And then I woke up like four or five in 

34
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:23,490
the morning.
Snoop Dogg was saying,

35
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:28,450
let's go champ,
champ back.

36
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,510
Beautiful.
What?

37
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,350
You've done some crazy shit too though,
man.

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,900
Like,
uh,

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,870
like especially with the Klitschko 
Biscuit,

40
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,870
if I had a lot of fun,
fun videos though,

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,430
showing up,
drinking his water,

42
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,563
fucking with him.
He knocked him over when you were 

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,850
writing,
I gotta jump.

44
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,693
Well,
how long ago was the paddleboard 

45
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:51,090
incident?
And I don't even know.

46
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,610
I lost track of time champ.
I was like two years maybe.

47
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,920
But he just,
you couldn't get a fight with him?

48
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,813
Nah,
he saw.

49
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,040
I've been listening.
I've been chasing clicks.

50
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,740
Go honesty since like 2005 was supposed 
to fight him,

51
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,010
like posts to fight.
He fought in New York City.

52
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:04,844
So was a fight.
Uh,

53
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,893
Shannon breaks,
everything was set to go and he wind up 

54
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,220
fighting a calvin brock who's from North
Carolina.

55
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,350
No one could.
I couldn't understand it where we had,

56
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,690
you know,
we literally had a contract.

57
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:16,524
Yeah,
it was.

58
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,550
It was going to sell out a lot of fans 
with all crazy all the time.

59
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,660
You know what I'm saying?
Because I'm bringing that.

60
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,783
Come on.
He didn't want it because he was 

61
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:25,470
dangerous and that's what I'm going 
through right now.

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,760
They can say what they want about me.

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,710
Joe Desena thorough.
He's crazy.

64
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,790
He's this.
But guess what?

65
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,010
I'm dangerous.
I've got tons of emails.

66
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm not a snitch.
Listen,

67
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,780
I got tons of emails of guys with their 
manager saying,

68
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,370
no,
not right now.

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,233
He's too dangerous.
I've got deontay wilder backed out of a 

70
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,610
fight with me for $2,000,000.
He can't front.

71
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,350
I got emails and everything.
Let's go chat.

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm getting excited as you can tell,
but once you,

73
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,980
once you started calling him the champ,
champ,

74
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,350
the meters,
Roger,

75
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,184
now man,
we told you about what I want to talk 

76
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,880
about fights.
Let's go.

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,260
Let's go.
Let's go champ.

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,713
Champ.
And Joe Rogan Klitschko one was 

79
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,040
particularly hilarious because he was on
that paddle board.

80
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,360
There's nothing more humiliating getting
knocked over fight.

81
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,820
People are talking shit and he's still 
wanting to fight me.

82
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,740
He still wouldn't fight me right here.
Look at him.

83
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,330
First of all,
what is he doing out there?

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,540
Board by himself and stupid in the 
middle of nowhere.

85
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:33,040
I mean,
this is almost like a setup Wednesday.

86
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,090
Does he?
Yeah,

87
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,140
he does this every Wednesday.

88
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,110
I got mine at the coast or somewhere.
Where's that?

89
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,990
It's Miami Fort Lauderdale.
Hollywood champs.

90
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,280
Shout out to Hollywood,
Florida.

91
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,410
Best sound in the world.
Does he live down there?

92
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,371
Yeah,
he lived down there.

93
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:52,690
I lived down there.
We all lived down there.

94
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,990
So he would stay on that paddle board.
Go out in the middle of the ocean.

95
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,280
It'd be pat.
I need this document.

96
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:00,760
Waller and he would just be paddling 
around exercise.

97
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,330
But a weird exercise.
Yeah.

98
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,320
He said where?
The strange guy.

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
Yeah,
he's weird.

100
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,470
That's how the beef started.
Joe.

101
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,643
Chris,
shout out to Chris Lawrence to have you 

102
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,100
with factory.
Who's the greatest guy on earth?

103
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,660
Honestly,
like it wasn't for him,

104
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:15,700
you know,
this guy put the fuel,

105
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:18,130
put the cash behind me.
I was flat on my face.

106
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,670
This guy came and was like,
you know,

107
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,730
I believe you.
I was fat the press.

108
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,160
He seen me in fresh market.
He was like,

109
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,390
Damn.
I was like,

110
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,530
you know,
he seen me.

111
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,990
I came back like seven,
eight months later I came to his office.

112
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:29,620
I was like,
Yo,

113
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,431
what's up?
He was like,

114
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,600
Damn.
He called me a week later.

115
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,061
It was like,
Yo,

116
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:34,150
we should do something.
I was like,

117
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,690
let's go champ.
And uh,

118
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,000
here we are today.
You know what I'm saying?

119
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,230
I've been traveling.
The world thinks is Chris and I'm now.

120
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,483
I've actually been ordered.
The WBA has ordered a fight between me 

121
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:46,510
and Lucas Brown and hopefully we can 
make that happen.

122
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,820
I was seeing something on your instagram
that it's,

123
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,250
it's still not signed yet though.
You're disappointed.

124
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,890
Very disappointed.
Look as brown trying to avoid it or what

125
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,420
is your,
you know what?

126
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,180
You know what Joel?
Honestly,

127
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,040
like I've been through so much the last 
couple of years,

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,913
wilder with Klitschko,
with a different funding with hae a 

129
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,203
door,
hangs on the car and I went over to 

130
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,120
England,
shout out to the UK.

131
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
I love it.
My second home,

132
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,070
it was big,
a big fuel injection,

133
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,153
uh,
behind what I'm doing right now because 

134
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:17,500
I went over there and I've never felt 
that type of love anywhere in the world.

135
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,350
Like for myself to go where,
you know,

136
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,820
we speak the same language,
we speak their language and um,

137
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,460
just to have the love man,
it's just incredible.

138
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,810
Everywhere I go,
let's go champ,

139
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
you know,
it's just amazing,

140
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,354
man.
That really put a lot into what I'm 

141
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:30,214
doing right now.
But he decided to go over there and get 

142
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,670
an apartment.
I had to,

143
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,690
I had to because I was flat on my ass 
champ.

144
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,100
And I was like,
you know,

145
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,570
trying to move up in the rankings.
I gave everybody a call out haymon every

146
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,410
labella,
everybody,

147
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,353
everybody,
the cubists I gave everybody that call 

148
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:44,771
was like,
Yo,

149
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,850
I'm trying to get back in the game.

150
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,190
Nobody believed in me.
Chris Lawrence called me and was like,

151
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,024
Yo,
I believe in you,

152
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,500
and that's what I was like,
you know what Chris?

153
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,071
He said,
Yo,

154
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,270
you a little crazy.
I said,

155
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,830
I am a big diagnosis,
a little crazy.

156
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,660
I suffer from PTSD.
This is true,

157
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,291
you know,
sad.

158
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,124
But um,
what I'm exciting and I'm gonna make it 

159
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,160
happen because I'm a believer that 
nothing could stop me chatting.

160
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,890
We look at me,
nothing can stop me.

161
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,500
I don't care who you get.
Whoever say they can beat me,

162
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,290
they lying because when we put the,
when the Bell Ring Champ,

163
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm a whole different person because I'm
charged.

164
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,700
Look at me.
Look what I've been through.

165
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,520
Look what I'm telling you.
You can hear the emotion in my voice.

166
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,990
The pain still.
Lil Champ.

167
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,430
I man,
let's go champ.

168
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,700
I'm in.
Let's go champ.

169
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
Let's go chat.
I don't understand why it's so hard to 

170
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,350
get you fight.

171
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,210
So this is I'm dangerous champion.
Look at me.

172
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,940
Look at me and I'm crazy.
I believe that I'm here.

173
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,090
I was a promoter care.
I don't care who I fight.

174
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,610
They can say what they are also not 
stupid.

175
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,430
I'm not gonna fight fights for me.
For guys,

176
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,870
for pennies.
That's meaningless.

177
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,740
That's gonna.
Beat me up.

178
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,330
I'm 44.
I'll be 45.

179
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,580
I already got it,
but so much limit on his body.

180
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,710
I'm a heavyweight.
I fought George Foreman Champ.

181
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,590
I fought fatality clinico champ for 
free,

182
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,424
by the way,
and we'll talk about that later for no 

183
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,473
money.
I fought France while both the dre 

184
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,690
mercer.
You feel me?

185
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,120
I fought some big punches.
George Foreman.

186
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,740
So for me,
I'm not gone.

187
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Go down.
I'm not gonna.

188
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,880
Fight every guy out there just to try to
build myself.

189
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,770
I'm a former two time heavyweight 
champion the world.

190
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,810
That alone should get me a title.

191
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,370
Fight.
That alone,

192
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,533
that's how it used to be.
Gods have come out of retirement from 

193
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,630
the,
from the beginning,

194
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:18,200
from Sullivan days and came out of no,
no fights and got a title fight.

195
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,970
What drives me crazy is your so 
marketable.

196
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,490
That's what drives me crazy.
The are in the UFC.

197
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,383
No,
no.

198
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,283
The best ever.
They would be lining up first few left 

199
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:26,900
and right.
If you were in the UFC,

200
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,660
listen,
champ.

201
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,520
I know,
I know.

202
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,370
That's my boy now.
That's another story in itself.

203
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,720
Nineteen 90 for three or four.
Maya,

204
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,810
which is his name,
right?

205
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,210
Marilyn.
He sold the UFC to Dana and them,

206
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:38,901
right?
Yeah.

207
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,490
In Two thousand one call rob right now 
he tell you who is boy Shannon Briggs.

208
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,920
He was sitting on the couch with me 
waiting for Mark Roberts.

209
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,860
Took them home to talk to try to get 
mark to get to,

210
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:53,630
uh,
go in with him with the UFC champ champ.

211
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,740
Sitting on the couch with me.
Ra or boxing is hard to get fights lined

212
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:01,640
up because there's so many different 
conflicting promoters and different,

213
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:03,680
you know,
their piece of the Pie.

214
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,903
And then it's hard to get fires to agree
to fight someone like you who's 

215
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,660
dangerous because I'm,
you know,

216
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,900
I'm fast,
I'm a punch hard and I got a chance.

217
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,603
So you know,
they only count on one thing that I run 

218
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:18,320
out of gas.
And I say this all the time,

219
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,120
champ,
if you'll,

220
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,450
if your biggest asset is hoping on the.
I run out of guys.

221
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,480
You fucked up my leg where?
I apologize.

222
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,530
Boys and girls.
Don't apologize.

223
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,940
Apology messed up.
Excuse me.

224
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,170
I apologize.
Boys and girls,

225
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,123
you messed up if your own.
If you relying on on me running out of 

226
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:34,730
gas.
That's your.

227
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,410
That's your.
You're going into a fight.

228
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,270
Took my man.
I just hope you run out of gas.

229
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,390
You already lost tramp.
Yeah.
