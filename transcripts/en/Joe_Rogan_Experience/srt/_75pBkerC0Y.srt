1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,610
So we're totally back,

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:02,880
right?

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,910
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,030
Experience

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,320
Ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:18,870
We had technological difficulties.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,570
It's probably due to,

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,453
uh,

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,470
aliens invading our system
or s or CIA and FBI.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,340
If you are FBI.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,530
I just want to say I love your work.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,973
Great Shit.

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:34,981
Don't get us wrong.

14
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:36,090
We're not enemies of the state.

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,810
We know.

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,400
We certainly are not mad at you.

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,240
Did you see Argo?

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,980
Was that the FBI?

19
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,290
No.

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,030
No,

21
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,580
we're not.

22
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,660
We're not mad at any.

23
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,900
We're mad at ultimately is
that we're in a broke system,

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,510
not the people that are in the [inaudible]
system that are just trying to make a

25
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,344
living.

26
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,333
You know,

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,430
I'm the last person that would
be upset at the people that are,

28
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,080
I think human nature.

29
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,970
When you're inside of a situation,

30
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,290
like when you have the kind of ultimate
control of the people that are in the

31
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,190
head of a government.

32
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,460
Anybody that would pass something like
the National Defense Authorization Act or

33
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,300
anybody that would do,

34
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,323
and that's like,

35
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,590
you've gotten to this incredible
position of ultimate control you can do,

36
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,580
you can do some really.

37
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,480
Yeah.

38
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,950
You could do some really ridiculous shit.

39
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,310
I feel bad.

40
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,970
We wanted people to get to that together.

41
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,360
One is I think I'd fuck up too.

42
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,171
If I could see,

43
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,660
I could start for throwing off money,

44
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,970
like just to get a
retirement plan for myself.

45
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,213
Do you understand?

46
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,591
By the way,

47
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:29,040
that's Ari Shaffir everybody
knows it's Irish fear.

48
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,570
It says it on the iTunes things.

49
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,850
We were always supposed
to be like professional.

50
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:37,851
Now did I've gotten fucking hours in
without introducing any like who is this?

51
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,820
That's how I should say powerful Ari
Shapiro of former number one on iTunes

52
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,140
bitches respect.

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,030
How many weeks were you
number one full week.

54
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,040
A full fucking weak suck
it all you silly bitches.

55
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,410
Yeah,

56
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,050
it was great.

57
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,883
Yeah.

58
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,003
Validation.

59
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,233
Fuck yes.

60
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,560
Oh,

61
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,220
okay.

62
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,540
One of the coolest things about
podcasting is that because of this,

63
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:00,810
uh,

64
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,120
network of podcasts that
we've all put together,

65
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,451
you know,

66
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:08,280
that we've all gotten to this
point now where everybody is,

67
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,670
you know,

68
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,170
getting recognized for their stuff.

69
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:10,550
You know,

70
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,460
Dunkin's doing these shows where he's
fucking selling out like every weekend.

71
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:15,570
They're these crazy,

72
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,860
ridiculous shows he's doing.

73
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,540
Like every weekend he's packing places.

74
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,531
It's amazing.

75
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:24,180
And the club owners don't know what
the fight is on gotta wait like what's

76
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:25,014
happening?

77
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,580
These freaks.

78
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,130
I'm like all these freaks
with cats on their shirt,

79
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:31,110
on their good drinkers and good tippers.

80
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:31,500
Yeah.

81
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,760
Nice handful and they're friendly
and weird per Chrysler propaganda.

82
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,701
Bert Kreischer.

83
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:37,920
So every show,

84
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:40,170
I've never been to a show that
didn't ever Bert Kreischer tee shirt.

85
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,680
I really every show we got
to deal with one of those,

86
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,700
either Tom or Christina or Dunkin as
somebody that there were like all these

87
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,200
people go to see all of us,

88
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,520
so they should offer like up,

89
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,421
you know,

90
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:51,961
buy four,

91
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,790
get the next one half
price or whatever it is.

92
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,080
Death Squad members of just like if you
go buy a ticket for Dunkin and Ari and

93
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:58,701
Tom Segura,

94
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:02,530
then then Kalin is this much or whatever
it is or get up package and split it

95
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:02,770
up.

96
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,460
That I guess I would make sense except
someone would have to organize that shit.

97
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,753
It'd be you

98
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,650
have these grandiose plans,

99
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,430
you're not,

100
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,800
I mean we could barely get
these fucking podcasts out.

101
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:15,870
I'm in.

102
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,420
Yeah.

103
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,260
For Fox asking you,

104
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,270
you're still in the middle
of building this size studio.

105
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,140
It's just takes time.

106
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,310
It takes time to put everything together,

107
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,320
but it should be get Mexican
labor of closer next week then,

108
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:25,961
then this week,

109
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,340
but it's going to be
cool when it's all done.

110
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,550
It's going to be fun too.

111
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,010
It's a sweet setup,

112
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,401
but yeah,

113
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:30,581
man,

114
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,001
it is cool it,

115
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,230
there's all this stuff is taken off.

116
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,740
Yeah.

117
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,640
It's beautiful to hear.

118
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,950
Joey Diaz is a,

119
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,640
you know his podcast is always in
the top 10 of iTunes now he's a,

120
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,483
he's killing them.

121
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,540
Yeah.

122
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,051
In the morning.

123
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:41,950
Does that 5:00 AM,

124
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,170
I'm looking at sleep for two
hours and it's like such a bad,

125
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,623
it's awesome.

126
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,010
I always woke up that early.

127
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:49,150
Yeah,

128
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,983
he's an animal.

129
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,741
He's the one guy.

130
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,240
Like whenever I would do Kevin and being,

131
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,780
you know,

132
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,250
I have to be up at like
seven o'clock in the morning.

133
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,153
I always call him.

134
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,131
He'll be awake.

135
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,221
Yeah,

136
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,390
we'd go have breakfast together.

137
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,080
We've had breakfast together in Hollywood.

138
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:00,880
The gang at times.

139
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,850
He used to call me sometimes when he
woke up a little too early and he would

140
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,040
call me at like four 15 just to see.

141
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,731
I was like,

142
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,160
hello,

143
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
and he just started laughing.

144
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,471
He's like,

145
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,304
you're still up.

146
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,800
Breakfast and Hollywood is a weird thing,

147
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,280
man.

148
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,431
Oh,

149
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,264
it's good there.

150
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,020
Yeah,

151
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,830
it's good burgers.

152
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,260
Good Punch with a bunch of these places.

153
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,220
The griddle griddle,

154
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,121
but what's,

155
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,190
what's weird is the
people that you run into,

156
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,020
you know,

157
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,830
it's the words that that vibe,

158
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,840
who's up that earliest,

159
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,220
the Hollywood morning vibe.

160
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,670
Hollywood is such as much
as fakers fucking place.

161
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,241
Yeah.

162
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,290
The percentage of fakers.

163
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,124
It's super high.

164
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,630
You feel that in the air,

165
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,340
you know?

166
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,710
Yeah.

167
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,760
I feel like a lack of authenticity
shitting me for no reason.

168
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,690
Yeah,

169
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,250
just asked you what time it is.

170
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,050
It's given me a story.

171
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,060
It's so hard to deal with people,

172
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,380
isn't it?

173
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,680
Or do you guys are hired by the way,

174
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,030
are doing the house of Blues in Chicago.

175
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,983
Powerful.

176
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,891
When is this happening?

177
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,480
November powerful.

178
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,430
November 8th house of Blues in Chicago.

179
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,110
Pack the fucking house
of Blues in Chicago.

180
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,921
That's going to be fun,

181
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,190
man.

182
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,281
Yeah.

183
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,110
That's a main event when people
are driving in for that one.

184
00:04:59,410 --> 00:04:59,741
Yeah,

185
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:00,490
that sounds,

186
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,450
that sounds sick.

187
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,800
All right.

188
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,131
Should fear,

189
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,060
what is it like man,

190
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,631
it just,

191
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,690
a few years ago you were in this
like crazy struggle situation.

192
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,920
It's the bass.

193
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,340
It's so much bad.

194
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,173
Huh?

195
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,350
He just got to go to these
places and do your stand up.

196
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,840
Yeah.

197
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,170
It's all I wanted to do.

198
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:21,370
That's all I wanted to do it just go
and tell the jokes I prepared and no one

199
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,150
would let me let me,

200
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,370
nobody else will that me.

201
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,490
I get to the end of a week of like,

202
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,690
so that was pretty good.

203
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:28,981
Right?

204
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,430
I mean you saw that was for the connect.

205
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,280
You think I can come back
one day at next to no money,

206
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,293
can I please?

207
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,343
And they're like,

208
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,293
Nah.

209
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,560
Ah,

210
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,950
yeah.

211
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,150
They didn't have faith.

212
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,980
That's the greatest come out.

213
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,841
But it's,

214
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:44,290
you know,

215
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,220
they've heard my album,

216
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,521
it's,

217
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,091
you know what it is,

218
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:46,451
man.

219
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:46,811
It's like,

220
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,171
it just,

221
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,210
water seeks its own level eventually.

222
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,910
And if you had all this going on,

223
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,331
you know,

224
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,420
if you were doing podcasts and everybody
would come to see you and you weren't

225
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,050
funny,

226
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,890
it wouldn't be happening.

227
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:57,620
The it's happening.

228
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,130
It's happening

229
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,300
because of hard work.

230
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,290
It's like you're,

231
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,640
you're in this position,

232
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,091
you know,

233
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,840
it's like the perfect time for you
because your act is really strong now.

234
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:06,170
It's like,

235
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,281
well,

236
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:06,670
you know,

237
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,210
you're,

238
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,230
somebody pointed this out too.

239
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,510
Got a lot of new shivs were
thing with a lot of podcasts,

240
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:11,650
people that,

241
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,060
right.

242
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,120
And because of that,

243
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,670
the comics who do sort of
an honest style of comedy,

244
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,350
just an open and honest style.

245
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,370
It's like that this is a premium put
on that now and so they've already been

246
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:21,940
doing it.

247
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,450
So it's like,

248
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:22,571
Oh,

249
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:23,404
good for you,

250
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,553
right to the right time.

251
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,923
It's very hard

252
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,260
to do that style comedy if that's
not what you've been doing.

253
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,650
If you've been doing a sort
of contrived bullshit act,

254
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:31,990
it's,

255
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,750
it's very tough to drop that

256
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,110
be real early on.

257
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:35,921
It's what everybody does.

258
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:36,281
It's just like,

259
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:36,491
let me,

260
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:37,390
here's the joke I wrote,

261
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:37,990
I guess.

262
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,290
Yeah.

263
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,960
You ever go back and listen
to some of your early shit?

264
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,740
I put one up for shits and giggles once,

265
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,511
like an early,

266
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:47,260
early set.

267
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,680
Yeah,

268
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,970
and then I was like,

269
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,900
this is just to know someone's
going to see that something.

270
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,763
This is amazing.

271
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,340
It's just know it's taken us down bad.

272
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,790
It's fucking hard man.

273
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,060
And in the worst too was people were
writing in like so funny and I'm like,

274
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,070
you're wrong.

275
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,090
You're way wrong.

276
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,530
What have you liked?

277
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,240
Everybody thinks they can do it though.

278
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:09,840
Have you ever,

279
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
I mean everybody that's
got any sort of confidence,

280
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,880
there's always the that question
and I've been thinking about doing,

281
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,950
stand up prepared some stuff.

282
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,843
Tell me what you think.

283
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,241
And they're like,

284
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:19,740
go over this stuff with you and shit.

285
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,161
You're like,

286
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:20,841
Oh God,

287
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,230
it's pressed to how terrible

288
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,200
I go dissuade you.

289
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:26,430
But well look man,

290
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,941
I go,

291
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:27,774
okay.

292
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,480
You know,

293
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,880
I wa,

294
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,420
I mean,

295
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,780
who the fuck knows?

296
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,130
They might be able to do it.

297
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,300
But realistically,

298
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:33,880
if you're like,

299
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,450
if I can give you an honest answer
without hurting anyone's feelings,

300
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,740
you would have to tell them like,

301
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:37,921
look,

302
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,980
you've just started this so of
course you're going to be God awful.

303
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,620
Yeah.

304
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,310
That's hard for people to accept though.

305
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,590
Especially smart people.

306
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,850
Smart people think that.

307
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:46,211
Yeah.

308
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:46,841
You know what though,

309
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,111
man,

310
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:47,411
I know.

311
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,244
Stand up.

312
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,300
I listened to it.

313
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:49,511
I've,

314
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,570
I've have watched it on TV before I
think or have an idea how to do it.

315
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,980
I'm just gonna bypass all.

316
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,680
Did you think to get that
with fucking farming?

317
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,400
You want to tell you how to plan a tomato
10 years and you'll be way better at

318
00:07:59,401 --> 00:07:59,670
it.

319
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah,

320
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,170
that's with everything.

321
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,850
But standup is that what people don't
understand when they're watching it is

322
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:06,684
that there's a,

323
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,400
there's a hypnosis going on.

324
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,750
It's not as simple as someone saying
something and you're reacting to that.

325
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,110
There is a little ride that
a standup takes you on.

326
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,011
You know when,

327
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,710
when when someone's good and
you watch them to this day,

328
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,210
like you get caught up in their,

329
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,040
their groove and you know,

330
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:23,641
you're like,

331
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:24,750
you're like tune into them.

332
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:25,280
You're like,

333
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,690
there's,

334
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,690
there's an exchange going on that it's
not as simple as everybody wants to make

335
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,060
it seem like you say something funny.

336
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:33,781
Ha Ha,

337
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,650
this person laughs.

338
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,670
Not that simple.

339
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,490
That's why when you say tosh does
something wrong by spending a rape joke,

340
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:38,671
you're like,

341
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:39,570
you weren't there.

342
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,950
You don't know about the whole situation.

343
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:44,670
He set up the last however long
he's built his crowd into something.

344
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:44,941
We're now,

345
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,990
he can do what he wants.

346
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,891
Your God,

347
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:47,250
Shit.

348
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,510
I remember early on you were like,

349
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:49,650
I can't open with that.

350
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,090
Yeah,

351
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,671
I've tried.

352
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,241
It won't work.

353
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:54,960
You've got to give him like 40 minutes
of like calmed down before it can hit him

354
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,771
that yeah,

355
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,010
like the

356
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,341
whole,

357
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,580
that's the whole thing that I
was used to do on Noah's Ark.

358
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,420
Yeah.

359
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,920
Yeah.

360
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,530
That all the people who
just do would get upset,

361
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,740
which is hilarious.

362
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:02,970
Yes.

363
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,620
You have to get them on your side first.

364
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:05,460
And if you did it and they'd be like,

365
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,294
it's just not funny.

366
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,661
Well,

367
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,230
it's also then in people didn't know
what to expect to come to one of my shows

368
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,240
and they would think there's going
to get the guy from fear factor.

369
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,840
That's all my fault by holding it up,

370
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:18,080
I'm doing shit like fear factor taken,

371
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,220
taken money for those silly shows.

372
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,230
He said bad precedent.

373
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:22,861
We were like this.

374
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:23,350
They had a cut.

375
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,030
You're like,

376
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,350
but fears not a factor for you.

377
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:28,430
Oh no,

378
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:28,850
it wasn't.

379
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,940
It's never hard to do.

380
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,990
You know?

381
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,990
I would never be a so pompous to pretend
that it's actually difficult to do.

382
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,431
It's,

383
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:37,860
it's still an amazing job.

384
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,830
Why did you start getting high
while you were doing it too?

385
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,700
Okay.

386
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,500
Season two so you knew it was coming back.

387
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,340
The ratings were high.

388
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,060
Yeah.

389
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,000
Well I just started getting high
around when season one happen,

390
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,620
but I didn't get high at work.

391
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:49,951
See,

392
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,200
I know what to get white at
and what not to get high at.

393
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,650
You went from not smoking at all
to smoking at work within a year.

394
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,250
Oh yeah.

395
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,083
Wow.

396
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,591
I was like,

397
00:09:58,591 --> 00:09:59,730
this is fun.

398
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,020
Gets a bunch of years.

399
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,480
Yeah.

400
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,610
Y Yeah.

401
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:06,030
I right away went to feeling
very comfortable with it
going on stage with it.

402
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,983
Hi.

403
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,810
Yeah,

404
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,600
it's just right away.

405
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,570
I recognize that this is
like some crazy truth serum.

406
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,683
Like it's not,

407
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,210
it's,

408
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,821
it's another thing.

409
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:15,930
It's not as simple as it seems.

410
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,320
You look at marijuana and all those guys
were getting high and you just escaping

411
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,154
reality.

412
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,860
It's actually doing the
exact opposite of escape.

413
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:24,960
You're seeing reality for what it is.

414
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,680
Diving into it with the lights
on as bright as possible.

415
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,250
It's not,

416
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,140
there's nothing escape about getting high.

417
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,520
This is what people don't understand.

418
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:32,721
It's,

419
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:33,301
it's not,

420
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:34,300
that's not what you're looking for.

421
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,430
Especially when you're smoking.

422
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,650
Sativas which another problem,

423
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,120
people don't know that there's two
completely different effects at two

424
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,970
completely different types of marijuana.

425
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:44,280
Half.

426
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,660
I feel like telling that
to people when they say,

427
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:46,381
I'm sure you the too,

428
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:46,920
when I say like,

429
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,041
oh,

430
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,701
I don't like weed.

431
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:48,030
I'm like,

432
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,990
I don't want to insult you.

433
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:49,890
But like what we'd,

434
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:50,550
if you had,

435
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,970
yeah,

436
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,380
you don't really know
what you're talking about.

437
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,581
You know,

438
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,810
and the people that say that
it makes it makes me sleepy.

439
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:56,490
It's,

440
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,323
well,

441
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,211
some we,

442
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:58,771
you can do that.

443
00:10:58,771 --> 00:10:59,610
Let me give you some other way.

444
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,360
Yeah.

445
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,140
This guy was sleeping at
a party and some major,

446
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,000
a desktop they'll go on is

447
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,410
hilarious.

448
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,993
Oh my God.

449
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,720
Meanwhile,

450
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,560
how much did they finger this guys?

451
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,970
That is hilarious,

452
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:15,804
dude.

453
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,150
Pat On this guy's ass.

454
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,130
That's amazing.

455
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,190
And they all signed
their names all over it.

456
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,581
Look,

457
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:24,450
people sign names,

458
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,950
however it just signing him.

459
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,120
Oh my God,

460
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,961
that's amazing.

461
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:29,280
I had a picture of me as well,

462
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,520
my flight when I got there because the
drinking age is 18 and I was drunk,

463
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,630
Barf in a sink,

464
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,510
like leaned over it to read
those in my ear and my nose.

465
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,810
My friends had put all over
me at toothpaste drawn on
me and that picture got

466
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:40,644
back to my mom.

467
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,760
I don't know.

468
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,593
Not back there.

469
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,370
So fucking embarrassed by it.

470
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,630
Oh my God.

471
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,000
How hammered were you that
you didn't know limits?

472
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,230
Tequila slammers you've ever
had to kill the slammer,

473
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,640
the shittiest Tequila.

474
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,010
Put little sprite in it and one
of those triple shot glasses.

475
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:57,430
Yeah.

476
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,080
You just slam it and then just drink it.

477
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,580
You have to learn limits.

478
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:00,910
Huh?

479
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,220
You just keep drinking
until you're throwing up.

480
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,540
Like literally last shot of going down.

481
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:04,930
You're like,

482
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,763
well hold it.

483
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,151
Yeah,

484
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,620
that's the problem with drinking.

485
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,641
You know?

486
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:13,000
That's something we could use
drinking schamens we really could,

487
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:13,780
you know,

488
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,790
I mean there's Schamens
for Iowasca as the deal.

489
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,200
Why don't they teach
you about it in schools?

490
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,220
You're going to get into it,

491
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,660
but they still don't bother teaching you.

492
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,021
Well,

493
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:23,770
let's just pretend like
abstinence is the best policy.

494
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,900
We should promote abstinence.

495
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,460
I,

496
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,310
why would you do that?

497
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,670
What you doing or what can never
totally going to happen on that trip?

498
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,980
We went into phrase at that
second semester of senior year,

499
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:33,491
we all went there.

500
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,540
I was talking to more my friends about it.

501
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,790
Like why wouldn't they
tell us about drinking?

502
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,720
Please.

503
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,280
People are going to fuck to okay,

504
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:39,881
they're going to fuck.

505
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:40,511
And I'm going to drink.

506
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,344
You know why?

507
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,360
Cause that's fine.

508
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,861
Okay.

509
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,720
People are going to fuck and
people are going to drink.

510
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,860
Why don't they talk about that?

511
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,590
You can't be against educating
people about condoms.

512
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,850
If you've ever seen an episode
of 16 and pregnant you,

513
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,720
you're no longer against condoms.

514
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,261
They're like,

515
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,190
you got to teach these people.

516
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,990
You should be a better way than condoms.

517
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,180
There should be like a
really effective way.

518
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,970
I was told me,

519
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,950
give you a shot and it's called a fortune

520
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:07,860
dude.

521
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,270
If you have,

522
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,800
you have had an abortion with a check
or gone where it girls had an abortion.

523
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,670
You know what that's like,

524
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,470
but if they make it good with like lasers,

525
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,131
like Bam,

526
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:15,611
you're done.

527
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:16,900
You just got to a board it next,

528
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,381
Bam,

529
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,080
you got to it.

530
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,180
I can take a shot and be like,

531
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,770
you'd be sterile for the next two days.

532
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,280
Look,

533
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,060
yeah.

534
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,761
What are the side effects?

535
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,030
I know this girl that's on something
that she gets a shot or something and it

536
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:26,290
lasts like four years.

537
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,750
Why are,

538
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:26,951
yeah,

539
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:27,191
yeah,

540
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:27,401
yeah.

541
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:28,090
What's it called?

542
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,050
The Nuva Ring.

543
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah.

544
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,470
She's like,

545
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,980
you could total cum dumpster because
of that because you can do whatever you

546
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:33,814
want.

547
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,100
They have like four periods a year.

548
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,993
Is that one of those?

549
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,023
It's like inside.

550
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,180
Here's why doesn't every girl,

551
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,350
same thing with girls on on
on fucking birth controls.

552
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,380
The same thing with weed where
it's like have you had all of them?

553
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:45,760
Cause there's new types now,

554
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,790
but it's kind of creepy though that
you're pumping chemicals in your body like

555
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,200
that and you're tricking your
body into thinking linear,

556
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,173
pregnant.

557
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,780
I mean,

558
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,740
I don't know.

559
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,560
What is the longterm effects of tricking
your body into thinking that it's

560
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,130
pregnant?

561
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,860
I Dunno.

562
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,693
Doctors.

563
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,400
Delicious Pussy.

564
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,413
Yeah.

565
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,750
No worry about baby.

566
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,380
I don't know have some negative effects
more than fucking having to work a

567
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,550
second job at the docks.

568
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,600
But those two things have that people
can't control when they're young is sex

569
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,320
and alcohol.

570
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,041
Those are two things.

571
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:15,520
He just,

572
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,211
both of them,

573
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:18,100
both of them were completely
overwhelming for you.

574
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,300
One of those kids talking and he was just
some nerd who never got laid with some

575
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,980
fat Mexican and never got laid.

576
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,993
And it was just like,

577
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,781
he was just like,

578
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:25,991
no,

579
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,824
I love you.

580
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,820
Oh my gosh.

581
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,890
And it was like you don't
know anything about anything.

582
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:33,190
And then a year later he won't talk to
her and then just figuring out who's

583
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:33,971
going to raise the baby.

584
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:34,610
It's just like,

585
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:34,720
oh,

586
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,430
you don't know anything.

587
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,850
Being a child and having a
kid as far as I am fucked up.

588
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,050
It's fucked up for everybody.

589
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:42,250
It's fucked up for the kid too.

590
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,660
It's yes,

591
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,840
but then the question becomes when you're
supposed to prevent it after the fact

592
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:48,820
or before the fact and if after the fact,

593
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,130
is it just you have to just accept
it or can you have an abortion?

594
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,260
And of course they're
going to have an abortion.

595
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:54,990
Of course you can.

596
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,120
But the Kim medical age.

597
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,451
Okay,

598
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:58,220
but to what age?

599
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,810
How old could the fetus be?

600
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,003
Nine months.

601
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,673
What do you think?

602
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,083
I Dunno.

603
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,780
I Dunno.

604
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,231
What do you think,

605
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:06,471
Brian?

606
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:09,920
What I do think though is that it's not
as simple as everybody likes to say,

607
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,090
no,

608
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,940
it's killing a baby.

609
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,410
We're adults who are making decisions
that we don't want to make this light

610
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,870
that's deep.

611
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,063
That's deep.

612
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,390
It's a heavy decision,

613
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,760
you know?

614
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,331
It really is.

615
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:22,040
That's what we've put onto human life for.

616
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,911
Like it comes out,

617
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:23,490
we're like look,

618
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,430
like when it comes to a certain level,

619
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:27,200
it's like when it's a bunch of cells,

620
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:28,550
when it's like 30 cells,

621
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,001
okay,

622
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,760
then it doesn't seem real then it seems
like you'd be able to get rid of it and

623
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:32,530
not even feel bad.

624
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,200
Yeah.

625
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,580
But at what point in time,

626
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,440
how easy is it to market it better?

627
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,680
You know,

628
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,513
if it was like

629
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,640
person like Betty White market it for you.

630
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:46,150
I do like the marketing techniques they
have is because of the pro life and

631
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,940
fourth choice.

632
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,260
When you think about just their names,

633
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,250
they're not at odds.

634
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,820
Both pro choices and
they're both pro life.

635
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,001
Yeah.

636
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:53,541
Isn't that funny?

637
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,380
Pro Choice.

638
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,590
That's a funny way of putting it because
otherwise it's pro life or pro death or

639
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,880
pro choice or anti choice.

640
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,271
Yeah.

641
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,070
It's pro life or pro choice.

642
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,621
You know,

643
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:02,720
those aren't opposites.

644
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,311
Yeah.

645
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:05,240
It's one aspect of the subject.

646
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,930
Yeah.

647
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,630
You know,

648
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,240
what choice are you making?

649
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,074
Hold on.

650
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,190
Just a kid.

651
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,450
Just call it a choice to kill pro choice.

652
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,250
Everybody's fucking pro choice.

653
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,170
That's just my choice is
different than your choice.

654
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,393
Exactly.

655
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,733
Exactly.

656
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,300
That is a creepy thing though.

657
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,340
The idea that people would be anti choice.

658
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,090
That's why when someone calls themselves
pro choice like sets you up to fail

659
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,050
when you competing against,

660
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,533
you know,

661
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,500
you know you can't,

662
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,670
they're saying they're pro choice if they
just were the pro baby killing party.

663
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,240
Yeah.

664
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,901
Who does that?

665
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:39,171
Yeah.

666
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:40,190
That's what I'm in favor of.

667
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,480
That's not going to make you money.

668
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,620
I talked to girls before,

669
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:43,850
I have sex sometimes and I'm like,

670
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,510
you know,

671
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,370
what have you had and how
do we feel about abortion?

672
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,533
Well,

673
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,000
it's a heavy conversation right away.

674
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,590
Ari's mercenary about it.

675
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,060
I don't want to fucking get that thing.

676
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:53,481
We just,

677
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:53,661
Oh,

678
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:54,411
I didn't know that.

679
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,840
She would never have an
abortion if anything happened.

680
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,470
Yeah,

681
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,970
cause I wouldn't bother asking.

682
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,260
Just saying the words wants.

683
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,041
It's a little uncomfortable.

684
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:01,821
So I'm going to raise some kid.

685
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,760
I don't want for fucking 10 years
or however long you'd have to.

686
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,210
Isn't it crazy?

687
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:07,701
So you just,

688
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:08,534
I just ask,

689
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,531
isn't it crazy?

690
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:10,364
That would just,

691
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,600
you play in like,

692
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,490
like when you're,

693
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,140
when you're not trying to
have a baby with a check,

694
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,110
it's actually not to,

695
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,230
you're playing this game
of trickery with nature.

696
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,830
Like nature's only reward me with those
awesome feelings cause that's how you

697
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:25,670
make humans,

698
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,241
you know,

699
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,830
and imagine how much it feels,

700
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,760
how good it feels.

701
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,110
If you're not even masturbating.

702
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,561
I give,

703
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,010
you're not masturbating and you'd just
a person and neither one of you ever

704
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,520
masturbate and you get together
naked and you wind up fucking like,

705
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,301
oh my God.

706
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,470
Of course you're going to come inside her.

707
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,730
Of course she's going to make a person.

708
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,780
That's how they rocked it.

709
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,770
Caveman just keeps feeling
good and they stopped.

710
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,613
It would never stop.

711
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,950
It was two people went,

712
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,621
oh wait a minute.

713
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,090
Babies come

714
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,810
a little pull out.

715
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:50,920
No,

716
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,660
no.

717
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,950
We had to figure out what makes
the baby part Louie bit about it.

718
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,350
No,

719
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,910
but if animals had to watch humans,

720
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:58,440
like animal planet version of humans,

721
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,221
they'd be like,

722
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,070
see this meeting and then we pull out
and shit on the floor or something like,

723
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,720
but you were so close.

724
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,040
What are you doing?

725
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,153
That's funny.

726
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,820
I thought I said tell my friends in
college when I was still a virgin that

727
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:15,060
masturbation was the same
as sex and they were like,

728
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,740
Ari,

729
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,201
you're wrong.

730
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:16,381
I'm like,

731
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:16,591
no,

732
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:17,580
you guys are idiots.

733
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,210
It's the same thing that's happening
physically to your genitalia.

734
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,320
How could it feel better?

735
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,810
It's the same act and they were like,

736
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,800
you just don't get it.

737
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,730
How could you think that your hand
could be as good as a pussy because you

738
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,140
coming would be the same.

739
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,430
That's you coming as you coming.

740
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,330
Wow,

741
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,050
that's interesting.

742
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,400
Isn't it funny that that's not the case?

743
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,570
That's not at all the case.

744
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,210
Like when you're really into
a chick and she's really sexy,

745
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:43,220
you rang especially a little drunk and
you love each other and you come like,

746
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,640
Oh God,

747
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,090
Oh God,

748
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,340
I feel so good.

749
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,361
It's amazing.

750
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,500
Sweet corn in the morning.

751
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,650
It's supposed to be to
make you make people.

752
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,821
That's really what,

753
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,050
that's why it feels so good.

754
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:58,990
You can't even think straight on.

755
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,150
It's a biological trick.

756
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,110
It's a wonderful one.

757
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,810
Wipe off the tip and put it back in.

758
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,653
It's me.

759
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,920
If you had to think about that with a
straight mind wiping off the tip and

760
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:10,200
putting it back in but
not be a viable option.

761
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,071
How about this one?

762
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:12,150
Just let me rub it on the outside.

763
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,150
She had ever taken place ever in
the history of the human race.

764
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,590
It was on one of my cds.

765
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,620
Okay.

766
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,940
That's your best match
I've ever done right there.

767
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:37,951
That's right.

768
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:38,820
I forgot about that.

769
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,271
Okay,

770
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,104
cool.

771
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,711
Dude.

772
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:41,700
Working at this store,

773
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
like as an employee,

774
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,750
as a fucking door man and cover
booth guy just helps you so much.

775
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Watch all these fucking great comics and
you just watch them and learn technique

776
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:51,660
and shit.

777
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,580
You get to see them do
the same jokes a lot too.

778
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,030
It was interesting as a guy learning
how to do it because everybody wants to

779
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,610
think as an audience member that that
a person on stage saying something.

780
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,180
That's the first time I've ever said it.

781
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,150
You really can't do that every time.

782
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,920
I mean we kind of can,

783
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,000
but it won't be as good.

784
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:06,834
Trust me,

785
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
it's better if we write stuff out.

786
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,800
It's better if we practice
things a few times.

787
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:11,760
It's better if you get it on.

788
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,080
Then there's this certain bits.

789
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:13,381
No,

790
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,030
there's certain bits where
it right out of the gate.

791
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:15,690
They're awesome.

792
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,230
It's cool.

793
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,120
But it happens.

794
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,340
You can't guarantee when those
are coming in when they're not.

795
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,473
You know,

796
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,620
there's something in Indianapolis.

797
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,050
I came back to my show second
time cause he came one night,

798
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,010
then he got my album,

799
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,630
which was different of the call up,

800
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,070
holocaust available revenge for the
Holocaust Ladies Gentlemen available on

801
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:32,821
Itunes,

802
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:33,654
Amazon.

803
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,700
But he was like,

804
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:35,791
oh,

805
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,301
it's different.

806
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,400
So I figured I'd come back again,

807
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,560
see another show and he just sat
up front and I couldn't even look.

808
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:41,340
He was on my right.

809
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,470
I did my whole act from straight to left.

810
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:44,580
I couldn't even look over there.

811
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,721
I was like,

812
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:46,380
dude,

813
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,560
you shouldn't come back.

814
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,540
And he was like the same jokes.

815
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,374
That's so creepy.

816
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,051
It's a mind.

817
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:51,390
Fuck.

818
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,510
I feel so fake.

819
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,111
Yeah.

820
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:53,221
I mean,

821
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:54,160
you got to get over that son.

822
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,930
You are fake fat faker.

823
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,580
You didn't just think of
something when you're up there.

824
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:58,414
God dammit.

825
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,760
You worked on it every
night for six months.

826
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,470
I just realized,

827
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,100
no you didn't.

828
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,940
You're fucking line

829
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,001
the death squad,

830
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:05,601
Ohio guys.

831
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:06,890
They go the boat shows,

832
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,040
they'll go to like these seven o'clock
show and the nine o'clock show.

833
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,690
So it's just like you guys,

834
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,870
it becomes a bit of a gay circle joke.

835
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,713
At a certain point.

836
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,130
I sort of get it where it's like
you can see like modest mouse.

837
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:20,960
There's some band like two times in a row.

838
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,570
Yeah,

839
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,403
I'll do to

840
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,330
more than once in a row.

841
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:25,740
I went to see bill Hicks twice in a row.

842
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,270
I saw a bunch of guys back in the day
where I saw the same act more than once.

843
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,790
Joe Loads aren't used to come to,

844
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,080
uh,

845
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,130
to our shows when we did
none of the way and shows.

846
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,730
Oh yeah.

847
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,340
And uh,

848
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,030
and there was this joke,

849
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,170
have you just make a bunch of Jitsu?

850
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,593
Um,

851
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,441
I guess I can do it now.

852
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:40,220
I never do it anymore,

853
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,611
but like,

854
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:41,000
uh,

855
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,811
I've got the way that you just,

856
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,760
it was invented was some Brazilian guy,

857
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,810
uh,

858
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,300
came on work from early one day,

859
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,050
came home early from work one day and
found his wife did not have dinner ready

860
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:51,884
for him.

861
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,450
So he's choking her because
of that fucking choking
the life out of her and the

862
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:59,360
girl's father comes in cause I live
in the same fucking hut in Brazil.

863
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,553
And um,

864
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:00,891
he goes,

865
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:01,724
what are you doing?

866
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,950
You're doing it wrong.

867
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,540
You got to fucking put hooks
in and then come from behind.

868
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,970
And that's how Jujitsu was invented.

869
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,021
That's my theory.

870
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:09,690
But I was,

871
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,510
I used to love that joke and I was like,

872
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,470
you seen it though?

873
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,570
And he goes out every sucks.

874
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,111
I was like,

875
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:16,160
I haven't done any research on it.

876
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,940
Uh,

877
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,361
but he goes,

878
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:17,451
no,

879
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,490
I like to sing it like slightly different.

880
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,241
Yeah,

881
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:20,361
yeah,

882
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:20,860
yeah.

883
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,210
See you're a fan of
standup then I get that.

884
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,451
Yeah.

885
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:24,980
There's certain guys that
had jokes that I would,

886
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,810
I would call out for like a,

887
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:27,920
when Holtzman was on stage,

888
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,860
who would always do that?

889
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,490
[inaudible] into a rage.

890
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,180
He would do this joke about a sosh.

891
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:36,661
Oh,

892
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:38,090
that's a fucking funny guy.

893
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,480
Never see him at the store anymore,

894
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:39,860
man.

895
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,693
I was never there.

896
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,760
My son,

897
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,600
my son's a homosexual.

898
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,630
He's my new favorite to call out.

899
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,830
Like just hear his jokes.

900
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:47,100
He's,

901
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,400
he's,

902
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,731
Oh yeah,

903
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:48,241
we used to do this.

904
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,760
They doing an hour and 10 set
minute sets the other day.

905
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,560
He's been doing really long sets now.

906
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,060
Closed up the main room show on Constance.

907
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,660
Awesome.

908
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,770
And they just all stay.

909
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,360
As long as your audience stays.

910
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,710
I'm doing the laugh factory.

911
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,100
And more night at the
time were where were,

912
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,120
well I had done the laugh
factory and decades probably.

913
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:03,450
Oh,

914
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,350
probably 10 years.

915
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:04,741
Yeah.

916
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:05,760
I haven't done it forever,

917
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,340
but I'm gonna do it tomorrow night.

918
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,320
I think it's like an eight o'clock
show when I go on like nine ish,

919
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,900
somewhere around nine nine
30 something like that.

920
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,790
Daddy d is just got
back from a long beach.

921
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:16,624
She said he loved it.

922
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,250
Yeah.

923
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,083
We should all go there.

924
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
Bet You really got to fill it up.

925
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,170
I like to see what it's like full,

926
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:20,551
but it's a,

927
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:21,420
it's a rock venue.

928
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,920
It's a cool area because I've stayed
at the hotel is there a few times.

929
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,920
It's so here's how big it
is when they introduce you.

930
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,690
By the time you can get to the mic,

931
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,120
it feels uncomfortable
in that time were like,

932
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,241
oh,

933
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,350
I should be talking now.

934
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,280
Really?

935
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
It's such a long walk to them.

936
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,890
Like a theater.

937
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,010
It was a fucking old rock
place with a big stage.

938
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,020
600 people maybe.

939
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,291
Yeah,

940
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:43,950
something like that.

941
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,783
Wow.

942
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,711
So,

943
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:46,270
uh,

944
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,960
it's big as a Phoenix,

945
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,310
the standup life in Phoenix,

946
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,270
it's bigger than that.

947
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,193
Really.

948
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,010
The,

949
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,030
just because it's more stage room and
standard blind and Phoenix is 600 seats,

950
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:56,570
right?

951
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,970
It's 50 it's bigger than six 50.

952
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,790
Wow.

953
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,150
Well the scope of it is bigger anyway.

954
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,831
Oh,

955
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:03,540
I see.

956
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,680
To the wall and stuff.

957
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,001
Yeah.

958
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:08,660
It's right next to so many to stores and
restaurants that stand up live is the

959
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:13,580
most intimate 600 you could get
because even though it was 600 seats,

960
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:15,050
it felt like it's like a club,

961
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,800
but just keeps going.

962
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,220
Yeah.

963
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,990
It felt like once we worked out,

964
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,510
if you would please Jen on the first show,

965
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,790
there was a problem with the microphone.

966
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,751
We'll monitor.

967
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:24,411
It was no minor,

968
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:25,490
so you can hear yourself.

969
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,090
There's a rider somehow I have a rider
that I didn't know it was that weird

970
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:29,330
shit.

971
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:29,610
Yeah,

972
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,780
and one of the things on is that
I have to have a wireless mic.

973
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:35,270
I don't need a fucking
wireless Mike Wireless Mikes.

974
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,313
It's,

975
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,720
I know for when you do like theaters,

976
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:40,310
like the more theater
in Seattle or whatever.

977
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,180
It was like,

978
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,710
just make sure you have everything right.

979
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,600
We need them because they don't
know sometimes the stand up,

980
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,141
but even then,

981
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,400
I don't need a wireless one.

982
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,860
Having James Mooney and it's Kevin.

983
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:51,531
I met Kevin.

984
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,510
James is rider.

985
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,560
He gets red wine and right where I,

986
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:54,741
yeah,

987
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:55,221
that's why I was like,

988
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:55,570
why?

989
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:55,960
Why?

990
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,793
Why aren't you

991
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,193
there too?

992
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:00,980
Right.

993
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,770
It was a weird man.

994
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,300
San Francisco this weekend we got,

995
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:03,930
um,

996
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,080
Brian's coming with me or are you doing
Greg Fitzsimmons is coming as well.

997
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,190
She'd be a lot of fun.

998
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,160
We're doing Knob Hill Masonic Center.

999
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,110
We're going to do that on Friday night.

1000
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,540
And then Seattle on Saturday night,

1001
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,201
the Moore Theater,

1002
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:17,790
the more theater is sold out.

1003
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,863
That's a really good room.

1004
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,780
But there are uh,

1005
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,120
there,

1006
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,130
there's still some tickets
left for the Nob hill show.

1007
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,020
So that's San Francisco Friday night.

1008
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:28,050
Greg Fitzsimmons who's fucking hilarious.

1009
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:29,940
If you never seen Greg
Fitzsimmons who's standing up.

1010
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:33,960
Greg and I started out
together like literally like
a week apart from each other

1011
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,700
way back in 1988.

1012
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,210
And uh,

1013
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,170
I've been friends with him ever since.

1014
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:39,190
He's a fucking hilarious standup.

1015
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,830
Like he's really fucking good.

1016
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,300
So I'm really excited to give you guys
a fun show and if you haven't seen me

1017
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,731
there for a while,

1018
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:45,900
I got a lot of new shit.

1019
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,490
So we're going to be real fun.

1020
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,780
So nob hill,

1021
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:49,531
masonic center,

1022
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:51,410
Friday night and then
the more theater side.

1023
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:51,890
And I,

1024
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,880
I think the more sold out
though because Nob Hill,

1025
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,840
I dunno,

1026
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,130
it's like a couple thousand seats.

1027
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,113
Wow.

1028
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:57,870
Actually we cool.

1029
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,380
Yeah,

1030
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,213
yeah,

1031
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,630
yeah.

1032
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,710
That's a massive show.

1033
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,041
Yeah,

1034
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:02,450
yeah,

1035
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,100
yeah.

1036
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,100
I just was talking to them and I just
thought like maybe it would be cool if

1037
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:11,280
Greg would come with me on the road
to a couple of gigs here and there.

1038
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,930
So solid too.

1039
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,790
And I would love for people to see him,

1040
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,653
you know,

1041
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,220
and all these shows to see him.

1042
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,940
You know,

1043
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,940
I think one of the coolest things about
doing this podcast and doing all these

1044
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:24,910
shows is that is it,

1045
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,720
we can all sort of blow each other up,

1046
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:27,970
you know,

1047
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,540
and then we can all show you
everybody who Brian Cowan is,

1048
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:31,230
you know,

1049
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,690
show everybody who Dunkin is and you all,

1050
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,130
yeah.

1051
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,230
With Hollywood style of making it,

1052
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,570
there's only a certain size,

1053
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:40,370
the pious and everyone is just slice.

1054
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,320
But now there's just an unlimited pie.

1055
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,691
Yeah.

1056
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:43,110
This is like,

1057
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,820
you can have as much,

1058
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,280
you have your own pie factory,

1059
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,320
Oliver.

1060
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,430
On Pie factory.

1061
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,411
Yeah.

1062
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,400
It's fascinating.

1063
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,870
It's a really interesting thing,

1064
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:52,250
man.

1065
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,830
Yeah.

1066
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,970
So tell me about this hunting thing.

1067
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,870
So yeah.

1068
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,590
Um,

1069
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,640
so I went hunting.

1070
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,870
Who'd you go with with Callan?

1071
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,130
Brian Cowen and uh,

1072
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,840
this dude named Steve Rinella

1073
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,910
was this a cougar hunt?

1074
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:05,860
But thinking,

1075
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,370
God,

1076
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,560
how dare you Brian.

1077
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,530
That's the kind of Huts Brian understands.

1078
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,020
He knows,

1079
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,390
he knows how to attract that prey.

1080
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,160
He walks in all drunk and limping.

1081
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,150
He told me it was like,

1082
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:18,721
he was like,

1083
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,160
where's broken?

1084
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,570
And he was like broken than
Minnesota fucking whatever.

1085
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,171
Montana,

1086
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,570
Montana hunting when hunting in Montana,

1087
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:26,340
this dude Steven Rinella,

1088
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,190
I became a fan of his show.

1089
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,100
He had a show on the travel
channel called the wild within.

1090
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,790
He's an author and he knows a lot
about the history of the wild west.

1091
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,250
And that was one of the coolest things
about the weekend is getting to talk to

1092
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:40,620
him about wild west stories and shit.

1093
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,161
Oh Dude.

1094
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:41,941
He knows everything.

1095
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:43,020
He knows like all the different,

1096
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:43,980
you know,

1097
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,530
incidents between the
Indians and the white men,

1098
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,350
the white men breaking the treaties
and the wars that took place.

1099
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:54,351
And we were camping on the Missouri
River where Lewis and Clark camped.

1100
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,921
That's where we camped.

1101
00:27:55,921 --> 00:28:00,180
And we did all our travel
by canoe or by hiking.

1102
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:00,660
Really?

1103
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,111
Yeah,

1104
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,880
it was fucking intense.

1105
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,050
So when you hiked by the Missouri River,

1106
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,070
was anyone else around?

1107
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,580
We saw in the five days we were there,

1108
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:12,360
we traveled 40 plus miles
down the Missouri River.

1109
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,930
And in all that time we
saw three other boats.

1110
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,660
Whoa.

1111
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,180
And then when you got off and was
like walking around and stuff?

1112
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:21,331
Well,

1113
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,070
once we got out at the very end,

1114
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,760
we were in a place where there was a
bridge and it was cars and traffic and

1115
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:27,594
stuff like that.

1116
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,723
It's down.

1117
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,191
Ah,

1118
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,830
over those five days we
saw nothing but canoes.

1119
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,390
We saw it three or four canoes.

1120
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:34,710
It was mostly just us.

1121
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,430
And we had a satellite phone in
case we had like an emergency.

1122
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,360
Um,

1123
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,880
and what we did was we pulled in,

1124
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,990
we got there,

1125
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:43,570
uh,

1126
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,620
on Monday and on Monday
we got in a plane are we,

1127
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:48,410
we got in a boat rather um,

1128
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,230
road a road down the
river kind of playing.

1129
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,080
What the fuck am I talking about?

1130
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,760
Got on a plane to get there.

1131
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,780
Um,

1132
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,870
we had to drive two hours
from billings to the rivers,

1133
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,310
the Missouri River billings.

1134
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:03,120
Montana is a very small place but a very
nice like cool small town cop a map.

1135
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,523
And uh,

1136
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,240
we drove two and a half hours

1137
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,400
to the river.

1138
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,473
And then when,

1139
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,850
what you just say the mayor?

1140
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,510
No,

1141
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,811
no,

1142
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:17,310
I said we drove to the river.

1143
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:17,940
Okay.

1144
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,270
Okay.

1145
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,390
We drove to the river and
then once he's too high,

1146
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,240
yes.

1147
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,650
For a store and he's too
high to pay attention.

1148
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,870
Drive the river.

1149
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,471
No,

1150
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:27,221
he said the mayor.

1151
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:28,054
Did you say the man?

1152
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,033
He said the word mayor.

1153
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,261
Dude,

1154
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:31,720
I'm telling a fucking important
and life changing story.

1155
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:36,721
You can't tell me when they like
timing with every fucking breath.

1156
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,340
I have question spewing mouths.

1157
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,380
I tried to tell you about a
beautiful life changing experience.

1158
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,610
So,

1159
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,443
so we're on this,

1160
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,380
we're on this river.

1161
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,540
Well,

1162
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,400
the first night we get there,

1163
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:49,270
it's pouring rain.

1164
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,260
We sleep in tents.

1165
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:52,240
It's fucking freezing outside.

1166
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,880
I mean it's really cold
like 33 34 degrees.

1167
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:59,500
Just w just cold enough so it
doesn't snow but the rain comes down.

1168
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,480
It's just ridiculously miserable.

1169
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,710
Then we get up in the morning.

1170
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:03,544
Have warmers or anything?

1171
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,050
Nope.

1172
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,740
You just sleeping bags
at that night like I,

1173
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,780
this was a bad idea.

1174
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,641
No Man,

1175
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,300
I was committed.

1176
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,470
I was 100% committed.

1177
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:11,891
I was like,

1178
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:12,340
look,

1179
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,390
if I'm going to do this,

1180
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:16,510
I'm going to do this the right way with
this Guy Rinella believes in is what's

1181
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,130
called a fair chase hunt.

1182
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,760
And what that means is like there's
certain people that have like a,

1183
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,120
they have property like a giant
ranch and it's like a high fence.

1184
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,130
And so there's all these deer inside this,

1185
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,550
this ranch and he like set up a stand
and then there'll be like a little feeder

1186
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,060
that goes off and it goes off
at the same time every morning.

1187
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:37,270
And it drops food and the animals come
in and get the food and you blast him.

1188
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,451
Oh,

1189
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:39,610
that's exactly what though.

1190
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,010
I mean not just trick them.

1191
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:43,930
I mean it's like the
ultimate setup as well.

1192
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,310
Just get your foot in the supermarket.

1193
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,303
Exactly.

1194
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,110
Exactly.

1195
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,120
And if that's how you were approaching it,

1196
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,140
I can understand that.

1197
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:53,290
Like say if you lived on that
farm and that's how you look,

1198
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,000
if that's actually smart,

1199
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,170
because it's a lot smarter than you know,

1200
00:30:59,171 --> 00:30:59,950
at going hunting,

1201
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,870
going and hunting for it.

1202
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,241
You should,

1203
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:01,690
you know,

1204
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,100
control your environment better.

1205
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,090
You need that food.

1206
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:06,070
It's not like you can
do it like as a sport.

1207
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,080
But we,

1208
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:08,291
uh,

1209
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:08,830
we went,

1210
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,600
we went and did everything the hard way.

1211
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,170
We hiked every morning
for about three miles,

1212
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:14,680
uh,

1213
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,390
over this mountain.

1214
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,750
These like these hills
that were made out of,

1215
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,640
they're made out of like a clay that
used to be the great inland Western,

1216
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:26,890
see great western inland sea,

1217
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,210
Great Western inland sea.

1218
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,020
And uh,

1219
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,460
during the Jurassic period,

1220
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,720
there was fucking dinosaurs
there and there's fossilize.

1221
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,230
It was a shallow,

1222
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:37,780
warm water ocean where Montana is.

1223
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,930
So when you are a walking around there
you find like fossilized shells like in

1224
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:43,870
the strata,

1225
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,070
you know like when things break off they
also find buffalo skulls all the time.

1226
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,580
Like in the strata because,

1227
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:50,440
well what a strata.

1228
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,020
Me the,

1229
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,890
you know how the earth has
like layers to it though?

1230
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,790
Well those layers,

1231
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,440
if you cut a slice through the earth,

1232
00:31:56,441 --> 00:32:01,150
those layers represent errors and you
can tell by how far it goes down by

1233
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:01,984
whatever measurement,

1234
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,161
how many thousands,

1235
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:04,570
millions of years it was.

1236
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,580
And you saw like a place
that cut out and stuff?

1237
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:06,761
Yeah.

1238
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:10,570
You see like fossilize
shells like on the ground,

1239
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,521
I mean it the,

1240
00:32:11,521 --> 00:32:13,510
the place it's called the bad lands.

1241
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:13,841
All right.

1242
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:14,674
And it is,

1243
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,820
it's,

1244
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,420
it's really cool,

1245
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,190
timid dating.

1246
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:18,821
It's a very,

1247
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:23,140
very intimidating place because there's
this river and then there's she's

1248
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,520
fucking mountains that are covered with
this clay shit and you're trying to walk

1249
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:27,711
in it,

1250
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:29,260
you're sliding all over the place.

1251
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:33,010
It's really difficult to get a
footing because it's essentially silt,

1252
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,990
silt from the bottom of the ocean.

1253
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:38,860
It's covered this whole
thing and it freezes up and
then it gets wet and it gets

1254
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:39,170
wet,

1255
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,980
becomes muck and it freezes up again.

1256
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:41,811
So when it's hard,

1257
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:42,501
you can walk on it,

1258
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,250
no problem.

1259
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,330
But when it becomes wet,

1260
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,010
it's just a fucking crazy nightmare.

1261
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:50,150
So we were climbing these wet hills
of this shit and it's exhausting.

1262
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,560
I mean really exhausting.

1263
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:52,520
And you're doing it for,

1264
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,200
you do that for several
hours in the morning.

1265
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,700
And then we would go in a row row the
canoes down river for several miles.

1266
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,050
And then once we would get out,

1267
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:04,090
then we would go and hike for several
more miles to get back and there a deer.

1268
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,920
You pull up your,

1269
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,763
your canoe,

1270
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,760
he said camp.

1271
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,110
And then you go and look for deer.

1272
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,850
Bears are predators.

1273
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:13,490
They're predators or Wa we
saw a mountain lion shit.

1274
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,110
And they attack humans a lot.

1275
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,101
No,

1276
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:17,090
there's too many of us.

1277
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,290
And we have rifles.

1278
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,510
We probably be would be safe.

1279
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:23,660
But you never can tell if you're in
the wrong situation at the wrong time.

1280
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:24,390
Hunger and amount.

1281
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:24,710
Yeah.

1282
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,970
For Mountain Lions old,

1283
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,560
if it can't catch a deer anymore,

1284
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,921
you know,

1285
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:28,880
if it's starving,

1286
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:29,480
if you catch them,

1287
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,380
you can just catch them.

1288
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,510
But where you were camping
at night like by the river,

1289
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,373
that was okay.

1290
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:33,891
Yeah.

1291
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:36,410
While we were camping at sites
where you're allowed camp,

1292
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,760
you know you're allowed to set up and we,

1293
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:38,210
you know,

1294
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,170
after the first night it
stopped raining so we,

1295
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:41,300
we made fires.

1296
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,431
But the,

1297
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:43,580
the nighttime man,

1298
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:44,390
when you,

1299
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,370
first of all it's fucking freezing.

1300
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:49,340
Like we've got down to as
cold as 12 degrees spin.

1301
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:49,791
No,

1302
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:50,240
it didn't spill.

1303
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,550
We slept in separate tents
were all sleeping outside.

1304
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,320
I mean we're outside in the fucking,

1305
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,931
I mean you,

1306
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:56,540
you have to zip yourself up in these,

1307
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,860
you wear a wool underwear,

1308
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,030
you wear like thermal,

1309
00:33:59,031 --> 00:33:59,330
like,

1310
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,550
like long John Tyler wool underwear.

1311
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,110
And then you were on top of that,

1312
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:05,900
like a thick pair of these wool pants.

1313
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,120
And then on top of that I've got,

1314
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:08,511
you know,

1315
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:11,090
a above me of God will long,

1316
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,320
long underwear top and then two layers
and then a jacket and then a down coat

1317
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,160
over the jacket.

1318
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,640
And then I'm inside the sleeping bag
in the down coat with a hood up and the

1319
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,920
hood on the sleeping bag and
you're barely able to do it.

1320
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,360
It's fucking cold.

1321
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,010
But once you get in there for awhile,

1322
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,830
especially once I've realized
to sleep with the jacket on,

1323
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,380
like I thought I should
probably take my layers off,

1324
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,430
but it was too cold.

1325
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,010
It's you to rule part.

1326
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:33,821
Yeah.

1327
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,341
It sucks.

1328
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:35,780
It sucks a masturbating,

1329
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:36,370
right?

1330
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:36,680
Yeah.

1331
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,520
I held my loads,

1332
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,730
I held my loads for strength and it,

1333
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,560
it benefited me in for my endurance.

1334
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:43,071
Cause it was a,

1335
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:44,480
it was a difficult thing to do.

1336
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:44,870
You know,

1337
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,291
it seems,

1338
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:45,861
it seems like,

1339
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:46,011
you know,

1340
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,090
you're whining about like,

1341
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:47,661
I work out.

1342
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:47,961
I do,

1343
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:48,771
I do tough stuff.

1344
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:49,161
I do,

1345
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:49,651
you know,

1346
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:49,850
uh,

1347
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,620
like hard kettlebell workouts.

1348
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:52,580
I do Jujitsu,

1349
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,690
very difficult things.

1350
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,280
But this hiking shit,

1351
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,631
when you're,

1352
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:57,680
you're hiking around in mud all day,

1353
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:57,920
you know,

1354
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,753
uphill.

1355
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,780
It's fucking hard,

1356
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:00,051
man.

1357
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:00,231
You,

1358
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:00,441
you,

1359
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:01,100
you really,

1360
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,640
you know,

1361
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,200
you really get winded.

1362
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,041
It's a,

1363
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,120
your heart rate gets up.

1364
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,130
It's a really good workout and you know,

1365
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:07,341
it's,

1366
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:08,570
it feels like honest,

1367
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,940
like you're really fucking getting some,

1368
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,570
you really doing something and you know,

1369
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,210
you're like,

1370
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,440
and then you get in the boat.

1371
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:15,921
So I was like,

1372
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,180
I was enjoying it from a,

1373
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,380
an an athletic stance.

1374
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:18,611
How was,

1375
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:18,940
I was like,

1376
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,850
this is a good workout.

1377
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,560
No,

1378
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,393
there was never warm.

1379
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,000
It never got more than in the
30s it was like the warmest,

1380
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,340
it was probably like 34 35 degrees.

1381
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:28,870
Like,

1382
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,180
well,

1383
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,430
every time we were there
where water would turn to ice,

1384
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,510
it was always constantly turning.

1385
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,080
The more people there when
the summertime is cool.

1386
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,721
Yeah,

1387
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:35,931
yeah.

1388
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:36,291
I'm sure.

1389
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,124
But that's not,

1390
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,600
the hunting season starts and
you want to go deer hunting.

1391
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,291
See this,

1392
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,520
this area is,

1393
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,200
it doesn't have a lot of biodiversity
according to Steven Rinella.

1394
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,950
But what it does have is it has a lot of
certain types of animals that you could

1395
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:50,730
find.

1396
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,630
And there's not like,

1397
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:52,980
you don't see a lot of animals,

1398
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:54,720
but when every now and
then you'll see a deer.

1399
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:56,940
Like there's one in every now
and then you'll see a ram.

1400
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:57,970
We saw a lot of rams.

1401
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:58,950
Yeah,

1402
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,730
dude,

1403
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,530
they're fucking impressive.

1404
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,251
These,

1405
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:02,610
uh,

1406
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,860
big horn sheep and they're there.

1407
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,290
They're walking across the tops of,

1408
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,770
in the ledges of these mountains and
you're watching them just like really,

1409
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,310
really perilous situations
and they're walking like,

1410
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:15,360
they're so sure footed.

1411
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,890
It's really kind of crazy to watch.

1412
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,890
And they're so bad ass curly horns.

1413
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,311
Nah,

1414
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,150
I don't think so.

1415
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,010
I don't think you have
to get too close to,

1416
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:24,500
I blow,

1417
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,860
you shouldn't get close to him.

1418
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:26,051
But,

1419
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:26,181
uh,

1420
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:28,080
I think if you're not trying
to do something to them,

1421
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:28,740
they didn't seem,

1422
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,880
seem to be interested in us.

1423
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,710
Apparently that's a really hard animal
to get a tag for it to hunt because they

1424
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:37,380
reintroduced them to Colorado
and they built up the,

1425
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:37,650
uh,

1426
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,483
the numbers.

1427
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,640
And so it's very difficult to get a tag,

1428
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,650
especially where we were to hunt him.

1429
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,790
It's not like when you,

1430
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:45,571
when you go hunting,

1431
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,490
it's not like everybody can go hunting.

1432
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,900
He like if safe,

1433
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:49,980
there's certain species,

1434
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:53,040
it's very hard to get a tag for
it even if you live in that state.

1435
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,180
So they only say like,

1436
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,740
let's say only time people
can hunt these things.

1437
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,753
Yes.

1438
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,840
It's one of those things,

1439
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,850
and you might have a million
people that are trying to hunt,

1440
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,110
you know?

1441
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,430
But Deere is one of the ones
that you literally have to hunt.

1442
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,720
If you don't hunt deer,

1443
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,210
then they have starvation issues.

1444
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,760
They have overpopulation issues.

1445
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,290
They interfere with traffic that it
becomes a real problem if there's roads or

1446
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,040
anything,

1447
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,350
or people are driving along
because these animals,

1448
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,131
in order to get food,

1449
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:21,270
they have to travel all over the place.

1450
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,210
Now there are a lot of them are nocturnal
and they'll run across the road and

1451
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:24,401
there's,

1452
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:27,160
there's certain parts of the country
right now where if you're driving around

1453
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:27,871
the road at night,

1454
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:28,950
it's fucking scary.

1455
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,270
You could slam it.

1456
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:31,470
A deer's left and right.

1457
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:31,650
I,

1458
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,160
I've,

1459
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,730
I don't remember,

1460
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,900
I think it was Iowa.

1461
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,140
There's some ungodly amount of deer
are killed in car accidents every year.

1462
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,590
It's like 100,000 because
it runs into the cause.

1463
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,424
There's so many of them.

1464
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:41,810
There's,

1465
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,990
they're fucking all over the place.

1466
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,290
And for,

1467
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,000
for people that don't understand
how conservation works,

1468
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:48,930
it's really interesting,

1469
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,000
but the majority of the money,

1470
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,691
in fact,

1471
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:55,950
all of the money that goes
to wildlife groups like,

1472
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:56,720
um,

1473
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,420
uh,

1474
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,171
like the,

1475
00:37:58,171 --> 00:37:58,560
um,

1476
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:58,811
the,

1477
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:03,210
the groups that put a bag limits on,

1478
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,571
uh,

1479
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,404
on hunting,

1480
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,020
you know,

1481
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,480
whatever the agency,

1482
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,310
whatever name of for
the agencies they are.

1483
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,091
And I don't know what,

1484
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:09,780
what they would,

1485
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,890
what they call themselves,

1486
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,480
but whatever they are,

1487
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:13,860
that fishing game,

1488
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:14,040
you know,

1489
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,873
whatever that is.

1490
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,290
But those,

1491
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,360
all their money comes from hunting.

1492
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,140
So the,

1493
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,973
all the,

1494
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,250
the money for regulating
like the population,

1495
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,800
reintroducing animals that were wiped out,

1496
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,000
all of that comes from hunting.

1497
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,790
And there's some people I can
understand their point of view.

1498
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,760
Some people think that we
should have no hunting and uh,

1499
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:33,061
you know,

1500
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,220
that that hunting is cruel
and it animals is cruel.

1501
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,321
And I,

1502
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:39,760
I can totally understand
that point of view too.

1503
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:42,130
I totally understand animals well,

1504
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:42,640
I liked,

1505
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,040
look,

1506
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,230
the,

1507
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,530
the type of person that would say you
shouldn't kill an animal cause killing

1508
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,870
animals.

1509
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,700
Accrual is a nice person.

1510
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,100
That's a person that wants
to be nice to animals.

1511
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,890
So I can't see how I would
want to argue with that.

1512
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:54,071
You know,

1513
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:55,000
I can see your point.

1514
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,500
But ultimately if I look
at it pragmatically,

1515
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:00,820
my thoughts have always been that,

1516
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,211
listen,

1517
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:04,840
these animals are going to die whether
we'd them or whether a coyote eats them

1518
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:05,860
or amount might need some.

1519
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,930
We found giant mountain lions shits
with hair on them with deer hair on him.

1520
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,531
Oh really?

1521
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:11,741
Yeah.

1522
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,610
It's really creepy.

1523
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,620
It's really creepy cause
you're just thinking this,

1524
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,410
this motherfucker killed
this deer with his face.

1525
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,160
Wow.

1526
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,720
Like what a bad ass cat.

1527
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:20,554
This is juicy.

1528
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,450
That video of a,

1529
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,740
the coyotes get killed
getting killed by the wolf's.

1530
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:24,200
Yes.

1531
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,120
Oh yeah.

1532
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,030
They rip it apart as don't have hands.

1533
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,470
Well the wild is a very
fascinating thing man.

1534
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,980
And being out there for five
days with no cell phone,

1535
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:36,850
no Internet,

1536
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,481
no TV,

1537
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:38,320
no radio,

1538
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,440
just sleeping outside and
eating outside for five days.

1539
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,490
It was very strange.

1540
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:44,260
And you're stalking an animal.

1541
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,820
You're stalking animals.

1542
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,220
And occasionally we'd see them,

1543
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,320
they were too far away and uh,

1544
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,070
we had to get up wind of them if we were,

1545
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:51,610
if we were,

1546
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,780
if we were a,

1547
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,780
if we were up wind and the wind
was going down to them our way,

1548
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,673
they could smell us.

1549
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,100
So we had to make sure that we were
always in a situation where the wind was

1550
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:01,690
blowing towards us,

1551
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,280
like from the animal to us.

1552
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,100
So at the animal couldn't smell us
and we're going to creep up on them.

1553
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,270
You would see it from far,

1554
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,250
far away and then try to track it down.

1555
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,151
We see them from far,

1556
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:13,030
far away and then we would duck behind
things and then we would try to go all

1557
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,820
the way around like that
depending on where the wind was.

1558
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:16,571
It's very important.

1559
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:19,360
How far down my first
vote we smelled so bad.

1560
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:21,940
We were there with no
showers for five days.

1561
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:22,601
Okay.

1562
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,620
So you could smell my ass from Mars.

1563
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,690
Sas must've been terrible heads.

1564
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:30,900
Yeah.

1565
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,160
You're,

1566
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,620
you're taking shits in these,

1567
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,990
these eco bags.

1568
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,820
It's like the whole thing was horrific.

1569
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:37,720
Yeah.

1570
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,141
Like this,

1571
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:41,740
this certain type of bag that's for
human waste so that you don't like leave

1572
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:44,560
your shit laying around
on the Missouri River.

1573
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,543
As long as their shit,

1574
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,020
you don't,

1575
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,691
what's gross?

1576
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:47,920
People don't want to step in your shit.

1577
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,390
Meanwhile there's cow shit everywhere.

1578
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,060
It's really wild because it's not wild.

1579
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:55,600
It's fucking deaf human shit of like
one of the worst things you could ever

1580
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:56,171
encounter.

1581
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,004
Yeah.

1582
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,510
Carb diets are disgusting and none natural
filled with preservatives and things

1583
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:03,460
of fucking ferment inside are assholes.

1584
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,130
And then it comes pouring out
and the most wretched smell ever.

1585
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,890
Even dog shit doesn't smell
nearly as bad as human shit.

1586
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,690
Human Shit smells dog shit in the house.

1587
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,270
Like I think a dog shit.

1588
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,500
Oh Fuck Ross.

1589
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,030
She go shit.

1590
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:21,120
Like I had the biggest fogo shit the
other day and I put a t I wanted to just

1591
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:24,870
put a $20 bill on it and not flush it
to somebody would try to grab that $20

1592
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:25,830
bill just to see it.

1593
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,461
Cause you know,

1594
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:27,294
I don't want him,

1595
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:27,840
you know,

1596
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,673
I didn't want them.

1597
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,420
We'll take a look.

1598
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,253
Let's try it.

1599
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,093
Anyway,

1600
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,500
so,

1601
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,820
so we're out there for,

1602
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,430
you know,

1603
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:36,710
two,

1604
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,251
three days.

1605
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:41,450
On the third day was when I
killed a deer and we were,

1606
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,900
before that we had seen a couple of
them but we couldn't get close enough to

1607
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:45,734
shoot him.

1608
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,101
Hold on.

1609
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:46,731
How far down?

1610
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:47,660
When do you have to be?

1611
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:48,980
Like two miles away.

1612
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:49,401
You're okay.

1613
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:50,640
But like how close can,

1614
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,590
you can be close as long as the wind is
going from them to you and then it's a

1615
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:55,401
matter of sound.

1616
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:56,270
But then if it's not,

1617
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,470
if it's going towards them,

1618
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,530
like how far away do you have to circle
around them to get it all depends

1619
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,030
because it's not a distance thing.

1620
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:06,590
It's a being behind things thing and
it's being above them thing you want.

1621
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,860
Ideally you want them below you and you're
above from like the top of the hills.

1622
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,750
Will you also be of more shots at
them if they have more opportunities?

1623
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,590
If they're going like up over
the hill and you shoot at them,

1624
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:23,120
they take off over the top of the hill.

1625
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,200
You didn't know where they're going.

1626
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,310
They went left or right.

1627
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:26,240
You have no idea where they are.

1628
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,400
If you look down on them,

1629
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,600
you could see where they are better.

1630
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,820
So you could scan more area too.

1631
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,070
It's Kinda hard to figure out
where they're going to go.

1632
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,321
It's,

1633
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,500
it's a really interesting
thing because it's your,

1634
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:38,150
you become a part of their world.

1635
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,391
I mean,

1636
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:39,380
you're walking around,

1637
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:40,610
you'll live in outside.

1638
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,060
You're,

1639
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,110
you're doing this for
several days and you're,

1640
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,990
you're becoming a party's animal's world.

1641
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,430
You don't talk all day,

1642
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,200
all day spent trying to walk as
slowly and quietly as possible.

1643
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,470
Stopping every 15 to 20
sites sounds like off scan.

1644
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,560
It just can't relax to scan the horizon
to look around for these animals.

1645
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,761
So you're,

1646
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:03,100
you're doing this all day and um,

1647
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,530
you,

1648
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,040
you,

1649
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,873
you're not talking,

1650
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,390
you know,

1651
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,230
very rarely.

1652
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,711
It's like,

1653
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:06,891
you know,

1654
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:07,760
maybe he'll say,

1655
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,210
okay,

1656
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,190
we're going to try over
here now on this one.

1657
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:11,180
Are you tracking anything?

1658
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,250
Sometimes we'll see a lot of tracks.

1659
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,590
You see a lot of a deer footprints.

1660
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:16,580
We saw elk footprints.

1661
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,411
A lot of Ram flipped,

1662
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:19,580
but we saw an amazing amount of Ram.

1663
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:19,851
So it was,

1664
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:20,511
it was incredible.

1665
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:21,230
How many of those,

1666
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,100
he's bighorn sheep.

1667
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,480
We saw you following the tracks.

1668
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,323
Are you just walking into,

1669
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,840
so you're following the trails
that the deer's traveling,

1670
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:29,930
cause it deer's traveling trails and
then they'll go off into the wooded areas

1671
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:30,764
to bed down.

1672
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,090
So they get up in the morning.

1673
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,290
Then in the morning they,

1674
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:33,540
uh,

1675
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,230
they were up and they get
water and eat and they'll,

1676
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:39,920
they'll stay active for a little while
and then they start going in the mid day

1677
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:42,230
to bed down and then they come
out when it gets dark again.

1678
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,850
Like we had one come through our camp
while we're sleeping and we heard it.

1679
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,820
You just hear a goal that he gets scared.

1680
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:50,061
It's,

1681
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:53,150
it came through the camp and as
it's in this cabinet realize like,

1682
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:53,691
oh my God,

1683
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:57,320
I'm surrounded by Ogres the monsters
at want to eat me right there.

1684
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:02,321
And it sort of freaks out and starts
stomping his feet and a fuck of a 10 if

1685
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,020
they want to.

1686
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,621
Oh yeah.

1687
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:04,011
It could.

1688
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:04,790
Of course it could,

1689
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,120
you know,

1690
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,361
I mean,

1691
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:06,260
they're not aggressive.

1692
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:08,150
It's not like they would do that
unless they were threatened.

1693
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:08,810
You know,

1694
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,690
they're there.

1695
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,240
They're clearly prey.

1696
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,960
You know,

1697
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,680
they're clearly there.

1698
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,880
There clearly pray for
all these different,

1699
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,540
uh,

1700
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,310
predators like especially mountain lions,

1701
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,330
but humans of course.

1702
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,370
And that's what they're worried about.

1703
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,470
Wolves will be an issue.

1704
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,810
They just want to walk
around and they want to fuck.

1705
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,680
That's what it is.

1706
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,450
It's getting close.

1707
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,900
We weren't there during the Rut,

1708
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,530
during the Rut.

1709
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,080
It's really crazy because the deer gets
super bold cause they just have hard ons

1710
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:35,100
and they just want to go fuck.

1711
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,310
And they'll just walk right across the
street and like look at you and you can

1712
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:39,144
blast them.

1713
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,290
It's a,

1714
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,280
it gets to be really,

1715
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:43,320
it's really like a ruthless trick,

1716
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:43,891
you know,

1717
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:44,311
because,

1718
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:44,670
um,

1719
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,031
they're,

1720
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:45,331
they're,

1721
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:46,141
they're being silly.

1722
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,720
So that's why people put the smell of it.

1723
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,990
You're on the female deer.

1724
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,351
Yeah,

1725
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:49,620
yeah.

1726
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,880
Well they spray it on them.

1727
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:52,140
They'll spray it on things.

1728
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:52,381
You know,

1729
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:52,920
there's,

1730
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,510
I think some places that's illegal though.

1731
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:54,811
There's,

1732
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,260
there's different places like didn't
have different laws and regulations.

1733
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:02,070
I learned a lot from hanging out with
the Steve Rinella guy was a fascinating

1734
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:02,280
thing.

1735
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,240
Should have those rules.

1736
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,820
Like girls shouldn't be able to
dress like sluts and that's like our,

1737
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,363
you know what I mean?

1738
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:08,780
Yeah,

1739
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,321
absolutely.

1740
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:10,154
I don't,

1741
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,720
fear comes up and he's like,

1742
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:11,901
oh,

1743
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:12,530
can I fuck,

1744
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:12,711
oh,

1745
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,630
it's some other thing and I can't fuck.

1746
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,460
So of girls were trying to rip you off.

1747
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:19,370
Like if girls were like professional gold
diggers shouldn't be allowed to dress

1748
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:20,380
like sluts yes.

1749
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,891
To let's,

1750
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:21,920
you're willing to back it up.

1751
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,790
Hmm.

1752
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,623
Okay.

1753
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,441
I see your point.

1754
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:25,340
You are a female deer.

1755
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:25,521
Yeah.

1756
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:26,360
You can make that smell.

1757
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,194
That's okay.

1758
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,310
It seemed like that,

1759
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:30,260
that would be very stressful.

1760
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,280
Like,

1761
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,900
did you ever get to a point
where you're just like,

1762
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,591
all right,

1763
00:45:33,591 --> 00:45:37,430
I really just want to just
yell and tweet and fighting,

1764
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:37,601
you know,

1765
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,590
like walk around it.

1766
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,340
No,

1767
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:39,800
no,

1768
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,160
no,

1769
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,470
no,

1770
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,303
no.

1771
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,080
I was able to,

1772
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:43,914
um,

1773
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,150
uh,

1774
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:49,830
I was able to sort of accept that this
was how we're living for the next few

1775
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,250
days.

1776
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:50,880
And uh,

1777
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,713
I didn't,

1778
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:51,840
uh,

1779
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,370
didn't look forward to it ending.

1780
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,331
He didn't bring your phone with,

1781
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,020
you know,

1782
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,690
well,

1783
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,371
it doesn't work.

1784
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:56,791
There's no,

1785
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:58,140
there's no cell phone reception out there.

1786
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:58,800
Nothing.

1787
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,910
You can't get anything out there.

1788
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,950
But I knew that going in there and
it was what I was thinking was like,

1789
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:08,880
this is going to be an
interesting opportunity to
sorta get off the grid for a

1790
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:10,140
little bit and see what that feels like.

1791
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,710
And one of the weird things about getting
off the grid for a few days is that,

1792
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:17,154
um,

1793
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,240
he got a lot of energy,

1794
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:19,074
man,

1795
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,820
got a lot of energy when you're walking
around going after these deer and then

1796
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:25,120
in between your role and your bone.

1797
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,630
But even when you sit
down for a few minutes,

1798
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,050
you don't,

1799
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:28,890
you're not exhausted.

1800
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,940
You don't want to take a nap.

1801
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,200
Like you have energy.

1802
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,213
It's like,

1803
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:32,551
dude,

1804
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:35,670
I think that's what people are
supposed to be smart phones.

1805
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:39,480
People were supposed to be working
and doing things physically all day.

1806
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,240
And when they don't do
things physically all day,

1807
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,320
they get exhausted.

1808
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,460
I really believe that.

1809
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:47,730
I think if you look at our
past as when we developed,

1810
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,151
you know,

1811
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:51,990
to the back the time where people
just first started storing foods and

1812
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:55,530
developing clothes and making weapons
and figuring out how to hunt animals.

1813
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,400
We were in motion all day where there
were a building shelter or collecting

1814
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:00,120
food.

1815
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,360
We were in motion all day
and I think that's how our,

1816
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,410
that's our default.

1817
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,710
And when we sit down like at a desk and
you're sitting in front of a computer or

1818
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:10,770
you're sitting there and you know,

1819
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:13,260
just sitting in front of the
TV in front of Television,

1820
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,330
I think your body gets confused as fuck.

1821
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,351
I think your body's like,

1822
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:16,561
well,

1823
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:17,700
we're just not moving.

1824
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,510
So I guess we should.

1825
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:18,810
Oh like,

1826
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,860
well why would that be a reason?

1827
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:22,100
It's just not eating.

1828
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,980
That's why I think that being in front
of a computer or being in a cubicle,

1829
00:47:26,981 --> 00:47:28,000
like doing that all day,

1830
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:32,810
like sitting in a desk all day is
probably terrible for your body.

1831
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,600
Terrible for you brain.

1832
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,870
How do we do this and
fucking surf the web.

1833
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,240
We should go walk even this right now.

1834
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,550
Like we're not doing anything.

1835
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:41,711
Yeah,

1836
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:42,940
but we're having a conversation.

1837
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,400
You know,

1838
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,260
this is the best way to have
a conversation is in the,

1839
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:47,260
in a way that you don't have
to think about your body.

1840
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:47,591
You know,

1841
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:48,640
you shut it off and relax.

1842
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:49,480
We were standing up,

1843
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,991
you know,

1844
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:52,960
we wouldn't be having as cool of a
conversation because we would be,

1845
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:53,823
maybe we should try it.

1846
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,710
We're not walking podcasts where we just
go for a nice walk and it's a bad idea.

1847
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,883
This

1848
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,410
was worse because with this fucking sucks.

1849
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:06,730
I want to go play Pokemon.

1850
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:08,680
Okay.

1851
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,290
Mine is this first thing that came to me.

1852
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,010
Um,

1853
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,590
is there a um,

1854
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,800
like a thing that we could get like the
big foot got hunter guys do a podcast

1855
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,240
videos of us getting
monitoring around Pasa.

1856
00:48:21,241 --> 00:48:21,920
Dena,

1857
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,150
look,

1858
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,990
you do a blog.

1859
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:24,220
We could totally do that.

1860
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,021
Yeah.

1861
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:26,620
That's a good idea.

1862
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,230
Well to this too pretentious
about Griffith Park,

1863
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,180
we would find people that will like put
their resumes in front of the fucking

1864
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,014
camera,

1865
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,210
such filled with so many
fucking douche bags.

1866
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:40,391
Yeah,

1867
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:41,380
we should totally do that.

1868
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,550
I took a lot of photos.

1869
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:43,384
Let's go to the zoo.

1870
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,080
I took a lot of photos from this trip.

1871
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:50,140
I'll kick a lot of photos
of their animal and uh,

1872
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:51,970
I mean I showed you a picture
of the animal that a shot,

1873
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,870
but so what happened was on the third day

1874
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,930
was when we were,

1875
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,560
um,

1876
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,370
we were,

1877
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,760
we had gone hiking through
the morning and then we,

1878
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:03,971
uh,

1879
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:04,810
went and looked for deer.

1880
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:05,320
We didn't,

1881
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,310
we didn't see anything.

1882
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,150
We got,

1883
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,090
we saw a couple of weeks and get close
enough to them to get a shot at him.

1884
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,081
And then,

1885
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:11,320
uh,

1886
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,580
we rode for a few miles down the river
and then we stopped at this one place.

1887
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:16,923
And uh,

1888
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:17,530
we're,

1889
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,620
we traveled about a
mile in this long field.

1890
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:25,330
We're going up all these hills and
one of the director's spots is deer.

1891
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,380
So there's just one dear.

1892
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,041
That's all is.

1893
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:27,874
And he's director,

1894
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,290
was he like,

1895
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:28,990
actually no,

1896
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:29,101
no,

1897
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:29,950
no director had the,

1898
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,700
the director also his works
as a camera man and his name,

1899
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,850
his name is Manuel.

1900
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,380
This is a super hard job.

1901
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:36,250
It's a for a TV show,

1902
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,520
104 television show.

1903
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,541
Oh really?

1904
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:41,374
Yeah.

1905
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:42,731
I can't wait to see what,

1906
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:45,580
it's all full documentation.

1907
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:46,780
A lot of funny moments.

1908
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:47,500
Oh yeah.

1909
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,011
My God.

1910
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:48,840
So much fun.

1911
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,800
Cause Callen went with me
so they had a hike with,

1912
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,753
with all their,

1913
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,130
all their cameras and shit
while they hold a camera.

1914
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,990
They have a camera that's not light.

1915
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,321
Okay.

1916
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:57,940
These guys are in serious shape.

1917
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,253
Mo Is this a,

1918
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,570
the directors is big
strapping guy and he fucking,

1919
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,010
he's huffing it man.

1920
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:04,280
I mean this is a real work.

1921
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:04,931
And Rinella,

1922
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:05,741
the guy just started the show.

1923
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,150
He does this shit all year round.

1924
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,420
So he's in serious shape
like he's in really like,

1925
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,490
there's like a type of shape
that you get in for hiking.

1926
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:16,090
Like it's a hiking shape and
he's in like great hiking shape.

1927
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:16,871
And so,

1928
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:17,140
uh,

1929
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,300
he takes these really perilous pass too.

1930
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:19,900
It was like,

1931
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,010
a lot of times I was like,

1932
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:21,251
Whoa,

1933
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:25,360
this is like tricky shit because I'm
carrying a rifle and I'm carrying a rifle

1934
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:27,080
and we're climbing up mountains and it's,

1935
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:27,800
it's,

1936
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,041
it's,

1937
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:28,400
you know,

1938
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,091
it was no joke,

1939
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:29,450
man.

1940
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,283
We did it.

1941
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,720
We did the whole thing the right way.

1942
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,070
I mean it wasn't,

1943
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:34,520
there was,

1944
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,280
there was this was like a
hundred percent wild animal.

1945
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,240
Most likely this deer had never
seen a person before was yeah,

1946
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:41,451
we,

1947
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:43,370
I mean we were in the
bad lands of Montana.

1948
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:44,720
It was like some serious shit,

1949
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,260
right.

1950
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,740
So we were getting over the
top of this Ridge and we,

1951
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:49,260
uh,

1952
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,780
we look over and most easiest steer so
we have to creep up on it and we have to

1953
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:57,950
creep up on it and go up wind
of it or downwind rather.

1954
00:50:57,951 --> 00:50:58,480
So that it's,

1955
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,920
it's sent is coming to
us and ours is coming in.

1956
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:01,941
And so then,

1957
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:02,270
uh,

1958
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,530
we've got a shot off at it,

1959
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:04,700
um,

1960
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,840
at 200 yards.

1961
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:07,340
I shot it from 200 yards.

1962
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,413
You killed it.

1963
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,650
How did they,

1964
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,450
how did you know how to use
the rifle the right way?

1965
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,313
He showed me how,

1966
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,700
showed me how to days before.

1967
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,301
It was pretty simple.

1968
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:14,461
I,

1969
00:51:14,461 --> 00:51:17,120
I shot guns before you
standing up or lying down,

1970
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:17,870
lying down,

1971
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:18,800
lying down on the ground.

1972
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,970
He had a scope and everything,

1973
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,540
you have to correct scope
because it was 200 yards away.

1974
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,790
Bullets.

1975
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,280
The gravity hits them so they'll
go down the further or so.

1976
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:31,850
You have to know to aim slightly up if
you're 50 yards away or 300 yards away

1977
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,361
and they get,

1978
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:33,930
the scope is designed for that.

1979
00:51:33,931 --> 00:51:34,071
Yeah.

1980
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:35,830
It tells you how far not for,

1981
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,160
not for high powered rifles.

1982
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,450
It takes a long time before they,

1983
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,180
they change trajectory that goes
pretty straight for a long time.

1984
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,160
I mean it's like a really serious rifle.

1985
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,060
Um,

1986
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,880
so the deer drops and I
didn't even know he dropped.

1987
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:47,750
Like I shoot it,

1988
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:48,141
the whole thing.

1989
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:50,330
It's a really tricky thing
like shooting something.

1990
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,680
First of all you're breathing.

1991
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:52,640
I'm breathing heavy.

1992
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,990
Like we had,

1993
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,360
you know,

1994
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,060
done all this crazy hiking
and my adrenaline is fine
cause I'm trying to relax

1995
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:01,400
and tune in and I don't
want to hurt this thing.

1996
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:05,300
I want to shoot it in the leg and it runs
away and we can never catch it again.

1997
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:05,780
And you know,

1998
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,613
you know what I mean?

1999
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,543
And bleeds out.

2000
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,410
I wanted to just,

2001
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:10,490
I wanted to do it correctly,

2002
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:13,490
so I wanted to make sure that I had a
good shot and I dropped it with the first

2003
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:14,210
shot.

2004
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,110
He wasn't dead.

2005
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:15,860
Um,

2006
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,670
I had to kill it.

2007
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,930
I had to drop it,

2008
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:18,764
hit it with a c.

2009
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,880
No he was,

2010
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,773
he was going to die.

2011
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:24,020
It shot him through like right above,

2012
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,380
uh,

2013
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,213
like his heart.

2014
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,540
And so it would have taken,

2015
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,630
he like hit his spine or we
Amy for the heart of the head.

2016
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,740
He aimed for the heart.

2017
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,520
And so then you have to walk up to it
or shot it again and write their shot it

2018
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:35,360
from a distance.

2019
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,160
How far was pretty close?

2020
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,610
I got,

2021
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,840
I got pretty close to make sure that I
didn't miss 10 feet no further than that.

2022
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,280
Like 20 with the rifle again
with the rifle and then I,

2023
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:46,160
I finished it.

2024
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:46,681
It was a,

2025
00:52:46,681 --> 00:52:47,840
it was very intense man.

2026
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,780
Cause then right after that then we're,

2027
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:52,190
we're gutting it and it's hot.

2028
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,413
Okay.

2029
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,240
You know,

2030
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,530
you know,

2031
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,071
and I made,

2032
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:59,090
I made like a real conscious decision
to do this and I know I got a lot of

2033
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:01,280
criticism from a lot of people
that said you shouldn't go hunting.

2034
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:02,300
You shouldn't kill something.

2035
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:03,500
This is like so hard.

2036
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:04,941
But here's,

2037
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:05,870
here's the issue.

2038
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,570
And it's like a lot of these people that
I'm talking to you that were in leather

2039
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:09,404
shoes,

2040
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,393
okay,

2041
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,570
you got leather in your car,

2042
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:12,530
interior,

2043
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:12,801
you know,

2044
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:15,130
you eat burgers and you've
got no problem with it.

2045
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,200
You,

2046
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,470
my shop until they find out
the iPhone is made of one.

2047
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:19,880
Um,

2048
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,820
this is my point of view
and I don't want it,

2049
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,510
it's not that I want to kill animals.

2050
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:24,650
I'm like a mean person.

2051
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:25,484
I want to out and,

2052
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,341
and kill these,

2053
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:27,450
these beautiful animals.

2054
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,900
But I eat meat and uh,

2055
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:35,280
I've eaten meat my whole life and I've
taken no responsibility for how that meat

2056
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,150
is acquired.

2057
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,040
I,

2058
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,020
I read all this shit
about farming and I don't,

2059
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:41,460
I don't want to be attached to that.

2060
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:41,820
I don't,

2061
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,580
I don't want to be attached
to be to factory farming.

2062
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:44,871
Yeah.

2063
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:45,760
And means a huge difference.

2064
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,550
I don't want to be attached to,

2065
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,120
uh,

2066
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,691
to these,

2067
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:49,050
these,

2068
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,550
the way they treat animals where they,

2069
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,060
you know,

2070
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,850
they essentially have them
live their entire lives,

2071
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:55,170
tortured in cages,

2072
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:59,430
feeding shit food that their body can't
even digest to fatten them up and then

2073
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,070
then we kill them and eat them and then
you just pick it up at the supermarket.

2074
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,560
Completely detached from the process.

2075
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,790
It just is meat,

2076
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:06,661
you know?

2077
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:07,890
And so I,

2078
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,860
I knew coming in that this is
going to be a weird experience.

2079
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:12,040
Like how was I going to address this?

2080
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:12,883
What was I going to,

2081
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:13,980
was I going to,

2082
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:14,843
um,

2083
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,250
like was I going to enjoy this?

2084
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:21,420
Was I going to feel terrible
and become a vegetarian?

2085
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:25,020
Wha How was my reaction to
it when you walked up to her,

2086
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,770
how'd you feel when it was dead
before you shot the second time?

2087
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,480
I have to kill it.

2088
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,040
You could see it close enough to know.

2089
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:33,860
It's like actually breathing
and stuff with your hearing.

2090
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,320
Yeah.

2091
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:34,860
You can hear it.

2092
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,280
Yeah.

2093
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:35,980
What was he doing?

2094
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,190
Just struggling.

2095
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:37,450
Yeah,

2096
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,283
I'm struggling.

2097
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,720
Who wasn't moving much?

2098
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:39,871
I mean,

2099
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,051
he like,

2100
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:41,040
he was going to die soon,

2101
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,920
but I had to make sure that I
took care of it right there.

2102
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:44,971
And,

2103
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:45,804
um,

2104
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,441
it's,

2105
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:46,681
look,

2106
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:47,040
it's,

2107
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,873
it's uh,

2108
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,050
it's very strange.

2109
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,351
The whole,

2110
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:50,730
the whole experience is very strange.

2111
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,930
The whole experience of,

2112
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:55,170
of tracking them down a strange knowing
that you're tracking them down to

2113
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,220
eventually eat them,

2114
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:56,791
you know?

2115
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,260
And then when you're actually eating it,

2116
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,681
it's like,

2117
00:54:58,681 --> 00:54:58,921
you know,

2118
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:03,921
that that night we sat around the campfire
and we cooked liver and the heart and

2119
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,040
the kidneys.

2120
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,590
Did you get it backwards?

2121
00:55:06,591 --> 00:55:07,424
You can't fair?

2122
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,011
No,

2123
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:08,520
we had to,

2124
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,480
we had to bring it back.

2125
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,710
How'd you carry it back?

2126
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:11,520
You've cut it up,

2127
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,080
cut it up first and
everyone's texted pace.

2128
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:13,261
Well,

2129
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:14,190
we did the first night.

2130
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:14,880
We took the,

2131
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,151
the,

2132
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:17,970
the organs out that we
could use that you'd eat.

2133
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,530
You don't eat all the organs,

2134
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:22,260
which you eat the liver and eat
the heart and you eat the kidneys.

2135
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,120
And so we took all that stuff.

2136
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:24,460
What have you,

2137
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,650
or the rest of the word we,

2138
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,000
um,

2139
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,650
we pulled it out and we were
going to use it for cat fish bait,

2140
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,310
but you just leave it there and we want
to believing it there and other animals.

2141
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:32,820
We eat it.

2142
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,030
Yeah.

2143
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,660
Like almost immediately the ravens were
find it and when the ravens find it,

2144
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:37,161
then the,

2145
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:38,040
the coyotes,

2146
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:40,530
we'll figure out where the ravens
are and the coyotes will go to there.

2147
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,160
It's like nature has us really
efficient system of cleaning out.

2148
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,061
Yeah.

2149
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:46,290
So it's really amazing.

2150
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,820
So we leave the Oregons um,

2151
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:53,250
take the edible organs and then leave
the body overnight because it takes a few

2152
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,380
hours to part it up and okay.

2153
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,500
To clean it and parking lot.

2154
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,300
No,

2155
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,530
it's 30 degrees outside,

2156
00:55:58,531 --> 00:55:58,910
so it's like,

2157
00:55:58,910 --> 00:55:59,140
okay.

2158
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,731
A frigerator.

2159
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,920
So you tie it up to make sure
that nothing can get to it,

2160
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:03,210
but there's no insects there.

2161
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,043
Everything's

2162
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,203
warm.

2163
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,220
You couldn't have done that or what's,

2164
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:08,660
what's the deal?

2165
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:08,840
Can,

2166
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,900
you know you couldn't do that?

2167
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,610
You can't leave the meat
out if it's hot out.

2168
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:11,731
Like,

2169
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:13,290
if it's in Texas in August,

2170
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,470
you should have your hat like
that because they always kill it.

2171
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,970
It doesn't like go straight to her fridge.

2172
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,900
That's a good question.

2173
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,210
I don't know how long you have some time,

2174
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,410
but if it's hot out,

2175
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:23,890
you don't have as much time.

2176
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,710
That's when people sell
things to preserve them,

2177
00:56:25,711 --> 00:56:26,544
right?

2178
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,453
Yeah.

2179
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,821
Yeah.

2180
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:28,420
But that's uh,

2181
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:28,781
you know,

2182
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:30,490
that's not what they do with wild game.

2183
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,370
That's what they used to
do with meat back then.

2184
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:33,550
I didn't have refrigerators.

2185
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,830
I don't really totally
understand how that works either,

2186
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,060
but maybe bacteria doesn't live on the
surface with the salt or something.

2187
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:40,750
I don't know.

2188
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,860
But um,

2189
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,260
so it was so cold out.

2190
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,250
We just left it there.

2191
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:45,971
You can leave it there.

2192
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:48,790
It's like leaving in the fridgerator
and then wa it was like a mile from the

2193
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:49,181
camp.

2194
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:51,940
So then we had to walk back from the camp.

2195
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,710
Kenyon k yeah.

2196
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:55,300
We had to take it apart.

2197
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,080
How much of that,

2198
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,010
how much that buck way or
it was about 180 pounds.

2199
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,021
180 pounds.

2200
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:01,270
So you guys had to just put that up.

2201
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,841
Yeah.

2202
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:03,580
We had to chop it out
at 40 14 carried out.

2203
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,180
Yeah,

2204
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,050
it was a lot of work.

2205
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,281
That was a,

2206
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:08,890
that was the most difficult
than was carrying the,

2207
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:09,250
uh,

2208
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:09,790
the,

2209
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:10,360
the uh,

2210
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:10,930
buck back.

2211
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:11,660
I actually know,

2212
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,011
you know,

2213
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,660
all the hiking together,

2214
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:14,740
all of it was pretty hard.

2215
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,740
It was the really slippery slopes
are probably the hardest thing,

2216
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,740
but the most difficult thing is staying
calm and shooting the animal and then

2217
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,550
making a decision.

2218
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:21,641
Like,

2219
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:22,660
is this really what you want to do?

2220
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:23,500
Like what do you do?

2221
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,340
You've already made that decision.

2222
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,570
But I wanted to know,

2223
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:27,290
I wanted to look the,

2224
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,240
the detachment that a normal
person has an eats meat.

2225
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,640
I don't necessarily think that's healthy.

2226
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,700
I think that we have,

2227
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,460
uh,

2228
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,460
we've removed what it is from our
heads and we're just acquiring meat.

2229
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,530
We're just going to a
supermarket and acquiring meat.

2230
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,340
And uh,

2231
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,130
I think that that lack of connection.

2232
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,261
I don't know.

2233
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:51,940
I think ultimately it's not,

2234
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,510
it's not healthy and I
think it's not natural.

2235
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,470
I think it's weird.

2236
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,111
It's like being in the,

2237
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:58,130
know where the food comes from.

2238
00:57:58,131 --> 00:57:59,920
It's like being born rich or something,

2239
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:00,131
you know?

2240
00:58:00,131 --> 00:58:01,060
It's like you don't,

2241
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,460
you don't really appreciate
it or understand it.

2242
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,250
What do you mean they're just grab
food that somebody else killed?

2243
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,031
They killed things too,

2244
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:07,740
dude.

2245
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,141
They're out there.

2246
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,130
That's a hard scrabble life.

2247
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:10,780
You can't be picky and
choosy when your coyote,

2248
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,630
but I mean is that like the idea of
going to a supermarket and everything's

2249
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:18,160
prayer prepared and packaged for
you about shots of the animal?

2250
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,030
Like a photo of me when I was,

2251
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,900
maybe this is me at one years old,

2252
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:23,850
just learn how to walk.

2253
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,660
I feel like now when you
buy the meat you won't,

2254
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,430
you'll put up appreciate it more.

2255
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:27,671
Well,

2256
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,820
I have a lot of deer meat
to eat and that that,

2257
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,600
oh yeah,

2258
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:32,560
did you like it?

2259
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:32,831
You like,

2260
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,664
it's delicious.

2261
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,200
The best meat you can eat.

2262
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,890
So now they say you want to get it clean
so it doesn't taste the game because it

2263
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,260
released that testosterone or
whatever it is for adrenaline.

2264
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,180
Once you hit it before you kill it.

2265
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:43,601
Yeah,

2266
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:45,820
they're going to have
adrenaline no matter what,

2267
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:46,150
man.

2268
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,540
I mean,

2269
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,950
if it doesn't die instantly,

2270
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,390
but it doesn't taste bad,

2271
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:49,901
you know,

2272
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,111
it's,

2273
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:50,351
it's,

2274
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:51,970
it's a really lean,

2275
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:52,870
delicious meat.

2276
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:53,620
It tastes,

2277
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,670
it tastes really good.

2278
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:56,140
Um,

2279
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,220
for a lot of people,

2280
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,350
they have a problem with killing things.

2281
00:58:59,351 --> 00:58:59,551
I,

2282
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:00,060
I get it.

2283
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,080
You eat meat but you
don't like killing things.

2284
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,400
And I understand that.

2285
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,450
But I think,

2286
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:04,900
uh,

2287
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,290
being upset at someone,

2288
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,010
be upset,

2289
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,490
being upset at someone for
killing something that they eat,

2290
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,410
I think it's a little bit hypocritical,

2291
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,930
not a little bit
ridiculously hypocritical.

2292
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:14,201
It's,

2293
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:15,520
and it's also a stupid,

2294
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:16,300
it's,

2295
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:16,681
we're,

2296
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:19,470
we're not being honest about what our,

2297
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:20,230
as,

2298
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,160
as an organism,

2299
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:21,980
we're not being honest

2300
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,090
about what we are as an organism.

2301
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,350
If you're mad at people that hunt,

2302
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,840
because every fucking
restaurant you go to,

2303
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,910
ever way you look has
murdered animals in it.

2304
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,050
That's everywhere.

2305
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,250
You learn something different though,

2306
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:34,880
to be part of the killing as opposed to
being okay with the killing going on.

2307
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,360
He's like,

2308
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,790
you don't want to be an execution
or where you can believe in capital

2309
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,750
punishment.

2310
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,111
Yeah.

2311
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:41,240
Gas If you weren't eating the prisoners,

2312
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:42,110
FTA killed them.

2313
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,390
But I'm saying you don't have
to be the one doing the killing.

2314
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:45,720
Yeah.

2315
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,180
Difference between doing the killing
and just being okay with people were

2316
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:49,014
getting murdered.

2317
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,220
I don't think the capital punishment
argument works because you don't need

2318
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,780
capital punishment for sustenance.

2319
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,090
You need,

2320
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:55,923
you know,

2321
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,190
you don't need meat either
as people that exist.

2322
00:59:58,191 --> 00:59:59,090
I'm being a vegetarian,

2323
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:00,290
but if you're consuming me,

2324
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,080
you're eating it and you know
that is a part of your diet.

2325
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,730
That's your part of your everyday dot.

2326
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:08,870
Yet we have no connection with that
and that was the issue that I had.

2327
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:09,321
I was like,

2328
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:09,531
man,

2329
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:12,800
I feel like I just as a human
going through this life,

2330
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,330
if I'm going to continue to eat meat,

2331
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,370
I should take apart in the process.

2332
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,480
I don't want to start a farm
and go kill a pig on a farm.

2333
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,790
No part of you want to just
go to a photo farm insight.

2334
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,431
Let's just do that.

2335
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:22,701
Why?

2336
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:27,680
When I think the best way is this animal
lives at totally natural wildlife and

2337
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:28,730
then boom,

2338
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:29,760
it gets shot.

2339
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,830
Can just make an argument for them.

2340
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:31,850
Cause I think it's fine.

2341
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,073
I don't care at all,

2342
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,973
but uh,

2343
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,540
that deer would not have died.

2344
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,670
You don't know that you're wrong.

2345
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,231
Most of them,

2346
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:40,520
most of them die.

2347
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,600
Either they get killed by predators
or they die because it gets cold out.

2348
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,010
That happens.

2349
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:45,771
It's out eventually,

2350
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:46,640
but when it died right then,

2351
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,900
but if you go to a farm,

2352
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:50,270
but there's killing cows
that that would have died,

2353
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,130
right then just you're doing it.

2354
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,910
Wouldn't that be more of
taking apart in the process?

2355
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:56,840
I don't know what you're saying.

2356
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,790
Go to a farm where they're
killing a bunch of cows.

2357
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,040
Today's CALC Killam Day go there and say,

2358
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:01,161
Hey,

2359
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:01,730
let me work there.

2360
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:02,960
The deliver for a little bit.

2361
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:03,831
Let me fuck it.

2362
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:04,970
Put a nail gun in his head.

2363
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:05,301
Well,

2364
01:01:05,301 --> 01:01:05,691
you know what?

2365
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:07,070
That's like a semantics argument.

2366
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:08,090
Like why would you even care?

2367
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:08,481
You're killing.

2368
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:09,590
You're taking a life either way.

2369
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,550
Take a life that's destined to
be taken and it's less work.

2370
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,211
It's less.

2371
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:14,721
Less mean.

2372
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:17,720
If that's a normal kind of meet people
eat then that seems like if you're

2373
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:22,000
sending you wondering where deer
is as normal as eating cows,

2374
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:23,400
well first of all to one,

2375
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,810
people don't eat there as much
to if they do where they have it.

2376
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,660
If they do eat meat,

2377
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,910
they usually get it from
supermarkets which are farmed today.

2378
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:35,630
Today we want to take human history.

2379
01:01:35,631 --> 01:01:36,560
People have been eating deer.

2380
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,840
I mean if you're saying you want to take
a part of what you're eating and say

2381
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:39,970
I'm going to take uh,

2382
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,400
uh,

2383
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,340
I'm going to let my conscious sit on
this and see this is what we're doing and

2384
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:48,320
what you want to go and do actually what
you're doing to get that meat and not

2385
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:49,340
change it to a different way.

2386
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:50,480
I'm not sure I follow you.

2387
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,940
If you get your chicken from farms
that killed 3000 chickens in a day,

2388
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,210
and that's where people get that chicken.

2389
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,510
Wouldn't it be better if you want to see
what it's actually like where there's

2390
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:00,111
checking comes from,

2391
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:02,570
would it be better to go to a place like
that where the count chickens all day

2392
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:04,310
and have it strong up
and sliced his throat,

2393
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,030
then killing a while checking,

2394
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,060
um,

2395
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:08,893
without them.

2396
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:12,680
If you are dead set on
eating factory raise chicken,

2397
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:13,730
I could see your point.

2398
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,770
But if your point was that you want it
to be a part of what you ate that not

2399
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:20,010
that you specifically wanted

2400
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,050
to eat factory raise chicken.

2401
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:22,380
Yeah.

2402
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,041
You know what I'm saying?

2403
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:28,041
Like I think that the idea of an animal
living a wild life and then it's life

2404
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,600
ending in a brief moment because a bullet.

2405
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:31,320
Yeah,

2406
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,260
I think that is a more humane and more,

2407
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,100
I don't even like the word
humane because humane.

2408
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:37,650
What?

2409
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,540
What is the actual
meaning of humane cause?

2410
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,490
Is it because humans,

2411
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,200
I don't think you're so fucking humane.

2412
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,030
Technically we've,

2413
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,560
if you look at how we acquire,

2414
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,550
that's not all right
then we're going to farm.

2415
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:52,500
They would have died then.

2416
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:54,420
So it's like you can take
apart without adding to the,

2417
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:54,960
to a kill.

2418
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,741
I see what you're saying,

2419
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:56,820
but it doesn't make sense.

2420
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,050
I think you're just begged,

2421
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,043
begged,

2422
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,330
but it totally makes sense
that I see what you're saying.

2423
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:05,360
You want to show that you're a part
of this and they'll work counseling.

2424
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:05,811
Most of you know,

2425
01:03:05,811 --> 01:03:06,360
I want it there.

2426
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,680
I also want to eat game.

2427
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,750
I could gain the best food.

2428
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,261
I think,

2429
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:10,620
um,

2430
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:10,771
I've,

2431
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:15,210
I've said this for a long time that I
think that there's probably more nutrition

2432
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,280
and wild game than any other kind of food.

2433
01:03:17,281 --> 01:03:20,460
And I think that that's one of the
reasons why they're so elusive.

2434
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,860
They know that they're
worth something dear.

2435
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,240
When the deer hears you and those fucking
intendant ears pop up and they start

2436
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:27,690
looking at,

2437
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,320
they know that they're like
super nutritious and there's
a bunch of animals out

2438
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:32,880
there that are just trying to jack them.

2439
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,610
They used to be a lot more mountain lions,

2440
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,650
but apparently they have a
good healthy supply of them.

2441
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:38,130
Now.

2442
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,900
We didn't see any while we were there,

2443
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,700
but whenever you have a lot of deer,

2444
01:03:41,701 --> 01:03:44,830
you have a lot of mountain lions
because that's where the three,

2445
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,271
yeah,

2446
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:46,110
that's what they eat.

2447
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,370
Especially Fonz.

2448
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:50,560
They'll go after the babies because
they're easy and they could take them and

2449
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,100
that kind of made sure to set everything
up work because everything sort of a

2450
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:53,934
fighting chance.

2451
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,320
We're not going to kill you,

2452
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:57,690
but the ones that are too bold
and go out away from the herd,

2453
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,553
you're going to get jack.

2454
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,600
It's very fascinating to be,

2455
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,640
even though I went there with all these
human inventions like tents and guns and

2456
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:06,181
all that stuff,

2457
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:10,350
to be out there living in
nature for four or five days,

2458
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:12,900
it's so far very eyeopening experience,

2459
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:13,734
man.

2460
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,573
There's some weird,

2461
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:18,840
some weird primal shit goes off when
you're out there stalking a deer that

2462
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:19,920
you're eventually going to eat.

2463
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,800
And then like later that night you're
sitting in front of a campfire with a

2464
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:27,801
bunch of men and everyone's feasting on
the meat from this animal and talking

2465
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:30,150
about how delicious it is and enjoying it.

2466
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:32,160
And it's very strange,

2467
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:32,431
man.

2468
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:32,690
It's,

2469
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:32,910
it's,

2470
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:33,740
it's a lot.

2471
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,690
I can see where a lot of people
would be uncomfortable with it.

2472
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,840
I could see where a lot of people
would be angry and you know,

2473
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:43,440
they might be a little bit of rational
and be pissed at me that I went and w and

2474
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:44,250
I hunted.

2475
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:44,821
But you know,

2476
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:45,181
you're not,

2477
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,980
you're not mad at me when
I have a cheeseburger,

2478
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:47,431
you know,

2479
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:47,821
there's not,

2480
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:52,350
I don't get cries for an anger when I
put a steak on the grill and take a photo

2481
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:52,770
of it,

2482
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:55,770
which I do all the time because I like
to cook steaks like two o'clock in the

2483
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,720
morning like a boss.

2484
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,490
What happens if you didn't
find that dude that day?

2485
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,780
We have no idea.

2486
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,613
I got to keep looking.

2487
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:01,951
No,

2488
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,210
we ate this fridge,

2489
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,980
freeze dried foods.

2490
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,140
We ate these freeze dried meals.

2491
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,590
The like you opened them up and you pour
hot water on them and they had these

2492
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,370
jets,

2493
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:15,960
these flame jets that would boil water
and you turn the flame jets on and you

2494
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:20,080
put this water canister over and it'll
boil the water and the water starts

2495
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:21,120
boiling and you shut it off.

2496
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:24,460
And then you pour the boiling water into
the bag and you seal it and you let it

2497
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:26,350
sit for a few minutes and it's not bad.

2498
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:26,561
You know,

2499
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:27,300
they have like,

2500
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,490
like you're boil the water over.

2501
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,640
Cause he saw that shit on Amazon,

2502
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:33,400
like a huge carton of
just tons of those packs,

2503
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:34,600
the right stuff.

2504
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:34,751
You know,

2505
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:35,810
like if we go,

2506
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,073
we need that.

2507
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,620
You'd be amazed at like,

2508
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:40,240
you could actually survive off of it.

2509
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:40,960
It's not bad.

2510
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,160
It actually tastes pretty good.

2511
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,353
So you see,

2512
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,600
the only thing that was was
ruthless is the sleeping outside.

2513
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:47,380
It's just,

2514
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,300
that's really difficult to get used to.

2515
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:50,530
And the,

2516
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:50,721
uh,

2517
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:54,490
the physical activity of stocking the
animal and then the reality of the

2518
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:55,720
shooting of the animal,

2519
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,310
that that was intense because I wondered
how it was gonna feel about that.

2520
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,100
I wonder if I was going to feel
sad if I'm going to feel bad,

2521
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,870
but I didn't feel bad.

2522
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:05,381
Yeah.

2523
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:07,270
When I felt it felt very natural.

2524
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,021
And when you're eating it,

2525
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:09,070
when you're thinking about the animal,

2526
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:09,461
you're killed.

2527
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:09,731
It really,

2528
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:10,630
we're just enjoying a good,

2529
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,200
well,

2530
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,280
I was enjoying it.

2531
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,830
I was thinking about the process in which,

2532
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,580
uh,

2533
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:15,941
you know,

2534
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:16,571
it happened.

2535
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:17,980
I was thinking about it's life.

2536
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:18,450
You know,

2537
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:18,680
I,

2538
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,481
I felt,

2539
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:20,020
uh,

2540
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:24,070
I mean it sounds very cliche to say
you feel very connected with nature,

2541
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,090
but man,

2542
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,620
that is the perfect description.

2543
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:28,300
It's like being connected with nature,

2544
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,051
you know,

2545
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:29,351
and like,

2546
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:32,170
you don't have to eat nature
to be connected with it.

2547
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:33,341
I know,

2548
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:34,031
but guess what,

2549
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:34,670
folks,

2550
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,250
when we eat Broccoli,

2551
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:36,551
you're,

2552
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:37,540
you're eating nature.

2553
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:38,140
You're fuck,

2554
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:38,830
okay.

2555
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,760
When you eat celery,

2556
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:40,594
you're eating nature.

2557
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,141
You know,

2558
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:42,070
when you eat beets,

2559
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:44,170
you're eating a living part of nature.

2560
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:44,890
It's just can't,

2561
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:45,940
it can't defend itself.

2562
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:46,900
It doesn't scream,

2563
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:48,370
it doesn't try to run away.

2564
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,690
So you assume it's okay.

2565
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,610
It's not the same species as us.

2566
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:54,070
But we would be super excited
if we found that on Mars.

2567
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:54,521
Okay.

2568
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:56,890
If we found Kale on Mars and you know,

2569
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,540
and in some asshole
came around and ate it,

2570
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:01,691
fucking Mars,

2571
01:07:01,691 --> 01:07:01,931
Kale,

2572
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:02,764
you can't,

2573
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,960
this is life from another
planet and you ate it.

2574
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:05,830
It's Mars Fed.

2575
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,180
It gets so regular though.

2576
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,460
He,

2577
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,420
and it doesn't mean that I didn't
think that the animal was beautiful.

2578
01:07:10,421 --> 01:07:11,710
I thought the animals very beautiful.

2579
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:12,970
I'm amazed just to see them.

2580
01:07:12,971 --> 01:07:15,730
I enjoyed seeing all the
rams that we couldn't shoot.

2581
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,960
We couldn't get tagged to shoot them,

2582
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:17,920
but I enjoyed seeing them.

2583
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,690
But I think that ideally I would
like to eat nothing but game meat.

2584
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,910
I think that'd be the best for me,

2585
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:26,110
like health wise.

2586
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:30,580
And I think that it would be the most
honest way to be a mediator and the,

2587
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:31,720
so that's what I'm going to try to do.

2588
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:34,420
And we're going to go again in the
summer and we'd go hunting for Caribou.

2589
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,830
Carolyn's going to go again,

2590
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,701
eat those things.

2591
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:36,911
Yeah,

2592
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:37,744
they're huge.

2593
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,700
And so you're going to have
stuff shipped in from now on?

2594
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:40,151
Yeah.

2595
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:40,620
My,

2596
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,770
my meat is in,

2597
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,220
um,

2598
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,090
is in Montana.

2599
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:43,924
It's on its way to me.

2600
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,400
They freeze it and they send it.

2601
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:45,881
I don't know.

2602
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:46,440
I mean it.

2603
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,050
What's your like from like more often
I'm going to do this more often.

2604
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,531
Yeah.

2605
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:50,831
I'm going to do,

2606
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:52,420
I'm going to try to go
hunting a couple times a year.

2607
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,800
Can you just buy game meat?

2608
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,401
You could,

2609
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:55,234
you could do that too,

2610
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:55,601
but you,

2611
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:57,190
what you'd be buying is the animals,

2612
01:07:57,191 --> 01:08:00,700
but they'd be like in a farm situation
and you'd have to make sure that they

2613
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,540
were grass fed.

2614
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,480
You would want to make sure I don't
have a wild game that you can,

2615
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,340
you can buy.

2616
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:04,641
No,

2617
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:04,940
no,

2618
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,550
I don't think you're
allowed to sell wild game.

2619
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:06,971
Oh,

2620
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:07,341
real.

2621
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:07,511
Yeah.

2622
01:08:07,511 --> 01:08:08,321
I think you have to,

2623
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:09,580
it has to be domesticated.

2624
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,680
I think I could be wrong about that.

2625
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:13,540
It might be different
in each state as well.

2626
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,970
There's a very big,

2627
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:15,591
any difference.

2628
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,040
I know

2629
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,350
a fresh water fish,

2630
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:21,050
I think tastes better the
quicker you get it to the pan.

2631
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:21,710
Yeah,

2632
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:22,521
but I'm salt water,

2633
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:25,820
not as much of a problem is or
does it any freshness factor to it?

2634
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:26,150
Like,

2635
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:26,331
well,

2636
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:26,931
the Oregon's,

2637
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:27,380
yes.

2638
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,600
You should cook the Oregons
quickly as possible.

2639
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:32,420
The organs and delicious
like dear liver is fantastic.

2640
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:33,300
He's better right then.

2641
01:08:33,301 --> 01:08:34,370
Then a day later,

2642
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,501
yeah,

2643
01:08:34,501 --> 01:08:35,001
you don't want it,

2644
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:35,381
but the,

2645
01:08:35,381 --> 01:08:36,750
the meat actually is a,

2646
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:37,381
according to Steve.

2647
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:38,660
Grinnell is better the next day.

2648
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:41,210
It gives you the chance to relax and uh,

2649
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:41,421
you know,

2650
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:41,610
it's,

2651
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:42,443
it's a very,

2652
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:44,540
you muscular animal,

2653
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,990
so you have to prepare in a certain,

2654
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:47,200
yeah,

2655
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,140
it's very little fat.

2656
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,100
They're incredibly lean.

2657
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,360
So when you cook them,

2658
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:52,670
you have to make sure that
you don't over cook it.

2659
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,620
You Cook it really quickly and uh,

2660
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:59,360
either you have it very much on the rare
side you can really venison venison.

2661
01:08:59,420 --> 01:08:59,720
Yeah.

2662
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,280
Or You could slow cook it.

2663
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:01,941
That's the other way too,

2664
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:03,740
where it breaks it down
like a pork shoulder.

2665
01:09:03,741 --> 01:09:04,010
You know,

2666
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:04,461
they do that,

2667
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:05,300
they slow cook it.

2668
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:06,351
Um,

2669
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,700
so we'll wind up,

2670
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,563
um,

2671
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,310
I'll figure out,

2672
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,330
you know,

2673
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:11,780
how to,

2674
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,650
how to cook all of it.

2675
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,023
Well.

2676
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:14,211
Yeah,

2677
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:15,044
but I have like,

2678
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,660
that's probably like 60
or 70,000 pounds of meat.

2679
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,280
We rename you think all our meats.

2680
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,170
We don't do it with birds,

2681
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:22,500
but all our meats we renamed.

2682
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,380
You don't have to talk
about the animal that it is.

2683
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,440
Probably like venison and yeah.

2684
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,400
Yeah.

2685
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,370
Cow Becomes damn fork steer becomes beef.

2686
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:31,791
Yeah.

2687
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:32,090
It's a,

2688
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:32,923
it's weird.

2689
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,830
W A steer,

2690
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,880
you know we have too many of steer.

2691
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:35,211
What's that?

2692
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:35,311
Oh,

2693
01:09:35,311 --> 01:09:36,890
that's a cow that we cut his nuts off.

2694
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,053
No,

2695
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,380
he doesn't do it there.

2696
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,200
He was at bowl at one point in time,

2697
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:42,591
but we're like,

2698
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:42,771
yeah,

2699
01:09:42,771 --> 01:09:44,090
you're not going to need those dudes.

2700
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:44,320
You're,

2701
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,530
you're here for steak.

2702
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,810
I really need you that sinewy.

2703
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,290
Yeah,

2704
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,640
I guess you can't eat a bolt,

2705
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:50,563
you know?

2706
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,141
I don't know.

2707
01:09:51,141 --> 01:09:51,530
I mean,

2708
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:54,470
we don't want them to have their
balls because I think they get like

2709
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,790
rambunctious.

2710
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:56,290
Yeah.

2711
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:58,760
I don't think squeeze the ball's
been bull riding contests then.

2712
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,380
Yeah.

2713
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,310
I don't know about that.

2714
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,383
That's what I've heard.

2715
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,120
They asked me to go on
celebrity Rodeo once.

2716
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:05,511
I was like,

2717
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:06,344
bitch.

2718
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,170
Yeah.

2719
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:07,431
I was like,

2720
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:09,680
are you Outta your mind?

2721
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,120
And go into any more with a bowl.

2722
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,100
You crazy bull riding.

2723
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:14,870
It's celebrity bull riding and I was like,

2724
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:15,131
you are,

2725
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:16,010
you're out of your mind.

2726
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,050
I think Stephen Baldwin did it
in a couple of other people.

2727
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:18,550
I'm like,

2728
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,750
yeah,

2729
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,080
it's asking for your body
to be broken forever.

2730
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,280
Not even getting stomped on just
the throne from a bull dude.

2731
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:25,700
You know,

2732
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,680
nobody rides a bull successfully.

2733
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:30,380
It's just a matter of how long
before you get thrown off.

2734
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:31,191
So if you,

2735
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:31,820
you know,

2736
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:32,151
you can,

2737
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:33,080
that's what you have to deal with.

2738
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:33,591
It's the best thing.

2739
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:35,380
You write it out so it runs out of energy.

2740
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,310
Then you just write a so stupid on it.

2741
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,580
Riding a boast.

2742
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:39,440
So ridiculous.

2743
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:39,701
How,

2744
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:40,040
um,

2745
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:40,401
how,

2746
01:10:40,401 --> 01:10:41,840
what was the feeling like
after you're killing,

2747
01:10:41,841 --> 01:10:42,980
you're frying it up or whatever.

2748
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:43,480
Strange.

2749
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:43,640
No,

2750
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,210
but like the feeling of being able
to talk fully for the first time.

2751
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,411
Could you,

2752
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,510
could you talk then or were you still,

2753
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,170
we talked to on the campfire,

2754
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,390
we always talked around
the campfire at night.

2755
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:53,810
Will,

2756
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,121
you know,

2757
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:55,280
which just while we're walking around,

2758
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:56,390
we're trying to be pretty quiet.

2759
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:59,330
Was that relieving every night to be
able to like actually use your voice?

2760
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,493
No,

2761
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:01,730
we really able to talk.

2762
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:01,960
Yeah,

2763
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,900
there was a little bit of that.

2764
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:03,011
Yeah.

2765
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:04,660
It was nice to go at camp and fuck around.

2766
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,900
The guys were really nice guys.

2767
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,070
This Guy Steve Rinella,

2768
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,160
he's got a great group of dudes
that he's got working for him.

2769
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:10,730
He really,

2770
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:14,100
really put together an awesome crew and
they have to be bad motherfuckers cause

2771
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,630

2772
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,790
sleeping in tents and for them,

2773
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:18,061
you know,

2774
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:19,620
this is their job for me,

2775
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:19,920
you know,

2776
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,840
it was like some crazy vacation and an
opportunity to go hunting for the first

2777
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:27,720
time and you know and
do this dude's TV show.

2778
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,033
Hey Buddy.

2779
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,240
But for um,

camera man and the director,

2781
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:37,410

part of their life.

2782
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,730
That's what they do every day.

2783
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,640
I mean that's a fucking tough job man.

2784
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:43,560
You camping outside most of the year,

2785
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:44,670

2791
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:55,710
This is a show that's already on?

2792
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:56,071
Yeah,

2793
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:57,000
it's been awhile.

2794
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:58,530
It's called meat eater.

2795
01:11:58,830 --> 01:11:59,760
Oh yeah.

2796
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,840
The dude had a show on the travel channel
called the wild within and it was a

2797
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:04,590
good show.

2798
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,860
It was like a really great choice show.

2799
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,860
What's it for hunting you sort of,

2800
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:08,071
yeah.

2801
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:11,220
I mean like one of the things he did
was he hunted Moose the same way,

2802
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:11,971
Louis or a,

2803
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:12,450
um,

2804
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,400
a buffalo the same way
Lewis and Clark did.

2805
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,410
He shot a bison with a musket,

2806
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,890
but all we're going old school must get
killed it and then turned it into a boat

2807
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,680
the same way they would back then where
they would make like a boat out of these

2808
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:23,270
things and,

2809
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,320
and take it into I boats.

2810
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:25,651
Yeah,

2811
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:26,610
he did that on the show.

2812
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:28,040
It was pretty interesting fucking show.

2813
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:29,251
I really enjoyed it.

2814
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:32,430
He's like a real wild west historian.

2815
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,810
Like he told us some crazy fucking stories
about different things at the Indians

2816
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:37,920
had done to the white man.

2817
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:39,360
The white man had done to the Indians.

2818
01:12:39,361 --> 01:12:40,800
And one dude,

2819
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:41,610
um,

2820
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:42,030
his,

2821
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:42,330
uh,

2822
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:42,750
he,

2823
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,201
he,

2824
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:43,440
uh,

2825
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,071
he gave up,

2826
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:45,510
but his friend tried to resist,

2827
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,740
so they took his friend,

2828
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:49,110
they butchered him in front
of them and cut them open.

2829
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,100
Yeah.

2830
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,640
They cut his dick off and they rubbed it
all over his friend cut his lungs off,

2831
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:54,474
rubbed all his friends,

2832
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,261
and then they told them,

2833
01:12:55,261 --> 01:12:57,210
we're going to give you a headstart and
then we're going to come and kill you.

2834
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,070
And so this guy out random,

2835
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:02,310
and he outran them and jumped into
the river and hid in a beaver den.

2836
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,870
They have beaver dens everywhere.

2837
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,010
And the beaver dens.

2838
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:08,940
What it is essentially is it's like
the water's running there and this guy

2839
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,740
climbed under the water and into a hole
that the beavers had dug into the side

2840
01:13:13,741 --> 01:13:15,910
of the river bank so they can eat,

2841
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,003
breathe in there.

2842
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,820
So he laid in there and
waited until the Indians left.

2843
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:25,770
And then he walked a hundred miles down
to the nearest town and barefoot and

2844
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:26,490
naked.

2845
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:27,180
And uh,

2846
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:31,560
he ate a rattlesnake and
he ate a piece of just raw.

2847
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,190
Yep.

2848
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,250
And a piece of buffalo
that he found as he was,

2849
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,710
uh Oh wait,

2850
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:41,490
so the Indians killed his friend in front
of this group just to be more like me

2851
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:42,181
up just to,

2852
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:43,014
you know,

2853
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:43,980
cause the guy resisted,

2854
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,170
who was this the guy that kills two guys?

2855
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:46,950
Yeah.

2856
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:50,790
There was all these stories about what
happened when the Indians ran into each

2857
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:51,653
other.

2858
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,130
You know what's also fascinating,

2859
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:54,310
what he told me it was him,

2860
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:57,820
how ruthless the Indians were to
each other or the native Americans,

2861
01:13:57,821 --> 01:13:58,950
you should say each other.

2862
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,620
Like they were fucking checking
each other left and right.

2863
01:14:01,621 --> 01:14:02,280
In fact,

2864
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,450
there was some that were near the,

2865
01:14:03,451 --> 01:14:06,450
in the Great Lakes area that
we're practicing cannibalism of.

2866
01:14:06,451 --> 01:14:08,640
Other tribes are on a regular basis.

2867
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,140
They were eating them for food.

2868
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,470
You know that like,

2869
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:12,280
I mean it was like,

2870
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,360
imagine how harsh it must've been around
the great lakes like in the winter,

2871
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,190
like how brutal that shit is.

2872
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:19,200
And I,

2873
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,440
I guess some of the natives that
were were hearing each other,

2874
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:26,530
we're ruthless and they actually
want up cannibalizing people.

2875
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:27,580
Yeah.

2876
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,660
Eating people that were,

2877
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:29,170
you know,

2878
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,640
travelers for the cowboys.

2879
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:31,474
Do Bat.

2880
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:31,961
Oh really?

2881
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:33,310
Just like traveling by people.

2882
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:33,521
Yeah,

2883
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:33,791
man,

2884
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,624
you fuck up.

2885
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:36,520
You ride your fucking wagon.

2886
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:37,780
Train to the wrong town.

2887
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:39,940
This town is a,

2888
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,090
with these guys at that eat people
cause that liquor we have for Compton.

2889
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:44,250
No.

2890
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,760
[inaudible] we're blue in
certain areas or by accident.

2891
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,660
It's way nicer now than it was
in the American Indian days.

2892
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,210
Can you imagine how ruthless,

2893
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:52,630
I mean,

2894
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,871
look,

2895
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:54,550
there's one thing to
run it a gang warfare,

2896
01:14:54,551 --> 01:14:57,100
but I mean bands of people
that want to eat you.

2897
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:57,860
He gets like,

2898
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,730
I saw one saw me from 400
miles away at 400 yards away.

2899
01:15:00,731 --> 01:15:02,590
I got to kill them or we're all dead.

2900
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,483
Yeah.

2901
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,760
Custer's last stand he
was describing like,

2902
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:06,081
he's like,

2903
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:09,590
he's like a real historian Steven Rinella
guy and he's just like talking about

2904
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:13,300
all the things that happened
during custards last days.

2905
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,170
One of the things they did was they
mutilated all the bodies the Indians did

2906
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,210
after they killed customers.

2907
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,850
Men so that they would have a shitty
afterlife like to cut his dick off so we

2908
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,050
can't use in the afterlife,

2909
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,240
cut his legs apart.

2910
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,030
He can't use his legs
at that point anymore.

2911
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,503
Arms out,

2912
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,070
punctured his ears,

2913
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,920
stabbed his ears so he could,

2914
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:32,230
uh,

2915
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:35,440
he could listen to warnings better
in the afterlife and the wow.

2916
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:36,663
Yeah.

2917
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:39,190
Cause they warned him that this
was going to happen to him.

2918
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:40,870
Yeah,

2919
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,651
it's crazy.

2920
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:42,550
And what's really crazy,

2921
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:46,390
there was a guy named
Gaul and a big giant,

2922
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:50,230
big giant Indian dude that was involved
in the massacre of Custer's last stand.

2923
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,190
And he was involved in killing customers,

2924
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:52,600
men.

2925
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,010
And after it was over,

2926
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:59,100
he went on those wild bill's wild west
tours where they would show up in towns

2927
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:01,241
and they would say,

2928
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:02,080
this is gall.

2929
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:03,520
He's responsible for killing,

2930
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:03,891
you know,

2931
01:16:03,891 --> 01:16:05,080
over 500 men.

2932
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:07,360
And the guy would like be standing
there like sneering at people.

2933
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,380
And he really was,

2934
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:12,640
he really was the guy that killed
custard in his man and very was you could

2935
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:13,181
watch him.

2936
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:13,361
I mean,

2937
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:16,000
he was free to just be
walking around and he,

2938
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:16,331
you know,

2939
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:20,170
he was a part of a war and when the war
was over and he hung out with wild bill

2940
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:22,180
and they took him around,

2941
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:22,361
I mean,

2942
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:23,770
could you imagine that
I could live in you?

2943
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:28,330
Imagine if they did that with
like EDI mean or some water load.

2944
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:28,751
Yeah.

2945
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:28,901
Yeah.

2946
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:30,700
Some warlord was on some,

2947
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:31,120
uh,

2948
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,030
some show guys relax.

2949
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,790
I kill that.

2950
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,700
That couple hundred thousand people.

2951
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:40,150
Saddam Hussein was one
day on one of these,

2952
01:16:40,151 --> 01:16:40,620
uh,

2953
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,170
these,

2954
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,660
it would definitely like celebrity
apprentice and shit like that.

2955
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,340
Yeah.

2956
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:44,650
Wow.

2957
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:47,050
Imagine he would do
those celebrity survivor.

2958
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:48,010
That's the future.

2959
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,521
That's when the,

2960
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,410
our civilization really
goes into the shitter.

2961
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:50,760
Yeah.

2962
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,593
Wait a minute.

2963
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,091
Why?

2964
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:52,511
Instead of,

2965
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:53,171
let's seriously,

2966
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:54,130
instead of killing tree,

2967
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:55,270
I know this is like running man shit,

2968
01:16:55,271 --> 01:16:57,970
but instead of killing Charles
Taylor and fucking sad,

2969
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:58,900
almost saying all these people,

2970
01:16:58,901 --> 01:17:02,200
why not have like a let him
fucking running man and out,

2971
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,030
uh,

2972
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,780
why just feel so it's entertaining.

2973
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,340
Yeah.

2974
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,173
Hmm.

2975
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,330
Well that's what we cash off.

2976
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,090
That's when we get dangerously immoral

2977
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,310
and they're like,

2978
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:16,810
this guy littered and
they get him in there.

2979
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,190
What if we can hunt abortion?

2980
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:22,060
So somehow with like how make it give
them a fighting chance if you get shrunk

2981
01:17:22,061 --> 01:17:22,451
down.

2982
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:23,420
So you're in there with,

2983
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:26,380
with the woman inner space abortions.

2984
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,393
God,

2985
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:31,060
could you imagine talking
to you while you in there?

2986
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:31,953
Don't do that.

2987
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,840
It's like you just have a wonderful line.

2988
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:36,674
Father

2989
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,180
is already creeped out.

2990
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,140
Hey,

2991
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:41,711
did you have it?

2992
01:17:41,711 --> 01:17:42,370
Did you,

2993
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:44,710
when you walked up to kill it till
after you were like punctured it,

2994
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,060
did you have any thought of like,

2995
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,410
I should say a snappy
like Supergirl lives?

2996
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,010
I'd like hell,

2997
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,320
you're going upside down and you're like,

2998
01:17:50,321 --> 01:17:50,531
no,

2999
01:17:50,531 --> 01:17:51,131
it's so,

3000
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:51,341
it's,

3001
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:52,990
so a lot of that before

3002
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,370
moment is so,

3003
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:55,680
uh,

3004
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,390
like it's so sober.

3005
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:00,610
You know the one moment you just shot
an animal for the first time and he

3006
01:18:00,611 --> 01:18:04,650
dropped it and seen it flop onto its back
with its legs up in the air and it was

3007
01:18:04,651 --> 01:18:05,311
like trying to get up,

3008
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,144
but he couldn't get up.

3009
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,193
It was done.

3010
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,160
You didn't think to say,

3011
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,140
I guess the buck stops here.

3012
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:16,870
What does the dude's name dude from Miami?

3013
01:18:16,871 --> 01:18:17,704
CSI.

3014
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:18,880
What's that sound?

3015
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,140
Oh God.

3016
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,910
I guess the buck stops here.

3017
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:25,870
You son of a bitch.

3018
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,150
How did

3019
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:30,961
it wasn't,

3020
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:32,010
it wasn't funny at all.

3021
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,780
Why did you decide who gets the shot?

3022
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:34,740
It was me.

3023
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:35,430
I was,

3024
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:36,310
I had,

3025
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:36,780
uh,

3026
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:41,160
the show I was with about and
Brian Cowen was off with a,

3027
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:41,731
another,

3028
01:18:41,731 --> 01:18:41,910
uh,

3029
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,110
professional hunting guide.

3030
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:46,920
And Brian also was getting filmed with a
different camera because you can't have

3031
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:49,020
that many people out hunting.

3032
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,090
Deciding which animal did his go well,

3033
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,261
yeah,

3034
01:18:51,261 --> 01:18:51,481
yeah.

3035
01:18:51,481 --> 01:18:51,850
He got,

3036
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,430
he shot an animal to meet up at night.

3037
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:54,060
Yeah.

3038
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:54,241
Yeah.

3039
01:18:54,241 --> 01:18:55,074
We made up at night.

3040
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,450
You knew of the a plots?

3041
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,030
Yeah,

3042
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,930
we met up what?

3043
01:18:57,931 --> 01:19:01,110
We had a camping spot and then we would
go hiking and they would come back to

3044
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,090
the camp spot and then
we would row together.

3045
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:06,360
So we would talk shit while we're rowing
down the river together and make jokes.

3046
01:19:06,361 --> 01:19:10,770
Like Brian Callan is one of the perfect
human vans to go on any long trip like

3047
01:19:10,771 --> 01:19:11,310
that.

3048
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:14,910
Cause he's so fucking
hilarious and he's never off.

3049
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:15,811
He's never off.

3050
01:19:15,811 --> 01:19:17,010
He's on the whole time.

3051
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:21,840
And it was a series of gay jokes
that never ended or evolve,

3052
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:22,230
but they,

3053
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:22,460
they,

3054
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,560
they got more and more
hilarious until the end of it.

3055
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:26,400
It was sick.

3056
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:26,910
While we're,

3057
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,560
I mean this sounds like so disrespectful,

3058
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:33,420
but while we're like butchering
the deer in between it Kaolin

3059
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,210
Oh,

3060
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:36,780
does this thing where he starts,

3061
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:41,850
stands over the ravine and starts
masturbating into the ravine.

3062
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:42,570
Just,

3063
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:43,700
just comes up with it.

3064
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:45,420
They call me the ravine comer.

3065
01:19:45,421 --> 01:19:46,200
Yeah.

3066
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:46,741
That's what I do.

3067
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:47,640
I find a ravine all,

3068
01:19:47,641 --> 01:19:48,510
I can't help calming.

3069
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,360
I'm coming into the world doing this.

3070
01:19:51,361 --> 01:19:51,781
It was just,

3071
01:19:51,781 --> 01:19:52,890
it was so ridiculous.

3072
01:19:52,891 --> 01:19:54,250
He doesn't have to be
able to use that down.

3073
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,610
We're going to put it on the Internet.

3074
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,800
We're going to put it on the Internet
because it was so ridiculous.

3075
01:19:58,801 --> 01:19:59,640
It has to go on the Internet.

3076
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,450
He had his tongue out and he was like
making this fucking like really aggressive

3077
01:20:03,451 --> 01:20:04,290
face and just shoot

3078
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,260
pretending to shoot loads over the ravine.

3079
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:07,094
It was so,

3080
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,300
it was so silly and so hilarious.

3081
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:09,780
You,

3082
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,900
but it was also in stark contrast
to what we're doing at the time,

3083
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:14,460
which was butchering this animal.

3084
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:15,480
You know?

3085
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,410
When I gutted it,

3086
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:16,800
that was,

3087
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,980
that was the really intense part because
it was just a few moments after I shot

3088
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:23,640
it and then all of a sudden I'm cutting
it open and as I'm cutting it open steam

3089
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:24,331
is coming out.

3090
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:25,080
It's like a Tauntaun.

3091
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:25,440
Yes.

3092
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:25,710
It's,

3093
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,700
well not quite so bad,

3094
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:27,630
but very close and it's,

3095
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,980
it's really,

3096
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:29,880
really warm.

3097
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:30,121
They,

3098
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:31,680
their bodies are warmer than ours.

3099
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:34,140
Their bodies like 104
degrees or something like,

3100
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,251
oh yeah,

3101
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:36,420
man will not warm him up.

3102
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:40,440
I had a pull the organs out that
they all have you slide to fall out.

3103
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:40,711
Yeah.

3104
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,101
You have to,

3105
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:42,450
you have to slice it a certain way.

3106
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:46,800
You have to slice around the body and
like pull it all the way up to the neck

3107
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:49,770
and then you have to cut through
the rib cage with a hatchet.

3108
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:50,910
Yeah.

3109
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:51,990
It's serious shit,

3110
01:20:51,991 --> 01:20:52,171
man.

3111
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:52,891
Is that your first time?

3112
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:56,760
Like you never did any kind of like
butcher snow knows it's fucking serious

3113
01:20:56,761 --> 01:20:57,180
shit.

3114
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:57,391
Like,

3115
01:20:57,391 --> 01:21:01,290
you know when you're eating a piece of
meat from an animal that you saw bouncing

3116
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:06,291
around and then you put a bullet into
him and then you go and open them up and

3117
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:10,410
take his organs out and then section his
body off and then cook it and eat it.

3118
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:14,460
Like there is no confusion as to where
that meat came from and there's a

3119
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:17,670
complete direct attachment I'd say.

3120
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:19,010
Then it becomes sorry,

3121
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:22,050
but then it becomes sort
of a philosophical debate.

3122
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:23,370
Like is that what you want to do?

3123
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:28,140
Do you want to just kill nature natural
animals and eat them or do you want to

3124
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:33,141
just remain to be a part of this sort of
strange disconnect system where we are

3125
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:38,940
all getting meat and not even thinking
for a second that that used to be an

3126
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:39,270
animal.

3127
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:43,080
We have like no intellectual connection
with the idea that that was a lot of it

3128
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:43,530
came from,

3129
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:43,801
yeah,

3130
01:21:43,801 --> 01:21:44,580
we just eat it.

3131
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:44,821
You know,

3132
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:46,770
and especially we eat this
really unhealthy stuff.

3133
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,470
I'm not even close.

3134
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:50,693
It doesn't even make sense.

3135
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,440
It's,

3136
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,100
it's weird to fucking weird,

3137
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:53,491
you know,

3138
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:54,324
I'm not,

3139
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,090
it's a neon outside
that while you were all,

3140
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:57,720
you're like eating,

3141
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,800
this is like going through your mind.

3142
01:21:59,160 --> 01:21:59,521
No,

3143
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:00,100
because while we can,

3144
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:00,730
I would just be like,

3145
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:01,830
this is delicious.

3146
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:02,641
Why was he getting it?

3147
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:03,900
I was thinking this delicious,

3148
01:22:03,901 --> 01:22:04,681
but it was also thinking,

3149
01:22:04,681 --> 01:22:04,861
man,

3150
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:05,430
this is like,

3151
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:07,320
this is a serious thing
that just happened,

3152
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:07,890
you know?

3153
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,900
And I got to treat this
serious thing with,

3154
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:10,440
uh,

3155
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,370
with respect.

3156
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:14,820
And someone said on my message board
wants that hunting was psychedelic,

3157
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:16,230
that he felt hunting with psychedelic.

3158
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:17,060
And I was like,

3159
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,220
well,

3160
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,060
that's ridiculous.

3161
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,893
It sounds like,

3162
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:19,823
it sounds like,

3163
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,750
it sounds like you don't
know what psychedelic means,

3164
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,021
you know?

3165
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:22,920
That's what I was thinking.

3166
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,690
Like how could that be psychedelic?

3167
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,501
That's like the opposite.

3168
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:25,880
It's like adult,

3169
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,930
like you're like killing
an animal and you're,

3170
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:29,040
you're taking a life.

3171
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,050
But then in doing it,

3172
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,360
I think I didn't know what he meant or,

3173
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,171
or what,

3174
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:35,190
what it could mean.

3175
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:39,530
What psychedelic about it is that you,

3176
01:22:39,531 --> 01:22:44,531
you are in a totally different world
when you're there and you're in nature.

3177
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,031
Okay.

3178
01:22:45,031 --> 01:22:46,890
And there's no cell
phone signal and shows,

3179
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:47,641
no radio,

3180
01:22:47,641 --> 01:22:48,510
there's no media.

3181
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:53,550
Nothing is is in in front of you except
nature and you're walking around in it

3182
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:57,040
all day looking for an animal and then
when you finally lock on to that and

3183
01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:00,320
you're doing this for days and days and
he finally lock on to that animal and

3184
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:04,470
then you take that animal's life and
you see it and you become a part of this

3185
01:23:04,471 --> 01:23:04,870
experience,

3186
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:05,830
then eat this thing.

3187
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,910
You realize like Whoa,

3188
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:09,160
all of a sudden like I am in the wild.

3189
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,830
Like I am literally immersed in the wild.

3190
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,260
I have just slept in the wild aid,

3191
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:15,910
an animal that I shot in the wild,

3192
01:23:15,911 --> 01:23:17,080
killed it in the wild,

3193
01:23:17,081 --> 01:23:19,390
cooked it in the wild on some trees.

3194
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:23,110
We chop some wood and we made a
campfire and cooked it over at Campfire.

3195
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:28,060
I mean it is as wildlife
immersive as is possible.

3196
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,650
And when that happens,

3197
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:30,040
man,

3198
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,690
it's a real paradigm shifting moment and
much like in a psychedelic experience

3199
01:23:34,691 --> 01:23:35,321
after it's over,

3200
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:35,621
you go,

3201
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:35,951
wow,

3202
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:40,951
I am going to take as much of that I can
take with me and that's going to make

3203
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,100
me a better person.

3204
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:43,690
That's gonna make me a more honest person.

3205
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:44,770
That's gonna I,

3206
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,930
this is certainly a powerful experience.

3207
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:47,711
I'm going to grow from it.

3208
01:23:47,711 --> 01:23:50,530
I think about that almost every
time I trip or have tripped.

3209
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,690
And that's exactly how I felt about this.

3210
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:53,800
And in that way,

3211
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,000
it's sort of psychedelic.

3212
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:56,500
Did you trip it all while you were there?

3213
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,423
Like a mustache?

3214
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,403
No.

3215
01:23:58,710 --> 01:23:59,543
Freaked out.

3216
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,370
No,

3217
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:00,701
no.

3218
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:01,690
I wouldn't have freaked out,

3219
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:02,200
but that's,

3220
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,033
there's no,

3221
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,480
there was no time to fuck around.

3222
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:04,931
I mean,

3223
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:05,420
this was a,

3224
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:05,711
it was,

3225
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:06,250
uh,

3226
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,620
it was a difficult endeavor.

3227
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,820
The way he does it.

3228
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:10,450
It's,

3229
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:13,840
you don't have time to like go do
mushrooms and lie around the grass for six

3230
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:14,674
hours.

3231
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,460
You're up wandering through
the hills of the rifle.

3232
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:22,240
And if I had cotton all the way there
with them and then decided to just do

3233
01:24:22,241 --> 01:24:22,781
mushrooms,

3234
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:27,781
they'll be like so disrespectful to
show and so disrespectful to what he's

3235
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:30,760
trying to do because when he's
trying to do is with his show,

3236
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:35,761
he's trying to do these really difficult
and challenging hunts and he took me

3237
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:38,260
along to do it exactly the way he does it,

3238
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:38,711
you know?

3239
01:24:38,711 --> 01:24:40,250
So I had to do it the way he does.

3240
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,410
Picture this picture of this.

3241
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,170
You've got that on day three.

3242
01:24:43,171 --> 01:24:44,740
I don't have a feeling it's
going to be a gang question.

3243
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,750
You and Karen,

3244
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:50,010
you're on Brokeback mountain.

3245
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,833
Beautiful.

3246
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,530
Uh,

3247
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:52,741
okay.

3248
01:24:52,741 --> 01:24:53,970
You get this thing on day three,

3249
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,980
you're back to your last campsite.

3250
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:57,050
You still have a day and a half left,

3251
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:57,530
right?

3252
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:57,751
You're like,

3253
01:24:57,751 --> 01:24:57,991
okay,

3254
01:24:57,991 --> 01:24:58,411
we did it.

3255
01:24:58,411 --> 01:24:58,950
That's amazing.

3256
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:02,100
Come and come to terms with that stuff
and you're undoing your sleeping bag and

3257
01:25:02,101 --> 01:25:02,670
stuff.

3258
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:02,881
You're like,

3259
01:25:02,881 --> 01:25:02,981
yeah,

3260
01:25:02,981 --> 01:25:04,200
actually where my code is actually cold.

3261
01:25:04,201 --> 01:25:05,130
And you reached in your pocket like,

3262
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,110
Oh fuck hey guys,

3263
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:08,611
I forgot these written here.

3264
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:09,750
I just found these mushrooms,

3265
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,153
which do him then.

3266
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:11,920
MMM.

3267
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,530
MMM.

3268
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:13,370
That's interesting.

3269
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,590
Everybody could do all the problem is,

3270
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,030
um,

3271
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:19,850
I would want to not be incapacitated
in case something went wrong.

3272
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:22,850
He never know what could go
wrong when you're camping,

3273
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:26,030
you know the idea that you're just going
to sit there and you'd do the mushrooms

3274
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:27,320
for five hours and you'll be fine.

3275
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:29,180
That sounds good in theory.

3276
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:33,370
However you need eight hours sleep and
you really got to make sure you get that

3277
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:34,790
cause you got a hard day ahead of you.

3278
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,960
And second of all,

3279
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,650
there's no five hour breaks there
between the light being off,

3280
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,780
eating your food and then
sleeping for eight hours,

3281
01:25:41,781 --> 01:25:43,340
then getting up while it's still dark out,

3282
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:44,210
there's really not,

3283
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:45,350
there's no time to do it.

3284
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:49,100
So I wouldn't have done it because
there was still work to be done.

3285
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:52,370
I still had to go back up there and get
the deer itself and cut it apart and

3286
01:25:52,371 --> 01:25:53,780
that stuff takes hours.

3287
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:54,973
It wasn't easy,

3288
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:56,090
you know.

3289
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:56,960
Oh you went back.

3290
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:57,381
Yeah.

3291
01:25:57,381 --> 01:26:01,160
So there was no time to do mushrooms
and then the next morning Brian got his.

3292
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:01,761
So,

3293
01:26:01,761 --> 01:26:02,060
uh,

3294
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:06,260
he helped me go and get my dear and cut
it up and that's when he was jerking off

3295
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:06,890
into the sea.

3296
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:09,050
He call himself the ravine calmer.

3297
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:10,843
But um,

3298
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,050
yeah,

3299
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:12,441
it was,

3300
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:16,370
the whole experience was
a very surreal from the,

3301
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,820
from pulling the trigger to watch
the animal fall into its back.

3302
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:22,310
It's very surreal to,

3303
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:22,670
you know,

3304
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:23,660
ending its life,

3305
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:25,071
you know,

3306
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:27,140
to cutting it open and to eating it.

3307
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,270
It's pretty fucking intense man.

3308
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,870
And I think that's the most
honest way to get food.

3309
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,710
I really do.

3310
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:35,350
I think that's the most
honest way to get meat.

3311
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:35,820
I'm,

3312
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:36,140
I'm not,

3313
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:36,920
I can't say that.

3314
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:40,280
I mean I'm not in a position where
I could eat all my meat like that,

3315
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,230
but I think that's the right way to do it.

3316
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,340
I think if I didn't have this kind
of traveling standup comedy schedule,

3317
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:50,150
if I was able to live in one
place for long periods of time,

3318
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:50,840
I would do that.

3319
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,250
That would get all my meat from game.

3320
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,620
I think if you want to choose to eat meat,

3321
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:56,060
that's the most honest way to do it.

3322
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:59,240
Not saying there's anything
wrong with having a steak border.

3323
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:01,370
Farmers come to like the big city.

3324
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:02,710
I'd be like,

3325
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:02,990
dude,

3326
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:05,630
you can just find me at the
supermarket you don't like.

3327
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:06,920
It's just so much better.

3328
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,750
Why are we fooling ourselves?

3329
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,250
Are you this and this?

3330
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:12,050
It's the most honest way to get your meat.

3331
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:14,360
I think there's something about farming,

3332
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:18,250
much like something about
hunter hunter on it.

3333
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,360
I think there's something primal about it.

3334
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:23,450
I do like picking something off of a
tree or Bush and eating it right there.

3335
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,000
You know what I like growing it,

3336
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,270
growing things lately,

3337
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:26,960
man,

3338
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,070
there's something cool that,

3339
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,170
you know we went to Underwood farms,

3340
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:33,140
they have this like a big farm where
you can pick out your own food.

3341
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:36,100
He'd go and pick out your
own pumpkin's for Halloween.

3342
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:38,390
You could pick out like all kinds of
different things that they grow there and

3343
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:39,680
then you bring it back and you pay for it.

3344
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:40,530
And I,

3345
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:42,920
I looked at him like how
difficult would this be to do?

3346
01:27:42,921 --> 01:27:46,550
Because it seems like a really smart
thing to do to have like a bunch of food

3347
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:47,660
growing in our yard.

3348
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:51,860
So I have a place like what if we had
like death squad farms where we all,

3349
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,110
we all grew our,

3350
01:27:53,111 --> 01:27:56,570
our our food like hired
someone to run a farm,

3351
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:57,530
buy a piece of land,

3352
01:27:57,531 --> 01:28:01,490
set up an irrigation system and that way
we know where all our Kale comes from.

3353
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:02,810
Our strawberries come from.

3354
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,460
That seems like that would be a toggle
rhubarb's obviously step one on the way

3355
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:08,990
to the cult compound slash.

3356
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:09,824
Farm.

3357
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:13,370
But we start with a farm because
nobody can argue with the farm.

3358
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,590
If you start with a cult then
all of a sudden they're like,

3359
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:16,071
hey man,

3360
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:16,904
you guys just can't,

3361
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:17,721
can't go.

3362
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:18,680
I'll call to on us.

3363
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:19,791
But you know,

3364
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,560
if you started off with a
farm and like listen man,

3365
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:22,910
I'm just going to make it tomatoes.

3366
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:26,450
How long and how many years
before somebody is like,

3367
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,570
so take up arms pretty quickly.

3368
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:30,493
I think right away.

3369
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,730
As soon as you start killing deer,

3370
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,740
then we need guns to kill deer.

3371
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,313
You know,

3372
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,860
that would be this shit.

3373
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,990
If you could grow your own food and live
off of wild game and vegetables that

3374
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:44,930
you grow in that as a very
close to nature way to live.

3375
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,670
The argument against killing animals
obviously is they're beautiful and you

3376
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:49,821
know,

3377
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:51,560
why would you do that and this and that,

3378
01:28:51,561 --> 01:28:53,170
but the bottom line is you,

3379
01:28:53,171 --> 01:28:56,840
you need to maintain populations
because if humans don't maintain the

3380
01:28:56,841 --> 01:28:57,621
population,

3381
01:28:57,621 --> 01:29:01,770
then we have to give up our spot as the
number one Predator and bring somebody

3382
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:06,771
else in to Duke decided we would rather
kill a deer than have to worry about

3383
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:11,520
heading one with our cars and worry about
all the different predators that will

3384
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:16,080
grow in size and number if you are not
killing those deals because then they

3385
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:17,250
have more food.

3386
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:19,020
So it goes on from there.

3387
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:19,201
Yeah,

3388
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:20,070
that's well look,

3389
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:24,990
a lot of folks don't realize that wolves
were a real problem in this world at

3390
01:29:24,991 --> 01:29:25,824
one point in time.

3391
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,140
It seems so strange to say,

3392
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:31,830
but like big bad wolf and Little
Red Riding Hood and all that Shit,

3393
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:36,360
what all those stories come from is
at one point time wolves keys to kill

3394
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:36,870
people.

3395
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:39,000
It was normal in France.

3396
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:39,631
Yeah.

3397
01:29:39,631 --> 01:29:42,510
I gotta I gotta pull this up because I
saw this and I just want to make sure

3398
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:45,930
that I quote this correctly
because it's curry easy.

3399
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:46,680
What?

3400
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,850
The Wolf Crop?

3401
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:48,550
Barely pig.

3402
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,781
Yeah.

3403
01:29:48,781 --> 01:29:53,160
Wolves killed like 40 people and
then in the 14 hundreds in France.

3404
01:29:53,161 --> 01:29:56,430
In Paris for 40 fucking people.

3405
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:56,671
Yeah.

3406
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:57,950
The wolves of Paris.

3407
01:29:57,951 --> 01:29:59,610
He's such a horrible way to die,

3408
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,330
dude.

3409
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:01,530
You can't wolf

3410
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:08,300
the wolves of Paris like walking dead in
1450 the animals entered into the city

3411
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:11,430
during the winter through
breaches in the walls.

3412
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,690
They put walls up the
kitchen to kick him out.

3413
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,380
Wait how,

3414
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:19,380
what year a wolf nit 1450 a wolf name
core Todd or bobtail was the leader of the

3415
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:24,060
pack and reports of the animal being
reddish in color may be indicative of a

3416
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:25,260
Liberian wolf,

3417
01:30:25,261 --> 01:30:29,240
perhaps having migrated
from the Pi Rennie's.

3418
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:30,000
Hmm.

3419
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Eventually the wolves were killed when
the precautions furious at the desk lured

3420
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:39,540
core Todd and his pack into this heart
of the city and they had the prescience

3421
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:44,541
stoned and speared to death the wolves
in front of the Notre Dame Cathedral.

3422
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:46,343
Wow.

3423
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,660
They speared them to death
in front of the cathedral,

3424
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:49,950
like a cornered the wolves,

3425
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,500
like people were literally
fighting for their lives against.

3426
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,750
Why do you know how
horrifying that must've been?

3427
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:55,710
You know,

3428
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:57,300
that's where the w the Werewolf,

3429
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:58,031
the,

3430
01:30:58,031 --> 01:30:59,880
the myth of werewolves come from real.

3431
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:03,480
Wolf's comes from real world walls
and walls being smart as shit.

3432
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,620
They're so smart.

3433
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:05,820
They seem like they're people.

3434
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:06,900
They hunt in packs.

3435
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,730
They have the Alphas and the Betas.

3436
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:10,110
If they have a system,

3437
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:12,630
power holes when solar system,

3438
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:15,000
what's that naming this
market below houses down.

3439
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:15,480
Oh,

3440
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,313
the old days.

3441
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:19,100
The old days before they
started smoking and he's,

3442
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:20,160
they got him to cool,

3443
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:20,550
cool.

3444
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:24,780
Menthols and they just fucking ruined
their huff and puff it on the old ladies

3445
01:31:24,781 --> 01:31:25,411
clothing too.

3446
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:27,190
And Try to fool a little girls.

3447
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:27,451
Yeah.

3448
01:31:27,451 --> 01:31:28,950
They can talk in English back in the day.

3449
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,013
Yeah.

3450
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,543
Um,

3451
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,140
so,

3452
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:34,800
so that's what always
scares me about camping.

3453
01:31:34,801 --> 01:31:37,950
It's like what if one of those
things comes up in my tent?

3454
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:38,281
Well,

3455
01:31:38,281 --> 01:31:40,140
it's a problem when you're
not armed and it's a problem.

3456
01:31:40,141 --> 01:31:41,340
There's not that many of you,

3457
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:41,881
you know,

3458
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:42,121
when,

3459
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:43,110
when we were with,

3460
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:43,500
um,

3461
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,490
the media to crew,

3462
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,740
it was a one,

3463
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:47,550
two,

3464
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:48,301
three,

3465
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:48,631
four,

3466
01:31:48,631 --> 01:31:49,351
five,

3467
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:49,921
six,

3468
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:50,910
seven.

3469
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:52,920
It was like all together there was,

3470
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:54,450
I believe there was nine of us,

3471
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:56,640
so there was quite a few.

3472
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:59,680
If Pete may have those big wolf
just in the middle of the night,

3473
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:01,980
just start to be a problem.

3474
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:04,510
Like how long until the first person
that wakes up gets his gun out?

3475
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:04,901
Yeah.

3476
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:05,890
Well that's the middle of the night.

3477
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:06,960
Did you see the gray?

3478
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,131
Yeah,

3479
01:32:07,131 --> 01:32:08,340
but that's my understanding
about the grade.

3480
01:32:08,341 --> 01:32:09,940
Why did they always kind of one by one?

3481
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:10,181
It's like,

3482
01:32:10,181 --> 01:32:11,170
just kill everyone.

3483
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,430
There's the wolves.

3484
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,480
12 if you wolves,

3485
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:14,710
you can't do shit.

3486
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:16,890
That's probably the only
realistic thing about the movie.

3487
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:17,800
The older one at a time.

3488
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:18,460
Sneaky.

3489
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:18,701
Yeah.

3490
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:19,301
Wolves are smart,

3491
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:19,780
man.

3492
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:22,570
They take their time when they were all
walking towards the trees and the one,

3493
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:25,710
the one guy fell back a little bit
and they went nuts on him was like,

3494
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,613
Hey,

3495
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,570
they just could have
turned on the rest of them.

3496
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:29,440
Yeah.

3497
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:34,090
But they might not of the mind that just
that will wolves are very clever man.

3498
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:36,760
That might be a realistic part of the
movie that they saw the people running

3499
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:38,770
back with guns that
they would run away to.

3500
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:41,410
We heard those wolves killed
kill a skunk or on his campaign.

3501
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:41,890
Yeah.

3502
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,660
It's just the yell they let out.

3503
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,250
It's just so amazing.

3504
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:46,840
They all just start howling.

3505
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:49,510
Like we've done it where I was,

3506
01:32:49,511 --> 01:32:51,500
he didn't have to worry
about wolves hear him.

3507
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,320
But they do have an Idaho,

3508
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,460
it's not that far away.

3509
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,031
You know,

3510
01:32:55,031 --> 01:32:58,480
they reintroduced him to
the United States in Idaho.

3511
01:32:58,570 --> 01:32:58,841
Yeah.

3512
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:02,050
Well because they're worried about the uh,

3513
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:02,920
the ecosystem.

3514
01:33:02,921 --> 01:33:03,910
They wanted to bring it back.

3515
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,410
They wanted to reintroduce the predators.

3516
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,080
It's really interesting cause it's
having a devastating effect on the game,

3517
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:11,270
but it's also to keep the door
of the game populations in order.

3518
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:12,330
But now that they're forced,

3519
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:16,150
now they're forced to have wolf hunts
cause the wolf's don't have any predators.

3520
01:33:16,151 --> 01:33:18,580
And the wolves used to have the
Predator and the Predator was us.

3521
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,090
So now people are hunting walls and now
of course there's a lot of people that

3522
01:33:22,091 --> 01:33:24,700
are upset that people are hunting
wolves and I used to agree with that.

3523
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,211
I used to say,

3524
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:25,541
wow,

3525
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:27,790
you know the community on that
you can't hunt fucking wolves.

3526
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:31,780
That's fucked up because I think there's
something majestic about a wolf and

3527
01:33:31,781 --> 01:33:33,520
there's something where
you're not going to eat them.

3528
01:33:33,521 --> 01:33:34,390
And people were like,

3529
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:35,920
why would you be able to hunt wolves?

3530
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,450
But now it's you can eat them.

3531
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:37,871
Yeah,

3532
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:38,740
but now as I get older,

3533
01:33:38,741 --> 01:33:41,920
I understand like you have to hunt
them to keep the populations in control

3534
01:33:41,921 --> 01:33:42,551
because if you don't,

3535
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:45,700
then they start going after livestock
and they will go after people.

3536
01:33:45,701 --> 01:33:48,250
A woman got killed by a
wolf this year in Alaska.

3537
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:49,840
If there's more wolves,

3538
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:52,320
so then that becomes less food
for all of them to go around.

3539
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,160
As those wolves die out,

3540
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:57,760
they get crazy at the end and
that's when it becomes a real look.

3541
01:33:57,761 --> 01:34:00,280
If you have an overpopulation problem
with wolves and they don't have enough

3542
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:00,581
food,

3543
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:03,650
that becomes a real fun problems
that to the population of girl,

3544
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:04,360
that's all fine.

3545
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:04,571
Yeah.

3546
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:07,270
So when everyone's looking at these
wolves right now and saying like,

3547
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:07,650
oh,

3548
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:10,270
I think it sucks that the people
who are going to hunt wolves,

3549
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:12,160
like they have to hunt them now,

3550
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,540
if you don't hunt them down,

3551
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:17,050
we're going to get to a situation where
it's going to be a problem and the last

3552
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,090
problem you want is a
fucking wolf problem.

3553
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:22,720
Imagine Wolf start just jacking people
again on a regular base and we'll think

3554
01:34:22,721 --> 01:34:27,010
of how fucking stupid we were to let
ourselves get to a situation when we built

3555
01:34:27,011 --> 01:34:30,680
the the murderer population
back then people murdered.

3556
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:33,220
Magic was walking down the
street on Pasadena is a wolf.

3557
01:34:33,221 --> 01:34:33,490
I've don't,

3558
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:33,701
don't,

3559
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:33,941
don't,

3560
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:38,110
don't go outside all night packs
of them snarling eating babies.

3561
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,030
Bears here in Pasadena.

3562
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,910
That bear that keeps on
coming down from the woods.

3563
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,350
It was going people swimming pools.

3564
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:44,731
Yeah.

3565
01:34:44,731 --> 01:34:45,640
Well it's babies.

3566
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:46,210
Yeah.

3567
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,380
It's come down with its babies.

3568
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:49,210
Before they've even had an Alta Dena.

3569
01:34:49,211 --> 01:34:50,540
They had mountain lions like chilling.

3570
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,550
This lady's driveway.

3571
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:52,960
They had one in Santa Monica.

3572
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:53,471
Yeah,

3573
01:34:53,471 --> 01:34:53,981
they had a shoot.

3574
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:54,640
It had to kill it.

3575
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,000
Yeah.

3576
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,900
That was a big one too,

3577
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:56,734
man.

3578
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:57,050
Yeah.

3579
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,070
Was a big ass fucking

3580
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,860
200 pounds.

3581
01:34:58,860 --> 01:34:59,090
Hey,

3582
01:34:59,090 --> 01:34:59,900
we made an agreement.

3583
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,360
You stay over there and we stay over here.

3584
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:03,160
Dude.

3585
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,770
You Matt.

3586
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:04,260
How big?

3587
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,240
I'm saying 200 pounds.

3588
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,021
I think that's how big.

3589
01:35:06,021 --> 01:35:06,640
It was fun.

3590
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,010
I remember good dog,

3591
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:14,150
like 90 pounds with Johnny Johnny's
one 40 it says way bigger than that.

3592
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:14,750
Yeah.

3593
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,583
She says,

3594
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,731
oh my God.

3595
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:17,391
Is it true?

3596
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:18,470
Is it really 200 pounds?

3597
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:19,550
I know they get that bag.

3598
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,100
Was there any moment of like right
before you pulled the trigger,

3599
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:22,993
did you like,

3600
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:26,330
will you just zoned in on you like nothing
to think about what I'm about to do,

3601
01:35:26,331 --> 01:35:26,500
right?

3602
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:26,631
No,

3603
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:26,720
no,

3604
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:26,871
no.

3605
01:35:26,871 --> 01:35:27,710
I didn't think that.

3606
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:29,390
I just wanted to make sure
that I got the right shot.

3607
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:29,870
It's hard.

3608
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:32,480
200 yards is a really
far distance to shoot.

3609
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:33,200
You know?

3610
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,070
That's why it didn't.

3611
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,090
I tried to get it,

3612
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:36,320
the bolt to go through his heart.

3613
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,860
It didn't go through his heart landed
right above the heart and a couple inches

3614
01:35:39,861 --> 01:35:40,370
of the hardware.

3615
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:41,031
The spine is,

3616
01:35:41,031 --> 01:35:42,920
that's where it hit him and dropped him.

3617
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,410
Um,

3618
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:45,740
why did they tell you
not to go with the head?

3619
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:49,400
Cause it's harder to hit mountain lion
killed and Santa Monica is probably

3620
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:50,420
seeking at home.

3621
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:51,920
Oh,

3622
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,120
poor baby.

3623
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:54,463
You think.

3624
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,280
Oh

3625
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:00,103
yeah.

3626
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,183
Um,

3627
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:01,941
how big is it?

3628
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:02,900
Come on your fucks

3629
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:07,380
while you're waiting for Joe to look at
that information and go buy it for the

3630
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:08,740
Holocaust and the city on,

3631
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:09,980
in terms of Amazon and city.

3632
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:10,111
Very,

3633
01:36:10,111 --> 01:36:11,580
very powerful.

3634
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:15,610
That was really weird that you
called me hooky mine earlier.

3635
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:17,710
And you had no idea
that Pokemon in my car,

3636
01:36:17,711 --> 01:36:18,040
Joe,

3637
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,090
maybe I did know.

3638
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,430
Maybe I knew you silly baby.

3639
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:23,380
You know I never talked about it
and I'm tuned into the universe.

3640
01:36:23,381 --> 01:36:24,340
I'm a hunter now.

3641
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,290
The spirit of the wild
brain scanning me man.

3642
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,330
Yeah.

3643
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:32,861
How did that,

3644
01:36:32,861 --> 01:36:33,700
it's really fucking weird though,

3645
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:34,061
cause I haven't,

3646
01:36:34,061 --> 01:36:35,760
I don't think I've told you or dude,

3647
01:36:35,761 --> 01:36:36,110
I'm Bro,

3648
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:37,630
I'm a fucking brain scanner.

3649
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,510
We've never done it.

3650
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:40,410
But we've never talked Pokemon ever.

3651
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:41,380
I've never told talk,

3652
01:36:41,381 --> 01:36:42,131
poke me ever to,

3653
01:36:42,131 --> 01:36:45,970
but if any one of us would
have a Pokemon outfit,

3654
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,590
you would be the winner of that.

3655
01:36:47,591 --> 01:36:50,100
Campbell I aside from God,

3656
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:51,720
I put it in my car on the way here.

3657
01:36:51,721 --> 01:36:52,870
I just got it this morning.

3658
01:36:52,871 --> 01:36:53,290
Brian.

3659
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:54,220
I don't know if you know this,

3660
01:36:54,221 --> 01:36:55,870
but I know that you're a silly bitch.

3661
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,840
You're stalking me hunting here,

3662
01:36:57,841 --> 01:36:58,270
aren't you?

3663
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:58,900
I have no,

3664
01:36:58,900 --> 01:36:59,740
you're hunting bear

3665
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,330
Pokemon.

3666
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:03,550
I understand silly bitches.

3667
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:03,731
Oh,

3668
01:37:03,731 --> 01:37:04,570
it's Halloween is coming up.

3669
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,333
Halloween.

3670
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:08,350
I hate it so much word.

3671
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,640
So much pressure.

3672
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:11,140
I got a gorilla outfit,

3673
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:12,250
but it's way too hot.

3674
01:37:12,251 --> 01:37:13,510
I don't see how anyone could wear it.

3675
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:14,261
Why is it pressure?

3676
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:16,060
Are you so at negative and angry?

3677
01:37:16,061 --> 01:37:18,280
I don't put something on
and it's like if you don't,

3678
01:37:18,281 --> 01:37:18,911
then it becomes like,

3679
01:37:18,911 --> 01:37:19,121
oh,

3680
01:37:19,121 --> 01:37:21,100
you didn't get one of these.

3681
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:21,640
It's also,

3682
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,570
you gotta explain it.

3683
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,140
I just want to,

3684
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:23,430
ah,

3685
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:24,220
come on.

3686
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:24,501
All right.

3687
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:24,710
It's like,

3688
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:25,543
this is like,

3689
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:26,650
it feels just,

3690
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:27,520
it's so soft.

3691
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,241
You just put it on.

3692
01:37:28,241 --> 01:37:29,920
It just feels like
you're everywhere you go.

3693
01:37:29,921 --> 01:37:32,710
Just so people know what your real
personality is like and be like mini dean

3694
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:33,140
everywhere.

3695
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,060
I fuck around man.

3696
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:35,230
Just wear that everywhere.

3697
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:36,760
Cool.

3698
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,840
If we never addressed it.

3699
01:37:37,841 --> 01:37:38,890
If you wore that every pod.

3700
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:40,180
Yeah.

3701
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,460
Why not man smell so it's cool.

3702
01:37:42,461 --> 01:37:42,911
I like it.

3703
01:37:42,911 --> 01:37:44,710
And it covers up your headphones.

3704
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:45,220
Yeah.

3705
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,570
Makes you look mysterious back there.

3706
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:47,990
Um,

3707
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:50,300
that DJ who dead mouse.

3708
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,050
You're uh,

3709
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,190
you're pokey miles.

3710
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:54,570
Have you seen dead mouses?

3711
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,490
Kat Von D's Twitter lately,

3712
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:57,060
by the way?

3713
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:57,630
No.

3714
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:59,460
Every single tweet is I love you.

3715
01:37:59,461 --> 01:37:59,691
I know.

3716
01:37:59,691 --> 01:38:00,121
I love you.

3717
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:01,320
I love going there and love.

3718
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,280
It's just so silly.

3719
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:03,720
He makes good music.

3720
01:38:03,721 --> 01:38:04,420
They live together now.

3721
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,470
She's hot as fuck.

3722
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:05,740
God.

3723
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:06,281
It's the worst.

3724
01:38:06,281 --> 01:38:09,020
When people fall in love and they
feel like we got to make it public,

3725
01:38:09,021 --> 01:38:09,940
it's possible.

3726
01:38:09,941 --> 01:38:10,410
Someone's,

3727
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:11,440
everybody does it.

3728
01:38:11,441 --> 01:38:11,990
It's like,

3729
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,290
dude,

3730
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:13,170
nobody cares.

3731
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:16,110
It's worse than eating babies and
shitting in people's mouths when they're

3732
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,973
sleeping.

3733
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:18,070
It's the worst,

3734
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,200
the worst rev,

3735
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,433
worst,

3736
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:23,320
the worst thing ever,

3737
01:38:23,321 --> 01:38:23,591
ever,

3738
01:38:23,591 --> 01:38:23,861
ever,

3739
01:38:23,861 --> 01:38:24,460
ever.

3740
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,840
Just so annoying and just like,

3741
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:27,521
we get it,

3742
01:38:27,521 --> 01:38:28,750
we're all bored with you now.

3743
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,290
Look,

3744
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:32,980
let them be in their global what for
like a month that they keep hearing about

3745
01:38:32,981 --> 01:38:33,110
it,

3746
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:34,510
seeing a post about it.

3747
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:35,913
Funny,

3748
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,900
waiting on an airplane and they put their
seats back and you were sitting behind

3749
01:38:40,901 --> 01:38:44,370
him and there were tweeting and there
were tweeting picks it up that way.

3750
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,213
The worst,

3751
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:49,930
that's the worst because
he cost the worst.

3752
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:53,660
I had to sit in front of no
liens or seat back all the way,

3753
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:54,450
just saying,

3754
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:54,661
oh,

3755
01:38:54,661 --> 01:38:58,830
I don't respect the person's boundaries
in any way behind me are their feelings

3756
01:38:58,831 --> 01:39:00,180
that I might be crushing their legs?

3757
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:00,661
No,

3758
01:39:00,661 --> 01:39:03,720
they're saying I would like my seat
to go back and I don't care about what

3759
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:06,800
anyone else is doing that doesn't
get your legs out of the way.

3760
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:09,300
Has a little button.

3761
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,903
That's what you're allowed to.

3762
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,290
So then you were allowed to go back as
far as they let you and what if they go

3763
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:15,210
should go a little further back.

3764
01:39:15,211 --> 01:39:15,481
Where'd you go?

3765
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:16,314
A little further back,

3766
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,360
like as long as that
was what was agreed to.

3767
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,081
And what did they let you go?

3768
01:39:19,081 --> 01:39:20,940
All the way back to where
you're lying on somebody's lap.

3769
01:39:20,941 --> 01:39:21,774
Would you do that?

3770
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:22,050
Oh,

3771
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:25,050
where'd you use your own mind and say
just someone sitting back there or you

3772
01:39:25,051 --> 01:39:27,090
need some yoga and some Vicodin.

3773
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,590
I would never do that.

3774
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:28,921
That's not one.

3775
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,930
I would never smashed
their fucking legs with my,

3776
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:31,764
with my chair.

3777
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:32,793
It's a violent,

3778
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:33,753
it's violence.

3779
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:36,380
Like someone taking what?

3780
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:38,130
You don't feel like you
want to pick your seat back?

3781
01:39:38,131 --> 01:39:38,880
At what point?

3782
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,410
Make sure I do uncomfortable,

3783
01:39:40,411 --> 01:39:41,380
especially as being a challenge,

3784
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,130
but I don't put it back because
someone is sitting back there.

3785
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,720
But that's designed for that.

3786
01:39:45,721 --> 01:39:46,560
So they put this,

3787
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,280
how far the design?

3788
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:47,821
It's annoying.

3789
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:48,640
You can't fucking,

3790
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,700
you can't type on your computer.

3791
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:50,530
Somebody leads back.

3792
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:52,310
You need to get rich enough
to get a private chat.

3793
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,220
Unless you can't ever,

3794
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:55,390
you can't ever look at your
laptop when someone's laying back.

3795
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:56,100
Oh,

3796
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:57,060
he's talking about coach.

3797
01:39:57,061 --> 01:39:57,894
I forgot.

3798
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:01,080
It's no worry.

3799
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,520
Just shows a lack of
caring about other humans.

3800
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:08,050
Doesn't art shows you want to lean your
seat back and I know that's the design.

3801
01:40:08,051 --> 01:40:09,370
That's the reason you're doing it.

3802
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:10,151
But everyone does.

3803
01:40:10,151 --> 01:40:11,990
It is not a reason to do anything.

3804
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,280
It is because everyone does it.

3805
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,700
It's an agreement.

3806
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:16,563
Yours,

3807
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:19,810
you're less comfortable when
somebody smashing into your legs.

3808
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,160
It's for then do it to someone else.

3809
01:40:21,161 --> 01:40:22,330
It's a horrible act.

3810
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,040
It's a horrible self shop.

3811
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:24,874
Fell Fish Act.

3812
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,530
No it's not.

3813
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:26,260
Yes it is.

3814
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:27,340
Knowing how bad it is,

3815
01:40:27,341 --> 01:40:30,340
you have to deal with your one year
old whose legs didn't go off the chair.

3816
01:40:30,341 --> 01:40:32,710
I could see it cause he wouldn't know
what it felt like to someone to go back on

3817
01:40:32,711 --> 01:40:33,544
him

3818
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:35,611
at all.

3819
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:38,470
You are very tall guy and
your legs get in the way.

3820
01:40:38,471 --> 01:40:40,030
When someone tries to lean their seat bag.

3821
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:41,920
If you crossing your legs you can't fit.

3822
01:40:41,921 --> 01:40:42,251
However,

3823
01:40:42,251 --> 01:40:44,590
me and Brian are stubby
and we fit in fine.

3824
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,100
Perfect.

3825
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,930
So it's a completely different situation.

3826
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,190
You also are like,

3827
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:52,330
that's like a version of a being like
a big giant fat guy that doesn't fit in

3828
01:40:52,331 --> 01:40:52,750
the seat.

3829
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:55,270
I actually of like it when
I'm laying back and the one,

3830
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,300
the ones in front of me,

3831
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:56,781
he's laying back.

3832
01:40:56,781 --> 01:40:58,240
It's like a little sky mall blanket.

3833
01:40:58,580 --> 01:40:59,570
Feel more protect like no,

3834
01:40:59,571 --> 01:41:00,620
it's gonna rack me in the balls.

3835
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,460
Scam all blanket cause are selfish.

3836
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:04,683
Selfish,

3837
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,500
selfish.

3838
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,400
That's interesting.

3839
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:07,240
I don't see it that way.

3840
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,840
Really causing some pain.

3841
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:11,650
I choose not to think about it
is not the cell causing me pain,

3842
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:11,980
man.

3843
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:12,731
No it cognitive.

3844
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:14,200
Somebody else pain's back.

3845
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:17,170
Some of the front of me
sending coach this weekend.

3846
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:18,550
Do you have it hates that.

3847
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:19,900
It's a worse sending coaches.

3848
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:20,440
If you have,

3849
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,180
if you have your thing out
and you're on your computer,

3850
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:23,890
you can't be on your computer anymore.

3851
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,030
It's too far back.

3852
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,151
Yeah,

3853
01:41:25,151 --> 01:41:25,690
you can't.

3854
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:26,380
That's it.

3855
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:27,400
So that's annoying.

3856
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:27,611
But yeah,

3857
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:31,810
you'll still inflict that on someone else
for the joy of leaning a little if you

3858
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:32,350
want to,

3859
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:33,030
you can do that.

3860
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,280
Yeah,

3861
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:33,910
you're allowed.

3862
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:34,760
The law allows it.

3863
01:41:34,761 --> 01:41:35,880
You're not there to visit.

3864
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:37,960
Why government doesn't work
cause everyone's corruptible.

3865
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,220
Yeah.

3866
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:38,950
Where's the Dolphin?

3867
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:39,550
It looks there.

3868
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:43,420
You're not going to do anything there
to sit in your seat and you're there to

3869
01:41:43,421 --> 01:41:44,254
get somewhere.

3870
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:48,920
You can make it less
painful airline's fault.

3871
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,833
Not

3872
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:53,740
because humans can't be
trusted to think about others.

3873
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:54,160
You're like,

3874
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,270
they let me honestly,

3875
01:41:55,271 --> 01:41:57,520
if they let you go as far back
as you want it all the way back,

3876
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,500
a bunch of you motherfuckers
would keep doing it.

3877
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,220
They would.

3878
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,053
They would.

3879
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:01,990
They would.

3880
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,380
There was like,

3881
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:03,220
I don't know what goes there,

3882
01:42:03,221 --> 01:42:06,970
so I'm just going to do it and then get
head because girls just would not be

3883
01:42:06,971 --> 01:42:09,280
able to help themselves and be
dicks right next to their face.

3884
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:10,173
It's an asshole.

3885
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:11,320
We don't know what's happening.

3886
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:11,820
I agree.

3887
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:11,990
Oh,

3888
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:13,690
are you really exaggerating here?

3889
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,290
I'm not.

3890
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:14,591
Wait,

3891
01:42:14,591 --> 01:42:16,120
what do you feel like it's selfish?

3892
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:17,500
One knows what it does to people,

3893
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:18,131
but you do it anyway.

3894
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:19,600
It's just a small selfish act.

3895
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:21,250
I don't think it's that selfish.

3896
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:21,541
No,

3897
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,090
you don't.

3898
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:24,110
I think it's something people never
think they're doing anything wrong.

3899
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,370
No,

3900
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:27,940
it's just you're very tall guy,

3901
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:28,211
man.

3902
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:32,310
It's very different for you than it
is for me or Brian Guy Behind you.

3903
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:32,951
Do you look and say,

3904
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:33,041
oh,

3905
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:33,791
he's a tall guy behind me.

3906
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:35,380
I'm not going to do this
and person on that plane.

3907
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:37,000
You need to understand that you're tall.

3908
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:38,590
You need to spend the extra $40.

3909
01:42:38,591 --> 01:42:40,750
Did the business upgrade
class or whatever,

3910
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:41,584
exit row.

3911
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,990
And that's what you see
a short person behind me.

3912
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:47,160
I still don't leave my chair back cause
it fucking disrupt all your sweetie.

3913
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:49,270
I'm just so selfless.

3914
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:50,171
That's you,

3915
01:42:50,171 --> 01:42:50,590
Ari.

3916
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:53,970
I just liked the fact that when
somebody does lean back and stiff going,

3917
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,431
ma'am,

3918
01:42:54,431 --> 01:42:55,280
I'm very tall,

3919
01:42:55,281 --> 01:42:57,400
but he just goes and starts kicking it,

3920
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:58,451
like hitting him.

3921
01:42:58,451 --> 01:42:59,080
Whoa.

3922
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:03,230
I think that was before he
did mushrooms this years ago.

3923
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,833
No,

3924
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:08,990
but he doesn't even
respond violently anymore.

3925
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:09,671
You don't do that.

3926
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:10,481
Sometimes I do this.

3927
01:43:10,481 --> 01:43:10,840
I say,

3928
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:11,680
just so you know,

3929
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:11,980
um,

3930
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:15,030
you're going to make this
very uncomfortable for me
and I'm going to be paint.

3931
01:43:15,031 --> 01:43:16,150
I'm going to paint in my knee.

3932
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:17,170
You said as you lean back,

3933
01:43:17,171 --> 01:43:18,290
but I know you're allowed,

3934
01:43:18,291 --> 01:43:18,730
but,

3935
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:20,190
but just know that's what's
going to happen to me.

3936
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:21,490
Why don't you just ask them,

3937
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:23,230
would you please read your mind?

3938
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:25,900
I had a knee operations and
I'm all fucked up and gangly.

3939
01:43:26,350 --> 01:43:28,780
Would you mind just that tall?

3940
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,020
It's not crazy.

3941
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:30,760
Five eight.

3942
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:30,971
Yeah,

3943
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:31,804
you are.

3944
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,643
That's so Tom,

3945
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:32,981
you're,

3946
01:43:32,981 --> 01:43:34,540
you're taller than average.

3947
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,220
Most people are like me and Joe size,

3948
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,900
but you know where that difference is?

3949
01:43:37,901 --> 01:43:39,700
You're just talking about knee to waste.

3950
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:42,280
That's the only difference in terms
of where it affects your seat.

3951
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:44,920
So those five inches,

3952
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:47,200
seven inches.

3953
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,460
I'm like,

3954
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,510
how come I'm not going away?

3955
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:50,650
It's going to be that much more.

3956
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:51,783
He does

3957
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:53,890
it.

3958
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:55,340
Cap doesn't get crossed up.

3959
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:59,210
You can do that weird thing where you
can actually fold one leg over the top.

3960
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,400
My little troll legs don't work that way.

3961
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:04,190
I can't fold my leg
over the top of my leg,

3962
01:44:04,191 --> 01:44:05,024
my legs.

3963
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,250
I can only wear a certain types of pants.

3964
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:08,600
Most pants I can't wear.

3965
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:12,260
I can't like like Levi's five oh
one I can't even get those on.

3966
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:13,011
If they were,

3967
01:44:13,011 --> 01:44:14,240
if they fit my waist,

3968
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:15,350
they never fit my legs.

3969
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:18,050
They get onto my legs and
they just lock up halfway.

3970
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:18,850
Really?

3971
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:19,683
Yeah.

3972
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:20,840
Cause you have thick thighs.

3973
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:21,560
Yeah.

3974
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,393
Don't feel like a troll.

3975
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:28,880
I'm five eight 190 pounds and most
of it's in my legs and my ass.

3976
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:29,900
Five eight one nine.

3977
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:30,860
You guys are both five eight

3978
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,760
to 10 Jesus

3979
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:39,140
men is so different than women.

3980
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,120
If a girl ever did that to her friend,

3981
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:43,120
what do you way to tent Jesus?

3982
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,530
You'd be them to the
end of the friendship.

3983
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:46,670
Isn't it funny?

3984
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:46,971
Yeah.

3985
01:44:46,971 --> 01:44:48,470
Women are allowed to do that.

3986
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:50,180
It's something they're allowed to do.

3987
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,130
They'll do what allowed to keep that.

3988
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:57,110
You know like you know half us to talk
about how much girl ways or you can't

3989
01:44:57,111 --> 01:44:59,450
like ask her and then like
get in her face like you fat.

3990
01:44:59,451 --> 01:45:00,260
Fuck.

3991
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:01,130
You can't say that.

3992
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:02,210
Putting it on the balance.

3993
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:02,920
Yeah.

3994
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,970
You can't say that you
were an asshole if you do,

3995
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,260
but with guys like who you,

3996
01:45:06,261 --> 01:45:06,621
you fat,

3997
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:07,160
fuck.

3998
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:07,850
You know why?

3999
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:09,500
First of all the time
have respect for women.

4000
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,810
That's why we don't do it because
we're like they can't handle it.

4001
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:14,290
Those little babies that we can't
fucking trust with real feelings.

4002
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:15,480
Well we have testosterone.

4003
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,360
Testosterone's was fucking speaker

4004
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:27,320
zig for frothy loads by the way on and
is going to have a testosterone boosting

4005
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,070
formula.

4006
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:31,130
We found out there's a bunch of things
besides the zinc and magnesium does

4007
01:45:31,131 --> 01:45:31,941
something called tongue.

4008
01:45:31,941 --> 01:45:36,290
Got Ali and there's a bunch of different
herbs that have been shown in an actual

4009
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:39,950
real clinical tests to up testosterone
when you take them for more than 10 or a

4010
01:45:39,951 --> 01:45:40,790
10 or 11 days.

4011
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:41,010
Yeah.

4012
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:41,400
Aubrey,

4013
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:44,110
we were saying that he tried the
Zma Max or whatever that does.

4014
01:45:44,111 --> 01:45:44,781
Same thing was,

4015
01:45:44,781 --> 01:45:47,180
and it just made him
shit a lot like diarrhea.

4016
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:47,730
Whoa.

4017
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:48,480
And I didn't have,

4018
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:48,771
no,

4019
01:45:48,771 --> 01:45:49,131
I never,

4020
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:52,100
I've never had their probably he must
have got a bad batch or it was confusing

4021
01:45:52,101 --> 01:45:54,700
it cause he was also
doing Tequila and stuff.

4022
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:55,623
The isolated,

4023
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:58,670
I met a dude this weekend who uh,

4024
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,230
had a stroke from meth.

4025
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,340
Wow.

4026
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:01,890
Yeah.

4027
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:02,390
We uh,

4028
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,730
we went to a bar and there's,

4029
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:05,180
this guy came in with his friend,

4030
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:08,250
his friend was 25 years old
and he had a stroke from,

4031
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:11,260
from doing math at one 2123.

4032
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:12,010
Yup.

4033
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,680
That's crazy.

4034
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:12,921
Yeah.

4035
01:46:12,921 --> 01:46:14,000
He's learning to like read,

4036
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,500
reuse his body again.

4037
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:16,783
Fucking crazy.

4038
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:20,180
Math is a mother fucker.

4039
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:21,103
Wow.

4040
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:25,760
That's one thing that you have to
deal with in like places like Montana,

4041
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:28,040
you know there's a lot of math problems.

4042
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:32,420
So those places I make a joke swap pill
sometimes and I get away from La to New

4043
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:32,421
York.

4044
01:46:32,421 --> 01:46:34,000
I think all you're not going to
get it cause you guys don't you.

4045
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:35,360
And then it hit me like Indianapolis,

4046
01:46:35,361 --> 01:46:35,910
Kansas City.

4047
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:36,170
I'm like,

4048
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:36,710
Oh yeah,

4049
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:37,610
this is where pills are.

4050
01:46:37,611 --> 01:46:38,340
This is where method.

4051
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:38,900
Oh yeah.

4052
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:39,890
Pills are everywhere,

4053
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:40,280
man.

4054
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:43,970
We live in a really strange world
because in the middle of this,

4055
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,980
this whole debate on marijuana that
keeps going on in the public eye,

4056
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:52,160
when you see it on CNN
and there's hills or yeah,

4057
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:53,460
while this is happening,

4058
01:46:53,461 --> 01:46:55,320
well this marijuana distraction,

4059
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:58,260
there are so many pill
junkies this country.

4060
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:59,700
So Monster,

4061
01:46:59,701 --> 01:47:02,010
monster numbers and no
one's doing shit about it.

4062
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,040
There's a lot of meth heads in
this country too in the weeds,

4063
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:05,874
doing shit about it.

4064
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:09,510
And then you see cops that just dressing
up like high school students and

4065
01:47:09,511 --> 01:47:11,910
pretended to be high school students
trying to get them to sell them weed and

4066
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:12,121
I'm like,

4067
01:47:12,121 --> 01:47:12,870
really?

4068
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:13,140
Why?

4069
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,150
Why are you not busting the meth labs?

4070
01:47:15,151 --> 01:47:16,070
You fuck you.

4071
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:16,141
No,

4072
01:47:16,141 --> 01:47:17,040
you're not done.

4073
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:17,490
You're not.

4074
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:18,600
You didn't do your work.

4075
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:22,620
You're going to go after high school kids
high school or selling marijuana will.

4076
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:24,150
It should be the last
thing you have to get.

4077
01:47:24,151 --> 01:47:24,751
Exactly.

4078
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:25,471
It should be.

4079
01:47:25,471 --> 01:47:26,310
Even if it's a layered,

4080
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,650
all the murderer we've cured,

4081
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:30,750
you know we resolved like who
committed all the murders,

4082
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:32,370
put everybody in jail.

4083
01:47:32,371 --> 01:47:33,151
We've cleaned up the streets.

4084
01:47:33,151 --> 01:47:34,590
We were down to zero crime.

4085
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,160
Okay.

4086
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:37,260
How about high school kids
are so we'd all right,

4087
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,780
we'll go back to that
and all have drugs first.

4088
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:41,230
Well,

4089
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:42,063
Utopia,

4090
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:43,860
Ari,

4091
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:45,150
I look like I'm the guy in the front.

4092
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:48,420
You're so uncomfortable putting up a
picture that's kind of drawn in the same

4093
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:52,950
way as the instructions that are in
planes telling you where the exits are.

4094
01:47:52,951 --> 01:47:56,130
But it's a guy very uncomfortable
with the seat and getting seats.

4095
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,270
His knees smashed.

4096
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,400
You should just jerk
off into people's hair.

4097
01:47:59,490 --> 01:48:02,200
I put it in there a little bit.

4098
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:06,510
That would be very,

4099
01:48:06,511 --> 01:48:07,344
very rude.

4100
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,930
It would be a violation of
it is fucking rude though.

4101
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:12,420
How they shoved so many
goddamn seats onto a point.

4102
01:48:12,421 --> 01:48:14,670
Oh it's like cattle now.

4103
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:15,061
Yeah.

4104
01:48:15,061 --> 01:48:15,781
I mean it's so,

4105
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:18,000
it's such not a seat
when it's really funny.

4106
01:48:18,001 --> 01:48:19,620
As they tempt you at the airport,

4107
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:20,491
at the airport,

4108
01:48:20,491 --> 01:48:23,490
you get to sit in those seats waiting
to get on the plane and those are,

4109
01:48:23,491 --> 01:48:24,310
those aren't bad.

4110
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:24,530
Yeah,

4111
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:26,070
it's a great and you're like,

4112
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:26,271
hey,

4113
01:48:26,271 --> 01:48:26,471
hey,

4114
01:48:26,471 --> 01:48:26,850
hey,

4115
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:27,300
okay.

4116
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:30,810
Obviously you know what
size seat should be.

4117
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:31,171
Okay.

4118
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:32,100
Cause you got them everywhere.

4119
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:33,571
You're teasing.

4120
01:48:33,571 --> 01:48:34,111
You're aware.

4121
01:48:34,111 --> 01:48:35,880
It's not like I have no
idea of why the size.

4122
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:36,640
Yeah.

4123
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:40,380
I'm all over his fucking gate
everywhere and then I get all,

4124
01:48:40,381 --> 01:48:40,590
you're like,

4125
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:41,423
oh we forgot.

4126
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:42,150
We forgot.

4127
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:43,200
We forgot what size it is.

4128
01:48:43,201 --> 01:48:44,100
We're gonna make them half that size.

4129
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:44,490
Right.

4130
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:45,323
That's okay.

4131
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:45,901
No it's not.

4132
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:46,321
Okay.

4133
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:47,154
Asshole.

4134
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:50,580
Kalin and I were sitting next to
each other and I'm not a big guy man,

4135
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:55,650
but I'm touching the airplane on my left
side and touching him on my right side.

4136
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,870
Can we do three rows of two
instead of two rows of three?

4137
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:58,920
That's exactly what it should be.

4138
01:48:59,220 --> 01:48:59,550
Yeah.

4139
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:00,990
Just make it tighter to get it around.

4140
01:49:00,991 --> 01:49:05,010
But it should be rows of two and it
should be more space in between the rows,

4141
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:05,641
you know,

4142
01:49:05,641 --> 01:49:06,400
and it,

4143
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,260
I mean,

4144
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:10,830
I guess you have to pay a little bit
more for that and people don't want to do

4145
01:49:10,831 --> 01:49:11,161
that.

4146
01:49:11,161 --> 01:49:11,761
But man,

4147
01:49:11,761 --> 01:49:13,410
I just feel like the way
they're doing it now,

4148
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:14,040
it's just,

4149
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,260
it's so Cadillac sucky beds,

4150
01:49:16,261 --> 01:49:17,400
like bunk beds style.

4151
01:49:17,401 --> 01:49:19,110
It should be people on top of people.

4152
01:49:19,111 --> 01:49:22,440
So like you're kind of laying
down and like a bunch of shit.

4153
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:25,770
I want to be old people couldn't
hold people down the bottle.

4154
01:49:25,771 --> 01:49:27,570
Some old people can barely stand up.

4155
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:31,530
The old feel of the seats can't crawl
out and just have a bunch of beds in the

4156
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:32,280
back.

4157
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:32,550
Yeah.

4158
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:33,600
Was don't fucking too,

4159
01:49:33,601 --> 01:49:34,434
that's another problem.

4160
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,070
That's not a problem.

4161
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:37,620
That's living your life

4162
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:40,780
won't be allowed to Hug Scott.

4163
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:41,911
You say that.

4164
01:49:41,911 --> 01:49:42,121
All right.

4165
01:49:42,121 --> 01:49:43,620
Because you're what's called a pervert.

4166
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:48,410
Your al young delinquent running around
out there with no responsibilities

4167
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:49,660
trying to fuck on airplanes.

4168
01:49:49,661 --> 01:49:50,140
Okay,

4169
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,520
but that's not good for society.

4170
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:52,850
Have you reflect on it?

4171
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:55,250
I'm trying to have jerked off an airplane

4172
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:58,570
on an airplane.

4173
01:49:58,810 --> 01:49:59,381
If you are,

4174
01:49:59,381 --> 01:50:02,380
how dare you have only been
more chances in your life.

4175
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:04,743
Yeah,

4176
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,030
I just think that uh,

4177
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:09,280
you can't give people too
many opportunities to fuck.

4178
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,630
They would just never get any work done.

4179
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,190
We never have iPads.

4180
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,560
Fuck whenever they want to fucking,

4181
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,281
yeah,

4182
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:15,761
it would suck,

4183
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:16,400
man.

4184
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:17,980
They talked really loud or quiet.

4185
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:18,671
Oh yeah,

4186
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:19,031
baby.

4187
01:50:19,031 --> 01:50:20,140
Put it in my shitter.

4188
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:20,381
Like,

4189
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:21,214
Hey,

4190
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,750
I'm trying to read.

4191
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:23,260
Yeah,

4192
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:26,620
you really fucking whore iPad.

4193
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,780
I'm getting you guys
going to make me jerk off.

4194
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:29,021
Okay.

4195
01:50:29,021 --> 01:50:30,880
I'm going to jerk off module.

4196
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:33,070
Businessmen poked their
heads will go off on me.

4197
01:50:33,071 --> 01:50:33,620
Bro.

4198
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:35,260
Took and my loads.

4199
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:36,220
Don't shoot that far.

4200
01:50:36,221 --> 01:50:37,330
I'm aiming towards you.

4201
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,470
It won't reach you.

4202
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:39,304
Trust me.

4203
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,150
He imagined he just jerking
off at straight out the guy.

4204
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,890
He's like three feet away.

4205
01:50:44,891 --> 01:50:45,671
Like don't worry dude,

4206
01:50:45,671 --> 01:50:46,540
I'll never hit.

4207
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:51,840
And then just by some crazy streak of
red wine to hit the longest just shot

4208
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:53,403
ever.

4209
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:54,461
It's almost like,

4210
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:56,620
you know like you manifested
it with the secret.

4211
01:50:57,790 --> 01:50:58,623
My friend Josh,

4212
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:02,050
he laid on a table he could jerk off
and hit the ceiling lower ceiling.

4213
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:02,920
This is like,

4214
01:51:02,921 --> 01:51:03,910
I'll bet you all right now.

4215
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:04,360
And we're like,

4216
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:06,190
literally none of us want to watch.

4217
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:07,620
Wow.

4218
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,250
That's a guy who's just hoping,

4219
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:10,010
oh gosh,

4220
01:51:10,010 --> 01:51:10,691
this isn't going to work.

4221
01:51:10,691 --> 01:51:10,961
Come on,

4222
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:11,561
suck my cock.

4223
01:51:11,561 --> 01:51:13,040
Who wants in that is it?

4224
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:14,650
It just wanted a bunch of
guys who watch some jerk.

4225
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:15,603
Ah,

4226
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:16,721
it was high school.

4227
01:51:16,721 --> 01:51:17,770
Of course I got squares.

4228
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:20,090
He would have just like come to it.

4229
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:24,930
Just dripped out to cut to
that guy right now is there.

4230
01:51:24,931 --> 01:51:27,170
They're roasting him like a pig over-haul.

4231
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:29,200
One guys kept wanting his ass.

4232
01:51:29,201 --> 01:51:32,230
One guy that's got one of his Dick and
they got him hogtied did just spinning.

4233
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:33,064
I'm

4234
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:35,930
spinning them button mouse.

4235
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:37,810
It's better than high school.

4236
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,980
Wouldn't even watch the shark.

4237
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:41,920
That guy's gay as fuck.

4238
01:51:42,650 --> 01:51:43,271
Even thinking about it.

4239
01:51:43,271 --> 01:51:44,710
That's not a rotisserie right now.

4240
01:51:44,711 --> 01:51:46,090
Spinning around Cox.

4241
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:49,031
Well,

4242
01:51:49,031 --> 01:51:51,820
people just on the
sides and glaze them up.

4243
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:59,080
Imagine the scenarios that were gay
before you knew what gay was or were aware

4244
01:51:59,651 --> 01:52:00,910
that it was actually going to be around.

4245
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:01,511
I was around,

4246
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:03,400
I knew what gay was really young.

4247
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:05,920
I moved to San Francisco,

4248
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,330
a family did when I was seven,

4249
01:52:07,331 --> 01:52:11,770
my and our next door neighbors were gay
and my aunt used to go next door and

4250
01:52:11,771 --> 01:52:13,390
smoke weed with them
and get naked with them.

4251
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:14,410
But yeah,

4252
01:52:14,411 --> 01:52:15,221
because they were gay,

4253
01:52:15,221 --> 01:52:15,551
they didn't,

4254
01:52:15,551 --> 01:52:16,900
they didn't want to have
nothing to do with her.

4255
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:17,980
So she would take off,

4256
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:19,180
they would all take off all their clothes,

4257
01:52:19,181 --> 01:52:21,370
they would get high together
and they would all play Bongo.

4258
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,720
And I was like seven,

4259
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:23,501
you know.

4260
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:25,770
And I remember it like they
were like really friendly there.

4261
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:26,830
They weren't creepy at all.

4262
01:52:26,831 --> 01:52:27,581
They were very nice.

4263
01:52:27,581 --> 01:52:28,600
They were very nice neighbors.

4264
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:28,781
Yeah,

4265
01:52:28,781 --> 01:52:29,680
they were very nice people.

4266
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:30,190
That's cool.

4267
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:32,110
And so my earliest,

4268
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:32,944
uh,

4269
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,130
my earliest encounters with
gay people was very positive.

4270
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:37,240
It was like our neighbors were gay.

4271
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,430
Really Nice guys and the
whole neighborhood was,

4272
01:52:40,130 --> 01:52:40,590
nope,

4273
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:41,320
nobody's a big deal.

4274
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:41,950
Yeah.

4275
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:44,590
San Francisco was really
fucking gays in the 70s.

4276
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,920
It's interesting how there's like
places that I was Asian back then too.

4277
01:52:48,921 --> 01:52:51,080
There was always a lot of Asians was.

4278
01:52:51,081 --> 01:52:51,530
Um,

4279
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:54,620
it's interesting how
places back then like,

4280
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,290
like there's like places
that are just decidedly gay.

4281
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:00,020
This is the gay or like Santa Monica.

4282
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:01,400
Like here's the gay area.

4283
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:02,630
This is Santa Monica Boulevard,

4284
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:03,853
West Hollywood.

4285
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:05,690
This is the gay area if I called it Mecca.

4286
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:06,200
Yeah.

4287
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:06,711
Oh yeah,

4288
01:53:06,711 --> 01:53:07,250
for sure.

4289
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:08,061
For Gay dudes.

4290
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:08,451
Mecca,

4291
01:53:08,451 --> 01:53:10,220
Hossam Gay dudes,

4292
01:53:10,221 --> 01:53:10,581
man.

4293
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:11,181
I'm telling you,

4294
01:53:11,181 --> 01:53:14,360
besides the persecution and the fact that
people don't want him to get married,

4295
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,100
they have the fucking life,

4296
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:16,940
you know,

4297
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:18,620
if they really enjoy being gang,

4298
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:20,790
I'll take a walk with
you one day down near my,

4299
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:21,020
no,

4300
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:21,590
no you won't.

4301
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:22,550
I'll be in my car.

4302
01:53:22,730 --> 01:53:23,720
Windows rolled up,

4303
01:53:23,721 --> 01:53:24,760
sunglasses on,

4304
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:25,760
walked by these places.

4305
01:53:25,761 --> 01:53:26,594
No one recognized

4306
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:31,670
they Daniel Boone hat on fake mustache.

4307
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:35,960
They all sit there and they're like
get wings during the day and stuff.

4308
01:53:35,961 --> 01:53:39,410
And he drank and tall and they're
all just smiling and happy.

4309
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:39,741
Great.

4310
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:42,470
And it's like you're all just
around pussy all day long.

4311
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:44,510
You're just in a good mood.

4312
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:45,200
Yeah,

4313
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,250
they have good jobs.

4314
01:53:46,251 --> 01:53:46,680
They don't wait.

4315
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:47,750
I don't want pays their own way.

4316
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:49,250
And women will look,

4317
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:50,640
some women get just happy.

4318
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:54,140
Someone would get turned on by guys
that are fucked up and perverted and

4319
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:56,540
aggressive and they get turned on by,

4320
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:57,170
you know,

4321
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:57,910
by just,

4322
01:53:57,910 --> 01:53:58,500
just,

4323
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,230
just be manly shit.

4324
01:54:00,231 --> 01:54:00,621
Like man,

4325
01:54:00,621 --> 01:54:02,120
leave violence sort of be heated.

4326
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:04,070
But some women don't and they'll,

4327
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:07,280
the blonde one thing is the women will
never totally understand it because

4328
01:54:07,281 --> 01:54:08,100
they're not a woman.

4329
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,460
Just like a man's never going to
totally understand what it's like to be

4330
01:54:10,461 --> 01:54:11,260
pregnant.

4331
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:15,360
Never be able to wrap your head around
wanting a baby to grow inside you or

4332
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:17,630
wanting a dick in your
mouth or in your pussy.

4333
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:17,870
There's,

4334
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:18,201
you're,

4335
01:54:18,201 --> 01:54:18,531
you're,

4336
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:19,910
you're not going to have to
wrap your head around that.

4337
01:54:19,911 --> 01:54:20,750
You're not a woman.

4338
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:25,100
And I think the gay guys have going
for them is their fucking men.

4339
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:26,090
They understand what it's,

4340
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,141
what it's like to be a man.

4341
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:28,550
There's no confusion there.

4342
01:54:28,551 --> 01:54:30,500
Turned on by men and they are men.

4343
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:33,350
So it's like everybody
knows what the fuck is up.

4344
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:37,880
Whereas it's not like this charade that
you have to play when you're trying to

4345
01:54:37,881 --> 01:54:38,421
get a girl to,

4346
01:54:38,421 --> 01:54:42,050
like you have to ask for like a Bj
or something and he looks at it.

4347
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:43,910
If that was a man there,

4348
01:54:43,911 --> 01:54:44,390
he'd be like,

4349
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,481
Oh,

4350
01:54:44,481 --> 01:54:45,080
you're drunk.

4351
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:45,591
Let me blow.

4352
01:54:45,591 --> 01:54:45,701
Yeah,

4353
01:54:45,701 --> 01:54:46,580
I can get you to bed.

4354
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:47,473
Yeah.

4355
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:47,990
Yeah.

4356
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,351
Well,

4357
01:54:48,351 --> 01:54:51,110
unless he was a greedy bitch
didn't want to blow you,

4358
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:53,090
just wanted you to blow him all the time.

4359
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,080
Apparently there's that,

4360
01:54:54,081 --> 01:54:55,790
that happens in a lot
of gay relationships.

4361
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,541
This is weird.

4362
01:54:56,541 --> 01:54:58,370
Like master slave sort of thing.

4363
01:54:58,610 --> 01:54:59,320
Yeah.

4364
01:54:59,320 --> 01:54:59,490
Uh,

4365
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:00,490
this was here too.

4366
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:01,491
It's mostly not,

4367
01:55:01,491 --> 01:55:02,324
but fucking,

4368
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:02,751
yeah.

4369
01:55:02,751 --> 01:55:03,171
That's why he's here.

4370
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:04,610
Almost all oral on handjobs.

4371
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:07,700
Handjobs how dare you,

4372
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:09,003
how Horny Hornier you.

4373
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,380
How dare they handjobs awesome.

4374
01:55:12,381 --> 01:55:14,320
Is inserting stuff into
her asshole as I fuck.

4375
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:15,050
Oh,

4376
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:17,390
well now you're talking
to a party that's like,

4377
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:18,391
I should have mentioned it.

4378
01:55:18,391 --> 01:55:19,520
The freeze dried foods.

4379
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:20,600
Once you had the hot water,

4380
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:22,490
it all pops out.

4381
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:22,790
Yeah.

4382
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:23,410
Let the party,

4383
01:55:23,410 --> 01:55:24,770
the like the fucking uh,

4384
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:25,783
Peter Pan.

4385
01:55:26,290 --> 01:55:27,650
What was every out of water through it.

4386
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:28,911
What movie was that?

4387
01:55:28,911 --> 01:55:30,200
It was some fantastical movie.

4388
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:30,920
It's,

4389
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:33,710
it's interesting that people
have a problem with gay people.

4390
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,750
It's interesting that people,

4391
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:39,170
I think they worry about
gay people being pedophiles.

4392
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:42,650
There's a big difference between being
a pedophile and being gay and there's a

4393
01:55:42,651 --> 01:55:43,880
lot of gay people that want them.

4394
01:55:43,881 --> 01:55:45,270
Nothing to do with the young guys.

4395
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:47,700
In fact like I want to
Brian Collins friends,

4396
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:51,690
it was a gay guy and he was attracted
to guys like John Mccain's age.

4397
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:53,790
He's attracted like older business.

4398
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:55,470
My friend Rachel send
to girls that are older.

4399
01:55:55,471 --> 01:55:56,280
She was like,

4400
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:56,491
yeah,

4401
01:55:56,491 --> 01:55:57,570
I'm thinking this 52 year old.

4402
01:55:57,571 --> 01:55:58,150
And I was like,

4403
01:55:58,150 --> 01:55:58,470
Ooh,

4404
01:55:58,470 --> 01:55:59,303
Rachel.

4405
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:03,450
But then I realized the 52 year
old just getting a younger chick,

4406
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:08,900
maybe she likes it because she takes
care of her or something and shit.

4407
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:09,960
She goes,

4408
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:10,441
shut up.

4409
01:56:10,441 --> 01:56:10,760
And I'm like,

4410
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:11,141
is it,

4411
01:56:11,141 --> 01:56:16,141
is wrinkly grey skin slops and on
her face like dead octopus swapped

4412
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:22,480
over your lips to your ears all.

4413
01:56:22,481 --> 01:56:23,970
She doesn't stick her tongue out.

4414
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:28,170
Unenthusiastic Lee and the big lesbian
just grinds are split on their tongue.

4415
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:28,900
Just keep her,

4416
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:29,733
keep her town.

4417
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:36,120
That face hugger pussy just
rubs up and down every time.

4418
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:38,100
She doesn't really lick the pussy as much.

4419
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:41,580
Just sits there with their tongue
out and this look on her face.

4420
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:43,540
He's like,

4421
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:44,373
yeah,

4422
01:56:45,490 --> 01:56:50,490
that's a big fucking giant
floppy face hugger pussy.

4423
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:54,083
Fucking right there.

4424
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,290
I'm fucking right there.

4425
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:55,770
You betcha.

4426
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:57,420
I'll keep in touch with her tongue out.

4427
01:56:57,690 --> 01:56:58,750
I'm getting thirsty.

4428
01:56:59,040 --> 01:56:59,873
I'm almost done.

4429
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:00,823
I'm almost done.

4430
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:04,260
Matt.

4431
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:06,060
Just someone's complaining
like you don't know.

4432
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:07,560
When you complain about getting thirsty,

4433
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:08,610
she starts from scratch.

4434
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:10,050
You fucking selfish combat.

4435
01:57:10,570 --> 01:57:12,240
Keep your tongue out there
and shut the fuck up.

4436
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:14,820
You want to do you want
to drive a range rover?

4437
01:57:14,821 --> 01:57:15,391
You do.

4438
01:57:15,391 --> 01:57:15,901
Okay,

4439
01:57:15,901 --> 01:57:17,910
well this woman's going
to get you a range rover,

4440
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,440
but you've got to keep your tongue out.

4441
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:21,673
Hung out.

4442
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:24,330
Keep the oil price to pay for Range Rover.

4443
01:57:24,331 --> 01:57:26,250
It was off road range rover.

4444
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:29,550
You fucking bitch are fucking range rover.

4445
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:35,580
Restive female gay
people angry about gays.

4446
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:36,451
What is that exact?

4447
01:57:36,451 --> 01:57:37,180
They're fools.

4448
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:37,400
No,

4449
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:37,550
no,

4450
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:38,510
but where is it?

4451
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,660
I don't think it's dad.

4452
01:57:40,661 --> 01:57:41,580
I think they're scared.

4453
01:57:41,581 --> 01:57:45,330
They're scared of that somehow
or another that the gay person,

4454
01:57:45,331 --> 01:57:49,680
some my is going to get ahold of them
and turn them into a gay person or some

4455
01:57:49,681 --> 01:57:54,681
tutors so scared of being gay that they
will not let a woman touch their asshole

4456
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:59,790
or do anything with it because gay people
have used that and an act somewhere.

4457
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:01,710
They will not allow a woman to make it.

4458
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,470
They can't even appreciate
on body in any way.

4459
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:05,491
Yeah.

4460
01:58:05,491 --> 01:58:06,900
To or were were suppressed.

4461
01:58:06,901 --> 01:58:07,591
We're all fucked up,

4462
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:07,860
man.

4463
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:08,430
I can't,

4464
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:09,550
I can't fucking do that shit.

4465
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:11,700
You can tilt down a you.

4466
01:58:11,701 --> 01:58:11,881
I'm like,

4467
01:58:11,881 --> 01:58:12,410
I know.

4468
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,750
That's the way

4469
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:17,340
sound like fun at all.

4470
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,570
That does not sound like fun.

4471
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:20,220
A girl putting on his trap on a fucking,

4472
01:58:20,221 --> 01:58:23,190
you know like who are you and what
are you trying to do because okay,

4473
01:58:23,191 --> 01:58:24,590
you don't even feel that strap on.

4474
01:58:24,591 --> 01:58:25,160
You create that.

4475
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,010
Just not like it's a part
of your body receives it.

4476
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,980
Like fucking hookers with Dildos,

4477
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:33,570
pushing it into a really don't
get the same sort of thing.

4478
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:34,170
Me Neither,

4479
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:35,670
but everybody's got their own thing.

4480
01:58:35,790 --> 01:58:36,810
It's got their own thing.

4481
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:37,980
Nothing wrong with it.

4482
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:39,870
As long as you make an
agreement with a hooker,

4483
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:40,900
you know,

4484
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,270
you listen right before I come,

4485
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:42,641
I got to stick.

4486
01:58:42,641 --> 01:58:44,170
Might need my finger right here.

4487
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:44,411
Yeah.

4488
01:58:44,411 --> 01:58:45,310
You wrap it down.

4489
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:50,500
Um,

4490
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:51,333
it's uh,

4491
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:51,731
you know,

4492
01:58:51,731 --> 01:58:55,630
sex is such a weird thing because it's
all just about what feels good to your

4493
01:58:55,631 --> 01:58:56,290
body.

4494
01:58:56,290 --> 01:58:57,430
That's what it's about.

4495
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:01,120
It's about people doing things to each
other's body that makes them feel good,

4496
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:03,190
but they're so negative connotations.

4497
01:59:03,191 --> 01:59:03,701
First of all,

4498
01:59:03,701 --> 01:59:04,534
the diseases,

4499
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:05,373
that's a big one.

4500
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,870
I read that like gonorrhea,

4501
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:12,900
that there were something like 300,000
cases of gonorrhea in America in 2010 can

4502
01:59:14,171 --> 01:59:14,770
America?

4503
01:59:14,770 --> 01:59:15,730
Yes.

4504
01:59:16,030 --> 01:59:16,870
Yes.

4505
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:17,793
300.

4506
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:20,050
I'll look it up right now because I think,

4507
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:20,710
yeah,

4508
01:59:20,710 --> 01:59:22,600
300,000 cases of gonorrhea.

4509
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:24,220
It's one out of like 1300 people.

4510
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,960
Yes.

4511
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:26,141
I know.

4512
01:59:26,141 --> 01:59:26,860
1300 people.

4513
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:27,020
Oh,

4514
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:27,341
of course.

4515
01:59:27,341 --> 01:59:28,340
I know some other kind of retail.

4516
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:29,410
Yeah,

4517
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:31,220
that seems about right.

4518
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:33,400
I just got it.

4519
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:34,150
Just got it.

4520
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:34,391
I mean,

4521
01:59:34,391 --> 01:59:35,410
we're shocked with crabs.

4522
01:59:35,411 --> 01:59:37,420
Like I never was crabs anymore.

4523
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:44,430
According August nine 2012
they approximately 340 case
of gonorrhea each year.

4524
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:47,320
A hundred 300,003 in America.

4525
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:48,551
In America.

4526
01:59:48,551 --> 01:59:49,384
I was right.

4527
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:49,870
Wow.

4528
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:52,450
That was gonna be one that comes back
and it gets cured or is that the one that

4529
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:53,284
you can forever?

4530
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:53,621
Yeah,

4531
01:59:53,621 --> 01:59:54,280
you cure it.

4532
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,050
You get a little shot of penicillin.

4533
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,140
That's the one he didn't border like
empire with the shoe thing up your dick

4534
01:59:59,141 --> 02:00:00,340
hole and pull up strain.

4535
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,200
So let's stop and think about that.

4536
02:00:02,201 --> 02:00:04,510
There's probably a lot of
money and treating gonorrhea.

4537
02:00:04,511 --> 02:00:05,890
I think about the amount of money.

4538
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:11,680
What if we found out like the medicine
responsible for treating gonorrhea was

4539
02:00:12,281 --> 02:00:14,400
also responsible for commercials.

4540
02:00:14,401 --> 02:00:16,010
It shows chicks acting like whores.

4541
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:19,360
Like he thought they were selling Nike's,

4542
02:00:19,570 --> 02:00:23,260
but really they're selling pussy
because it's partially sponsored by the

4543
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:26,140
gonorrhea medication that
is trying to get them going.

4544
02:00:26,141 --> 02:00:26,440
Yeah,

4545
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:29,500
like gonorrhea mercenaries
and they'd go out there,

4546
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:32,620
they give them gonorrhea and then
there's like the guys that are studs,

4547
02:00:32,621 --> 02:00:37,130
they just got to fuck a lot of bitches
and they create like a hole in festal

4548
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:38,300
hold town with gonorrhea.

4549
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:41,920
Just so they can sell or trying to sell
people to stop smoking so it can chew

4550
02:00:41,921 --> 02:00:42,420
gum.

4551
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:44,260
And I found out he was from
the truly come factory.

4552
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:45,183
Oh really?

4553
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:45,641
Oh,

4554
02:00:45,641 --> 02:00:46,450
that's hilarious.

4555
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:46,601
Yeah,

4556
02:00:46,601 --> 02:00:49,150
that'd be hilarious that they
were doing that to spread disease.

4557
02:00:49,151 --> 02:00:49,960
Yeah.

4558
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:50,860
Bring down girls.

4559
02:00:50,861 --> 02:00:51,280
They make,

4560
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:52,720
they may porn everywhere.

4561
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:55,930
They tried to just make
it have more gonorrhea.

4562
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:56,651
Well you know,

4563
02:00:56,651 --> 02:01:01,300
that's a weird thing about the strange
groups of like the like the branch off

4564
02:01:01,301 --> 02:01:03,880
groups of gay people that branched off,

4565
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:04,361
you know,

4566
02:01:04,361 --> 02:01:05,710
those weird branches.

4567
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:06,590
Those uh,

4568
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:06,840
what,

4569
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:07,110
what does,

4570
02:01:07,110 --> 02:01:08,140
what does the expression,

4571
02:01:08,230 --> 02:01:09,070
not branch off,

4572
02:01:09,071 --> 02:01:09,904
but uh,

4573
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:10,940
whatever,

4574
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:12,550
what I'm talking about is bug chasers.

4575
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:13,190
Oh,

4576
02:01:13,190 --> 02:01:14,250
you're wanting to do,

4577
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:17,170
to go out and try to get HIV positive.

4578
02:01:17,171 --> 02:01:20,890
They want guys to shoot loads in
their ass and make them HIV positive.

4579
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:23,540
It's like what are so tied in with like,

4580
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:25,150
this is a gay disease grids.

4581
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:25,601
Yeah.

4582
02:01:25,601 --> 02:01:28,150
That is a crazy request though.

4583
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:28,700
That's my thing.

4584
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:30,880
Idea that you want to go and get aids.

4585
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:31,330
Like you're,

4586
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:34,090
you're trying to go out and get HIV.

4587
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,710
Like what?

4588
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:36,900
That's,

4589
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:40,790
but that just goes to show you that
there's that many people that their people

4590
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:41,840
are so fucking nuts.

4591
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:44,660
There's a certain amount of people they
want to tattoo their face and stretch

4592
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:46,910
out their lips and stretch out their ears.

4593
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:47,620
You know,

4594
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:50,630
there's a certain amount of people
that want to fucking you pierce.

4595
02:01:50,631 --> 02:01:54,950
Their dicks is a certain amount of
people that want aids aids through people

4596
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:55,850
with those giant,

4597
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:56,690
like this big round,

4598
02:01:56,691 --> 02:01:59,990
like half dollar full corn
dollar size earrings in.

4599
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:02,030
Really pushed it out in a girl.

4600
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:04,910
And the guy came up to me after Portland
and said hi and stuff and I was like,

4601
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:05,480
oh,

4602
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,830
are you guys together?

4603
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,220
Both of you crazy ears.

4604
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:11,571
Yes.

4605
02:02:11,571 --> 02:02:13,070
Restaurant that we were at in Montana.

4606
02:02:13,071 --> 02:02:13,541
I had to do too.

4607
02:02:13,541 --> 02:02:14,091
Is working there?

4608
02:02:14,091 --> 02:02:15,020
Has Ears like that?

4609
02:02:15,021 --> 02:02:16,400
It's like a two years going back.

4610
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:16,820
No,

4611
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:16,971
no.

4612
02:02:16,971 --> 02:02:18,110
You have to get them stitched up.

4613
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:19,063
Ah,

4614
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:20,041
yeah.

4615
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:20,874
That's no joke.

4616
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:22,160
That's pretty serious.

4617
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:22,840
The,

4618
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:23,091
I mean,

4619
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:26,300
literally they have to go in and they
have to pull your fucking meet together

4620
02:02:26,301 --> 02:02:28,970
and stitch it up and they probably
have to cut some of it off.

4621
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:30,200
Oh yeah.

4622
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:30,621
Oh yeah.

4623
02:02:30,621 --> 02:02:31,490
He would have to cut some of that off.

4624
02:02:31,491 --> 02:02:32,390
You'd have to cut some of it off.

4625
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:34,941
Yeah,

4626
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:35,870
it's fucking Gross,

4627
02:02:35,871 --> 02:02:36,470
man.

4628
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:37,910
It's a weird thing that people want to do.

4629
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:39,710
Like I saw this pretty girl the other day.

4630
02:02:39,711 --> 02:02:40,610
She's really pretty.

4631
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:44,150
She came to the show and afterwards
she had this giant ring in her nose,

4632
02:02:44,151 --> 02:02:46,490
like a bull ring and ask for it.

4633
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:47,120
Yeah.

4634
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:47,610
I was like,

4635
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:47,960
Eh.

4636
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,760
I mean the aesthetics,

4637
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:51,590
I'm not into it or not into it,

4638
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:53,270
so I can go chat to though.

4639
02:02:53,271 --> 02:02:53,540
Right?

4640
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:53,770
Yeah.

4641
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:54,420
I don't want any of that.

4642
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:54,980
Like that.

4643
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:55,700
That's hot.

4644
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:55,911
Yeah.

4645
02:02:55,911 --> 02:02:56,601
Especially if they're good.

4646
02:02:56,601 --> 02:02:57,330
It's good work.

4647
02:02:57,330 --> 02:02:58,190
It's good clear.

4648
02:02:58,191 --> 02:02:59,330
And it's got red and black,

4649
02:02:59,331 --> 02:03:00,164
not just all black.

4650
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:00,560
It's like,

4651
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,130
Ooh.

4652
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:01,940
Yeah.

4653
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:02,480
Yeah.

4654
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,430
And it also shows she's just dirty.

4655
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:06,350
She's just getting drilled on.

4656
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:08,420
She could take the pain.

4657
02:03:08,730 --> 02:03:11,150
That's a girl could
take us serious fucking,

4658
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:11,840
you know,

4659
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,700
girls who like complain a lot about stuff,

4660
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:14,211
you know.

4661
02:03:14,211 --> 02:03:16,100
So we've got their phone on 20 folks.

4662
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:17,570
That was one of the weirdest thing,

4663
02:03:17,571 --> 02:03:17,811
man,

4664
02:03:17,811 --> 02:03:20,020
is that this little thing called
vibrate and I forgot about it.

4665
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:23,480
That's one of the weirdest things
about being there was no cell phone,

4666
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:24,740
no email,

4667
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:25,310
no,

4668
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:26,920
no nothing for five days.

4669
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:27,860
That must been cool.

4670
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:28,753
It was strange.

4671
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:29,900
You got a lot of energy,

4672
02:03:29,901 --> 02:03:32,110
a man wondering how much just from that,

4673
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:33,110
not the being outside.

4674
02:03:35,050 --> 02:03:35,840
All of the above.

4675
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:36,500
All the above.

4676
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,820
I think it's walk around.

4677
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:41,570
I left my phone at home last night for
four hours at this comedy store in your

4678
02:03:41,571 --> 02:03:42,404
hand,

4679
02:03:42,770 --> 02:03:43,491
but I did a lot of purpose.

4680
02:03:43,491 --> 02:03:43,731
I was like,

4681
02:03:43,731 --> 02:03:45,980
now let me leave it here to
charge low and it was like,

4682
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,850
I'll be okay at fucking 11:00 PM at night.

4683
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:51,830
Took to whenever you're talking about
like down the street from your house.

4684
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:53,150
I was like,

4685
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:53,983
nobody.

4686
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:55,010
Yeah,

4687
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:56,390
but you still got to concentrate on it.

4688
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:56,781
Yeah.

4689
02:03:56,781 --> 02:03:59,360
We're eventually going to
become a symbiotic machine.

4690
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,910
We're going to be part
machine thinks that this,

4691
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:03,200
it's just the going that way.

4692
02:04:03,410 --> 02:04:04,010
It would have to be,

4693
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:06,660
we're already connected to your phone
mean what difference does it make if you,

4694
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:10,400
if they told you that we have a
new phone that's more effective.

4695
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:11,870
If you don't carry it,

4696
02:04:12,110 --> 02:04:15,200
we inserted into your
thigh and they forgot away.

4697
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:15,471
Oh,

4698
02:04:15,471 --> 02:04:15,861
by the way,

4699
02:04:15,861 --> 02:04:16,281
Brian,

4700
02:04:16,281 --> 02:04:16,581
we,

4701
02:04:16,581 --> 02:04:16,721
uh,

4702
02:04:16,721 --> 02:04:17,130
we're,

4703
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:20,930
we're going to be able to upload all the
shows live on youtube as well now and

4704
02:04:20,931 --> 02:04:23,300
we'll be able to a stream them on youtube.

4705
02:04:23,301 --> 02:04:24,410
We've got a new thing going on.

4706
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:26,260
We're going to be able
to live in u street.

4707
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:26,431
No,

4708
02:04:26,431 --> 02:04:26,521
no,

4709
02:04:26,521 --> 02:04:26,631
no.

4710
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:27,620
We're going to do at the same time.

4711
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:29,330
Simultaneous,

4712
02:04:29,331 --> 02:04:30,440
simultaneous.

4713
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,250
How about that?

4714
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:31,761
That's possible,

4715
02:04:31,761 --> 02:04:32,320
right?

4716
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:32,940
Yeah.

4717
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:33,773
Uh,

4718
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:36,680
two feeds to video feeds and
get some hardcore bandwidth.

4719
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:37,290
Okay.

4720
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:37,700
Uh,

4721
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:38,050
we're going to

4722
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:40,230
get the guests to computers or something.

4723
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:41,371
I Dunno.

4724
02:04:41,371 --> 02:04:42,204
That's kind of tricky.

4725
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:45,210
Let's see if we can try it because
otherwise we can at least upload them.

4726
02:04:45,211 --> 02:04:47,190
We can start uploading
them to use youtube.

4727
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:47,821
Yeah,

4728
02:04:47,821 --> 02:04:51,600
I did prom might have with youtube is
that I've always tried to do the live

4729
02:04:51,601 --> 02:04:52,980
streaming thing or you know,

4730
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:53,701
and it never,

4731
02:04:53,701 --> 02:04:55,050
it always never works.

4732
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:55,680
Right.

4733
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,900
Crashes or maybe we could try it.

4734
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:58,820
We'll try it.

4735
02:04:58,820 --> 02:04:59,653
We'll see what's up.

4736
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:01,960
I don't know what my Internet's
like at the new place.

4737
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:02,401
Will suit,

4738
02:05:02,401 --> 02:05:04,890
won't see until they're putting
the bricks on the walls.

4739
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:08,830
This week I'm making it fancy folks
making it like a Billy Joel's Italian

4740
02:05:08,831 --> 02:05:09,310
restaurant.

4741
02:05:09,310 --> 02:05:10,000
That's the thing.

4742
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,080
Vytorin embattled white,

4743
02:05:13,870 --> 02:05:15,290
whatever kind of moon.

4744
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:18,190
Uh,

4745
02:05:18,190 --> 02:05:18,401
yeah.

4746
02:05:18,401 --> 02:05:21,040
I just thought that they can get bricks.

4747
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:21,160
Uh,

4748
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:21,640
first of all,

4749
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:23,680
the reason there's two reasons
for putting bricks in the wall.

4750
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:26,680
The number one reason is to
Joey Diaz the room at the fuck.

4751
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:27,350
I got a joy.

4752
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:28,660
D has proved his cock sucker.

4753
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:29,561
The uh,

4754
02:05:29,561 --> 02:05:29,891
the,

4755
02:05:29,891 --> 02:05:33,310
there's a business next door and I don't
want Joey screaming through the walls.

4756
02:05:33,311 --> 02:05:35,110
I don't think it would show up,

4757
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:35,831
but,

4758
02:05:35,831 --> 02:05:36,271
so I'm,

4759
02:05:36,271 --> 02:05:38,880
I'm taking significant
steps to what deaden the,

4760
02:05:38,890 --> 02:05:40,390
some of the sound in the room.

4761
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,430
And one of them is to put up a brick wall.

4762
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:43,650
Yeah.

4763
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,290
I mean super.

4764
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:48,040
It's just get a big bubble when the
bubble boy bubbles for Joey Diaz and just

4765
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,690
have him walk around
like a hamster anyway.

4766
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:53,140
Plastic and just going for it.

4767
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:53,480
Yeah.

4768
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:54,130
I'm a,

4769
02:05:54,130 --> 02:05:58,570
they take bricks that they like wreck a
building and they take bricks and they

4770
02:05:58,571 --> 02:06:01,750
sliced the veneer off the brick and then
they could put that on a regular wall

4771
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,850
so it adds like another wall layer,

4772
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:04,480
you know.

4773
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:08,110
So I figured that would be a
pretty good to prevent some sound.

4774
02:06:08,111 --> 02:06:11,350
And then I'm also got these curtains
that are going up that have like a sound

4775
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:14,500
deadening backing to them
putting those up as well.

4776
02:06:15,010 --> 02:06:15,431
Yeah.

4777
02:06:15,431 --> 02:06:16,720
And a I just taken,

4778
02:06:16,721 --> 02:06:17,980
it's taken some time folks,

4779
02:06:17,981 --> 02:06:20,680
but it's because I'm doing it while
I'm doing all these other things.

4780
02:06:20,681 --> 02:06:21,514
At the same time,

4781
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:22,130
if you're,

4782
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:25,000
the customer over under this week is
going to be the bricks that we'd done.

4783
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:25,900
The desk is done.

4784
02:06:25,901 --> 02:06:27,700
So I have all the equipment in.

4785
02:06:27,701 --> 02:06:28,420
So not,

4786
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:29,200
not that bad.

4787
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:30,220
Once the uh,

4788
02:06:30,610 --> 02:06:32,560
once the bricks are up on the wall and uh,

4789
02:06:32,561 --> 02:06:33,670
I got the wall painted.

4790
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:35,200
Yeah,

4791
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:35,801
I think so.

4792
02:06:35,801 --> 02:06:36,551
I think in December,

4793
02:06:36,551 --> 02:06:40,150
I think my goal is before we do the
end of the world show with honey,

4794
02:06:40,151 --> 02:06:45,151
honey and Diaz and Stan hope that we
do a podcast like the night before that

4795
02:06:46,241 --> 02:06:51,241
would be my goal is to open up the studio
that week and do a do a podcast there

4796
02:06:51,341 --> 02:06:52,174
the night before.

4797
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:53,860
But once we have it,

4798
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:55,240
once we have an up and running,

4799
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,230
it's going to be,

4800
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:56,530
uh,

4801
02:06:56,530 --> 02:06:57,220
just,

4802
02:06:57,220 --> 02:07:02,220
I just want to get a place that's
going to be a place that we can kind of

4803
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:07,500
completely control the environment and
make it like as cool inside as I can,

4804
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:09,041
you know,

4805
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:11,890
set it up as technologically perfect,

4806
02:07:11,891 --> 02:07:12,730
technically perfect,

4807
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:14,750
really nice big desk and,

4808
02:07:15,850 --> 02:07:17,990
and have it a fairly close to,

4809
02:07:17,991 --> 02:07:18,400
uh,

4810
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,830
this place has really
become fucking high tech.

4811
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:21,411
Well,

4812
02:07:21,411 --> 02:07:22,360
not the core.

4813
02:07:22,361 --> 02:07:23,130
I mean it's really,

4814
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:25,870
it's like this is inside Brian's brain.

4815
02:07:27,030 --> 02:07:30,580
If you could open up his brain with a
can opener that Hitler Zombie would pop

4816
02:07:30,581 --> 02:07:31,414
right out.

4817
02:07:32,230 --> 02:07:33,730
I had a crazy ass dream the other night,

4818
02:07:33,731 --> 02:07:34,060
man.

4819
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,440
Weird Alpha brain did.

4820
02:07:35,441 --> 02:07:36,274
I was on a,

4821
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:36,671
what do you got?

4822
02:07:36,671 --> 02:07:37,780
Their fellow Koser.

4823
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:38,653
Yeah,

4824
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:39,640
you tail.

4825
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:40,473
Okay.

4826
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:41,560
This man's almost 40

4827
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:45,500
clutching a coke zero like he's in prison.

4828
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:47,370
Are you going trick or
treating and with the fam?

4829
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:47,751
Oh yeah,

4830
02:07:47,751 --> 02:07:48,080
Bro.

4831
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:49,970
That's a cool part of
Halloween that I would do.

4832
02:07:50,090 --> 02:07:50,550
We did it.

4833
02:07:50,550 --> 02:07:51,010
Um,

4834
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:52,720
we went trick or treating in Disneyland.

4835
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:53,290
Oh Wow.

4836
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:54,940
People can figure neighborhood did it?

4837
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:55,170
Yeah,

4838
02:07:55,170 --> 02:07:55,351
yeah,

4839
02:07:55,351 --> 02:07:55,810
yeah.

4840
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:56,471
We're going to go.

4841
02:07:56,471 --> 02:07:56,950
Um,

4842
02:07:56,950 --> 02:08:00,520
we're going to go walk the neighborhood
to the community that I live in has like

4843
02:08:00,521 --> 02:08:02,440
a little friends that they
have like a little party.

4844
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:04,720
They have like a live DJ and stuff.

4845
02:08:04,721 --> 02:08:05,260
It's kind of fun.

4846
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,630
When did Wednesday,

4847
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:09,250
Wednesday is the day that I have to
turn off all my lights and not answer my

4848
02:08:09,251 --> 02:08:09,660
door.

4849
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:09,890
Why?

4850
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:10,420
Why is that?

4851
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:11,440
Because it's annoying

4852
02:08:13,470 --> 02:08:15,130
and be like,

4853
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:15,600
no,

4854
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:16,280
that is mine.

4855
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:17,680
I like to hide.

4856
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:18,590
Ding Dong.

4857
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:19,180
Ding Dong.

4858
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:19,870
Ding Dong.

4859
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:20,703
Ding Dong.

4860
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:21,201
Yeah.

4861
02:08:21,201 --> 02:08:22,990
I'm flying to Calgary
this year on Halloween.

4862
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,450
I got out of it before it was Halloween.

4863
02:08:25,451 --> 02:08:25,700
I was like,

4864
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:26,930
Oh fuck yeah,

4865
02:08:27,470 --> 02:08:28,303
let's do that.

4866
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:29,180
Yeah,

4867
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:29,930
you're working.

4868
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:31,470
Where was the club in Calgary.

4869
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:32,170
Okay.

4870
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:32,450
Oh,

powerful Yuk Yuk.

4872
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:34,460
Ladies and gentlemen.

4873
02:08:34,490 --> 02:08:37,100
Head on out to see how re
motherfucking shoe here.

4874

Calgary right this year.

4875
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:39,820
Yeah.

4876
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:40,580
Yeah.

4877
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:42,210
Get a lot of people come from that show.

4878
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:43,290
That was an man.

4879
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:44,600
Yeah.

4880
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:44,990
Yeah.

4881
02:08:44,990 --> 02:08:46,340
And I bet you have a
lot of new shit anyway.

4882
02:08:46,341 --> 02:08:47,480
You've been working on a lot of Shit,

4883
02:08:47,481 --> 02:08:48,280
right?

4884
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:49,900
I'm starting to do this one.

4885
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,170
One of the cool things about everybody
doing all these shows and putting out cds

4886
02:08:54,171 --> 02:08:55,640
like yours and Joey's is a,

4887
02:08:55,660 --> 02:08:55,911
you know,

4888
02:08:55,911 --> 02:08:56,061
we're,

4889
02:08:56,061 --> 02:08:58,100
we're constantly putting a new material.

4890
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:58,910
Yeah.

4891
02:08:58,910 --> 02:08:59,470
It's fun.

4892
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:00,860
So I can feel very reasoned to.

4893
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:01,431
Yeah.

4894
02:09:01,431 --> 02:09:02,510
I feel very challenged,

4895
02:09:02,511 --> 02:09:02,830
you know?

4896
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:03,080
Yeah.

4897
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:03,913
It feels fun.

4898
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:06,230
I haven't really felt like
this since open mikes.

4899
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,333
Yeah.

4900
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:08,660
I don't know how it was in Boston,

4901
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:11,900
but in la it was the same
people seeing you all the time.

4902
02:09:11,901 --> 02:09:14,840
So really every week I did have
something new or you're an asshole.

4903
02:09:15,530 --> 02:09:16,363
You know,

4904
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:18,410
we're getting a lot of these
people that are just like,

4905
02:09:18,650 --> 02:09:18,981
you know,

4906
02:09:18,981 --> 02:09:19,940
that come into a lot of this year.

4907
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:23,750
So at least every year it's a crazy
little grateful dead thing going on.

4908
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:24,970
We're fine.

4909
02:09:24,970 --> 02:09:25,491
Fit for me.

4910
02:09:25,491 --> 02:09:28,190
And Juliet in Chicago
November 8th by the way,

4911
02:09:28,290 --> 02:09:31,280
that has the blues people are flying
in people I'm making like meetups and

4912
02:09:31,281 --> 02:09:31,820
stuff.

4913
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:33,130
Of course here I can.

4914
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:34,400
I love that shit.

4915
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:34,740
Yeah,

4916
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:37,110
we're going to have to figure out our
own gathering of the Juggalos types.

4917
02:09:37,111 --> 02:09:37,944
Yeah,

4918
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:39,620
no that's,

4919
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:42,500
Duncan wants to do it in the desert,

4920
02:09:42,501 --> 02:09:43,334
man.

4921
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:45,230
I want to go out with Manson.

4922
02:09:46,670 --> 02:09:50,480
I'm telling you the palm springs area.

4923
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:51,601
We'll get it handled.

4924
02:09:51,601 --> 02:09:52,434
So many mushrooms.

4925
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:56,661
Yeah.

4926
02:09:56,661 --> 02:09:56,840
Would

4927
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:57,550
you ever do this?

4928
02:09:57,550 --> 02:09:57,640
Uh,

4929
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:58,910
this the guy who hosts the pock,

4930
02:09:58,911 --> 02:09:59,960
I've talked about him before.

4931
02:09:59,961 --> 02:10:01,530
He's like almost apocalyptic.

4932
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:01,790
Yeah.

4933
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:02,990
Post apoc.com guy.

4934
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:03,800
Oh he,

4935
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:06,620
he's the one that sent me that package
once where I thought it was a bomb or

4936
02:10:06,621 --> 02:10:09,410
something and it just ended up being
a really cool pipe that he made.

4937
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:11,390
He's always sending me like cool things.

4938
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:11,901
Anyways,

4939
02:10:11,901 --> 02:10:16,410
he goes to thrift stores and
buys old bottles of sodas here.

4940
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:19,250
I get to the point he drinks them.

4941
02:10:19,251 --> 02:10:20,510
So this is like an eight,

4942
02:10:20,511 --> 02:10:23,480
like a 70 year old bottle of grape soda.

4943
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:23,781
Dude.

4944
02:10:23,781 --> 02:10:24,220
I did.

4945
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:25,910
I trusted her coke original.

4946
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,270
He's wanting to break
that rest flattish shit.

4947
02:10:29,271 --> 02:10:29,750
Right?

4948
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:30,411
Well it's,

4949
02:10:30,411 --> 02:10:30,980
you're not,

4950
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:33,000
it's acidy and shit like that.

4951
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:34,070
Is that as our work

4952
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:34,760
in the background?

4953
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:35,061
Yeah,

4954
02:10:35,061 --> 02:10:35,571
I think so.

4955
02:10:35,571 --> 02:10:37,940
That is a bad ass picture of
the dude with the gas mask.

4956
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:40,600
His website's really bad by the way.

4957
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:45,630
The new hire primate gas mask monkey sure
is available and plus pictures of a 40

4958
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:50,730
go to higher-primate.com but he drinks it.

4959
02:10:50,731 --> 02:10:52,190
I made sure that it tastes like shit.

4960
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:52,701
It's like,

4961
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:52,911
you know,

4962
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:54,780
copper almost and that,

4963
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:55,071
okay,

4964
02:10:55,071 --> 02:10:55,904
well let's let him talk.

4965
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:56,743
Okay.

4966
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:59,060
Instead of a rubber gasket,

4967
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,250
it's real cork.

4968
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:03,260
Cork,

4969
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:05,900
real cork would disk
inside the bottle cap.

4970
02:11:06,410 --> 02:11:11,250
I thought that was botulism or fungus
of some kind when I first opened it that

4971
02:11:11,251 --> 02:11:12,540
we're going to have to
end this video early.

4972
02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:14,720
Um,

4973
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:15,980
we help us up the light.

4974
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,900
We saw no floaties.

4975
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:18,773
Who was he talking about?

4976
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,080
No monsters are little squids or anything.

4977
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:21,940
It's talking about himself.

4978
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:22,773
Emily's personnel.

4979
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:23,653
Your name or guy.

4980
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:27,060
He's like Roy Jones Jr
strongly like grape Dimetapp.

4981
02:11:28,570 --> 02:11:28,841
I mean,

4982
02:11:28,841 --> 02:11:29,621
super strong,

4983
02:11:29,621 --> 02:11:30,454
great flavor.

4984
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:33,520
This can be fermented to all hell
and extra for this down my throat.

4985
02:11:33,521 --> 02:11:35,200
And you'll see it just
burn right through my desk.

4986
02:11:35,201 --> 02:11:36,310
Squad shirt right here.

4987
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:38,853
I really are.

4988
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:40,530
We watching a guy just drinking soda?

4989
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:40,761
Yeah,

4990
02:11:40,761 --> 02:11:42,450
but it's like from the 19,

4991
02:11:42,510 --> 02:11:43,710
1947.

4992
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:47,530
All right.

4993
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:50,710
Your tastes like grape flavor,

4994
02:11:51,010 --> 02:11:52,570
like nasty pond water.

4995
02:11:53,650 --> 02:11:54,483
It's a,

4996
02:11:54,730 --> 02:11:55,563
okay.

4997
02:11:56,150 --> 02:11:57,520
That really wasn't that interesting.

4998
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:58,853
Just thought it was weird.

4999
02:11:58,880 --> 02:11:59,370
I mean,

5000
02:11:59,370 --> 02:12:01,570
what would you do that I just,

5001
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:03,570
I drank a bottle of
coke zero coke original.

5002
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:06,050
How these three of them save from uh,

5003
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:06,741
when I was little,

5004
02:12:06,741 --> 02:12:08,130
little really real.

5005
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:09,433
What it tastes like.

5006
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:11,360
Super flat coke,

5007
02:12:11,361 --> 02:12:11,991
super flat coke.

5008
02:12:11,991 --> 02:12:12,824
Pretty much coke.

5009
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:14,480
He ends up puking and slightly off,

5010
02:12:14,481 --> 02:12:16,110
but not much muck cars.

5011
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:16,910
Does he really?

5012
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,211
Yeah,

5013
02:12:17,211 --> 02:12:17,961
he sends up because of it.

5014
02:12:17,961 --> 02:12:18,890
It's just silly bitch.

5015
02:12:18,910 --> 02:12:21,400
And that's why you drink that?

5016
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:21,921
Well,

5017
02:12:21,921 --> 02:12:24,830
I don't understand what people would
like think that it's interesting to drink

5018
02:12:24,831 --> 02:12:26,590
something gross that's been
around for a little bit.

5019
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:26,870
Probably.

5020
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:28,040
If you look at last that long,

5021
02:12:28,041 --> 02:12:29,030
like a wine then sure,

5022
02:12:29,031 --> 02:12:29,570
whatever.

5023
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:31,430
But if it can't last that
long and what are you doing?

5024
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,120
It's gone.

5025
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:32,930
It's gone rotten.

5026
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:34,570
That's a weird thing
that people do with ones,

5027
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:35,030
you know,

5028
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:37,760
keep wines around for hundreds of
years and drink them or scotch.

5029
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,241
I love it.

5030
02:12:38,241 --> 02:12:39,380
That sounds like hoarding behavior.

5031
02:12:40,210 --> 02:12:41,420
That's like there's only a few left.

5032
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,400
Just don't gotta wait.

5033
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:44,091
Yeah.

5034
02:12:44,091 --> 02:12:45,290
That's what I do with weeds now.

5035
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:48,200
I'll have like a few different strains
of weed and if it would be good,

5036
02:12:48,201 --> 02:12:49,610
I've got through half of it
right away and they'll be like,

5037
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:49,851
oh,

5038
02:12:49,851 --> 02:12:51,050
we only have like half of it left.

5039
02:12:51,250 --> 02:12:52,610
It's when it gets like slower,

5040
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,260
but I use it and then I only go
back to it every couple of months.

5041
02:12:55,290 --> 02:12:59,090
You hoard it like the last of the Maui
Wowie let's just slow it down a little.

5042
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:00,620
What would you do that
we need to just get more.

5043
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:01,150
I,

5044
02:13:01,150 --> 02:13:02,180
I always sort of forget.

5045
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:03,080
I can go get more.

5046
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,310
I don't want it to be gone.

5047
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,260
That's a problem with living
in parts of the country.

5048
02:13:06,261 --> 02:13:07,370
That's not like California.

5049
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:12,140
The world really would change if the
rest of the country was like Colorado and

5050
02:13:12,141 --> 02:13:12,950
California.

5051
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:15,170
Those are the two places where
you can get weed anywhere.

5052
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:16,910
Did they not shut down
dispensaries in Colorado?

5053
02:13:16,970 --> 02:13:17,760
No.

5054
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:18,593
Only only here.

5055
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:19,240
Yeah,

5056
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:20,510
they shut them down a lot more here.

5057
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:23,180
I'm sure they have shut down
some of them in Colorado,

5058
02:13:23,210 --> 02:13:26,060
we're a lot more of
like on the radar there.

5059
02:13:26,061 --> 02:13:26,480
Atlanta,

5060
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:28,130
they're on the radar and Colorado man,

5061
02:13:28,131 --> 02:13:30,140
there's a lot of people
focal point to us here.

5062
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,890
But the accepted,

5063
02:13:31,891 --> 02:13:32,010
and

5064
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:35,910
I think it's more accepted by the people
in Colorado than it is the people of

5065
02:13:35,911 --> 02:13:36,720
La,

5066
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:37,650
the people of La,

5067
02:13:37,651 --> 02:13:40,290
this little bit of a battle in Portland.

5068
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,670
It was just everywhere.

5069
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:42,623
Oh yeah.

5070
02:13:42,770 --> 02:13:44,340
Cause they're all fucking nature boys too.

5071
02:13:44,341 --> 02:13:45,270
So they'll grow shit.

5072
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:47,550
It's part of the garden we plant too.

5073
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:49,080
There's some likes their own weed.

5074
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:50,010
It's smart,

5075
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:51,810
smart places and smart places.

5076
02:13:51,811 --> 02:13:53,010
Like I'm not pro,

5077
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:56,820
I'm not pro drugs period because
some drugs are fucking terrible.

5078
02:13:56,821 --> 02:13:57,810
I'm not pro pills.

5079
02:13:58,050 --> 02:13:58,861
I'm not pro math.

5080
02:13:58,861 --> 02:13:59,610
I'm not pro that.

5081
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:00,840
But if you're not pro,

5082
02:14:00,841 --> 02:14:03,330
we'd even have to be a
fucking idiot if you,

5083
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:06,090
if you really think that there's
something wrong with it and it's bad for

5084
02:14:06,091 --> 02:14:06,924
society,

5085
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:08,730
you got to be an idiot or you're ignorant.

5086
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,580
You don't understand what's really
going on with it because it was really,

5087
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:13,440
what's really going on is not a bad thing.

5088
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:13,711
It's a,

5089
02:14:13,711 --> 02:14:15,810
it's a humbling thing
that everybody could use.

5090
02:14:15,811 --> 02:14:16,644
A little bit of humbling.

5091
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:17,101
Sure.

5092
02:14:17,101 --> 02:14:19,590
There's going to be some people that
just sit around and smoke pot all day and

5093
02:14:19,591 --> 02:14:20,424
don't get anything done,

5094
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:25,440
but that's a psychological problem that
they have issues that that issue could

5095
02:14:25,441 --> 02:14:29,430
manifest itself that way or it could
manifest itself by them being perpetually

5096
02:14:29,431 --> 02:14:30,900
late or it can manifest.

5097
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:33,060
They could fucking sabotage themselves.

5098
02:14:33,061 --> 02:14:36,990
People have weird issues so they could
sabotage themselves with weed or with

5099
02:14:36,991 --> 02:14:38,580
anything else they choose to do it with.

5100
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:41,310
That doesn't mean that it
can't be used the right way.

5101
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:46,260
Do you think people are burnouts because
of weed or they're just burnout and

5102
02:14:46,261 --> 02:14:47,094
then they would lose?

5103
02:14:47,630 --> 02:14:49,000
I think they are burnouts for weed.

5104
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:50,160
Weed helps it along too.

5105
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:50,401
Well.

5106
02:14:50,401 --> 02:14:52,800
Anything can help you along
if you don't have any resolve,

5107
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:54,710
if you don't have any fucking disaster,

5108
02:14:55,710 --> 02:14:56,011
shit,

5109
02:14:56,011 --> 02:14:56,844
weed.

5110
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:57,751
It's a little bit of that.

5111
02:14:57,751 --> 02:14:57,961
Yeah.

5112
02:14:57,961 --> 02:14:59,040
You smoked that thought of it.

5113
02:14:59,220 --> 02:14:59,830
Yes.

5114
02:14:59,830 --> 02:15:00,663
Come on Dad.

5115
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:01,860
Chronic dog.

5116
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:03,780
Some people that just hasn't
been had some weight loss,

5117
02:15:03,781 --> 02:15:05,100
so that's true too.

5118
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:05,461
Yeah.

5119
02:15:05,461 --> 02:15:07,500
There's some people where every look,

5120
02:15:07,530 --> 02:15:10,070
people get fucking sick
if you get the nuts,

5121
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:11,040
could not get high.

5122
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:11,710
Yeah,

5123
02:15:11,710 --> 02:15:12,543
and then I go,

5124
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:12,931
oh,

5125
02:15:12,931 --> 02:15:13,581
I told you about it.

5126
02:15:13,581 --> 02:15:14,160
Yeah.

5127
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:14,401
Yeah.

5128
02:15:14,401 --> 02:15:15,180
Amazing.

5129
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:15,630
Yeah,

5130
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:18,270
I heard that works with Dmt to the
certain people that just can't,

5131
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:19,530
DMT just doesn't work on them.

5132
02:15:19,531 --> 02:15:20,640
Small percentage of people,

5133
02:15:20,641 --> 02:15:24,440
but every now and then I heard somebody
went to float lab and she was just like,

5134
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:24,611
no,

5135
02:15:24,611 --> 02:15:25,860
that wasn't really hallucinating.

5136
02:15:25,861 --> 02:15:26,694
It was just like,

5137
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:27,540
yeah,

5138
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,290
float lab,

5139
02:15:28,290 --> 02:15:29,790
that's tank or whatever.

5140
02:15:29,791 --> 02:15:30,720
That takes some time.

5141
02:15:30,990 --> 02:15:32,130
The float tank is not a,

5142
02:15:32,131 --> 02:15:33,810
it's not like instant hallucinations.

5143
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:38,850
You got to really get comfortable with
letting go and I'm like you finding like

5144
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:40,020
the center of your thoughts.

5145
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:41,161
That's not an easy,

5146
02:15:41,161 --> 02:15:42,510
it's easy to distract yourself.

5147
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:42,721
I said,

5148
02:15:42,721 --> 02:15:42,950
what's your,

5149
02:15:42,950 --> 02:15:43,800
what would you try to do?

5150
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:45,570
You got to get strong mentally,

5151
02:15:45,571 --> 02:15:47,820
you have to learn how to meditate.

5152
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:49,170
When you get into a float tank,

5153
02:15:49,171 --> 02:15:51,870
it's not as simple as you get in there
and you start tripping because you get in

5154
02:15:51,871 --> 02:15:51,961
there,

5155
02:15:51,961 --> 02:15:52,531
you're still thinking,

5156
02:15:52,531 --> 02:15:52,711
I'm like,

5157
02:15:52,711 --> 02:15:52,891
God,

5158
02:15:52,891 --> 02:15:53,371
I'm floating.

5159
02:15:53,371 --> 02:15:53,551
I'm like,

5160
02:15:53,551 --> 02:15:53,671
God,

5161
02:15:53,671 --> 02:15:54,331
this feels weird.

5162
02:15:54,331 --> 02:15:54,961
Where's the side?

5163
02:15:54,961 --> 02:15:56,130
It's right here on my balls.

5164
02:15:56,131 --> 02:15:56,610
Itch.

5165
02:15:56,610 --> 02:15:58,110
You start thinking a
bunch of different things.

5166
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:00,150
You have to have control of your mind.

5167
02:16:00,151 --> 02:16:02,400
It's not as simple as you
get in the float tank,

5168
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:02,851
boom.

5169
02:16:02,851 --> 02:16:04,050
You have hallucinations.

5170
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:07,440
You have to get in the full tank and
you've got to start that process on your

5171
02:16:07,441 --> 02:16:08,040
own.

5172
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:09,270
You have to center yourself.

5173
02:16:09,271 --> 02:16:10,860
You have to concentrate
only on your breath,

5174
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:13,710
drop everything slowly but surely.

5175
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,440
Remove all the layers of consciousness,

5176
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:20,670
all the layers of letting go until you
get to the center and that's when you

5177
02:16:20,671 --> 02:16:22,310
start having these crazy
visionary experiences.

5178
02:16:22,311 --> 02:16:23,640
That's kind of like a same thing.

5179
02:16:23,641 --> 02:16:24,061
I'm sure mushrooms,

5180
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:25,980
it's like when you were talking to
your friends and laughing and stuff.

5181
02:16:25,981 --> 02:16:26,371
It's fun.

5182
02:16:26,371 --> 02:16:26,610
You know?

5183
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:26,781
Listen,

5184
02:16:26,781 --> 02:16:27,030
I could,

5185
02:16:27,030 --> 02:16:30,040
and then you just stop and
like look up at the and just

5186
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,300
don't talk or listen to anyone.

5187
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:32,830
That's when he started seeing shit.

5188
02:16:32,890 --> 02:16:33,580
Yeah.

5189
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:36,970
It's guy just was telling me the other
day about the same thing that he went and

5190
02:16:36,971 --> 02:16:38,050
he was more of just like,

5191
02:16:38,130 --> 02:16:38,321
all right,

5192
02:16:38,321 --> 02:16:39,880
I'm just bored and you know,

5193
02:16:39,881 --> 02:16:40,850
I'm just laying here.

5194
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,980
This is really stupid.

5195
02:16:42,010 --> 02:16:42,430
Oh really?

5196
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:42,910
Yes.

5197
02:16:42,910 --> 02:16:43,361
Well if he,

5198
02:16:43,361 --> 02:16:44,650
if you don't know how to use it.

5199
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:45,130
Yeah.

5200
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:45,701
Anything else?

5201
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:46,001
You know,

5202
02:16:46,001 --> 02:16:47,890
you have to learn how to relax.

5203
02:16:47,891 --> 02:16:49,780
I don't run your thoughts of all of them.

5204
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:54,940
You for the idea behind the sensory
deprivation tank is that there's no input

5205
02:16:54,941 --> 02:16:57,850
coming in and when there's no input
coming in and you could just sit there and

5206
02:16:57,851 --> 02:16:57,971
go,

5207
02:16:57,971 --> 02:16:58,250
oh,

5208
02:16:58,250 --> 02:16:59,530
socks on board.

5209
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:04,890
Or You could just slowly let go of all
your consciousness to the point where

5210
02:17:05,051 --> 02:17:05,320
you,

5211
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:07,360
you are just your mind.

5212
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:09,190
Untethered from culture,

5213
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:11,770
from any interactive
experience with nature,

5214
02:17:11,771 --> 02:17:12,041
with,

5215
02:17:12,041 --> 02:17:12,970
with gravity,

5216
02:17:12,971 --> 02:17:15,820
with seeing things or hearing
things or touching things.

5217
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,860
You removed from all sensory input.

5218
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:19,030
And when you do that,

5219
02:17:19,031 --> 02:17:22,030
you can have very clear
and intense thoughts.

5220
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:26,140
And you can also have some pretty powerful
hallucinations if you allow yourself

5221
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:28,090
to manifest those ideas.

5222
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:30,190
But you have to learn
how to let go to do that.

5223
02:17:30,191 --> 02:17:31,120
You can't just get in there.

5224
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:32,680
It doesn't just happen right away.

5225
02:17:33,070 --> 02:17:33,270
You know,

5226
02:17:33,270 --> 02:17:34,480
you start thinking about your life,

5227
02:17:34,481 --> 02:17:36,370
you start thinking about
things that you can't avoid.

5228
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:38,420
You start thinking about things
that had been bothering you,

5229
02:17:38,870 --> 02:17:39,760
like about yourself.

5230
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:40,460
Oh,

5231
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:41,230
you know,

5232
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:41,351
well,

5233
02:17:41,351 --> 02:17:41,561
no,

5234
02:17:41,561 --> 02:17:42,394
not necessarily.

5235
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:42,791
I mean,

5236
02:17:42,791 --> 02:17:44,620
it depends on what's
going on in your head,

5237
02:17:44,621 --> 02:17:48,340
but for the most part we just sort of
accentuates experience on a small version

5238
02:17:48,341 --> 02:17:49,570
of this plans.

5239
02:17:49,571 --> 02:17:53,200
Recently I've just taken some
pock cookie or something.

5240
02:17:53,201 --> 02:17:54,840
It's going gonna be a long
flight and just so you know,

5241
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:56,270
I'm not getting anything done here,

5242
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:56,770
but it's not,

5243
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:59,590
but I'm not tired when I've slept and
it's like I like 2:00 PM flight or

5244
02:17:59,591 --> 02:18:02,920
something that I just look out the
window and I just stare out the window.

5245
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:05,170
I'm just let my mind
just go the entire time.

5246
02:18:05,530 --> 02:18:06,363
Yeah.

5247
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:11,560
The only way I get a really get blasted
these days is on planes because when I

5248
02:18:11,561 --> 02:18:13,330
interviewed enough from
the outside can help you,

5249
02:18:13,331 --> 02:18:17,100
like just start like a synapse
going a little bit sure out.

5250
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:20,800
Also it's like the only time I
don't have any responsibilities,

5251
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:23,140
I don't have to take care of my kids.

5252
02:18:23,141 --> 02:18:24,070
I don't have to be,

5253
02:18:24,071 --> 02:18:24,340
you know,

5254
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:25,173
sober.

5255
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:26,440
There's no Wifi in the,

5256
02:18:26,441 --> 02:18:27,071
it's even better.

5257
02:18:27,071 --> 02:18:28,580
It's like I can't do anything.

5258
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:32,020
It's a great way to write to
10 minutes about the per trip.

5259
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:32,651
Well I'll leave it,

5260
02:18:32,651 --> 02:18:35,350
I'll leave it on my lap and just like
if I get a thought that I'm like,

5261
02:18:35,410 --> 02:18:36,580
oh gosh that could work.

5262
02:18:36,581 --> 02:18:37,930
As I quickly write it down,

5263
02:18:37,931 --> 02:18:39,420
I type so much better than I write.

5264
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:40,410
I'm really,

5265
02:18:40,410 --> 02:18:42,730
I've hardly write anything anymore
and I can type pretty quick.

5266
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:45,280
I type really quick now so I have to type.

5267
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,420
But I like it.

5268
02:18:46,421 --> 02:18:46,601
Man.

5269
02:18:46,601 --> 02:18:47,920
I really love writing on playing.

5270
02:18:47,921 --> 02:18:48,850
It's one of my favorite things.

5271
02:18:48,851 --> 02:18:49,980
I write some of my best shit ever.

5272
02:18:49,981 --> 02:18:52,630
I'm plans high as fuck.

5273
02:18:52,631 --> 02:18:55,210
I've really started flying
later that now so I can do that.

5274
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:55,540
Yeah.

5275
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:58,510
Cause it is a good place to just get
away from everything and like get things

5276
02:18:58,511 --> 02:18:58,900
done.

5277
02:18:58,900 --> 02:18:59,410
Yeah.

5278
02:18:59,410 --> 02:18:59,651
Yeah.

5279
02:18:59,651 --> 02:19:01,780
When you're sitting in that seat you
got nowhere to go and you've got that

5280
02:19:01,781 --> 02:19:02,531
laptop open,

5281
02:19:02,531 --> 02:19:04,010
you can get slips or noon.

5282
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:04,590
I'm not,

5283
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:05,290
you know,

5284
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:06,580
and then it's just like now it's,

5285
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:07,180
yeah.

5286
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:07,541
Don't you,

5287
02:19:07,541 --> 02:19:08,920
do you feel now that you're,

5288
02:19:08,921 --> 02:19:11,110
you're having all this success
and things are going well,

5289
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:12,940
you feel like even more motivated.

5290
02:19:12,941 --> 02:19:16,290
Like you're like fucking really hustling
now and really putting in the work to

5291
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:17,890
add more stuff or more,

5292
02:19:18,070 --> 02:19:18,903
isn't it fun?

5293
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:24,070
My next thing I like how like like motion
begets more most yet people or force

5294
02:19:25,301 --> 02:19:25,960
of habit.

5295
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:26,320
Yeah.

5296
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:29,000
I think that's what it is and where
be able to work out all the time.

5297
02:19:29,001 --> 02:19:29,560
It's just like that,

5298
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:31,350
that's your habit and when
you do the Joe all the time,

5299
02:19:31,351 --> 02:19:32,184
then that's your habit.

5300
02:19:32,670 --> 02:19:32,881
Yeah.

5301
02:19:32,881 --> 02:19:36,900
And that's one thing that people have
kept telling me over and over again from

5302
02:19:36,901 --> 02:19:37,681
this podcast.

5303
02:19:37,681 --> 02:19:41,670
One of the things that they pull from it
is that it's changed the way they sort

5304
02:19:41,671 --> 02:19:43,110
of address and approach things.

5305
02:19:43,410 --> 02:19:43,981
And people,

5306
02:19:43,981 --> 02:19:44,251
you know,

5307
02:19:44,251 --> 02:19:46,720
sometimes people just need to hear
something and it's like one things,

5308
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,000
reasons why I love that book.

5309
02:19:48,001 --> 02:19:48,834
The war of art.

5310
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:52,290
I probably understand and I've thought
most of the things in that book on my own

5311
02:19:52,291 --> 02:19:53,040
independently.

5312
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,230
I think a lot of creative people,

5313
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:56,400
it's not that you can't piece it together.

5314
02:19:56,401 --> 02:19:58,080
Sometimes you need to read it again.

5315
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:59,130
You need to see it again.

5316
02:19:59,131 --> 02:20:00,330
You need to be reminded again.

5317
02:20:00,331 --> 02:20:03,540
You need to clear when it's written out
or when you can actually see it or when

5318
02:20:03,541 --> 02:20:04,470
it's spelled out.

5319
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:09,480
When someone say's says it in a way that
resonates with you know how you feel

5320
02:20:09,481 --> 02:20:10,314
about the world.

5321
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:14,820
And I think that's one way that we can
all help each other in a way that no one

5322
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,700
of past generations was able to do.

5323
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:19,920
One of the different things
about this sort of a medium,

5324
02:20:19,921 --> 02:20:20,820
like a podcast,

5325
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:22,380
medium contact with everyone in the world,

5326
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:25,620
quick contact with everyone in the world
and you can express things in a way

5327
02:20:25,621 --> 02:20:28,880
that you really couldn't do if you were
sponsored by Palmolive or fucking the

5328
02:20:28,970 --> 02:20:29,803
trucks.

5329
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:30,241
You know,

5330
02:20:30,241 --> 02:20:32,250
it's like you would have
never gotten all these,

5331
02:20:33,240 --> 02:20:36,120
this information out as clearly
as we're doing it right now.

5332
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:36,790
Yeah.

5333
02:20:36,790 --> 02:20:37,623
Just saying,

5334
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:38,763
yeah.

5335
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:40,150
Strange Times our issue.

5336
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:40,960
Fear,

5337
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:41,341
powerful,

5338
02:20:41,341 --> 02:20:41,670
Arusha,

5339
02:20:41,670 --> 02:20:44,770
fear of the skeptic tank on iTunes.

5340
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:46,300
You dirty,

5341
02:20:46,301 --> 02:20:47,470
dirty bitches.

how he's always had that power.

5348

Well,

5349

Amazing.

Smooth up.

I know your back.

5359
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:18,940
I love me and I'll love you back.

5360
02:21:19,060 --> 02:21:19,601
Number 10.

5361
02:21:19,601 --> 02:21:20,110
Um,

5362
02:21:20,110 --> 02:21:20,740
and uh,

5363
02:21:20,740 --> 02:21:24,670
you just got done doing a fucking return
homecoming gig and the place where you

5364
02:21:24,671 --> 02:21:26,890
started and you can't see conquering hero.

5365
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:27,911
I felt good there,

5366
02:21:27,911 --> 02:21:28,211
if any.

5367
02:21:28,211 --> 02:21:30,490
Did you know how it's like at any level,

5368
02:21:30,491 --> 02:21:31,151
no matter where you are,

5369
02:21:31,151 --> 02:21:34,180
there's certain shows that
are just important to you
and it might not because of

5370
02:21:34,181 --> 02:21:36,760
money or anything you wanted
to let everybody know.

5371
02:21:36,761 --> 02:21:37,710
That's where he started out.

5372
02:21:37,711 --> 02:21:39,310
I had a bunch of friends
from high school came out.

5373
02:21:39,311 --> 02:21:40,210
It was kind of cool.

5374
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:41,650
My aunt came.

5375
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:43,090
That's how awesome.

5376
02:21:43,090 --> 02:21:43,631
It was just like,

5377
02:21:43,631 --> 02:21:44,081
and people are like,

5378
02:21:44,081 --> 02:21:44,231
oh,

5379
02:21:44,231 --> 02:21:45,620
it's like way different than last time.

5380
02:21:45,621 --> 02:21:48,010
I was a fucking wrote into
our fucking professional now.

5381
02:21:48,190 --> 02:21:48,431
Yeah,

5382
02:21:48,431 --> 02:21:49,690
it felt real professional.

5383
02:21:49,810 --> 02:21:50,643
You're legit.

5384
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:52,360
Too legit to quit.

5385
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:53,150
Hey.

5386
02:21:53,150 --> 02:21:53,960
Hey.

5387
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:54,261
Okay.

5388
02:21:54,261 --> 02:21:59,261
This weekend you fucking freaks San

Again.

5412
02:22:39,710 --> 02:22:41,820
Let's see if we can bring that
shit back to number one again.

5413
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:43,320

soon as I get off the phone.

5415

Only one gram of sugar per serving.

5454
02:24:00,211 --> 02:24:00,840
It's not.

5455

We don't even add that.

5456
02:24:01,630 --> 02:24:04,740
That's just what's in the hemp and all
the juicy good shit that we put in it.

5457
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:05,760
All right.

Funky psychedelic kitty cats and no,

5501
02:25:11,581 --> 02:25:12,960

5502
02:25:12,990 --> 02:25:14,220
The fuck are you talking about?

5503
02:25:14,221 --> 02:25:16,710

5508
02:25:24,050 --> 02:25:25,160
way out to white castle.

5509
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:26,860
I'll give it up for
black people in general.

5510
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:28,900
I have given up on the olive garden.

5511
02:25:28,901 --> 02:25:30,760
They do not want me to support them,

5512
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:34,780
but white castle has been supporting
me by giving me a tee shirts,

5513
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:35,913
I think.

5514
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:36,883
I think that,

5515
02:25:37,210 --> 02:25:38,260
believe it or not,

5516
02:25:38,340 --> 02:25:40,190
the olive garden is too
white for Brian Redman.

5517
02:25:40,191 --> 02:25:40,600
Yeah,

5518
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:42,420
they're too wide and Cassie's cooler.

5519
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:44,090
We'll be back tomorrow family,

5520
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:45,940
but it's over with the olive garden.

5521
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:47,830
We love the fucking
shit out of you people,

5522
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:48,700

5523
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:49,600

02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:50,793
We're gonna.

5525
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:51,790
We're gonna roll on.

5526
02:25:52,310 --> 02:25:53,440
We're taking it to the next level.

5527
02:25:53,490 --> 02:25:54,040
I don't even know,

5528
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:55,330
like nothing I've ever,

5529
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:57,100
I fucking love you bitches,

5530
02:25:57,570 --> 02:25:58,403
Huh?

5531
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:11,983
Okay.

5532
02:26:20,860 --> 02:26:21,693
Okay.

5533
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:23,200
Right.
