1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,670
Then let him come
in to this house.

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,930
We're board top papa ladies and
gentleman

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,610
of sourdough.
That's your nickname.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,410
I love that.
I saw that this morning.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,130
Shower.
It's really bad Ass New York Times.

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,940
They mentioned you in the New York
Times,

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,960
the New York time.
I talk about the New York Times.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,130
I'll keep my mouth closed.
The New York Times.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,593
I,
uh,

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,930
I'm now friends with the New York Times
because of your podcast.

11
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,920
And what does he like a,
he's a great guy.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,740
The gray old lady.
Old Lady.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,800
Uh,
so I,

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,430
when I was in New York,
I went with my daughter.

15
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,910
They gave us a tour of the New York
Times.

16
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,130
They invited anytime you want to come
because of the sour dough,

17
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:48,390
because of the sour dough.
It's incredible story.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,540
And because of they saw it on this show.
That's incredible.

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,920
Yeah.
Wow.

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,690
This show brings me riches to this show.
Got An article written in the New York

21
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:02,691
Times about sourdough bread and starters
was absolutely fascinating though.

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,740
And was.
I had no idea.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah,
that's the new world.

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,070
I read an article today in the New York
Times.

25
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,460
It was so disappointing though.
It was some woman wrote an article

26
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:16,461
blaming the Patriarchy on women drinking
too much sexism on women during the.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm like,
is this the fucking New York Times?

28
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:25,641
Like how desperado are they for ratings
or for reading or sourdough starter

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,290
Americans rising pen.
There it is.

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,810
You have a high.
There's a better picture than that

31
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:32,790
though.
I don't remember what it was there.

32
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:37,791
It was
my little starter sitting on my counter.

33
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,930
That's awesome.
I was just stirring it up today.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,440
There's a fucking really disturbing
article that I read in The Washington

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,450
Post this morning.
The news is getting fucking super wacky.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,370
Glenn Greenwald tweeted it.
The Washington Post wrote an article

37
00:01:56,371 --> 00:02:01,371
about this settlement in Israel
settlement that Israel wants to knock

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,910
the settlement in Israel that they want
to bulldoze,

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,420
and they called it a miserable town,
miserable town that Israel wants to

40
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,530
bulldoze this miserable town,
and they're like,

41
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,470
whoa,
whoa,

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,350
whoa.

43
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,240
Who fucking wrote this article?
Like,

44
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,850
how did you.
How'd you like naming the language?

45
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm going to write miserable article.
You're dealing with like dirt poor

46
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:28,830
people that are living in these horrible
conditions and they just decided to go

47
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,660
with that as their title.
Look at this title.

48
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,760
Tell me like,
this is your wants to bulldog.

49
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,400
Oh,
they changed it to ramshackle village.

50
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,400
Oh,
they changed fucks.

51
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,820
But Europe is providing life support.
Wow.

52
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:45,180
They call it was miserable village this
morning.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,080
Ram shackled sounds Kinda cute.
Ramshackled is still.

54
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,550
It's like they're trying.
Yeah.

55
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:51,990
Ramshackle is like,
okay,

56
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,900
if it's white people,
if you're talking about white people

57
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,930
that live in trailer parks,
he's got a ramshackle trailer park,

58
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,140
corncob pipe and he hangs out

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,880
drinks from his jug at night.
He's got a bunch of cars on blocks in

60
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,310
the yard it,
so it's not fancy but assures

61
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,710
ramshackle.
Yeah,

62
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,400
that makes sense.
But this morning it was the,

63
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,280
the title was miserable.
Don't you feel that?

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,330
Uh,
writing and all of journalism,

65
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,830
like it's all leveled out.
Like sometimes you read an article in

66
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:25,540
the Huffington post and they suck you
into like some article and it's written

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,950
by like a high school journalism
student.

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,010
It's just sensational.
It,

69
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,500
it just goes like three paragraphs in
before it even comes out,

70
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,870
like the heading.
It's a.

71
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,110
It had been.
Then you read some stuff from the New

72
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,270
York Times or other places and some of
it,

73
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:47,440
some of it's definitely much smarter,
but some of it is a little opinionated.

74
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,840
Has these little things in it and it's
lazy.

75
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,430
It's so.
It seems like it's because there's such

76
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:51,940
a rush.

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,710
You can't spend as much time on stories.
People get lazy and careless.

78
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,160
While I also think that when people are
at their best,

79
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,140
they write about what they love.
Like if you read a really lazy Article

80
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,070
From The New York Times writer about
something,

81
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,650
yeah,
maybe that guy would write an amazing

82
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:11,530
article about handmade furniture.
You know what I'm saying?

83
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,080
Because maybe he's like into it into
handmade furniture,

84
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,940
but there's a lot of articles that have
people writing.

85
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,560
They're just fucking just trying to get
them done.

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,320
Yeah,
but the problem is that a lot of that's

87
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,480
in the news.
It's not,

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,190
you know,
but don't you feel that way about the

89
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,024
new.
Sometimes like,

90
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,710
enough,
I just,

91
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,200
I can't do this anymore.
You need to digest the news.

92
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,580
Yeah,
forget it.

93
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,180
Yeah.
That's one of my crusades for real.

94
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,180
I have a thing.
I get the newspaper in the morning

95
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,400
because I want to spend maybe 20
minutes,

96
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,880
maybe a half hour,
looking at some news stories and then

97
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,480
that's it.

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,040
That's all Tom Papa needs to know about
the world's events because I can't do

99
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,970
anything about it and if I just check in
another half hour check in another half,

100
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,870
a 24 hours of that day's gone and you
feel sick,

101
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,400
you're paranoid,
you're sick,

102
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,890
you're upset.
I turn the news off.

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,670
It's a barrage and I need to talk to the
fucking New York time about what

104
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,540
constitutes breaking news.
Listen New York Times just because

105
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:12,160
Anthony Wiener got busted sexting again.
That's not fucking breaking news.

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,500
It's pretty great story though.
It's a good story,

107
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,460
but it's not the New York Times the
saying this is war.

108
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,840
Yeah,
war is breaking,

109
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,740
right?
Earthquake,

110
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,560
breaking news,
breaking news stories.

111
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,540
The other shit is just a story.
Yeah,

112
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,360
breaking,
but it's not super critical.

113
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,253
It,
it's.

114
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,540
But you know,
you have to keep feeding the beast 24

115
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,020
hours a day and they got to keep you in
so they have to make it urgent.

116
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,050
They have to
watch this video on sexual desire for

117
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,340
content.
Sock away.

118
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,640
I've heard the earth is flat
content and how they gonna make you pay

119
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,280
attention to the content by scaring the
shit out of you,

120
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,740
scaring the shit out of you or making
you angry or writing something

121
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,370
ridiculous

122
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,390
like sexism is why women like to drink.
That is ridiculous.

123
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,600
Are you sure?
That was a near 100 percent.

124
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,070
One hundred percent find it.
Jamie.

125
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,910
Jamie's on it.
Because I was at the New York Times

126
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:14,120
building because of the sourdough
article and I saw no such thing.

127
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,890
It was pretty cool to watch.
I mean it was cool to like be inside the

128
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,240
New York Times.
Well this was my point about Huffington

129
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,460
post when you were saying that it's like
it's written by a high school kid.

130
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,390
It could easily have been like there's a
lot of contributors to the Huffington

131
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,650
Post.
A Lot,

132
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,200
a lot of contributors to a lot of these
online news sources.

133
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,330
Yeah.
How Wall Street pros talk,

134
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,980
talk women down.
That's on it now.

135
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,110
It was out today.
It's about sexism and drinking sexism

136
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:45,221
and drinking a that the patriarchy makes
women drink.

137
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,490
It was like the pressure of dealing with
sexism all day.

138
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,320
It makes women drink.
That is.

139
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,600
It's so unbelievably ridiculous.
But for anybody who hates those

140
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,350
arguments and it's beautiful because
it's so stupid that it's like self

141
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,220
parody.
It's like,

142
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,510
it's so dumb.
Oh really?

143
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,210
That's what makes you drink because
everybody who doesn't drink,

144
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,020
how come it doesn't work on them?
It's almost like that headline is to a

145
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,810
level of this will piss them off.
Yes,

146
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,060
exactly.
And here we are talking about it.

147
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,320
Yeah.
So she might be right.

148
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,461
You know,
I mean,

149
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,600
yeah,
definitely.

150
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:21,200
Women must face sexism because a lot of
men are sexist for sure,

151
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,020
but many pegs you have to work with a
guy for eight hours a day for five

152
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,930
years.
If he's not gonna try to fuck you.

153
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,650
He's going to be thinking about fucking
you all the time and he's definitely

154
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,230
gonna play like little games.
Yeah.

155
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,180
See how far he can go to say,
see what you say when he says this.

156
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,060
Look,
we work with guys when they are

157
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:48,080
completely free when we're alone with a
guy like when you're in school or

158
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,810
whatever and working with people,
you know,

159
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,680
you get jobs with these men,
you know,

160
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,870
and when we're alone with them,
the shit is sad.

161
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,491
I mean,
right.

162
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:02,780
I mean it's filtered is brutal about
everyone in the office about their

163
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,360
wives.
They're pulling out their parts.

164
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,640
It's not the same story.
This is the opposite of that.

165
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,310
Says sexism isn't driving women to
drink.

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,370
I found something.
I'm not seeing something from the times

167
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:14,480
though.
Okay,

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,190
I'll send it to you.
I'll find it here.

169
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,970
But the,
it doesn't matter.

170
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,650
You don't even need to look at it.
It's just an article.

171
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,690
But you know what I mean?
Men are such pigs,

172
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,960
pigs.
You can be in an office with another guy

173
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,060
and you know,
the coast is clear the stuff.

174
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,680
So for him to look at each other and go,
you know,

175
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,450
this never leaves this room.
Right,

176
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,220
and that would be it.
I would do to her

177
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,870
conversations and then they walk out
among all the people and they that they

178
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,390
can keep it together.
Like knowing what we know that they can

179
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:51,230
keep it together when they're mixed with
everybody else is kind of astounding.

180
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,590
I've,
I feel like the more likely a man is to

181
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,640
wear loafers with those tassels,

182
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,600
the more likely has to have these deep
dark visions fantasies.

183
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,760
I'm sadly,
you get out of him if you just get a

184
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:09,180
couple of cocktails in him yet because
he's probably pretty wealthy,

185
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,540
probably makes a good living and
probably is been married to the same

186
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:20,121
woman for quite a long time as children.
Probably has some sort of religious

187
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,780
affiliation.
Yeah,

188
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,810
most likely you're in
deep desires

189
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,770
if you're living or working well,
if you're working with that guy,

190
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:36,600
it's almost crazier than living with
them.

191
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,270
You think about it like if you,
if your wife works all day,

192
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,310
so if you work all day,
your wife works all day,

193
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,520
you're not seeing each other for nine
hours out of the day,

194
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,380
right?
Travel time.

195
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,940
If you're.
If you're super lucky,

196
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,910
then you come home.
How long are you awake for?

197
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,890
Three hours.
Four hours at the most.

198
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,640
Three hours.
How much is this really good time with

199
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,080
exactly how much time is like,
stop fighting.

200
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,670
Don't do that.
That's not yours.

201
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:02,971
No,
no,

202
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:04,080
no.
Yours looks like that,

203
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,040
but yours is different.
This is being.

204
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,980
That's the reality is if your wife works
with some fucking creepy dude,

205
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,290
that creepy dude sees her more than you
do.

206
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,850
Yeah,
and I think work environments are very

207
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,370
strange for human beings.
Not saying that we shouldn't engage in

208
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,440
them,
but what I'm saying is that being in a

209
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:24,930
traditional work environment where
you're working your way up the corporate

210
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,490
ladder,
so everybody's full of Shit.

211
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,360
Everybody is at certain point in time
saying the thing that's the right thing

212
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,150
to say for their career versus what they
really feel about things.

213
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,130
Oh yeah.
It was probably not a lot of room for

214
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,800
opinion.
A lot of it is about the company and how

215
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:40,110
important that company is.
And then fucking,

216
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,930
if you're lucky,
you get to like crack a joke by the

217
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:44,040
water cooler,
right?

218
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,770
That's like your little freedom of the
day or maybe they'll let you dress your

219
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,810
cubicle up.
You could have like a little fucking

220
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,130
star wars guy in the cubicle.

221
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,520
Joe's a wild man.
Show them your socks.

222
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,630
Look at the death star my cubicle.
I'm a big star wars fan.

223
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,700
I can't wait for the next step.
So he's the guy.

224
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,680
When you,
when people come up to go,

225
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,270
oh,
there's a guy in my office.

226
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,610
He is so funny.
Yeah,

227
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:06,650
it's star wars.
It's like that.

228
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:10,100
Thoreau quote.
Most men live lives of silent

229
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,660
desperation.
I'm sure.

230
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,730
Most women too.
I think most humans,

231
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,680
there's a lot a lot of doing shit.
You don't want to do what?

232
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,840
You know,
what I find though,

233
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,680
like people who are in those jobs,
you know,

234
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,680
and they get pretty high up and they
were creative people.

235
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:26,330
Whatever.
They don't,

236
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:29,270
um,
they don't question things as much as we

237
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,670
do that,
can't you?

238
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,670
You.
Yeah,

239
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,680
but I think that's why they're able to
get into it.

240
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:35,600
Also.
I don't think their heads are.

241
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,100
I wonder if you know,
if that's what causes it or if that's

242
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:43,790
like a mindset that one sort of like
boxes themselves into it.

243
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,180
An early age.
It's probably a little of both,

244
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,190
but I definitely have a couple of
friends who are just fun guys.

245
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,070
They work,
they've been in corporations

246
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,010
their whole careers and they just don't
question it.

247
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,690
There's never a part of them that's
like,

248
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,850
that's ever thought,
oh,

249
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,890
what am I doing?
It just got out of school and said,

250
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,270
let's go.
We're going to go do this and then you

251
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,780
go watch the rangers and it'll be fine
and they don't think about it.

252
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:11,080
And he was always that way.
Like he just kind of slid in and it's

253
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:14,410
almost like ignorance is bliss in those
situations.

254
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,110
Those guys generally like to drink.
Yeah,

255
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,750
that's a big one because the drinking is
the best way to say who gives a fuck at

256
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,730
the end of the day when you're done with
your work,

257
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,450
you have a couple of pops with the boys
and all of a sudden you're laughing.

258
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,140
Who gives a shit about the stock
profile?

259
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,240
Yeah.
Who gives a shit about the lawn?

260
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,270
He gives a shit.
I would be in that environment like,

261
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,430
oh my God,
he's acting like a dick to me.

262
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,000
What is he trying to do and why do they
hate me so much?

263
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,680
Those guys are just like,
screw him,

264
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,860
he's an asshole.
And then he'd go and go and get to work

265
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:45,880
with a guy.
Right,

266
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:49,330
exactly.
What are they going to do that's done?

267
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,710
That's one of the things that separates
alcohol from marijuana.

268
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:58,711
Like that's like the dividing line
between how it makes you look at things

269
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:02,980
in your life that aren't desirable.
It changes them like really radically

270
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,940
because alcohol way God gives a fuck,
but marijuana will go,

271
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:09,370
dude,
you gotta do something about this.

272
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,000
This is fucking with your head all the
time and you know what's fucking with

273
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,070
your head.
It's in the background of everything you

274
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:15,540
do.
It's.

275
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,530
It's constantly looming over you,
shadowing you like a backhand ready to

276
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,430
do.
This is why you don't read philosophy.

277
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,640
You're just opening up,
opening up and there's no way to solve

278
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,000
it.

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,730
It's the pot God damn pot.
That's why it's illegal.

280
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,260
It would ruin this fucking society.
It would ruin the fiber of society,

281
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,720
would stop all these jobs.
I would hope in that pot legalization

282
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,160
coincides with excellent new robots to
conduce shitty jobs,

283
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,510
so it all flows together the way you do
with all those people that are now

284
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,260
running through the streets.
Oh good.

285
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,700
Let the robots killing the robot's gonna
eat them.

286
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,380
They're going to use them as fuel.
You see the Matrix,

287
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,510
each robot that kills most people,
whereas it's face going to have a Taco

288
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,060
Bell Fan club and whoever shows up,
those are the first people to get eaten.

289
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,380
You know,
like things like that.

290
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:10,381
They'll take like really obvious robot
traps like donor parks.

291
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,190
No,
but this is your kids.

292
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm talking about fully grown adults.
There's got to be some real traps.

293
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,150
You got to take care of robots,
just eat people.

294
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,090
You have to look at them.
Over here.

295
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,110
There's a few rogue robots like there's,
you know,

296
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:27,580
viruses that computers catch a few rogue
robots found out they can eat people and

297
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:30,400
they just go off and eat people,
but they're very ethical about it.

298
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:32,200
They,
they eat the dumbest fucking people they

299
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,810
could find.
It's like a crocodile doesn't go after

300
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:37,930
the fastest gazelle.
It goes by that wounded motherfucker

301
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,230
lips up to the waterhole and just gets
jacked.

302
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,050
Wounded.
Old One can hear anything anymore.

303
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,460
It's got one gray.
I see everybody running.

304
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,980
The crocodile gets and so much like much
like the crocodile,

305
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:56,570
the robots that eat people will become
like the natural predators.

306
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:59,450
The weeders.
It's great of the week just walking

307
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,440
there.
They're no,

308
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,040
they're no better than just gang up and
attack a city because we just make it

309
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,650
rain on him or something and they're all
rusty.

310
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,240
Explode or something.
They will shoot them.

311
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,680
We have,
we have guns.

312
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,080
We know they're coming.
We can keep an eye on them,

313
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,310
but if they can just talk really fucking
stupid people into traps and then just

314
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,670
eat them and do our bidding.
Like a Taco Bell Fan club.

315
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,730
Are you a fan of Taco Bell?
We are to come celebrate Taco Bell Fan

316
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,500
night and you go there.
Come on town.

317
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,200
It's not even free food.
I just give away like Taco bell tee

318
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:34,250
shirts and hats and shit and people are
fucking socked about Taco bell broad.

319
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,740
Our three choices on my corner got
birthed here and got Wendy's.

320
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,380
I always go to Taco Bell,
Taco Bell's my shit.

321
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,500
Look at this free tee shirts.
They're the best to the burst that the

322
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,690
quality of their ingredients is
unprecedented.

323
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,150
They get me,
man.

324
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,960
We'll get fucking seriously into like it
would be ridiculous to get that way

325
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,910
about Taco Bell,
but it's not ridiculous to get that way

326
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:53,744
over apple.

327
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,910
Right.
Do you want me to put fucking people?

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,800
When I was working on news radio,
that was like during the days before

329
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:04,190
Osx,
so this was like the days of like

330
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:09,191
windows 95 and the operating system for
Mac was all like it wasn't that good and

331
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:15,140
the way I've seen it be described like
the interface is really cool,

332
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,760
like the way you use it was very simple
and easy to remember and a lot of

333
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:22,490
creative type people like to use it for
a bunch of different reasons,

334
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:27,491
but there was no memory protection.
There was no preemptive multitasking.

335
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,430
It was like a clunky operating system
for like high end users.

336
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,980
Like they didn't code video games on
them.

337
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,270
People that really needed them.
And obviously this I'm regurgitating

338
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,310
regurgitating because I don't know shit
about computers so what I've read,

339
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,230
I'm blaming it.
These people that I was working with on

340
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:48,950
news radio,
we're fucking radical Mac fanatics.

341
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,700
They were radical and like the news will
come out when we're going to get them

342
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,000
with this new operating system,
this new operating system,

343
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,670
spending less sex was coming out.
I was like,

344
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,300
go,
we're going to get them with sex

345
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,490
was actually pre Osx I believe.
I want to say Osx came out in the early

346
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,590
two thousands.
What was before that?

347
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,660
Shit.
It's terrible.

348
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,660
Yeah,
I used to.

349
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,430
Yeah,
well I used to use it too because I

350
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,600
remember there was no viruses for it,
like no one had figured out how to make

351
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:21,500
a virus for macs yet.
There was a ton of them for pcs and I

352
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:25,200
caught one once I caught one a codified
bro.

353
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,130
Dude,
somebody sent me a Microsoft word.

354
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,270
I'm a package of a script or something
like that and I read it.

355
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:37,460
It had a virus in it and then I sent
something to friend of mine and it had

356
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:38,150
the virus in it.

357
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,640
It had connected to all my Microsoft
word documents.

358
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,310
So.
But my friend was like a super genius

359
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,061
tech guy.
He's like,

360
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:44,894
Hey,
fuck face.

361
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,000
He's sent me a virus.
You stupid cunt.

362
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,000
Right.
He scans all his email.

363
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:54,720
He's like super paranoid.
So he scanned to shit and was like,

364
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,300
yeah,
same,

365
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,560
the same working bro.
I'm disseminating fibers,

366
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:02,470
but yeah,
my had to bring my daughters in to a

367
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,320
apple because someone hacked all the
browsers and just couldn't do anything

368
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,320
and he went in there.
This guy,

369
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,640
the browsers,
what they do.

370
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,110
Yeah.
They hacked the browsers,

371
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:17,670
put a a malware called malware.
You get there from porn sites.

372
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,420
I hope not.
It's my daughter's 14.

373
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,350
Probably porn sites.

374
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,790
Probably only gay
dudes fucking each other.

375
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,170
If I was a girl,
I'd want to know what are they doing

376
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,310
over there and do I like it,
you know,

377
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:42,900
because like guys have guys stumbled
across a video of two girls fingering

378
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:45,120
each other while making out like real
softly.

379
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,510
Like we get very excited about it.
Like,

380
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,353
Whoa,
Whoa,

381
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,740
whoa.
You know,

382
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:53,010
like you feel like you've stumbled
across something but you stumble across

383
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:55,080
to dude motherfucker and you're watching
a crime

384
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,590
watching a violent encounter.
Even if they love each other,

385
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,060
we love each other.
They just probably say,

386
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:03,871
look,
I love you.

387
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,000
You love me,
but we're going to do some dirty shit to

388
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:11,001
each other for the
next whatever minutes takes it's gonna.

389
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,130
Get ugly up at this bitch.
Well,

390
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,920
the guy at the genius part did not seem
to think that's what my daughter was

391
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:17,754
watching.

392
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,920
He said probably spotify or
spotify,

393
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,750
spotify,
and they're gay porn obsession,

394
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,250
but he just went in and ripped it all
out.

395
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,980
He was just like,
went in a couple of files like malware.

396
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:32,814
Yeah.
Look,

397
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,260
look out,
look out there directing you.

398
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,850
Look where they put this stuff in your
extensions.

399
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,300
You ain't got it all out.
Fucking geniuses.

400
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,430
Well,
that's a real genius at the genius bar.

401
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,380
He was.
He was pretty good because that's a

402
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,600
pretentious title.
Genius Bar.

403
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,850
I work at the genius bar at Apple.
Trust me,

404
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,440
I'm right.
There was this flat.

405
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,180
Stop it
here.

406
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,840
It's not flat.
Not Anymore routing itself out over the

407
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,840
years it's gained weight like all of us.
Um,

408
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,470
what we're talking about.
Oh,

409
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,430
so this a malware thing.
They don't know where she got it from,

410
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,230
but they could just pull it out.
Yeah.

411
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,230
They just go in and Kinda Kinda tore it
all out.

412
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,210
They didn't have to re,
uh,

413
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:18,270
installing the operating system or
reformat the hard drive now.

414
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,500
Nope.
It's all good.

415
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,633
One.
If it's.

416
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,460
Hmm.
I wonder if it shows up in like time,

417
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,290
machine time,
machine backups.

418
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,920
I wonder if time machine backups have
malware in them.

419
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
Uh,
no.

420
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
I don't think so.
No.

421
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,690
No.
They just backup critical.

422
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,790
Yeah.
And then it's another backup.

423
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,550
But if the files are infected,
I mean there's gotta be a way like how

424
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:40,860
does windows do it?
Do you know how windows does their,

425
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,660
their backups?
No idea.

426
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,970
Is it something that never used on the
operating system?

427
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,320
Everybody looks like.
I'm asking do you want to do Morse code?

428
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,490
Smoke signals?
No.

429
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,600
Windows.
It looks great to me.

430
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,260
I'm so confused and I know I'm an idiot.
Okay.

431
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,170
Don't get me wrong.
But um,

432
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,930
I went to the store the other day
because a,

433
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,920
I'm buying a TV.
I wanted to look at the newest tvs which

434
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:07,180
are fucking suit with the curve.
The curve.

435
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,890
That's a gimmick.
It's gonna go away.

436
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,270
Trust me.
The new ones.

437
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,550
The PTI.
Oh,

438
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:13,560
the forecast?
Yeah.

439
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,040
Good Lord.
They look good.

440
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,821
Do they?
Yeah.

441
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:20,380
Well they get you at the store first of
all because what they're showing you is

442
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:23,290
a loop.
And that loop is like super hard

443
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,710
definition stuff.
It's all leopards and shit and fucking

444
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,350
perfect snakes and flowers and
waterfalls.

445
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:34,351
You're like fuck amazing music to stare
at it all day to look at this all day.

446
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,060
But if you went home and watched like
fucking game of thrones on it,

447
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:39,100
it's not going to look that good.

448
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,200
Game of thrones is not filmed like that.
It's not filmed in that super four k.

449
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,530
yeah.
What is very few things on Netflix is

450
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:50,860
doing their specials in it though.
They are my new netflix specials in four

451
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:52,630
k.
You can see how shitty I look in real

452
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:53,240
life.
Yeah.

453
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,840
It's a little too real,
real deep,

454
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:01,390
slow deterioration of the aging process.
He has a lot of motherfuckers getting

455
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,290
skin on his face is sort of loose.
See how it's like it's there,

456
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:10,110
but it's not.
It's not like cleaning on this is like

457
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,320
this.
You don't go like from here to like uh,

458
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,000
like Ted Kennedy.
It's not Ted Kennedy.

459
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,580
Before he died,
he had a basset hound.

460
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,730
You don't go from this men manly
chiseled face to that.

461
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,950
Will you?
Do you go from this to what I got going

462
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:29,550
on right now?
We just a little too much elasticity.

463
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,890
Little loose,
not tight enough.

464
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,630
Now I want to say elasticy.
Yeah,

465
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:36,380
because the last test would allow to
snap back.

466
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,510
It's a little too little elasticity.
It's just getting kind of late and

467
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:44,870
fluffy anymore college into my diet.
It's kind of fallen off your face and

468
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,240
there's no way to stop it.
There is apparently no,

469
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,290
it's not.
Apparently the same doctor who invented

470
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:54,310
Regena King,
which is a process that I used to deal

471
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:57,820
with a bulging disc,
so they take your blood out and it's

472
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:02,200
kinda like platelet rich plasma in a way
except the heat it up and by heating up

473
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:05,800
your blood,
your blood produces a response to the

474
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,940
heat and it creates this yellow serum
and his yellow serum.

475
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,390
They spin in a centrifuge and then
extract that yellow car and it's one of

476
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,660
the most potent anti inflammatory
medicines ever discovered.

477
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:21,810
Scott discovered he discovered a lot of
inventions ever discovered in your body.

478
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,900
Doesn't reject it because it's your own
blood and it has a great effect on

479
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:30,070
people with like inflammation injuries
and helping healing times would it do

480
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:32,590
for you.
You had the disrobe bulging from

481
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,420
repeated use from Jujitsu,
from just too much sparring and not

482
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:41,350
enough time off and getting injured and
not taking enough time off in between

483
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:44,860
the injury and getting right back into
Jujitsu is really fun.

484
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,000
It's really fun.
It's like a video game like that kind of

485
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,950
fun or like I like to play pool.
It's,

486
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,330
it's,
but it's way more exciting than that and

487
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,550
the only way you could do it,
you gotta do it with your body.

488
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,790
So it's like you have this game piece
that you're playing with and his game

489
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,340
piece get banged up all the time.
It's an old controller.

490
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,660
Yeah.
And so,

491
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,000
uh,
I was developing some back issues from

492
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:10,001
numb fingers and usually those indicate
that your disc is pushing against the

493
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,710
nerve so it means a disc is bulging out.

494
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,010
So then I went through a bunch of things
with spinal decompression

495
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,630
and Regena keen was a big part of that.
So this guy who developed Regena King,

496
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,960
all these athletes like Peyton Manning,
coby Bryant,

497
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:29,210
they all flew to Germany to get this
procedure and then slowly they brought

498
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:32,900
it up to the United States and now they
do it in California.

499
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,710
Um,
and they do it in Santa Monica is where

500
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:39,080
I had it done,
but I think they'd do it also in Dallas

501
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:41,420
and they do it a couple other places
maybe in Las Vegas,

502
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,590
the same doctor who came up with this
procedure has some new procedure that

503
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:49,880
they're preparing to release which is
going to kickstart to production of

504
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,480
Collagen and people.
And that is the thing that makes your

505
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:55,880
skin look like shit.
That's the thing that makes your face

506
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:59,840
sag and your wrinkles appear and your
body just looks like an old bag what

507
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:00,950
your college and goes away.

508
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,880
Exactly.
You're stuffing in your face basically.

509
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,500
You're more,
she's stuffing Collagen is responsible

510
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,780
for a lot of the elasticity of your
skin.

511
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,060
It's responsible for a lot of other
things as well.

512
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,650
But the elasticity of your skin is
apparently a lot of it's based on your

513
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:23,651
body's healthy production of Collagen.
So we're losing it now and we're getting

514
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,080
just a little loose.
We'll loosen up this hill,

515
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,640
right?
Thermitight.

516
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,710
What is this injectable?
What is this?

517
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,603
What is this,
Jeremy?

518
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,220
This is what?
College and injection.

519
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,170
Yeah.
It looks like just a little video of it.

520
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,750
Oh,
this.

521
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,420
This looks like they're tightening you
now.

522
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:39,410
That's a college,
right?

523
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:43,010
People get college and just injected
into college and injected.

524
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,230
How long does that last?
I don't know.

525
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,790
This is all new stuff that has been
taught to me by people who have gone

526
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:52,940
over to Germany and talked to this guy
and had procedures done by this guy.

527
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,370
And uh,
did it help your spine?

528
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,320
Like a huge.
It did a big difference.

529
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,461
Big,
big difference.

530
00:25:58,461 --> 00:25:59,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

531
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,090
Big Difference in relief.
Big Difference in recovery time.

532
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,030
I did a bunch of different things.
I was pretty proactive about it.

533
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,910
The spinal decompression.
I did a lot of Rolfing,

534
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:11,980
which is super painful.
Torturous method of massage where

535
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:14,480
they're like,
they're manipulating your limbs and

536
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,990
digging their elbows and you're back in
the fucking.

537
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,150
The guys did.
It was this football player dude.

538
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:20,630
He was huge.
Big,

539
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:23,510
giant dude.
And just beat me up.

540
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,060
It was rough.
There's nothing worse than when you get

541
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:28,150
a massage and it's just like this little
girl hands,

542
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,400
just like,
I hate that I'm used to the painful

543
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:32,690
ones,
but those are the ones,

544
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,000
the painful ones,
the ones that like break up the tissue

545
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,220
and allow it all to relax and heal
better.

546
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,640
And that helped a lot.
The decompression helped a lot.

547
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,380
That was a big.
So are you able to tell how much this

548
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:44,680
process help?
Oh yeah,

549
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,710
yeah,
yeah.

550
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,770
Well I don't know how much that process
helped overall because I did them all

551
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:50,670
together.
Right.

552
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,170
But everything together worked awesome
sounding.

553
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,250
I don't have a bulge at all anymore,
which is really important to talk about

554
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:59,760
because there's a lot of people to get
bulging discs and they immediately want

555
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:02,550
to go get surgery.
And in some cases that's the right move.

556
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,190
In some cases like Eddie Bravo,
my,

557
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,410
a good friend of mine had a discreet
place on his back and uh,

558
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,730
Eddie is a longtime Jujitsu guy and his
disc,

559
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:15,570
it's been squashed and deteriorated so
much that it was essentially like bone

560
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:18,510
on bone was lower back,
constant state of inflammation,

561
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,770
inflammation.
So in that case the doctors decided it

562
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:27,540
was a very smart move to replace the
disk with these new titanium disks that

563
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:27,900
they have.

564
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,080
They have some pretty cool artificial
discs,

565
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,670
but there's other specialties.
His was really bad for a long period of

566
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,590
time,
but there's other injuries where you

567
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:39,820
could mitigate all the issues without
surgery.

568
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:42,390
It's just going to take a little time
just like it took time to create the

569
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:44,220
injury.
It's going to take time to heal it.

570
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,920
Right.
And spinal decompressions big.

571
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:48,960
Like even those things we hang by your
ankles.

572
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,440
Just doing that a little bit every day
is really good for pain,

573
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,600
really good for relief of your lower
back.

574
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,820
There is also the other ones you could
do with your neck.

575
00:27:56,821 --> 00:28:00,450
I have one that's like a harness as
straps to my neck and it hangs from a

576
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,550
door.
Oh yeah.

577
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,060
Yeah.
And then you can actually pull.

578
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,830
It stretches your neck out and they're
like.

579
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,020
You could feel it like relaxing your
neck.

580
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,070
It's attached to the door.

581
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,680
Yeah,
it's actually the thing for your head.

582
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,170
Yeah.
It's like this metal bracket that clamps

583
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:16,230
down on the top of the door and then it
has like this arm that comes off of it

584
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:20,300
and then a rope comes down from the arm
which is attached to this velcro like

585
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,250
face thing.
Put it on your velcroed in place so it's

586
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:24,850
tight,
and then he pulled on the string.

587
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:25,441
It's like click,
click,

588
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:25,861
click,
click,

589
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:29,850
click,
and it's just like a poll on your neck

590
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,160
and could use that right now.
That's great man.

591
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,660
I'm not lying.
That's it right there.

592
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,680
That's what it looks like.
Oh,

593
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:39,681
you look cool too.
And it looks like a diaper was like

594
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,220
pulling that thing.
I can like feel the relaxation and if

595
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:47,940
you do it on a regular basis it really
does offer you some nice relief.

596
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,740
Again,
no affiliation with any of these

597
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:50,450
companies.

598
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,270
You can just some things I used
instilled,

599
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,240
you can put it in the door jamb and not
have it land on your head is your hand.

600
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,930
Yeah,
you gotta be careful because one time it

601
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,880
didn't fucking Ding me in the head.
It did.

602
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:00,870
Yeah.
I was an asshole.

603
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:01,980
I didn't tighten it down.
Right.

604
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,240
And that's what I be worried and when it
came down it,

605
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,050
it fucking in the forehead and left this
big cut and I was doing all this press

606
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,080
for a spike spike tv because it was at
the same time where I was doing or Scifi

607
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,330
rather because it was the same time I
was doing a Joe Rogan questions.

608
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:21,480
Everything is TV show.
So all the pressure I did with a divot

609
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,020
in my head like this,
but for spike it probably helped.

610
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,060
It was Saifai helper,
Psi Phi.

611
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,430
But anyway,
um,

612
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,700
those things were all really good.
I was just,

613
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,440
something happened just in the last two
days,

614
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,930
sleeping and woke up.
It can happen.

615
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,390
Just Yoga.
I Love Yoga.

616
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:40,350
Yoga is the thing,
man,

617
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,070
hot yoga.
That fucking clears

618
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,560
all that up.
I don't the strength in who knows how to

619
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:45,394
do it.
You've got to be.

620
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,220
I like this.
The regular yoga where I'm sweating like

621
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:52,370
a pig over hot yoga just opens you up
baby.

622
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,910
Just the extra little millimeter of
stretch.

623
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:56,190
You get out of it all.
No,

624
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,610
it's too hot too.
Yeah,

625
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,950
but it's also mental toughness to get a
build mental toughness.

626
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,940
Ninety minutes net class tough enough,
or you are at.

627
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,510
What do I need it for?
I don't know.

628
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,150
Tough.
Do I have to say I just got to pick my

629
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:09,850
kids up and these are all rhetorical
questions not to drink.

630
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,390
Sexism is causing you to drink.
I've been meaning to talk to you.

631
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,460
Really.
I mean,

632
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:21,910
look,
we all know that men are awful and we

633
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:24,130
attack and do horrible things and we've
been.

634
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,760
You've yelled at us now and we're
dealing with it now.

635
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:29,830
Back off.
We know there's a problem.

636
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:32,510
We're working on it.
The right art is 12.

637
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,530
Okay.
Is it okay to only want to work with

638
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:39,240
men?
So say if you start a company,

639
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,930
at what size can the company be before
you've got to start hiring women?

640
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,780
Like right now,
Joe Rogan experience enterprises,

641
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,400
very small company.
There's only a couple employees and they

642
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:52,620
happened to be male.
Now one of the more higher.

643
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,400
What if we keep going with eventually I
hire 50 people.

644
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,600
Who is anybody gonna say,
why do you have 50 dudes?

645
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,113
How come?

646
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,560
Because you're.
You're,

647
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,310
you're not meeting the quota.

648
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,380
Is that really the case?
Or is it that these are the people that

649
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:09,860
I want and I just happened to find out
they're all men.

650
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,800
You have to at a certain data now you
have to hire and meet these numbers.

651
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,160
What number is probably probably like 40
percent of your staff?

652
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,191
No,
no,

653
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:22,480
no.
I mean at what number does,

654
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,440
you're like,
I can do it.

655
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,120
Get Away with it.
With two people I think.

656
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,160
Yeah.
I think if you bring in one more person,

657
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,870
really it's going to be a problem.
Yeah.

658
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,030
It's.
If I bring in one girl,

659
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:33,310
it's going to be a problem.
Going to hear some of the shit.

660
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:35,200
Jamie says the mics off,
she's going to go,

661
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,660
what the fuck?
She's going to be quietly building a

662
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,760
case against Jesus Christ.
Dude,

663
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:41,140
that does happen,
man.

664
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,003
Yeah,
look at.

665
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,270
Look at Anthony Wiener.

666
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,680
Well,
that's a different.

667
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,820
That's a different case,
but I know this girl who worked with

668
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:52,330
this guy.
This is actually the sister of a good

669
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:54,100
friend of mine.
Why am I giving you all the details?

670
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:56,200
You're going to know who it is.
Anyway,

671
00:31:56,201 --> 00:32:00,310
she worked with this guy for years.
Writing down anytime he said anything

672
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:03,820
inappropriate and building a file,
but all total.

673
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I mean all clearly her,
her word against his that he said all

674
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,680
these things,
but she made this file of all the

675
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:15,430
inappropriate things that he had said at
picnics included everywhere.

676
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,930
Company picnics.
She wrote a bunch of things down and

677
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,420
she's thinking about suing the company.
They are going to burry you.

678
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,500
Are you out of your fucking mind?
My God.

679
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,630
Like what?
What w?

680
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,790
What were these things?
Unless they were like really fucked up.

681
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,950
But that's the.
The thing

682
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,330
about the corporate or like white
working in a corporation would be so

683
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:35,850
bizarre.
He thinking that he has a good

684
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:37,150
relationship with her.
They're like,

685
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,980
she's probably doesn't not dislike

686
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,000
him,
like,

687
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,210
you know what I mean?
Like there's this play acting that

688
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,790
they're doing all the time.
No one's really being honest ever,

689
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,600
but there's also the real possibility
that you could make some money if you

690
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,160
sue them.
Yeah.

691
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,480
Like that kids grow up today and knowing
about like,

692
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:57,920
here's a,
here's the lawsuit example.

693
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,120
That's insane.
There was a woman who was a single

694
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:03,590
woman,
a single mom,

695
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,540
and she had this kid and she brought the
kid over my house and the kids stayed

696
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:12,080
over my house for a long ass time.
Like she was supposed to pick the kid up

697
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:14,150
at four and then she didn't show up
until eight.

698
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,880
It was weird as weird.
One of those weird ones and she was also

699
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,040
just slightly sketchy.
It was just something.

700
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,650
And this isn't one of the things you
deal with when you deal,

701
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:27,710
you know your kids are going to school a
bunch of different people you run into

702
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:29,270
and then you have to interact with these
people.

703
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:30,860
You're not exactly sure what to get out
of it.

704
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,780
So she left her kid at this other lady's
house and the other lady had a little

705
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:37,550
dog.
I mean a little fucking dog.

706
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,020
The dog jumped up and did the pawing
thing and left a visible scratch on the

707
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,010
girl's leg.
She sued them for 100,000 dollars.

708
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,060
What?

709
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,530
Attacked her daughter might be 50 grand.
Maybe she got $50 gross trying to

710
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,670
remember what the numbers were,
but it was like,

711
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,920
whoa.
Like that was good.

712
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,100
This was this lady saying we're in,
you know,

713
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,140
we gotta,
we gotta get a shot here,

714
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,320
got a shot here at some money with
people you go to school with and see all

715
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,910
the time.
That's how awful you are.

716
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,630
It was just the dog didn't bite anybody.
It just jumped up because he got

717
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:15,630
excited.
Is being a dog.

718
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,610
Dogs do it.
You know,

719
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,020
I could get if,
if I was my dog and he did to someone's

720
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,220
door,
I'd be very upset.

721
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,100
I do whatever the fuck I could do to
make it better.

722
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,580
But um,
it's not like the dog was a biter,

723
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,160
but bad dog.
Yeah.

724
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,200
Legally does she have a case?

725
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,580
The issue is with a lot of lawsuits,
it will cost you more to fight it than

726
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,400
it will for you to just settle.
Right?

727
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,310
So a lot of people just settled,
like say it'll cost you $10,000 to

728
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:48,530
settle,
but it'll cost you $50,000 to fight it.

729
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,180
Like that's all.
That's all real.

730
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:52,460
People have to consider those things.
You should fight it though.

731
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:54,170
Just to stick it to her.
Well,

732
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:59,171
the UFC told us to not take photos,
choking people like people ask you,

733
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:01,400
Hey,
put me to run naked choke because two

734
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:04,820
people got sued.
One of them was chuck Odell and one of

735
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:06,930
them was Matt Hughes,
the Matt Hughes One.

736
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,670
Crazy because this guy says to ask Matt,
he used to put him in a choke hold.

737
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,130
People do that shit all the time that
obliges him.

738
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,670
Then the guy uses the photo,
tries to sue Matt Hughes,

739
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:19,220
says Matt Hurt Him.
And here's the evidence,

740
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,530
the photo evidence that you heard them.
Then here's where it gets even crazier

741
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:24,320
than they do an investigation in this
guy.

742
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:27,590
Find out he's a cop.
Then they go deeper.

743
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,110
Find out he's a dirty cop.
Nah,

744
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,840
he gets arrested and kicked off the
force.

745
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,120
Well,
he's a scam artist.

746
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,530
It's a scammer.
I mean,

747
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,220
he's a scammer

748
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,620
that just happened to figure out how to
become a cop.

749
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,080
Oh No.
He hadn't fucked up enough.

750
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,130
By the time he was,
you know,

751
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:47,880
x amount of years old that he couldn't
get disqualified for being a cop.

752
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,440
She's credited as gross.
Yeah,

753
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,300
I know.
That is a,

754
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,830
that's an awful.
That's another reason why you shouldn't

755
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:57,660
let your kids play with other kids.
Yeah.

756
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,650
You gotta keep me at home.
Right.

757
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,440
Don't ever let him out,
man.

758
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,520
Just the having to talk to everybody
when they're picking up the kids and you

759
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,211
know,
it's great.

760
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:08,430
They don't want to talk to you.
You don't want to talk to them and the

761
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:11,310
kids won't put their shoes on and you're
standing there for a half hour just

762
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:13,100
staring at each other,
trying to get through it.

763
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,580
Leave the shoes on it,
stay inside.

764
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,853
You know what?
I mean,

765
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,710
it's hard,
but don't you love it when you find a

766
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,050
parent that you actually like for sure.

767
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,270
That's an oasis.
Yeah.

768
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,790
It's an oasis in the fucking desert.
Oh,

769
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,850
thank God.
They're think they're laughing.

770
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,280
They're normal.
Oh my God.

771
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,770
They can talk to me.
Yeah.

772
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,460
I can drink with this guy.
No problem.

773
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,470
To them.
We're going to be friends.

774
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,270
Holy Shit.
I can't believe it would be friends with

775
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:44,271
a parent who I knew they were out there.
Then do have me parents who you know,

776
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:45,940
don't like you.
Yo.

777
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

778
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,760
You just feel it.
You can.

779
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,690
Yeah.
It going to have that man.

780
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,380
Yeah.
This.

781
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,120
Can it be parents who want to fuck your
wife?

782
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,410
What?
For sure.

783
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,980
They're going to meet her.
They're going to say maybe if Tom dies.

784
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,280
Oh Man.
Yeah.

785
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:04,830
I just know that there's a better job
and he doesn't understand.

786
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,960
She's the.
She's complicated.

787
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,070
She's not difficult.
You just requires more and more back.

788
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,933
That's so.

789
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm not saying it's bad,
it's just.

790
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,510
I mean he goes on the road a lot.
I'm just saying I wouldn't do that.

791
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,310
I mean,
I wouldn't go on the road.

792
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,460
What would I do?
I'd be a stay at home dad that adjust my

793
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:24,840
income accordingly.
I mean,

794
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:27,240
because I just feel like being with you,
it'd be more important than,

795
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:28,800
you know,
getting the applause from strangers.

796
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,290
Well first and foremost,
I'm a feminist and as a feminist I

797
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,740
always do what women want me to do.
He doesn't tell you you're beautiful

798
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:38,640
every day.
I mean,

799
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,220
I'm not judging them.
I would do it.

800
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,580
That's a requirement.
That's something you have to say.

801
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,070
It's just something you want to say
anyway.

802
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,950
And I would want to say especially since
it's true,

803
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,570
but it's true and you say it okay,
you just do,

804
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,190
do better.
Just do better period just to better.

805
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,200
You know,
what I'm finding is the older you get,

806
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,900
the less you run into people because
once they're in high school,

807
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,230
they start to just.
They don't involve the parents at all.

808
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:17,760
They don't want their parents around.
Now you have to make an effort to be

809
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,450
like,
Hey,

810
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,360
I want to see some of these parents
before I let you go over to their house,

811
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:22,920
because now it's getting.
It's good point.

812
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,280
Yeah,
because they're.

813
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,140
When they're little and Weirdos and the
little they really have you.

814
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,270
There's some weird stuff that goes on
like people having parties that my

815
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,620
daughter had.
She was 12 I think,

816
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:39,621
or 13 and the party,
the kids party was held at the stand.

817
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,950
Not The standard.
The Strand,

818
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,620
you know,
the fancy hotel on sunset.

819
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,060
Really what's at the stamp.
I think it's the standard standard

820
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,020
standard.
Thank you.

821
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,640
Cool.
I am.

822
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,440
I've gotten there twice.
We work.

823
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,310
We work on.
We started across the street literally

824
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:59,800
across the street on that diner there.
It's open.

825
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,210
Really.
It might be 24 hours.

826
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,163
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

827
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,910
It's amazing.
It's really good food,

828
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,300
but it's also a place where when you're
new to Hollywood you have parties there

829
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,980
and there's a lot of people with coke
and running around.

830
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:10,570
Naked Dude.
I took a picture.

831
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,210
I was there once.
Rampage Jackson came out of the back

832
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,240
with sunglasses on.
No shirt on and a fur coat and two super

833
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:21,220
hot Chinese checks and I took a picture
of him.

834
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,130
It was back in the day before instagram
and twitter.

835
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,690
I put it up online somewhere.
It's probably.

836
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,860
Yeah,
I don't.

837
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:29,590
I doubt if you can find it,
if you could find that you're a fucking

838
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:31,990
wizard,
but with that is the standard is

839
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:35,350
probably from like 2004 or something
like that.

840
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,100
It's still the same today and my
daughter's like,

841
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,730
they're having a party in the one room
and the parents are having a party in

842
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:44,320
the other room.
That's ridiculous.

843
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,530
It's just parties that want to get
fucked up and then we'll put the kids in

844
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:48,364
that room.
We can.

845
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,120
Oh my.
So my daughter was going to go to A.

846
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,390
I'm not dropping you off at the status.
So stupid.

847
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,570
Definitely fucked up.
Things are going to happen because

848
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,400
parents aren't paying any attention
trying to bond each other.

849
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,990
La,
you know,

850
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,370
there was another,
there was a,

851
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:05,530
there was an incidence of parents bone
each other.

852
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,650
Oh yeah.
Not In my kids' school,

853
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,960
but one of my kids' friends,
school,

854
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,800
the moms.
We're all talking about it at good

855
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:16,360
stuff.
Parents got together,

856
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:22,300
they got date frake on the side.
You notice the sign,

857
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,340
what?
When they want to travel with you,

858
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,030
that's where it all goes down with the
swapping happens a lot on those

859
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:30,490
vacations.
When someone comes to you is like,

860
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:31,540
hey,
you want to go uh,

861
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,590
to the Grand Canyon with me and Carol.
We all camp

862
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,680
camping,
camping stuff.

863
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,430
You gotta do like hotels where there's
like a gym that's 24 hours and it's like

864
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,740
the middle of the night.
Like I just feel like,

865
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,780
you know,
lifting

866
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,470
to one of those massage rooms,
I think camping would be an easy one to

867
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,390
just go into the bathroom in the woods.
The problem is the woods are quiet.

868
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,100
You're going to hear everything.
You're going to hear it all.

869
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,290
It's just the woods.
It's not the best sleep either.

870
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,900
Write up real easy.
You're all,

871
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,680
you're kind of on edge.
And was sleeping on the ground with

872
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:21,280
animals laying on the ground where
animals live.

873
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,030
I.
Hey,

874
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,200
I,
I just got back from Africa.

875
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,690
Oh yeah,
you're right.

876
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,130
Yeah.
You slept in a,

877
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,020
in a tent like that.
It's not a,

878
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,220
not a floppy template.
Like a wall tent.

879
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,350
Wall tent.
Yeah.

880
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,490
When,
where did you go and listen to lions?

881
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,160
All night long.
Literally.

882
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,470
Oh,
it sounded like it was like literally in

883
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:46,850
our bed,
just like safe for hours.

884
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:52,150
He was about about 300 yards away with a
dead zebra and he was basically through

885
00:41:55,701 --> 00:42:00,701
the night telling his family
for miles where the zebras.

886
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,870
Hey,
that's the line I took.

887
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,740
Hey,
that's my thing.

888
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,540
That's your,
a instagram page fellow.

889
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Tom Papa.
Literally like hearing it felt like they

890
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,470
were literally in our,
in our tent.

891
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,170
And what part of Africa did you go to?
Tanzania.

892
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,750
Tanzania.
See I was going to go to Tanzania,

893
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:21,170
but I was scared that I would have to
give my kids a shot.

894
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,700
Yeah,
he did.

895
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,140
How old are you?
Kids?

896
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,360
Uh,
11 and 14.

897
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,200
And they had to get a typhoid shot.
They didn't have to get malaria.

898
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:34,740
We took malaria medication once a day
and a.

899
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,240
How bad is it?
It gives you crazy vivid dreams.

900
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,760
People had said it might give us
nightmares.

901
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,600
We would just come down in the morning
like,

902
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,080
what did you dream last night?
Wow.

903
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,140
I mean like so crystal clear for k vivid
dreams.

904
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,420
Really wild.
And as soon as you'll go,

905
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:55,190
as soon as you went off the dreams went
away.

906
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,600
And how long do you have taken for?

907
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Two days before you go the whole time
you're there and then a week after the

908
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,010
whole time you're there.
You take it.

909
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,240
Yeah.
Does it fuck you?

910
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,440
Larry is real.
It's around.

911
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,260
It makes your stomach a little.
Didn't.

912
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,140
My wife's stomach was a mess because of
it,

913
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,240
but that's it.
Just stomach ache.

914
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,643
Excuse me.
Yeah.

915
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,680
Which can definitely fuck up your
enjoyment of this experience,

916
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:19,431
right?
Yeah.

917
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:22,430
But you know what?
Go to the bathroom a couple times to be

918
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,800
six feet from Lyon is like,
yeah,

919
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,690
you just do it.
You know,

920
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,390
I don't like that stuff.
I always feel like I'm going to get bit

921
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:32,690
by a bug and I feel that I'm too young
for that.

922
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,130
How old are they?
Six and eight.

923
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,830
I just don't want to give him malaria
medication.

924
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,100
They are minor.
Eleven and 14.

925
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,910
And this was the perfect time to take
them.

926
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,320
The 14 year old was aware of.
Certainly in the younger one at 11 is

927
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:50,451
like,
she's good.

928
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:51,740
She can travel,
she can eat food,

929
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:55,880
she could swallow pills.
She's like a person any earlier than

930
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:56,570
this.
It would've been,

931
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,040
it would've been hard.
Yeah.

932
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,963
It's,
um,

933
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,530
it's got to be amazing though.
Huh?

934
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,350
It's amazing.
It's kind of,

935
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,920
it's,
it's mind blowing.

936
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,040
You definitely have a,
you know,

937
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:07,380
it's like,
well,

938
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,780
those things like you go on vacation,
you're like,

939
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,070
oh,
it's just going to blow me away.

940
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:11,120
Like why,
you know,

941
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,810
you're kinda like always this patient.
But then it's always becomes a little

942
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:18,590
more simple than that.
You just kind of hang in this place and

943
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,260
by the end of it you come back,
you're like,

944
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,870
I'm still thinking about it.
You know what I mean?

945
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:26,330
It's like seeing a great movie and you
can't get it out of your head.

946
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,810
It's like these things are going to.
Africa was pretty.

947
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,070
It's pretty deep,
you know,

948
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:35,160
like you really see just the beginning
of,

949
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,620
of everything.
It's kind of,

950
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,980
it's kind of a.
and then it's just cool just being by

951
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:42,420
these animals,
I mean,

952
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:44,940
you're literally by all these animals
about Africa.

953
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:46,890
It's not just the beginning of
everything,

954
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,110
but in a lot of ways it's still like
that.

955
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,500
Yeah.
Like it's one of the few places where

956
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,610
you can go and there's indigenous tribes
essentially all over the continent yet

957
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,280
that are living in a,
you know,

958
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:04,281
really kind of primitive way complete.
We took a balloon ride and balloon guy.

959
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,710
This isn't dangerous enough.
We're going to ground with lions.

960
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,940
And uh,
this was right after the crash.

961
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:12,691
And.
But anyway,

962
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:16,200
we got in the balloon,
it wasn't the safest and he got off

963
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:19,380
course.
So we drifted out of the Serengeti and

964
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:21,930
the grammatic river and we're just kind
of going for a little bit.

965
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,780
And we,
he brought it down in this clearing we

966
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,430
ended,
we ended up fucking movie,

967
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,430
brutal upside down.
A tribe that lives there,

968
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,500
comes running out,
they cut,

969
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,690
they saw us coming down,
they started running,

970
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,370
it got sticks and robes and they come
running and we land.

971
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,000
They've never seen this before.
They've never seen us before.

972
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:44,770
They've never seen this before and
they're like,

973
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,540
my daughter held up a cell phone and
boys who were older than her probably 15

974
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,220
ran,
literally ran at the site of a cell

975
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,600
phone and uh,
it was like,

976
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,510
and they're so primitive,
they're so basic.

977
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,120
They're living in these little places,
just raising cattle and just doing the

978
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:07,710
primitive things.
But I think I was more scared of them.

979
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,010
Then the kids running from the cell
phone,

980
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,150
like I didn't know.
I've only heard like Rwanda or the boat

981
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:17,520
room thing and I'm like,
I don't know these people,

982
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,413
they can eat you.

983
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,020
They've got a robot,
but I've got two daughters with me.

984
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:22,854
You know,
who,

985
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,110
who knows.
He took guy just gets in my face.

986
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,890
She went on a route and getting crazy
and like I'm taking that one.

987
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,000
You landed in my territory.
I'm taking that one dude.

988
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,130
You know what I mean?
Would you be uneasy?

989
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,930
I bought Kia.
I was uneasy.

990
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,580
Yeah.
Well you don't know how to speak their

991
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:41,220
language.
Now think if you land on a fucking

992
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:45,120
balloon and south central Chicago or
South South side of Chicago,

993
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:46,200
you're in trouble.
Right?

994
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,063
Right,
right.

995
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,740
You could learn a bad neighborhood
anywhere in America and a fucking

996
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:51,690
balloon and getting a heap load of
trouble,

997
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,840
but I felt bad about myself that I'm
assuming that I'm landing in that these

998
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:01,200
people must be trouble,
but instinct kind of kicks in.

999
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:03,570
You know what I mean?
You're just kind of landed in the swamps

1000
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,210
of Louisiana and nobody can hear you
scream.

1001
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,360
You don't.
You wouldn't be weird if you landed in

1002
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,570
some fucking strange little swamp town
or a bunch of people just gator hunting.

1003
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,570
That's what it is at skaters.
That's what it is.

1004
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,190
It's the unknown.
It's not knowing.

1005
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:20,460
All I needed was someone to say,
have the balloon guy be like,

1006
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:21,690
these people are cool.
Yeah.

1007
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,830
These are my friends.
Hello.

1008
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,610
Right there.
But no one was saying that one was a

1009
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:30,220
little nervous too,
that cut hands and do the blood brother

1010
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:33,040
thing like outlaw Josey Wales.

1011
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,110
He is my brother,
my brother of the jungle.

1012
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,270
They do the fake thing where they're
about to fight,

1013
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,320
then got terrible movies and they're
like a Crocodile Dundee type movie.

1014
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,960
But you know what the people like the
guy,

1015
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,980
the safari guy that came to pick us up
and drive us back and he was,

1016
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,580
he wasn't cool with being there either.
Oh really?

1017
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:59,140
No.
He was a little nervous.

1018
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:00,940
He was Kinda like checking around and
like,

1019
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,780
okay,
let's go and oh God.

1020
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,730
He's like,
you don't know,

1021
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,590
you don't.
You don't know.

1022
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,560
They could ask for money because you
landed on their bushes.

1023
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,900
You know what I mean?
Anything could go down.

1024
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,310
I know a dude who went there and he went
there for a hunting trip and while he

1025
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:20,311
was there he got sick and the nearest
hospital from where he was hunting was

1026
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,870
like six hours in a truck.

1027
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,280
And so he got so sick he had to go to
the hospital.

1028
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:26,610
Wow.
So they put them in the back of this

1029
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,740
truck.
He's lying down like trying to like not

1030
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:33,760
throw up and just trying to relax over
the six hour drive to the hospital and

1031
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:38,761
they stop for gas along the way and in a
gun fight breaks out and the truck he's

1032
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:41,670
in gets hit with gunfire.
Where,

1033
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,190
what part?
Fuck notes.

1034
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,870
Some Africa like place this dude out
there.

1035
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,890
Dirt roads for six hours.
He gets it a fucking gun fight at a gas

1036
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:55,300
station at a gas station.
There were some rebels disagree with

1037
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:58,250
something and they shot at.
The guy was driving the car and it's,

1038
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,730
that's the,
it's so primitive.

1039
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:05,731
It's so you don't.
We went to a little town and you come

1040
00:49:05,771 --> 00:49:10,310
into this town,
it's just like steel siding put up and

1041
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,840
chickens running around and I mean it's,
it's not a town,

1042
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:15,110
it's,
you know,

1043
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,490
it's what you picture in your head of
like a crazy African,

1044
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:19,900
like bizarre,
you know?

1045
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:25,050
And there's guys on motorcycles mean up
and down the street and you don't know.

1046
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,640
I don't know how this is going to go.
This is,

1047
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:30,970
you know what I mean?
This is most of the time in those parts

1048
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:33,490
of the world,
everything goes fine and that's right,

1049
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,270
but there's a high percentage of the
time in those places as opposed to an

1050
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:40,600
America where things don't go well.
It's like when they don't go well,

1051
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:43,030
they unraveled really quickly and it can
just not come back.

1052
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,090
Then people stuff happens here.
The cops show up and it'll.

1053
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,780
They'll get,
they will get controlled by reading the

1054
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:52,540
cops just shoot you right.
Yet again,

1055
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:55,000
getting control.
Cops listen to right?

1056
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:57,670
No fuck you move,
but you go into those towns.

1057
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,400
I feel like,
you know,

1058
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,300
I want to be the photo journalist who
like comes in and just as cool with

1059
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,110
people and presumes these people are
kind and gentle and a lot of them are

1060
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:09,770
kind and gentle of a scarf.
A lot.

1061
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,910
I could get one.
He needed like some sort of a knit

1062
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:15,450
scarves like,
like it's been like almost like

1063
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,690
transparent.
One of those scarfs in the.

1064
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,140
Like the mirrored sunglasses,
the wire mirrored sunglasses.

1065
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,070
That's kind of a Douche move.
Scarf.

1066
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,340
The scarf.
Well,

1067
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,230
and

1068
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:31,610
scarf makes you look worldly,
like were talking before the podcast

1069
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:35,570
started about those leather bags that
you put your pop your laptop in that

1070
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:40,340
Amanda like six saddle leather develops
a fine Patina over time.

1071
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,860
Fucking pounds.
Damn piece of shit.

1072
00:50:44,861 --> 00:50:46,160
It weighs 20 pounds.
You know,

1073
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:47,930
it's the best thing for carrying your
backpack.

1074
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,370
Your laptop.
It's a backpack.

1075
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,770
Yeah.
Everybody knows it so well.

1076
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,930
Cool.
No,

1077
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,680
it doesn't look like Clint Eastwood with
Abbott.

1078
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,360
Yeah.
If you have a shoulder strap and it's

1079
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,390
pitino leather and you could smell the
leather on.

1080
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:00,224
Yes.
Yes sir.

1081
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,280
Let's look at his shoes.
They're suede with a thin bottom thin.

1082
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,040
How's it heal?
But it's a very small heel,

1083
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:12,620
very thin under nondescript Suede shoe.
He's where?

1084
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:15,050
It's gray of course that he rolls his
own cigarettes.

1085
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:17,630
He does roll his own cigarettes.
You're amazing.

1086
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,590
And he does it well.
A man who controls on cigarettes quickly

1087
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:23,150
and very.
So look at that.

1088
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,030
It looks professional.
It looks like a machine did.

1089
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,711
Oh,
that guy.

1090
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:28,520
Yeah,
so I'm reciting poetry to that girl.

1091
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:33,521
Before that guy was embedded with a
tribe of cannibals for a year and didn't

1092
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:36,590
even speak their language.
He's amazing,

1093
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:41,590
but I do feel that it's my American
paranoia is part of it and that I want

1094
00:51:41,591 --> 00:51:46,591
to be a better person and and assume
that these gentle people raising cattle

1095
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:48,663
are kind

1096
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,740
or you should just assume that all that
shit you read every 20 minutes when you

1097
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,860
get up in the morning and the New York
Times about people eating people over

1098
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:55,694
there.
It's true.

1099
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,360
Jesus Christ,
fucking white liberals,

1100
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,910
they're all.
We just want to think the world is a

1101
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,490
diversity is awesome.

1102
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:10,810
I felt I did have a conflicting thing
like lucky and they had already eaten

1103
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,030
some.
They're like,

1104
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,920
fuck you.
We don't need people

1105
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:28,220
joking around folks,
but that is how I was acting.

1106
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,940
I want it to be like,
it's all cool,

1107
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,880
but I was not.
I was keeping my daughters by me.

1108
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:34,900
I was like,
let's go.

1109
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,240
This little girl came up,
will you give me some juice?

1110
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,890
I'm like,
screw you.

1111
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,960
Fuck you.
Let's get out of here.

1112
00:52:40,961 --> 00:52:43,210
We got our.
We got our fabric that we wanted.

1113
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,490
Let's leave.
I really,

1114
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,050
I was that way.
I was like,

1115
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,940
I'm not having it.
I'm not cool.

1116
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:53,730
I'm paranoid and I'm territorial and
let's get back to the,

1117
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,683
to the van.

1118
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,270
I got a buddy of mine who's had malaria
three times,

1119
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:01,900
three times,
and he goes to the Congo for months at a

1120
00:53:01,901 --> 00:53:05,740
time and a builds wells for the pygmies
in the Congo.

1121
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,040
Oh my God.
He's a salt of the Earth z names Justin

1122
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,810
wren.
He actually had met him when he was

1123
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:12,790
fighting for the UFC.
Wow.

1124
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,820
And he took,
he took a long time off of fighting.

1125
00:53:15,821 --> 00:53:19,900
You just recently returned to bring
awareness to the pygmies.

1126
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,670
Oh,
real hand to speak,

1127
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,580
to help money to help us gather money
to,

1128
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:25,770
uh,
to build them wells.

1129
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:27,780
And they build like,
I think 42.

1130
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:28,650
Well,
so far.

1131
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:29,940
Wow.
It's amazing.

1132
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,780
Yeah,
it works.

1133
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,240
Amazing.
Works with this company called water for

1134
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:36,600
and you can donate.
There's a website called fight for the

1135
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:38,040
forgotten.com.
That's him.

1136
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:39,770
That's my friend.
But uh,

1137
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,830
he goes down there for months and months
at a time and lives with these people in

1138
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,540
like one of those.

1139
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,340
He looks happy.
He's the happiest guy ever.

1140
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,370
He looked so happy.
He's so fucking Nice,

1141
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,400
but I wouldn't feel great too if I went
to a land where of pygmies and there I

1142
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:55,230
was just like,
I am your God.

1143
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:58,350
I am big and I can dig just a guide or
God,

1144
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,500
God,
they're little right?

1145
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:03,540
Pygmies,
they just call them the big pygmy.

1146
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,240
Yeah,
he looks like the gnome on my leg.

1147
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,490
He's a big guy.
He's a UFC heavyweight,

1148
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,700
so he's 250 plus pounds.
Wow.

1149
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,410
He's a big dude.
Big Boulder of a man.

1150
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:14,371
But,
um,

1151
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:16,230
it looks like one of my tattoos and
he's,

1152
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,620
he really does.
He's,

1153
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:22,530
I think he might be over there now or if
he's not there now,

1154
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:24,870
he's going back soon.
He goes there all the time.

1155
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,140
He's an amazing guy.
But that guy has had malaria three

1156
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:29,490
fucking times.
And he said,

1157
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:30,510
there's types of area.

1158
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:31,680
Yeah.
Well,

1159
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,560
he said there's types of malaria that
you can get that can last years.

1160
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,540
What do you say?
Like 30 fucking years.

1161
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,850
Oh my God.
One of them was like five months.

1162
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,660
One of them was 10 years and there's a
type that lasts for like 30 years and he

1163
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:44,370
just didn't want to take medication.
Well,

1164
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:47,520
he did.
He didn't take medication for some of

1165
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:48,870
them.
He did for other ones.

1166
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,320
There's other people that he knows that
took medication and still got malaria,

1167
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,130
but he's in the fucking heat of it,
man.

1168
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,631
No,
that's.

1169
00:54:55,631 --> 00:54:57,090
Yeah,
he's in the Congo.

1170
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:58,210
The Congo,
yeah.

1171
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,090
Do you know that malaria has killed half
the people that have ever died ever.

1172
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,950
Really?
Yeah.

1173
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,040
Out of all the things that have killed
people and all the history is the

1174
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:11,760
biggest lols and fucking earthquakes.
Wagons,

1175
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,580
drowning malaria.
Half of them,

1176
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,440
half of them died because of malaria.

1177
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,700
That's not going to last though because
we were able to go in and affect

1178
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,180
mosquitoes and the mosquitoes are going
to go and take all that out.

1179
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,230
I've seen that genetically modified
mosquitoes all.

1180
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,180
Where are you now?
You're GML pussies.

1181
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,700
Scared Gmo.
What we have is everything is non GMO.

1182
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,120
It's super important to me to be clean,
to eat,

1183
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:41,100
clean writing,
smoking cigarettes,

1184
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:45,060
taken acid on the side,
a dirty hippy day,

1185
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:51,240
Gmos,
Gmos have been with us forever and it's

1186
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:53,850
not a good idea for here's,
here's what's not a good idea.

1187
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,360
It's not a good idea to put pesticides
on your food.

1188
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,010
You know it and I knew it and the
problem with things like GMO round up,

1189
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,190
everybody knows that roundup was created
so they could spray it with evil

1190
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:08,400
chemicals because it makes it easier to
grow plants,

1191
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:11,400
but it's not how it's supposed to be
done.

1192
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,950
Like you can't.
These shortcuts that people have created

1193
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:17,490
for industrial arts farming to kill off
weeds and things like that.

1194
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,030
Pesticides,
that shit is fucking terrible for you

1195
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:23,590
and it gets in the water and that stuff
gets in the water.

1196
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:27,220
I know a dude who has bone cancer and he
has bone cancer and a bunch of people in

1197
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,670
his neighborhood have cancer and they
all got cancer because they were near a

1198
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:35,530
fucking golf course and they had wells
and so they were down down water from

1199
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:39,040
the golf course and the golf course
constantly sprayed pesticide all over

1200
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,750
the grass.
They wanted to keep that grass clean.

1201
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,040
It's seeped into the ground water.
These people all drank that groundwater

1202
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,640
and they got cancer.
Fuck,

1203
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,580
fuck.
Load of people in this guy's

1204
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:51,700
neighborhood got cancer.
He has instead of a thigh.

1205
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,730
His femur is a rod.
It's like a metal rod and they like

1206
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:01,830
rebuilt his leg had cut his femur out of
that or remove your leg.

1207
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,980
You want to try a Rod?
Yeah,

1208
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:07,981
let's go with the rod and he's a fucking
rod in his leg like a gmo mosquitoes,

1209
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,230
but here's the thing.
That's terrible,

1210
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:13,750
right?
But genetically modified foods,

1211
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,410
the more I've looked into it,
the more I understand it now.

1212
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,720
First of all,
they've been with us forever.

1213
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:24,850
Everything you fucking eat from oranges
to corn to tomatoes,

1214
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,970
all those things have been genetically
modified.

1215
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,010
Most of those things have been
genetically modified by traditional

1216
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:33,460
methods,
traditional agricultural methods that we

1217
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:37,000
don't think of as genetically modified.
We have like this ignorant view of it,

1218
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:41,560
like we think it's all being done with
the going into the DNA and injecting

1219
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:44,520
dangerous chemicals and we don't know
the consequences of.

1220
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:47,110
They'd been like splicing plants
together forever.

1221
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:52,111
They've been doing certain aspects of
naturals of selection and selecting the

1222
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:56,830
type of traits in foods that they want
and taking seeds and figuring out.

1223
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,130
Like that's the other thing that I know
most of the foods that you buy,

1224
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,290
the seeds aren't going to even work on
them.

1225
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,320
Like if you buy like tomatoes and those
tomatoes,

1226
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:08,140
like then they're probably not even
going to grow tomatoes from them from

1227
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,280
the seeds and those plants.

1228
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:13,950
That's what's the thing that freaks me.
Like you hear Gmo and you just think,

1229
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,840
I think okay,
someone big is messing with our food and

1230
00:58:18,841 --> 00:58:23,520
then there's only.
There's smaller number of big people who

1231
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:26,170
are manipulating food supply and they
don't care about you.

1232
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,790
They don't.
They don't even allow those old ways of

1233
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,900
modifying stuff because there's so
taking seeds out away from regular

1234
00:58:33,901 --> 00:58:37,080
farmers and I mean it's really that
part.

1235
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:42,590
It's like the big brother part of the
food industry that really scary and when

1236
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:44,430
I hear Gmo I just think,
okay,

1237
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:46,800
who's doing what?
You know what level?

1238
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,840
I think the same way when we were
talking about how many employees do you

1239
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:52,210
have to have before you have to hire a
check.

1240
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,160
You don't.
You're okay if you have to,

1241
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,490
if you have more.
I think when you're a part of a big

1242
00:58:57,491 --> 00:58:59,680
corporation,
how many people do you have to have,

1243
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:04,180
but where no one feels responsible for
the consequences of the actions of the

1244
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:07,480
company.
Like if you working for Monsanto,

1245
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,580
you're working for a fucking enormous
monster of a machine that needs to make

1246
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:14,560
more money every month and the previous
month.

1247
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,520
Bigger than a lot of countries.

1248
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,370
It's bigger than a lot of countries and
it's,

1249
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,400
it's the amount of money that it
generates is substantial worldwide.

1250
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:25,670
Yeah,
and then here's the thing with the

1251
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,390
universe or infinite growth,
which is this thing that a lot of

1252
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,910
corporations operate under.
They have stockholders.

1253
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,890
People want returns on their
investments.

1254
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:38,120
You want to make more money every
quarter then you did the previous

1255
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,320
quarter.
That's crazy.

1256
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,300
Insane.
You can't sustain that.

1257
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:44,450
Keeps going and going and going,
and when you're a company like Monsanto,

1258
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:49,400
I'm not making any excuses for them.
I'm just saying the way giant

1259
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:51,770
corporations operate,
they are.

1260
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:56,771
The CEO has.
He has an obligation to stockholders to

1261
00:59:56,991 --> 01:00:00,470
generate more income.
It's important that he made and if they

1262
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,790
don't,
they'll write them out.

1263
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,770
The a new guy in here who's going to do
the job.

1264
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:07,400
So if you take on the job of a CEO of a
major corporation,

1265
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:11,690
your job is to make more fucking money
every time and it's a very high pressure

1266
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,580
job,
which is why it's worth so much money.

1267
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:15,870
Like there's no you.
No,

1268
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,760
you get it,
but that's.

1269
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:21,761
But that's why you need someone like the
FDA to keep an eye on it and keep them

1270
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:25,400
small and break them up,
make sure they're not putting that stuff

1271
01:00:25,401 --> 01:00:28,460
in the wells and doing all that stuff.
They're all bought and paid.

1272
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:29,210
You can't.
Yeah,

1273
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,500
but you need.
If,

1274
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,220
if the corporation's goal is to just get
bigger and make more,

1275
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,330
they're not going to put the brakes on
and say let's not put the bad water in

1276
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:39,130
the.
Well,

1277
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:39,650
yes.
True.

1278
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,540
Somebody has to do it.
Somebody's gotta do it.

1279
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,810
Right.
But the government is far from doing it.

1280
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,600
Right.
But the FDA with food that they let so

1281
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:51,140
much stuff slide.
There's so much stuff in our food that

1282
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:52,640
isn't allowed in Europe.
Yeah,

1283
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:54,710
well that's what I'm saying.
Like they're bought and sold.

1284
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,710
Like if they were looking out for us,
the first thing they would do is look

1285
01:00:57,711 --> 01:00:58,544
into cigarettes.

1286
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:02,150
There would be like some major
investigation as to why politicians

1287
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:05,690
haven't spoken out against cigarettes.
Are Cigarettes killing 500,000 people

1288
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:08,780
and no one's doing anything to stop it.
That that would be one of the first

1289
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:11,270
things they would do.
Because if you tried to exist at all,

1290
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,900
if you had to see a new product like
cigarettes,

1291
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,120
it was kind of a half million people a
year and it wasn't doing anything good.

1292
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,160
Yeah.
How the fuck is that going to stick

1293
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:19,551
around?
Right.

1294
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,190
You make a bubblegum that's killing half
the people.

1295
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,440
Here's what it does.
Do.

1296
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:26,400
It makes you need that gum.
Yeah.

1297
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:29,150
And then you want to get that gun back.
Anybody who created that gun would be

1298
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:32,450
thought of as a monster monster.
But like you could be like,

1299
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:33,470
what does your dad do?
Oh,

1300
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:35,390
well he runs a tobacco company.
Oh,

1301
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,380
cool.
Oh cool.

1302
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:39,860
Yeah.
So does the rest of the state everybody

1303
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,470
in North Carolina?
He,

1304
01:01:41,471 --> 01:01:42,940
uh,
he employs a lot of people in this

1305
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:43,431
state.
Oh,

1306
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:44,960
excellent.
What does your dad do?

1307
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,060
Oh,
he makes his addictive gum.

1308
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,490
That kills you.
Piece of shit.

1309
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,280
Piece of shit.
Oh yeah.

1310
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:55,320
He wears a cape and he lives in a dark
castle.

1311
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,290
It's never sunny.
Weird.

1312
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:01,580
Just mysteriously goes around the
basement and it's about killing people.

1313
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,570
He's so happy with his product killing
half a million a year and he has all the

1314
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:07,570
money in the world.
He buys off politicians.

1315
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,680
Yeah,
with his evil gum money.

1316
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,330
I mean,
that's what they're doing.

1317
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:12,320
Yeah,
exactly.

1318
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,880
Exactly.
So much difference.

1319
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:15,440
That's.
You know what I think I was trying to

1320
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:18,680
think of why like your buddy goes and
helps the pygmies and all these people

1321
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,040
are like,
you got to just go into these

1322
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,620
places and help these people,
and part of me was when I was there was

1323
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,170
thinking that it's almost like in this
liberal,

1324
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:32,580
arrogant way offensive to be like,
I'm here now.

1325
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,000
I can help you.
You live like this.

1326
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,770
Let me make it better.
But as I was thinking about it,

1327
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:44,610
I don't think that desire to go to work
with the pygmies and the go to help

1328
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:48,150
these people with their water and all.
It's not that we think we're better.

1329
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,260
You just see people that need help,
but unlike here in the county in this

1330
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:53,910
country,
you see people that need help.

1331
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,480
It's a mess to be able to help them.
You don't know if you're really there.

1332
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:00,120
It's like a build a well and these
people are happy,

1333
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,780
right?
I say I give them education and it's a

1334
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:06,930
clear path.
There is no FDA.

1335
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:08,730
I know going against what I was saying
before,

1336
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:12,210
but there is no government regulation.
There's no complex corporations.

1337
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,310
If I want to help somebody here,
it's like,

1338
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:16,560
how do you help people in Detroit?
Where do you start?

1339
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:19,740
How does it make an impact?
There he goes and sees pygmies.

1340
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,680
He helps the pygmies and at the end of
the day he's helped pygmies.

1341
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:23,940
Right.
You know what I mean?

1342
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,860
There's a direct way to help people
there.

1343
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,640
There is that thing though.
Whenever you do something charitable

1344
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,360
that people think that you're.
You're like peacocking your charitable

1345
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:35,760
ways.
You're doing it for yourself and your

1346
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:36,710
own ego.
Yeah.

1347
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,190
Yeah.
But then there's the other side of

1348
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:40,620
looking at it like who cares?
As long as the good work gets done.

1349
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:43,380
Like even if you have kind of Shitty,
selfish,

1350
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,470
right.
Ambitious sort of feared intentions

1351
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:49,560
behind it.
If I do something good for people,

1352
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:53,520
I want other people to know I did it.
I'll admit it.

1353
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,700
I really like,
like it's,

1354
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,880
I know it's a shitty motivation,
but I did help somebody,

1355
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,390
you know what I mean?
They got something out of it for sure.

1356
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,530
I got something out of it.
Praise Tom Papa.

1357
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,800
I'm a pretty good guy.
Look what I did.

1358
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,103
Good.
I do.

1359
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,530
You know what I mean?
I really,

1360
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,020
I will admit it.
If I go back,

1361
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:20,700
if I went back to Africa and help these
people out with their drinking water.

1362
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,040
This one wants to do a documentary on it
makes them cash.

1363
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:25,590
Oh yeah.
I do a special and Kilimanjaro on my way

1364
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:29,730
home and I would market it.
And what kind of comedy would you do on

1365
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:31,320
Kilimanjaro?
Oh Man.

1366
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,270
These rebels folks who's dressing him?

1367
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,200
No,
it's safe in Tanzania.

1368
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:39,120
There's no conflicts.
There's no rebels.

1369
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,650
It's nice and peaceful.
These people are kind of Nice.

1370
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:46,820
They're good Kilimanjaro's like that.
[inaudible].

1371
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,800
What would you do?
What kind of jokes would you.

1372
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,000
When you're in Kilimanjaro,

1373
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:56,940
they don't understand English very well,
so you have to be to get a little

1374
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:57,934
physical.

1375
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:04,960
Do the old grandpa and grandpa running
from the lion gag?

1376
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:10,230
A couple boob jokes.
That sounds good.

1377
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,150
I saw the lion king,
not the lion king.

1378
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,240
Jungle book last night.
Yeah,

1379
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,770
I saw it on the plane.
Spoiler alert.

1380
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,780
All the animals can talk in the kid
lives.

1381
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,780
I wanted to like it.
It just took itself.

1382
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,650
So as soon as I heard Liam Neeson in the
beginning,

1383
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:32,110
taking themselves too seriously,
I was out well,

1384
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:34,410
and also they had a gigantic pithy gus
in it.

1385
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,070
It was just.
I thought it was fascinating,

1386
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:39,360
but they made it an orangutan.
They decided that a gigantic Pythius

1387
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:44,370
wasn't orangutan an enormous orangutan
that knocked over a building.

1388
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,280
It was just 10 foot tall orangutan that
can talk.

1389
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,810
Spoiler alert.
Sorry.

1390
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,580
Is it bad that I still want to say
Orangutang because it's sounds familiar.

1391
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:58,590
Were you saying it wrong?
It's neander tall also by the list.

1392
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,110
It's not fall too tall.

1393
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,980
Some of the oldest human remains were
Tanzania.

1394
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,143
Really?
Yeah.

1395
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:07,850
Which,
uh,

1396
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,080
how old were they?
I don't know.

1397
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:11,610
Well,
they think that's where people evolve.

1398
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,510
If you believe all that evolution
nonsense and not the Bible,

1399
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,030
I do.
I do believe it.

1400
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,990
I pity you.
I put your soul because you're going to

1401
01:06:20,991 --> 01:06:23,480
burn in a fiery pit.
Whoops.

1402
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,530
I pity.
Or twitter,

1403
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:29,620
I guess you fucked up.
That's where people evolved,

1404
01:06:30,081 --> 01:06:32,270
right?
Or one of the main places.

1405
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,700
I think the original place where human
beings.

1406
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,110
Ethiopia and then.
Yeah,

1407
01:06:36,111 --> 01:06:36,561
yeah,
yeah.

1408
01:06:36,561 --> 01:06:39,890
And then obviously they branched out in
different species of human,

1409
01:06:39,891 --> 01:06:44,870
different branches of human evolved.
They're always keep finding over the

1410
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,300
last few years a bunch of new one.
I know these new branches,

1411
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,110
you know,
they finally some teeth and go what us

1412
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,420
and then they,
I think we got a new job bone here guys.

1413
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,730
And then they do some DNA on it and
like,

1414
01:06:55,731 --> 01:06:57,090
holy fuck stick.

1415
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:02,100
Did humans have tails?
Maybe I'll do via Tanzania.

1416
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:03,650
Hmm.
Yeah.

1417
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:07,460
This site in Tanzania that holds the
earliest evidence of the existence of

1418
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:09,170
human ancestors.
You gotta go,

1419
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:10,340
Joe,
you got to go.

1420
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,720
You would love it.
Holy Shit.

1421
01:07:11,721 --> 01:07:14,150
Look at that.
They found hundreds of fossilized bones

1422
01:07:14,151 --> 01:07:18,770
and stone tools in the area dating back
millions of years leading them to

1423
01:07:18,771 --> 01:07:21,440
conclude that humans evolved in Africa.
Wow.

1424
01:07:21,441 --> 01:07:23,150
Millions of years.
Millions.

1425
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,340
I didn't know they had stone tools,
millions of years ago,

1426
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:29,570
million.
One of their saying fossilized bones and

1427
01:07:29,571 --> 01:07:31,360
stone tools.
Also millions.

1428
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:33,860
Like how old was the oldest?
If you had to guess right now,

1429
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,680
without any looking,
how old do you think the oldest stone

1430
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:37,970
tool ever found was?

1431
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:44,040
The oldest stone tool was discovered by
Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia.

1432
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:50,070
You're talking about his wife.
It's his,

1433
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,500
his beard,
his old tool.

1434
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:54,170
That's what we call this stone tool.

1435
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,500
I'm very bad with thinking about,
uh,

1436
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,450
about,
uh,

1437
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,530
numbers like back into the past and,
and things out into the universe.

1438
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:04,390
Like these billions don't make any
sense,

1439
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:09,430
but I would guess I'm in my dumb way.
I would say,

1440
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:13,630
uh,
a tool would be about a 2 million years

1441
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,464
old.
Old.

1442
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:15,860
Yeah.
I'm going to go with you.

1443
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,530
I'll say about 2 million years.
So I'm impressed.

1444
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:21,620
Let's say two point 8 million.
Wow.

1445
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,660
Holy Shit.
That's a long time.

1446
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,000
It's so long.
The artifacts are by far the oldest

1447
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:28,790
handmade stone tools,
yet discovered the previous record

1448
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:31,100
holders known as the older ones.
Don't tools.

1449
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:32,780
We're about two point 6 million years
old,

1450
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:37,760
so I was hunting reasonably in Nevada.
You got to go to Africa.

1451
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:39,050
You.
You're built for this.

1452
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:42,470
I was in Nevada though.
I was in the mountains in the high

1453
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:44,330
country,
the high country desert hunting mule

1454
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:46,160
deer doing this.
Archery,

1455
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:47,090
hunting,
hiking,

1456
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:48,530
backpacking,
camping out there.

1457
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,910
Have found a.
found a stone.

1458
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:54,140
Arrowhead.
You did?

1459
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,580
Yeah.
While hunting.

1460
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:58,970
I've found an ancient era.
That's the coolest.

1461
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,970
It was the coolest shit ever because who
knows how old it was.

1462
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,470
You keep it.
Well,

1463
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:05,030
you're not supposed to,
so yeah,

1464
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:06,143
of course.

1465
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,110
You're not supposed to walk out with it.
They're the fuck outta here.

1466
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,780
Fuck off is.
How big was it?

1467
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,010
Tiny.
Small.

1468
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:14,390
About that big.
It's amazing.

1469
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:16,040
I've always wanted to find that.
I left it there.

1470
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:19,220
I buried at Tom.
I buried it so someone else could find

1471
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:20,120
it.
You're a good man.

1472
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:22,870
I am a good man.
I want everybody know I buried it today.

1473
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,210
You would.
I know you would want everyone to know

1474
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,420
if I got a deer there.
I was going to take a photo of the new

1475
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,440
arrowhead next to the old arrowhead,
not take a photo of him,

1476
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:37,790
but glue them onto a piece with a photo
of the animal and then have it framed

1477
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,840
for this thing.
It's a dope thing to find while your bow

1478
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:44,960
and Arrow hunting.
You find an arrowhead from probably

1479
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:45,830
Indian.
Yeah.

1480
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:48,180
I'm sure.
Native Americans or indigenous people,

1481
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:52,730
I mean engines in
scans,

1482
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,860
you know that kind of Powwow,
eagles,

1483
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,870
Eagle feathers,
you know them dudes.

1484
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,490
You know,
whenever I say Indians,

1485
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:03,350
my daughter always goes,
dad.

1486
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,260
Yeah,
don't say American.

1487
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:06,223
I'm like,
Oh,

1488
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:09,350
I'm okay.
But then I was reading an article in the

1489
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,861
New York Times about,
you know,

1490
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:12,890
they're trying to put the pipeline
through North Dakota and they call them

1491
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:17,210
the Lakota Indians.
They don't say the Lakota native

1492
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:19,610
Americans,
so I'm not being offensive.

1493
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,890
The lakota people I think is what
they're supposed to be calling

1494
01:10:21,891 --> 01:10:23,900
themselves.
I think they called them Indians in the

1495
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:25,790
article.
Do you know that other Indians called

1496
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,624
them?
The Su.

1497
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,440
Su means enemy who the Lakota people
were on notorious war like people.

1498
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,630
Right.
Tough.

1499
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:38,570
Do you ever hear the Nez perce?
No big time.

1500
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:40,280
Cannibals.
Oh yeah.

1501
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,870
The Great Lakes areas.
Yeah.

1502
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,810
They did a lot of killing and eating
white folks,

1503
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:47,900
not.
They didn't like the white invaders,

1504
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,480
so they ate them.
Took to killing them and eating them and

1505
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:51,260
take their soul.

1506
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,910
Oh,
here's something I found out that's very

1507
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:53,760
important.
The revenue.

1508
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:55,820
It's all based on bullshit.
No,

1509
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:59,990
it's not fucking bullshit.
Here's what actually happened to that

1510
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:00,411
guy.
No,

1511
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:00,721
no,
no.

1512
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:04,090
I read the account of the actual event.
Oh,

1513
01:11:04,091 --> 01:11:05,690
okay.
Here's a bunch of shit that never

1514
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:07,010
happened.
It's first of all,

1515
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,760
he never had a son.
You know?

1516
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,380
His son was murdered by the guy who
wants to go up to the guy.

1517
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,130
Never had a sense.
Not In the book,

1518
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:15,750
by the way.
Second of all,

1519
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,540
they never left him.
They never tried to bury them alive.

1520
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,720
He was fucked up.
You got mauled by a bear and they left

1521
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:23,730
him to die.
That he was going to die it in Barium.

1522
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,890
They didn't bury them.
The guy crawled that sound in the book

1523
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:27,480
either.
He never killed anybody.

1524
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,570
He didn't kill anybody.
That guy never didn't kill anybody,

1525
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,310
made it back to camp,
crawl back to camp,

1526
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:32,880
got pissed.

1527
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,780
Nearly go.
Sorry.

1528
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:34,861
Um,
yeah,

1529
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:36,510
it just ended.
He never killed him.

1530
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:40,320
I know book either the guy who left him
to die,

1531
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:42,810
wound up dying.
They all die really young back then.

1532
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:43,950
But he,
uh,

1533
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,540
the only thing that was true is he
survived.

1534
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:49,140
He found an animal,
I think it was a moose or an elk that

1535
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:52,080
had been killed by wolves and he ate
some of that and he killed and ate a

1536
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:55,470
snake and that's all he had to eat his
entire way back and his body's all

1537
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:57,690
fucked up.
And he did crawl his way back to

1538
01:11:57,691 --> 01:12:00,060
wherever the fuck he was going.
He actually,

1539
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,030
yeah.
And then he,

1540
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:02,810
uh,
then he got a horse you've got,

1541
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:06,650
you've got a horse swimming Indian and
wrote it to a fort and then it just kind

1542
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:09,630
of ends.
And when he fell off the cliff and

1543
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:11,820
landed in the tree,
bullshit never happened.

1544
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,820
Made up the book is pretty accurate to
the real account.

1545
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,830
Oh yeah.
And my buddy told me to read it.

1546
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:17,693
So,
uh,

1547
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:19,800
putting together a little summer reading
list,

1548
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,740
I threw that into the pile.
I hate that phrase.

1549
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,920
Pretty accurate.
You're talking about like historical

1550
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,440
events,
you have an obligation to have zero

1551
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:30,840
bullshit that you add in there,
the story better,

1552
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:33,510
but I think the book is,
I couldn't tell you 100 percent,

1553
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,360
but all that stuff,
like as I was reading it,

1554
01:12:36,361 --> 01:12:40,380
it's really good book because it really
gets into the smallness of like what you

1555
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:43,800
have in your,
in your utility bag and like walking

1556
01:12:43,801 --> 01:12:46,080
through and with this Indian would do.
And this is all,

1557
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:49,020
it's very little subtle day to day stuff
that makes the book great.

1558
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,540
Um,
but uh,

1559
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:52,621
it just,
yeah,

1560
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:54,540
it just kinda like drifted off in and
ended.

1561
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:56,340
There was a,
there was a lot less drama.

1562
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:58,170
The book was pretty dry.
Yeah.

1563
01:12:58,171 --> 01:13:00,210
Well that's the real life story,
right?

1564
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,790
No.
So this is the account of all the stuff

1565
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:06,600
that they carried with them,
like flint to start fires and things

1566
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:07,850
along those lines.
Exactly.

1567
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:09,510
The Flint,
what did they carry with them?

1568
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:11,880
A little rope,
a little less fat,

1569
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,350
fat,
fat,

1570
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,550
fat.
I don't know,

1571
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:15,930
to oil up their,
uh,

1572
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,810
their tools.
Oh,

1573
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,670
to make sure that their tools didn't get
rusted.

1574
01:13:19,671 --> 01:13:22,170
Probably a lot of stuff for their gun,
for their gun maintenance.

1575
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,860
I'm what they call it,
a supplies bag or it was a cooler name

1576
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:30,150
than that.
And so they had muskets back then.

1577
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:32,070
Right.
So they would have like black powder and

1578
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:35,700
they would pour it into the barrel.
Then they would have to pack it down and

1579
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:39,810
put a primer in and they had a little
piece of flint they would drop down on a

1580
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:43,410
hammer and the spark from that.
What had caused the explosion.

1581
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:45,030
Yep.
So fucking primitive.

1582
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:46,350
It's amazing.
Amazing.

1583
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,210
Amazing.
It really is.

1584
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:51,790
To me,
it's amazing how people just not just

1585
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,060
got by back then,
but actually would go out into the

1586
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:56,190
woods,
like barely,

1587
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:59,540
barely supply.
Nothing.

1588
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,770
Almost nothing.
Just against the weather.

1589
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,120
Yeah.
Not Prepared.

1590
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:06,600
You'll one pair of clothes I want to.
How much food they would bring and how

1591
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:09,930
much that we just rely upon the land
because they didn't really know what the

1592
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:12,070
hell was ahead of time.
They would

1593
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,970
salt a lot of meat right?
They would salt it and jerk it and carry

1594
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:17,220
that stuff,
but you know,

1595
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:20,500
that was like,
you ate that when you were in a fix,

1596
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,270
you know,
you had no food for awhile,

1597
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,590
but they didn't.
They couldn't carry a lot of stuff.

1598
01:14:24,591 --> 01:14:26,110
We couldn't refrigerate stuff,
you know,

1599
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,490
you're just living out there.
It's quite.

1600
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:33,700
Think about a scary.
It would be just like sleeping there and

1601
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:34,780
knowing that,
you know,

1602
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,840
native Americans are coming through the
woods.

1603
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:40,090
Well,
I got really stuck that you're on their

1604
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:40,891
land.
Oh,

1605
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:41,980
insane.
You know,

1606
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:44,140
and you really are on their fucking
land.

1607
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:45,780
Like you're really not supposed to be
there.

1608
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:48,130
Brian Invading Army.
Yeah.

1609
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:53,250
I put this article up yesterday that
somebody tweeted that I retweeted.

1610
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:59,980
It was just a shocking article.
I started reading it about all of the

1611
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:01,040
northern,
uh,

1612
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,000
all the,
um,

1613
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:06,280
southern California murders that
involved Indians and then California in

1614
01:15:06,281 --> 01:15:08,410
general,
like how many native Americans were

1615
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:12,850
murdered when,
in establishing California when they

1616
01:15:12,851 --> 01:15:14,440
were pioneering,
like when they were first coming,

1617
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,410
oh my God did this.

1618
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:21,450
But these accounts were horrific.
Like firsthand accounts of thousands of

1619
01:15:22,091 --> 01:15:24,370
people are getting slaughtered,
including children,

1620
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:25,540
babies,
women,

1621
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,350
yeah.
This.

1622
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:28,660
This all happened a couple of hundred
years ago.

1623
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:34,510
After reading the revenant,
I decided I was so excited about reading

1624
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:36,350
about the west I wanted.
I'm like,

1625
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,110
let me learn about how the Indians
actually live.

1626
01:15:39,111 --> 01:15:40,420
Let me see.
They're small bags.

1627
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:42,250
What did they carry and what was their
day to day?

1628
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:45,550
I really wanted to kind of get into that
like an idiot.

1629
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,880
I pick up a barry may have wounded knee,
which is the most horrific account of

1630
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:55,030
the slaughter of native Americans.
It's just,

1631
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,230
you know,
tribe after tribe.

1632
01:15:56,231 --> 01:15:59,710
It just takes you through our expansion
and going into each state and lying and

1633
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,410
destroying and killing men,
women and children.

1634
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,590
It's unreadable.
You literally can't get through it.

1635
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:07,160
It's so recent.
I'm like,

1636
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:12,390
I want to read a nice Indian story where
a white guy comes out and they know he's

1637
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:17,230
cool and he gets a girlfriend and he's
like the one cool white guy and hangs

1638
01:16:17,231 --> 01:16:18,040
with the Indians.

1639
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,820
I love Indians.
Dancing with wolves is my favorite

1640
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:24,490
movie.
When the beautiful white man becomes the

1641
01:16:24,491 --> 01:16:26,530
best Indian,
I love it.

1642
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,370
That's what I want.
Fucking horrible movie.

1643
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:35,050
The best of the group who gets the
hottest woman is a beautiful white man

1644
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,030
with a ponytail,
starts off slow.

1645
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:39,300
He gets his ass kicked early.
Some of them,

1646
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,990
some of the young guys don't trust them.
Yeah,

1647
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,400
it's A.
There's a lot of rivalries.

1648
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:45,400
Here's the story arc.
It's going to take a long time.

1649
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,930
We need three plus hours,
three hours kind of fucking movie as

1650
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,460
well.
He has to win the Indians.

1651
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:52,720
Respect.
It's going to take time.

1652
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:55,180
It's an amazing movie.
And Kevin Costner's onboard,

1653
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,150
so Kevin believes in this.
Sold.

1654
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,280
Kevin is.
First of all,

1655
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:03,220
Kevin has been researching this for a
long time.

1656
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,860
Okay.
It would be within your best interest to

1657
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:09,050
make this film because if you don't,
someone will just tell you that now.

1658
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,160
Okay,
we're

1659
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,310
here out of respect because of our
previous relationship that we have with

1660
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:17,570
universal getting made.
This is getting is getting made.

1661
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:20,590
This is an amazing film.
I'm.

1662
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,450
Kevin becomes the best Indian at the end
of the movie.

1663
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:29,050
He kicks everyone's ass and Fox,
everyone's Pocahontas fucks their wives

1664
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,350
and think about all the Indians you're
going to employ in this movie.

1665
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:35,480
You won't have to hire black people for
the rest of the year,

1666
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:40,570
and there was a young man at one point
in time in the film who seemed like he

1667
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,570
and Kevin would be rivals.
Eventually he worships Kevin.

1668
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:46,730
Thanks.
Kevin is amazing.

1669
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,210
Kevin begins to dress like them.
Somehow or another though goes to a

1670
01:17:50,211 --> 01:17:53,780
barber and gets his haircut perfectly
around his ears.

1671
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:55,630
It's weird like,
have you looked at St Louis?

1672
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:59,000
He wasn't waterworld.
It's sort of melody,

1673
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,410
but whatever's going on at the top,
he's obviously got some product in that

1674
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:04,370
hair,
right?

1675
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:04,851
I mean,
what's.

1676
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:07,130
What's happening big time?
He's like,

1677
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,990
yeah,
he's in a.

1678
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:11,050
In a hair metal band.
Yeah.

1679
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:14,170
My favorite is Wyatt earp.
Did you ever see when he played wider

1680
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:17,270
up?
So he played wider and wider.

1681
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:19,670
Was Young.
They just put a wig on a 40 year old

1682
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:21,070
Kevin Costner.
You're like,

1683
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,330
yeah,
I just make them one of these aging and

1684
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,870
give him a fucking word.
And so I was like,

1685
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:25,010
gee,
Mr. I don't know,

1686
01:18:25,011 --> 01:18:27,590
why did you beat me up?
This guy beats him up and he's got this

1687
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:30,320
fucking.
He's a 40 year old guy with a wig on and

1688
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:31,850
no one's.
No one's freaking out.

1689
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:32,710
Everyone's like,
oh,

1690
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,900
your kid's weird looking and then
fucking 25 years later it looks exactly

1691
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:41,390
the same.
It's just so strange.

1692
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:46,070
Voices a little deeper,
but he's got the loose skin thing going

1693
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:50,180
on,
but he's got a mop of hair crazy fast.

1694
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,360
Nobody cared.
They didn't have CGI back then.

1695
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:55,750
You couldn't make it look like an 18
year old.

1696
01:18:55,751 --> 01:18:58,060
It wasn't four k.
no one was really looking back.

1697
01:18:58,061 --> 01:19:01,520
It looks so bad.
It looked like not even the healthiest

1698
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,700
40 year old guy,
like 40 year old guy that probably does

1699
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:06,950
a little coke every now and then I lose
it up.

1700
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,510
I let him,
Gee,

1701
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,140
Mr. I don't want that trouble.
That's him in wider,

1702
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:14,690
but that's not him.
When he was the youngest,

1703
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:19,340
that's him in the movie somewhere,
but he had an also lazy bitch.

1704
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,180
Didn't even bother losing any weight for
that moving because he has a little bit

1705
01:19:23,181 --> 01:19:26,510
of a double chin.
You're a movie star.

1706
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:27,711
Well,
you know,

1707
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:28,371
he's like,
fuck it,

1708
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:29,900
I'm directing,
I'm acting,

1709
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,670
I get tired,
I want to snack.

1710
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,270
I'm dealing with a lot.
All right.

1711
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,600
By the way,
I love Kevin called and dances with

1712
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:40,430
wolves is a fucking awesome movie.
I loved it,

1713
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:43,930
but that is what happened.
But when you're going in thinking like

1714
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:47,930
you're going to get that level of Indian
fun and then you read bury me at wounded

1715
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:50,390
knee,
the first chapter alone is like a

1716
01:19:50,391 --> 01:19:53,870
Holocaust.
It's like it's really rough.

1717
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,530
It is incredibly fucked up.
And you stop and think about the time

1718
01:19:57,531 --> 01:20:02,300
period of the 18 hundreds and then
previous to that how,

1719
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:05,150
how recent.
That was incredibly fucked up.

1720
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,130
It's incredibly fucked up and it's
incredible.

1721
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,810
How much has happened is has happened up
till now.

1722
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:17,830
Like I mean walking through this area in
like in the dark with no lights and it

1723
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:20,030
was like being in Africa.
Right?

1724
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:23,770
And now they didn't have overnight.
These guys camped at night and they

1725
01:20:23,771 --> 01:20:25,080
didn't have flashlights.
Nothing.

1726
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,600
They couldn't even light a fire because
they thought it was going to track the

1727
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:30,120
enemy.
Crazy.

1728
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,420
This is not long ago,
dude.

1729
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,700
Yeah.
Not long ago at all.

1730
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,960
What people do when they find new spots
and so what they've done throughout

1731
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,180
history to find out who's owning those
bots.

1732
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,740
What's all the good stuff in those
spots.

1733
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,210
All right.
We've got to kill those people to get

1734
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,230
that good stuff.
Yeah,

1735
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:50,070
and then they just jack them.
I don't understand why more parts of

1736
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:53,190
Africa were exploited.
It's tough to it to.

1737
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,510
First of all,
it's enormous.

1738
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,630
If you think about the sheer size of
Africa and then there was also a lot of

1739
01:20:57,631 --> 01:20:58,970
stuff they tried to exploit.

1740
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,020
I just.
One of the famous things about the Congo

1741
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:06,021
is that European settlers tried to.
They tried to take the Congo and they

1742
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:10,320
tried to colonize it.
You tried to move in and they tried to

1743
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:13,320
gentrify the Congo.
They tried to like build houses and

1744
01:21:13,321 --> 01:21:17,760
they're still the remains of a lot of
these incredible mansions.

1745
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,950
He tried to put like plantations up in
the Congo.

1746
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,130
You go through all of it.
It was of.

1747
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,480
That's when the Germans were here.
That's when the French owned it.

1748
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:26,970
That's when the British owned it.
I mean that's the way it was.

1749
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,790
People just came from Europe and took it
over and owned it.

1750
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:35,060
The difference is they didn't come in in
most cases and slaughter everybody and

1751
01:21:35,341 --> 01:21:39,900
try and take it over for some reason.
They came in and just try to adapt those

1752
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:42,150
people,
but people weren't moving down.

1753
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:44,610
It's a hostile environment and there's,
you know,

1754
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:46,780
I mean there's diamonds and all that
stuff and.

1755
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:52,340
But there's no,
there's no real like minor thing that

1756
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:56,290
you could exploit and bring to the rest
of the world in these areas that are.

1757
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:59,460
There is in some areas and those areas
of deep trouble,

1758
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:02,460
that's where you get like conflict
minerals.

1759
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:07,020
A lot of that is they're getting some of
these minerals that they need for cell

1760
01:22:07,021 --> 01:22:10,260
phones and for some different things to
get a lot of those from Africa,

1761
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,550
you know,
it was coming in big in Africa is China.

1762
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:17,400
China is going in and building stadiums,
building football stadiums,

1763
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:20,640
soccer stadiums,
really going in and building them for

1764
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:23,610
free so they get and then they get in
with the government and they get all

1765
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:27,300
these contracts because they see Africa
as the place that's going to be

1766
01:22:27,301 --> 01:22:30,180
exploited in the future in China's going
big.

1767
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

1768
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:33,450
I've heard that.
I heard they're buying up enormous

1769
01:22:33,451 --> 01:22:34,920
swaths of land.
Yeah.

1770
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,150
Yeah.
It's kind of weird.

1771
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:39,120
Bended.
The thing that China has gone on is that

1772
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,520
they're kind of capitalists now.
Yeah,

1773
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,900
a fiercely.
Yeah.

1774
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:47,930
But they're also not in that they can
completely control their people can shut

1775
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:51,360
down aspects of the Internet.
Like I had a friend who was an executive

1776
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:55,320
at Google and they were going over there
and trying to talk with the Chinese and

1777
01:22:55,321 --> 01:22:57,060
trying to negotiate,
bring google,

1778
01:22:57,061 --> 01:23:02,061
but they had like some really bizarre
demands as far as their ability to enact

1779
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:06,490
censorship.
And then on top of it they have no

1780
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:11,550
laws when it comes to enforcing
copyright protection and um,

1781
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:16,030
and,
and fraudulent items like they have full

1782
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:18,970
apple stores in China that are all
fakes.

1783
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,100
It's 100 percent counterfeit.
Yup.

1784
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,530
It has a giant apple logo.
You go in there,

1785
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,140
you buy apple laptops,
they all have the right names,

1786
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:30,160
the right specifications.
All of it's fake and apple can't do

1787
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:31,670
anything about.
I can't do a damn thing.

1788
01:23:31,671 --> 01:23:34,990
I can't do a damn thing.
There's nothing they can do and the

1789
01:23:34,991 --> 01:23:36,320
government's not going to do shitty
there.

1790
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,740
There's just what they do.
Look at this.

1791
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,800
This is a fake apple store.
It's in China and it looks exactly like

1792
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,280
crazy.
It has the same images on the wall.

1793
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:51,160
They copied the images.
It is top of the logo.

1794
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,710
Now that you know it is off just a
little bit.

1795
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,660
Not really.
I wouldn't think so.

1796
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,830
I wouldn't think so at all.

1797
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,750
Look to it.
It has all the same ads.

1798
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:02,230
They steal everything.
They steal all the ads.

1799
01:24:02,231 --> 01:24:05,380
They steal the font,
they steal the same sort of tables,

1800
01:24:05,381 --> 01:24:08,530
the thick,
you know earthy wooden tables that make

1801
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:12,250
you feel good when you sit down on those
are our children and it's spelled store

1802
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:17,251
wrong.
S t e r s t o u r get away with it.

1803
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,490
That's the one thing we do.
No,

1804
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:20,030
no,
no.

1805
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,570
Your apple store.
Apple store.

1806
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,610
This can't be common though.
Oh yeah.

1807
01:24:24,611 --> 01:24:25,450
It's common.
It is.

1808
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:26,440
Yeah.
It is common.

1809
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,021
Yeah.
They,

1810
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:30,100
they just do this constantly.
There's a problem with this.

1811
01:24:30,101 --> 01:24:34,420
In the archery world,
there's a company called rage.

1812
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,760
They make probably the most popular
broadhead for hunting.

1813
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:44,560
It's called a rage hypodermic.
It's a very complicated design because

1814
01:24:44,561 --> 01:24:46,390
it's what's called a mechanical
broadhead.

1815
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:51,430
And what this means is with archery,
a lot of the accuracy in archery

1816
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:54,010
involves drag,
like how little drag you have,

1817
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:58,750
meaning how much air impacts the Arrow
wind drift things on those lines.

1818
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,380
And uh,
when you have an Arrow that's cutting

1819
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:06,040
through the air,
like it has to be aerodynamic and it has

1820
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:09,100
to operate in a specific way.
So the most accurate ones are these,

1821
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,460
these arrowheads that are called
mechanical broadheads.

1822
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:15,060
The problem with these things is they,
um,

1823
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:18,910
they open up on impact,
so they hit and then they open up and

1824
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:22,480
they create this huge wound channel.
So it goes open to like two inches.

1825
01:25:22,481 --> 01:25:26,530
But everything has to be like high
quality steel,

1826
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:30,040
razor sharp blades that it has to fit
perfectly.

1827
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:33,130
The tolerances are incredibly small
because everything has to be.

1828
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:36,160
You're talking about like to be an
ethical hunter,

1829
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,130
you have to not just be good at it.
You have to make an accurate shot,

1830
01:25:39,131 --> 01:25:41,170
you have to practice and you have to
have the best equipment.

1831
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:43,030
Right?
So this is like one of the best pieces

1832
01:25:43,031 --> 01:25:46,840
of equipment you could buy if it's real.
But the problem is they're making fake

1833
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:50,470
ones in China.
No blades are dull and the metals cheap

1834
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:52,360
and they break off.
Are they selling them here?

1835
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,680
They don't know.
People don't know.

1836
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,150
They don't even know if they're buying
him.

1837
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:58,540
I mean you could buy them from a
disreputable company that's getting them

1838
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:00,340
from China and they look exactly the
same.

1839
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,200
She,
it has the same logo,

1840
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:04,190
the same fonts.
And when you buy

1841
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,390
these things,
you're shooting amount on animal,

1842
01:26:06,391 --> 01:26:11,180
like it's entirely likely you're
shooting a cheap piece of steel against

1843
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:14,090
China.
And for this company that's put all this

1844
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:16,130
money,
this company a rage that's put

1845
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:20,150
incredible amounts of money and
resources and designing this incredible

1846
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:22,900
piece of archery hunting equipment
there.

1847
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:27,710
They're fucking pissed.
Of course China is ruthless.

1848
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:31,850
I mean with us like that with all that
stuff we're saying that like if

1849
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,080
she's dead right,
she died,

1850
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:37,220
she did die.
She was nice.

1851
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,430
She was a,
the whole poaching problem in Africa.

1852
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,900
China.
Yeah,

1853
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,280
yeah,
yeah.

1854
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:46,990
They don't get what they want.
They want Rhino Horn and uh,

1855
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:49,220
they'll pay millions of dollars for
seeing what it does to your Dick.

1856
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,500
No,
it doesn't do anything.

1857
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,560
Let's check and see if they're paying
attention.

1858
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:58,550
So funny.
Are you really happy for a second?

1859
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:02,150
Because they were saying because they
were talking about how they work in this

1860
01:27:02,151 --> 01:27:05,090
whole like Serengeti area.
They have like a place just for rhinos.

1861
01:27:05,091 --> 01:27:07,790
It's the only animal that they've walled
off because they were in there trying to

1862
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:09,620
protect it from these poachers.
Credible.

1863
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:10,940
And uh,
I was like,

1864
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:14,540
the only explanation is do something
here to.

1865
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:16,860
Well,
do you see that they three d printed a

1866
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,690
fake rhino horns.
Oh,

1867
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,870
use cellulose and all the different
things.

1868
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:22,100
I guess it's cellulose,
right?

1869
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:26,450
Like what are they used to make them.
But they are three d printing,

1870
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:27,920
fake rhino,
Horn.

1871
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:30,560
Brilliant.
That literally the seemed to be rhino

1872
01:27:30,561 --> 01:27:31,900
horns to,
to collectors.

1873
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,290
They're going to flood the market with
them.

1874
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,420
That's great.
It is great.

1875
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,460
But it's.
They should also put chips in.

1876
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:38,720
I'm in busted with people buying it.

1877
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:41,780
Yeah.
But you don't tell him don't give a

1878
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:43,400
fuck.
Who Cares?

1879
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,900
Yeah.
So you've got another dude who kills

1880
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:46,000
rhinos.
We're gonna.

1881
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,600
We're just.
So we'll just go to the Tigers,

1882
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:52,100
get some tiger dick next.
I went by a in Tanzania next to the

1883
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:54,980
Serengeti,
like the Serengeti is this huge national

1884
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,790
preserve and the place where I stayed,
this Guy Paul Tudor Jones,

1885
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:03,440
who's a focusing is a guy in New York
because in New York,

1886
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:06,560
Hedge Fund guy who a philanthroper now
and uh,

1887
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:11,540
he bought all the land next to the
Serengeti where people were poaching and

1888
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:13,430
people were destroyed.
The whole population.

1889
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:16,940
There were no animals and he went in,
bought the land,

1890
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,240
bought up all the hunting licenses from
the,

1891
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:25,300
from Tanzania for 99 years,
and in 10 years time it just exploded

1892
01:28:27,021 --> 01:28:29,750
with animals.
The whole population is back.

1893
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,450
Wow.
Poaching is major,

1894
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:33,284
Major,
major problem.

1895
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,860
Here's the problem with poaching,
um,

1896
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,960
the word poaching [inaudible].
A lot of it is really fucking poor

1897
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:45,710
people that are just trying to survive.
So like to say that like poaching is an

1898
01:28:45,711 --> 01:28:49,280
issue in Africa.
Poverty is an issue in Africa,

1899
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:52,220
right?
Poaching is a symptom of the poverty in

1900
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:53,180
Africa,
getting lunch,

1901
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:57,440
not even necessarily talking about like
the big money stuff like the ivory trade

1902
01:28:57,441 --> 01:29:00,710
and the Rhino Horn trade.
That can be applied to that as well.

1903
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,040
But a big part of poaching

1904
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,200
is just meat is just eating.
Stealing meat.

1905
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:05,700
Yeah.
They call them poachers,

1906
01:29:05,701 --> 01:29:08,040
but what they really are is that they're
hunters.

1907
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:10,710
They're aren't property owners right now
and these guys,

1908
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:11,760
they run around,
they,

1909
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:14,730
they do snares to catch these animal and
snares.

1910
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:16,560
They,
they have these really shitty,

1911
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,400
almost like musket,
like guns that they've devised,

1912
01:29:19,401 --> 01:29:21,600
like really similar to take a rifle and
they,

1913
01:29:21,601 --> 01:29:24,180
but they don't have bullets so they uh,
rocks in it.

1914
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:28,860
They put things in it and then they pack
in gunpowder and they light it and make

1915
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:31,830
it blow like a,
like a fucking rifle or like a musket.

1916
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:32,720
It's,
yeah,

1917
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:34,800
they use some really shitty.
I mean some of them.

1918
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:37,390
Yeah,
I know you can't put your western.

1919
01:29:37,391 --> 01:29:39,790
You can.
I know there's a tendency to put

1920
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,310
everything through our western prism and
be like,

1921
01:29:42,311 --> 01:29:43,900
you know,
this is just a horrible thing,

1922
01:29:43,901 --> 01:29:47,650
but when you go through these villages
where they literally are walking a mile

1923
01:29:47,651 --> 01:29:50,290
for water and you know,
you get meat,

1924
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:52,030
that's like a big thing.
I mean look,

1925
01:29:52,031 --> 01:29:54,790
these people,
it was my wife's birthday when we were

1926
01:29:54,791 --> 01:29:57,430
there.
They don't have the phrase happy

1927
01:29:57,431 --> 01:30:00,040
birthday.
They don't celebrate birthdays.

1928
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:04,240
Like they said,
it's because you'll have to have gifts,

1929
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:06,520
will have to take time away from
working.

1930
01:30:06,521 --> 01:30:09,280
We'll have to do.
They just never came up with the concept

1931
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,040
happy birthday because their life is
hard.

1932
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,630
They don't have a lot of,
uh,

1933
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,900
a lot of,
they don't have a word for dessert,

1934
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:19,540
they don't celebrate,
they're hardworking,

1935
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,230
surviving people.
So just to the point that you're right,

1936
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:27,600
there are a lot of people that just need
meet for their family and they're not

1937
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:31,600
thinking that a tourist from La is
coming in and wants to take pictures of,

1938
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:33,700
of the Zebra,
you know what I mean?

1939
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:37,660
But there's gotta be a way to Parse it
out because China's still is a huge

1940
01:30:37,661 --> 01:30:41,530
problem and they're taking all these
animals for endangered animals,

1941
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,540
not for meat.
You know what I mean?

1942
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:46,450
They're coming in and taking rhinos are,
they're taking cheetahs,

1943
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:49,930
were not many survive.
Even just the nature taking Cheetah's

1944
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,020
just for the coats they'd like to make
hats out of them.

1945
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:54,250
Really?
Cheetahs,

1946
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:56,440
I don't know,
probably jockstraps.

1947
01:30:56,441 --> 01:31:00,140
It's all jockstrap.
All the steps in China.

1948
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:03,260
You don't know that well,
you've seen the Cheetah judge

1949
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,123
jockstraps,
right?

1950
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:07,060
Most of the articles I'm finding on pull
it up,

1951
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:08,320
three d printed rhino horns.
Yeah.

1952
01:31:08,321 --> 01:31:09,070
That,
uh,

1953
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:11,640
they have them in their make or there is
a couple of companies that aren't going

1954
01:31:11,641 --> 01:31:13,690
to start making them the,
but there are people that are saying

1955
01:31:13,691 --> 01:31:16,630
it's not a good idea to have them
introduce because it's going to cause

1956
01:31:16,631 --> 01:31:20,380
more problems than they're already
having with just the real ones.

1957
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:22,120
They look real.
But the thing is,

1958
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:24,160
is that a real.
Are those real or fake?

1959
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:26,290
These are the picture I'm showing is
real ones,

1960
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:30,490
but a national geographic problems that
are going to come.

1961
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:34,080
It's so fucked up that what's killing
these crazy animals.

1962
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:36,950
So we're going to miss so much.
I know a dinosaur.

1963
01:31:36,951 --> 01:31:37,990
It's a dinosaur.
It's,

1964
01:31:37,991 --> 01:31:40,350
it's like a stegosaurus or something.
It might as well be.

1965
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:44,610
But what's killing them is this
erroneous idea that the horns make your

1966
01:31:44,611 --> 01:31:45,480
dick hard.
I mean,

1967
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:50,580
if that's not symptomatic or symbolic of
how fucking bizarre humans are.

1968
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:56,130
And meanwhile at the same time there's
plenty of fucking pills that actually do

1969
01:31:56,131 --> 01:31:58,500
the job.
It's not like you're asking these rhino

1970
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:00,040
horns to do something that no pill could

1971
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:05,040
do.
We've solved this problem to see Anna

1972
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:08,170
Nicole Smith,
j Howard Marshall,

1973
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:11,980
that old guy who married a creepy dude.
He's like in his eighties and he married

1974
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:15,520
that big titted sloppy slut.
Why did he do that?

1975
01:32:15,521 --> 01:32:18,040
Because they had Viagra finally.
You could fucker.

1976
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:23,080
It's right on a bit of money.
He just fucking kept his cowboy boots on

1977
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:25,780
and that is a great point.
It's like why?

1978
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:28,060
Why the Rhino thing?
Exactly.

1979
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:31,480
But it's,
but it's not probably not just for their

1980
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,580
hard on.
It's probably also because they think

1981
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:35,080
they can cure cancer with it.
No,

1982
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,340
no.
It's really more.

1983
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:38,110
There's j Howard Marshall and Anna
Nicole.

1984
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,060
It's really,
I think more of anything.

1985
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,340
A status symbol.
You come over a man's house,

1986
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:44,710
you have some rhino.
T both were,

1987
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:45,970
you know,
expense.

1988
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,040
Cheetah,
expensive to leap.

1989
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,480
Watches,
you know,

1990
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,150
you drive a Ferrari.
He has a Rolls Royce.

1991
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:54,010
You talk about real estate.

1992
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,710
You're buying and you do something.
You would pull out a Cuban cigar.

1993
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:58,810
Tom,
where'd you get the Cubans?

1994
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:00,950
Hey,
I got a buddy who lives in Miami and

1995
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,373
let's,
let's,

1996
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,750
let's sit out on the back porch and
pretend we're gentlemen.

1997
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,430
I mean there's so many people that never
fucking smoke cigars and it gets so

1998
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:13,510
pumped about getting a Cuban Cuban Cuban
on what?

1999
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:16,120
Gun?
With a gun to oil de Monterrey double

2000
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:18,730
corona.
Lots of fat.

2001
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:22,000
When I looked at afterwards today,
it's just a fake with a label on it.

2002
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:25,540
Going to do a whole lot of those.
I can tell the difference.

2003
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,430
I used to box,
I was buy real ones,

2004
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:30,940
but I used to buy real ones that would
pretend they're fake from London.

2005
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:34,390
That's to order them from London.
They would send them to be from a

2006
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:37,330
tobacco.
Is that what they call them in London?

2007
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:41,920
Tobacco.
They would send me the actual labels.

2008
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:46,420
Like weeks later they'd send these
things to me in boxes and they would

2009
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:49,680
just be labeled Dominican cigars and
then I get it,

2010
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,180
but I,
I had specific cigars that I would ask

2011
01:33:52,181 --> 01:33:54,470
for such a stupid.
As soon as I started smoking weed at

2012
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:57,360
dumped that habit.
Don't you like this nonsense?

2013
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:58,780
You don't find it enjoyable.
I do.

2014
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,643
I do.
I do.

2015
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,230
But it's just.
There's something about it that's very

2016
01:34:02,231 --> 01:34:04,860
fetishy.
There's something about it that's very

2017
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:08,410
effected.
It's like you're putting on airs.

2018
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,420
Definitely.
Yeah.

2019
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:12,370
When I smoke.
So a guy with a fat face and he's got a

2020
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:13,150
cigar.
I'm like,

2021
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:14,620
Oh,
what is this dip shit have to say,

2022
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,760
yeah.
Everyone on the cover of Cigar

2023
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:17,620
Aficionado.
It looks like an asshole.

2024
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:19,840
I have you stand this Myelin.
Yeah,

2025
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:23,590
come on,
but when you're just being that asshole

2026
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:26,500
like night,
ever make it onto the cover of cigar

2027
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:27,334
aficionado.

2028
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:29,560
Please find out if that's a good
question.

2029
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:31,660
He always had a cigar.
He was a good spokesman for the brand

2030
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:36,040
that
that is the part of the appeal.

2031
01:34:36,041 --> 01:34:37,720
You do sit back and just say,
you know what?

2032
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:39,190
Yeah,
yeah.

2033
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:41,440
I'm all right.
Sit back.

2034
01:34:41,441 --> 01:34:42,530
Everything's good.
Yeah,

2035
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:43,470
I'm here.
All right.

2036
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:46,900
I got a guy when I got my family back
from that vacation and nobody had

2037
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:51,901
malaria or cuts or any emergencies and I
got them all the way back from Africa.

2038
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,710
I sat out back with one and I was like,
yeah,

2039
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:57,560
yeah,
yeah.

2040
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,110
Back here in California,
back here.

2041
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,020
I might vote Republican.
I don't give a fuck.

2042
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:06,080
I am a lion.
How about we give Donald Trump a chance

2043
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:07,460
to make America great again?
No,

2044
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:10,880
you're going too far.
You're taking them to Sean Combs.

2045
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:13,850
Look at them looking like an asshole.
Everyone looks like an a little tiny

2046
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:14,150
hands.

2047
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:16,290
Jack Nicholson is the only one that
doesn't look like an asshole.

2048
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,140
Hands are.
Yeah,

2049
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:19,430
Jack.
Jack was made for it,

2050
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,530
but Jack Nicholson also looks like you
didn't pose.

2051
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,270
Is there something wrong with his hands
or is it me?

2052
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,970
Is Puff.
Daddy's hands are very small.

2053
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:31,250
They're in front of him.
They look weird way out in front of him.

2054
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,010
The perspective looks weird,
but they're small,

2055
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:39,220
so like if you put it up to his chest,
he got a little baby hands with the guy.

2056
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,820
He played sugar Ray Leonard and that
knew Roberto Duran movie.

2057
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:46,600
Usher can box apparently.
No.

2058
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:47,480
Yeah,
yeah.

2059
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,220
Hands of stone.
Yeah,

2060
01:35:49,221 --> 01:35:52,970
he played.
He played sugar ray and everyone looks

2061
01:35:52,971 --> 01:35:56,060
like an asshole.
Let's pull up the most foolish covers of

2062
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:59,210
popular cigar,
cigar aficionado.

2063
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:01,850
Jack Nicholson looks great.
Vince Vaughn looks pretty douchey right

2064
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:02,480
there.
Yep.

2065
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,550
Click that.
What the fuck?

2066
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:05,660
What do you plot and things?

2067
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,980
Hey,
as brothers kind of thing that we have

2068
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:11,350
together.
Hey,

2069
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:16,460
you cannot look.
Do you all look like an idiot?

2070
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,413
Oh,
Charlie.

2071
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:22,160
Charlie Sheen,
cigar smoking aids.

2072
01:36:22,161 --> 01:36:27,161
I don't give a fuck.
Everybody was waiting until he got HIV.

2073
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:31,070
They smell so bad.
You can't have one without thinking.

2074
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:33,620
What is this?
Screw everybody.

2075
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:35,970
You know what I mean?
Oh,

2076
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,100
you smoke a cigar.
You're saying,

2077
01:36:37,101 --> 01:36:38,510
fuck you guys.
I'm smoking this.

2078
01:36:38,511 --> 01:36:40,190
I know it's awful,
but I'm enjoying it.

2079
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:43,940
So when you see a guy with it,
that's what you're seeing in his eyes.

2080
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:47,060
He looks pretty good.
You know,

2081
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:51,350
he purposely adds weight.
He puts weight on and keeps weighed on

2082
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:54,590
because it fills his face in and he
keeps him from looking wrinkly.

2083
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:57,770
That's how rooker should take that
advice because.

2084
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:58,641
Well,
I'll broke her.

2085
01:36:58,641 --> 01:36:59,474
Did the opposite.

2086
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:04,850
You know Joe Manchin's pretty good.
Do you know that guy has a gun nut?

2087
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:06,980
Izzy?
He's got a gun show.

2088
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:10,470
I've watched his gun show.
He's got a gun show in the sports

2089
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,680
channel.
Yes,

2090
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:13,210
he does.
Yes,

2091
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:14,240
he does.
I watched it.

2092
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,860
You're thinking of Joe Montonya?
No,

2093
01:37:16,861 --> 01:37:17,210
no,
no.

2094
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:21,150
Joe Montana.
He has a fucking gun history show and he

2095
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:23,650
shoots guns constantly.
That's great.

2096
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,660
These are gun nut,
like a full on second amendment.

2097
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:29,230
No,
no,

2098
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:31,700
I don't say that in a negative way.
I like guns.

2099
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,310
I do too,
but it's like a helix,

2100
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,400
right?
I'm sure he's not going to be open to

2101
01:37:37,401 --> 01:37:40,850
any ideas.
Maybe see gun stories.

2102
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:42,420
Is the name of his show bad?
It's great.

2103
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:44,930
It's a gun nut.
It's got a gold pistol there.

2104
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:48,950
I bet he's rock hard right now.
I bet he's like Anthony Wiener.

2105
01:37:48,951 --> 01:37:51,920
Rock hard,
like strapped down inside his boxer

2106
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:53,870
shorts,
so fucking angry.

2107
01:37:53,871 --> 01:37:56,550
Hog.
Ready to go.

2108
01:37:56,551 --> 01:37:59,130
He really loves guns.
It's a fucking show.

2109
01:37:59,131 --> 01:38:01,560
It's on the outdoor channel.
Watch the show.

2110
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:06,320
Does it make me less of a man that my
passion is bread?

2111
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,100
No,
no.

2112
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:10,940
You're the salt of sour dough.
It's not just that you're passionate

2113
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:12,470
bread.
You take it to a whole new level.

2114
01:38:12,471 --> 01:38:14,630
Thank you.
You were featured in the New York Times.

2115
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:15,500
Thank you,
Joe.

2116
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:18,950
This Joe Montana thing is interesting
though because I haven't seen him in

2117
01:38:18,951 --> 01:38:23,210
movies in a long time and he's a
brilliant actor and now this guy has

2118
01:38:23,211 --> 01:38:27,320
been in some fucking amazing movies.
Now what he does,

2119
01:38:27,321 --> 01:38:29,150
he took all that money.
Just shoot shit.

2120
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:32,090
He golfs a lot too.
I think he's always looking in those

2121
01:38:32,091 --> 01:38:33,320
golf tournament.
It might be one of them,

2122
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:35,270
Arizona dudes.
You know,

2123
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:39,170
Arizona,
Arizona to this day is the God damn wild

2124
01:38:39,171 --> 01:38:41,840
west.
It's the Florida of the southwest.

2125
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:44,840
You know what I mean?
A lot of people end up there with their

2126
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:46,010
own ideas.
Oh,

2127
01:38:46,011 --> 01:38:47,330
they've got their own ideas.
Yeah,

2128
01:38:47,331 --> 01:38:49,790
and that's why they had that sheriff
that put everybody in pink underwear.

2129
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:52,040
Yeah,
he's still there.

2130
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,010
Aleppo.
So a power pio.

2131
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,480
Joe Arpaio.
Yeah.

2132
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:58,940
He just got in trouble.
He's good buddies with Steven Seagal.

2133
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:01,010
He'll get them out of trouble.
Steven will get them out of trouble.

2134
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:05,330
Was that video reel with Steven Seagal?
Was like Brando size now.

2135
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,550
He was doing movies and yeah,
he's enormous.

2136
01:39:07,551 --> 01:39:09,650
He's really big.
He's enormous.

2137
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:11,180
Yeah.
I've run into with the UFC a bunch of

2138
01:39:11,181 --> 01:39:13,930
times.
He has the skills just

2139
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:16,670
well.
Um,

2140
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:22,460
what low skills are he's good at?
He's good at those things that he's

2141
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,333
doing

2142
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:26,570
in those movies.
Would those things actually work?

2143
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,830
No,
they would not work.

2144
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:31,400
Right.
What you're seeing in those things is a,

2145
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:33,830
some what you would call active
compliance,

2146
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:37,920
so voluntary compliance maybe where
someone look up videos.

2147
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,930
It's hilarious.
It looks like you're running around.

2148
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,060
He's riding around with this.
A bunch of people I've got to kill and

2149
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:47,240
he's just got this enormous gut.
He's huge.

2150
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:51,290
He keeps making these movies and I'm
sure they do really well and foreign

2151
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:52,190
markets,
you know?

2152
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,990
Yeah.
It's probably one of those things where

2153
01:39:53,991 --> 01:39:56,450
if you're in Bulgaria,
it's like Steven Seagal night every

2154
01:39:56,451 --> 01:39:58,880
Tuesday.
It almost looks like he's kidding,

2155
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:00,970
right?
Like the way he holds the gun and so

2156
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:04,340
big.
Joe Montana,

2157
01:40:04,341 --> 01:40:08,210
by the way,
was in criminal minds when sharp 105

2158
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:12,260
episodes and just stopped this year.
Who is this guy that I've seen this guy

2159
01:40:12,261 --> 01:40:15,080
before?
Who's The guy?

2160
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:16,490
The White Guy,
that guy.

2161
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:17,690
Oh yeah.
I have seen him,

2162
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:20,840
uh,
say that code of honor.

2163
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,780
Whole 2016.
Oh,

2164
01:40:23,781 --> 01:40:25,250
it's coming.
It's coming out now.

2165
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:28,050
Is a bomb about to go off and I have a
knife.

2166
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:29,420
Ooh.
Watch me walk away.

2167
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:34,630
Do the classic dyed his hair is to walk
away without looking back as the bomb

2168
01:40:35,151 --> 01:40:36,040
goes off.
Yeah.

2169
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,680
That is original and awesome.
Who's The guy?

2170
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:42,920
Who's the other guy that,
uh,

2171
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:47,930
that other guy that's in those movies?
Say Craig Schaeffer.

2172
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,780
Okay.
Oh,

2173
01:40:50,781 --> 01:40:51,770
you know,
that guy is,

2174
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:54,550
that guy's in movie a river runs through
it.

2175
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:58,210
You know?
Does that him?

2176
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:01,360
He was Brad Pitt's brother in that
movie.

2177
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:06,220
There's a hell that some actors fall
into.

2178
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:07,030
Yeah,
that's him then.

2179
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:12,030
Oh yeah.
There's a hell at some actors fall into.

2180
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,920
Wow.
I think that dude's nutty though.

2181
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,380
I think that guy's very nutty.
I think he is nutty.

2182
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,830
I was at a restaurant once and that guy
was like a talking to a couple.

2183
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:22,660
He's eating by himself with a Bandana
on.

2184
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:26,620
He was talking to a couple about someone
being an old soul.

2185
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:28,100
Oh God.
Just one of the things.

2186
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:28,871
Is that him?
Wow.

2187
01:41:28,871 --> 01:41:30,550
He looks so different.
He's got a wig on.

2188
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:33,100
It's definitely not hair.
Yeah.

2189
01:41:33,101 --> 01:41:34,930
But what's going on there?
Back Up.

2190
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:36,110
Back Up.
Jamie.

2191
01:41:36,110 --> 01:41:39,070
Why you getting away from that wig?
What's happening there?

2192
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,270
What's going on?
Let's put a wig on it.

2193
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:44,530
Is he crying?
Is that a mouse?

2194
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:45,430
Oh,
that's your cursor.

2195
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,330
Um,
yeah.

2196
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:51,310
That guy was in a lot of good shit
though.

2197
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,550
Then now he's doing these weird movies.
Joe Montana works.

2198
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,133
Yeah,
I'm sure.

2199
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,990
Criminal minds.
He was in a really big series.

2200
01:41:59,080 --> 01:41:59,940
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2201
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:01,740
Going to yes.
Just like.

2202
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,311
Oh,
that's right.

2203
01:42:03,311 --> 01:42:06,610
He was in that fucking,
that horror movie to that Craig

2204
01:42:06,610 --> 01:42:09,220
Schaeffer Guy was in that horror movie.
Remember that weird horror movie that

2205
01:42:09,221 --> 01:42:11,600
was based on the Fox?
His name?

2206
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:12,761
No,
no,

2207
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:13,091
no,
no.

2208
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:15,190
Not that one.
What movie was that?

2209
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:16,150
Uh,
I don't know.

2210
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,160
Johnny.
Scary face.

2211
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:23,370
I forget the fucking movie man.
But it was a,

2212
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,740
it was.
There was a guy who wrote tales from the

2213
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:27,790
crypt.
So is it night?

2214
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:30,240
Read ascension night.
Read.

2215
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,270
He's best known at horror fans is to
starve nightbreed.

2216
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:36,200
Nightbreed might read he.
Sure that's.

2217
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:39,310
That might be reading goodnight moon and
that seems like a Typo.

2218
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,980
It's really serious.
Go try nightbreed.

2219
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:46,190
I hate breed.
Yeah.

2220
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:48,051
Night.
Yeah.

2221
01:42:48,051 --> 01:42:51,410
Who made that movie man?
Because it was one of those.

2222
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:54,030
We'll look at that.
Who is the,

2223
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,460
uh,
the director and writer,

2224
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:57,160
that movie.
It looks like a Halloween show because

2225
01:42:57,170 --> 01:43:00,170
he was a famous sort of a,
a clive barker.

2226
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,210
Clive Barker.
That was clive barker.

2227
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:03,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

2228
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:06,620
Clive Barker made a bunch of like really
freaky fucking movies,

2229
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:11,000
like really interesting,
weird takes on horror and apparently a

2230
01:43:11,001 --> 01:43:12,040
very good writer.
Right.

2231
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:13,660
Like his books.
My,

2232
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:14,870
I'm not making that up.
Right,

2233
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,790
right.
You don't think so?

2234
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,970
I don't think you're making it.
Okay.

2235
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,230
Yeah,
I think that's where it all started out

2236
01:43:21,231 --> 01:43:22,850
as from his writing.
Uh,

2237
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,590
I think he was a famous horror writer.
Yeah.

2238
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,070
And then they did a few of his movies
back in the day,

2239
01:43:28,071 --> 01:43:29,450
but for whatever reason they didn't
catch on.

2240
01:43:29,451 --> 01:43:32,720
But nightbreed was a really interesting
one and that Craig Schaeffer guy was in

2241
01:43:32,721 --> 01:43:33,554
that.

2242
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:38,000
He was he.
Was He ever on Cigar Aficionado?

2243
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:39,710
No.
Never made it.

2244
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,210
But Brad probably did.
You probably get mad bought,

2245
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:48,560
bought the issue.
Fucking Brad on this shit out here is

2246
01:43:48,561 --> 01:43:53,561
fat guys throwing kicks at me.
Fucking hell man,

2247
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,710
because I.
Bryan County is a great guy to talk to

2248
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:04,010
the stop because Brian Cowen knows a lot
of those actors.

2249
01:44:04,011 --> 01:44:05,590
He knows a lot of actors,
right?

2250
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:10,240
And he's had friends that were like
really famous actors at one point right

2251
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,370
now.
They have been forced to take these gigs

2252
01:44:13,371 --> 01:44:15,140
whenever they can get them right and you
know,

2253
01:44:15,141 --> 01:44:18,020
they're away from their family for
months at a time and they don't make

2254
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:20,690
much money and their hope is that this
does well.

2255
01:44:20,691 --> 01:44:24,320
And then eventually it's like you're in
a holding pattern hoping that you catch

2256
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:27,950
fire with a good,
a good film and then it gets you into

2257
01:44:27,951 --> 01:44:29,090
another film and then you're back.

2258
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:31,700
But when you drop off,
and especially if there's a

2259
01:44:31,701 --> 01:44:34,250
transitionary period between you being a
30 year old man,

2260
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:38,000
be in a 50 year old man,
those 50 year old guys are Foxville

2261
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:41,000
further fucked right.
Nobody wants you until you're 60.

2262
01:44:41,001 --> 01:44:43,610
And then if someone's dad it,
there's like this period of time where

2263
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:47,690
you're not quite old enough to be a dad,
you're definitely not old enough to be

2264
01:44:47,691 --> 01:44:49,860
the.
Not Young enough to be the hot guy.

2265
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:52,360
Yeah.
You can't be really an ass kicker.

2266
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:54,260
Nobody's going to believe it.
You know,

2267
01:44:54,261 --> 01:44:57,830
like Steven Seagal has to do all kinds
of crazy shit to be maintained as

2268
01:44:57,831 --> 01:44:59,510
kicking status.
All dying.

2269
01:44:59,511 --> 01:45:01,130
His beard,
his beard died.

2270
01:45:01,131 --> 01:45:04,130
The hares,
the hares have a masterpiece.

2271
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:06,380
It's a lot going on.
Maybe it's doing the shatner thing.

2272
01:45:06,381 --> 01:45:08,090
Maybe he's like,
I'll just put the weight on and just be

2273
01:45:08,091 --> 01:45:08,630
a bigger guy.

2274
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:09,920
Good move.
Good move.

2275
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:12,980
Apparently Schachner says keeps your
face fall.

2276
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:15,670
It's like the opposite of hits his
version of Collagen.

2277
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,570
Just fill it up.
It's pretty smart.

2278
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,250
Just fill that.
He doesn't on purpose.

2279
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:21,590
He really,
allegedly,

2280
01:45:21,591 --> 01:45:25,940
he says he might just be an excuse for
why he just drinks every night.

2281
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,290
Right?
He can't stop drinking.

2282
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:29,133
I,
uh,

2283
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:31,730
but I,
he looked pretty good on cigar fishing.

2284
01:45:31,731 --> 01:45:32,960
I would.
Jack Nicholson,

2285
01:45:32,961 --> 01:45:37,040
I think agreed is the best.
If they called you tomorrow,

2286
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:38,030
would you do it?
Yeah.

2287
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:40,700
What would you do?
Oh,

2288
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:44,600
that's a good wolf.
Is there a way to do it and uh,

2289
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:47,840
not be wacky or Douchey?
Just you holding it is.

2290
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:49,490
Do you feel Douchey?
Yeah.

2291
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:51,740
How about you just stand there and it
just says,

2292
01:45:51,741 --> 01:45:53,720
trust me,
I smoke cigars and there's no cigar

2293
01:45:53,721 --> 01:45:54,950
insight.
Look at that.

2294
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,400
Yeah.
Does not work.

2295
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,010
Yeah,
I know how many takes that was.

2296
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:02,630
If that was one picture.
Oh,

2297
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,700
if he was just there,
he pulled up in this car.

2298
01:46:04,701 --> 01:46:05,810
Hey,
how y'all doing?

2299
01:46:05,811 --> 01:46:07,370
And they took a picture and he had the
cigar.

2300
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:08,481
Bam.
Cool.

2301
01:46:08,481 --> 01:46:11,010
Let's see.
The problem with those photos is there

2302
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:12,440
not candidate?
Not.

2303
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:16,010
If you're an intelligent person that
understands that and you're watching

2304
01:46:16,011 --> 01:46:20,090
these fucking magazine stands,
you know that there was some douchey and

2305
01:46:20,091 --> 01:46:24,420
evolve and making this cover.
That's one of Andre's Lee.

2306
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:26,810
Hey y'all.
I got a white hat on because I'm a good

2307
01:46:26,811 --> 01:46:28,460
guy.
You want me to go with the black hat

2308
01:46:28,461 --> 01:46:30,530
now?
You want me to have a white hat?

2309
01:46:30,531 --> 01:46:32,480
Sort of a guy according to my record
label.

2310
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:35,950
So that Jeremy Pivot down there.
Oh,

2311
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,910
does he have a glass in his hand or was.
No,

2312
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:39,620
no,
they changed outfits.

2313
01:46:39,621 --> 01:46:41,750
There was a makeup lady.
You know what I mean?

2314
01:46:41,751 --> 01:46:43,730
It's good for Sutherland.
Oh,

2315
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:45,350
what's this?
No Cigar.

2316
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:47,990
Cute.
There's no fucking cigar.

2317
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,130
Yeah,
him and Deniro.

2318
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:52,230
Hey,
what the fuck is this Kiefer?

2319
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:53,573
Listen,
Pussy.

2320
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:57,190
You're scared to pull it off.
We'll get cramer bond.

2321
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,380
No,
Sukar White.

2322
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,940
Go to a Kramer's over.
By the way.

2323
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,790
Best James Bond by far,
right?

2324
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:04,290
Daniel Craig.
No one's even close.

2325
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:05,700
He's the coolest.
Oh,

2326
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:09,870
Kramer.
Kramer is lovable.

2327
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:11,460
You know he's thinking when he's holding
that cigar.

2328
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,790
I love black people.
Yeah,

2329
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:16,470
just thinking,
thinking,

2330
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:19,650
thinking.
That word rhymes with bigger.

2331
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:24,210
Danny Devito.
He's got something going on.

2332
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:25,770
What is he doing?
He's lighting it.

2333
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,890
There's too many.
Too many takes there.

2334
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:32,240
There's no.
There was more than one take.

2335
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:38,000
I can pull it off on the inside.
I don't care.

2336
01:47:38,001 --> 01:47:41,060
This is good for publicity.
This is good for my image.

2337
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,050
When I smoke is the God gives you the
feeling.

2338
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:47,780
Prosperity.
I live in a mansion in the palisades and

2339
01:47:47,781 --> 01:47:52,781
I fuck my maid Dai
gum inside them.

2340
01:47:54,101 --> 01:47:59,101
I don't leave your wallet with me.
I come inside her as well.

2341
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,790
Is cover works.
Adrian Brody,

2342
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:07,700
I'm just sitting here wondering what
happened.

2343
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,230
No,
you're right.

2344
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:12,690
Arnold is the perfect person at
investors to loan.

2345
01:48:12,691 --> 01:48:17,060
Seems fairly candid photos,
but I'm worried there was too many

2346
01:48:17,061 --> 01:48:18,560
takes.
I'm worried.

2347
01:48:18,561 --> 01:48:22,160
They took several takes.
There's a guy who looks pretty fucking

2348
01:48:22,161 --> 01:48:25,370
Jiffy for seven years old.
Even if you are still on and you let it

2349
01:48:25,371 --> 01:48:28,010
go,
you let them put stallone zone as

2350
01:48:28,011 --> 01:48:28,370
you're.

2351
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:29,120
No,
no,

2352
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:30,380
no.
You can't do that.

2353
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:31,783
No,
no,

2354
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:32,623
no.
No.

2355
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:36,320
Zone is pretty good.
I like what you're doing by the way.

2356
01:48:36,321 --> 01:48:38,690
I met that guy.
Fucking super friendly.

2357
01:48:38,691 --> 01:48:41,850
Nice normal self deprecating guy.
Varying.

2358
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,050
He might've been turned on the charm
because I had to interview him for this

2359
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:46,430
thing,
for the UFC once,

2360
01:48:46,431 --> 01:48:49,250
but he was fucking.
I met that guy to Laurence Fishburne.

2361
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:51,980
Fuck.
Super friendly.

2362
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:55,280
Is that Rob Lowe?
Rob Lowe have a cigar in his hand.

2363
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,550
He pulled it off.
Rob [inaudible].

2364
01:48:57,860 --> 01:49:00,570
He's kind of not fiduciary numb by it.
Yeah.

2365
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:04,040
Look at his jacket.
He's got that fucking bouncing jacket on

2366
01:49:04,041 --> 01:49:07,460
that country club jacket that just did
the rest of the rob lowe this weekend,

2367
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:08,450
right?
Yeah.

2368
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:11,390
Why is you have so many layers on?
I'm confused about is white tee shirt

2369
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:14,600
than polo shirt than jacket.
Can someone turn the fucking heat on?

2370
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,910
Why does it robs inside?

2371
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:18,460
Why is it,
why does he have to dress like he's

2372
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:21,140
layering for a backpacking trip in the
Andes?

2373
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,750
But you know,
you hit on something if you,

2374
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,870
if you embrace your.
Do sheree?

2375
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,220
Yeah,
it works if you're,

2376
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:29,780
if you're,
uh,

2377
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:32,780
trying to not be a Douche with it,
it doesn't work.

2378
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:36,170
Cause go down there.
Oh Jesus.

2379
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,990
Oh look.
And he's got a glass of something.

2380
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:40,970
An Espresso.
That's what he jammed them with.

2381
01:49:40,971 --> 01:49:41,541
Right?
Didn't eat.

2382
01:49:41,541 --> 01:49:44,500
Jam Him up with like Cappuccinos.
He put it in a drink.

2383
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:45,363
He did.
He did.

2384
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:48,120
His cappuccinos tastes kind of shitty.
Kind

2385
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:51,790
of pretending it taste good.
Get it fucking roofie in it.

2386
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:54,010
Can't.
Oh my God,

2387
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:56,350
there was one above that.
There was one above that.

2388
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:57,390
Jeremy,
um,

2389
01:49:57,610 --> 01:50:00,100
that I didn't recognize.
The gentleman right to the upper left

2390
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:03,730
with the black blazer on upper left.
Above that one,

2391
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:05,040
right above that one.
No,

2392
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:05,650
no,
no,

2393
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:05,840
no,
no,

2394
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,673
no.
Back where you were,

2395
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:10,600
right.
Go cosby and then go to the left to the

2396
01:50:10,601 --> 01:50:11,500
left.
And that guy.

2397
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:13,780
Who's that fucking guy?
The bomber.

2398
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:16,330
Oh,
what the fuck is that?

2399
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:17,240
Oh,
it's a,

2400
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,330
it's a fake.
It's a matter of looking at.

2401
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:21,220
Oh,
well that will,

2402
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:23,710
that.
What that's doing is that's mocking the

2403
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:27,190
rolling stone cover because rolling
stone put him on the cover and he looks

2404
01:50:27,191 --> 01:50:29,710
like a fucking teen.
Heartthrob was douchey.

2405
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,790
Well,
it was weird.

2406
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:32,530
It was really weird,
but isn't douchey.

2407
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,290
Here's my question.
It's just a photo of them and it is

2408
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:38,080
curious that he,
they took a tremendous amount of

2409
01:50:38,081 --> 01:50:39,100
criticism for this cover.

2410
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:40,330
Okay.
Well,

2411
01:50:40,331 --> 01:50:42,130
I'm looking at this.
What is,

2412
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:45,990
this is just what happened.
Um,

2413
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:47,200
you,
you're looking at this.

2414
01:50:47,201 --> 01:50:51,160
This is just a young man man,
but he has.

2415
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:56,330
I mean he has a cover of a magazine.
It's your job to put things on rolling

2416
01:50:57,341 --> 01:51:00,640
stone and you know how to look at things
that make people feel a certain way,

2417
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:02,770
so maybe they were trying to make them
feel like,

2418
01:51:02,771 --> 01:51:05,080
hey,
he's a monster.

2419
01:51:05,081 --> 01:51:06,310
Can look like this.
Yeah,

2420
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:09,880
but recent listened to the heading.
Highly popular,

2421
01:51:09,881 --> 01:51:13,060
promising student was fueled by his
family,

2422
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:16,210
but what was failed?
Oh,

2423
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:18,430
it was failed.
Was failed by his family,

2424
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,030
fell into radical Islam and became a
monster.

2425
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:24,580
Yeah.
You're making that seed now with the

2426
01:51:24,581 --> 01:51:27,760
headline.
I dislike it even more because now

2427
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:29,680
you're making him seem like he's just a
vulnerable.

2428
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:30,820
Not.
It's not his fault.

2429
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:31,840
You're excusing him.

2430
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,420
I think with that photo and that
headline combined,

2431
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:37,600
it feels to me like you're.
You're letting them off the hook.

2432
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:39,130
Well,
that is a weird question.

2433
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:43,830
Why is it that you do that where you
read a couple letters of a word and just

2434
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,940
fill it in for yourself?
I do that all the time.

2435
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,070
Yeah.
Where I find myself,

2436
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,220
even if I'm wearing reading glasses,
I fill in a word and then I go,

2437
01:51:51,221 --> 01:51:52,054
oh,
what's that word?

2438
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:56,560
For whatever reason I don't.
You just saw the whole world I saw

2439
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:57,350
fueled.
Yeah,

2440
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:58,780
because I was thinking,
okay.

2441
01:51:58,781 --> 01:52:01,960
They would say is fueled by hate or
fueled by his radical religion.

2442
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:03,580
I wouldn't have been so douchey and
corrected you,

2443
01:52:03,581 --> 01:52:05,340
but it didn't change the meaning of it.
Yeah.

2444
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:08,840
But how old is this kid at the time?
Because I think if you're looking at it

2445
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:11,950
like an 18 year old kid,
I mean that's relevant being you have a

2446
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:12,700
14 year old.

2447
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:16,240
Imagine if your kid grew up in some
fucking radical,

2448
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:21,130
crazy fuck had religion.
You could look there.

2449
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,600
There's,
there's a good question though,

2450
01:52:22,601 --> 01:52:24,910
like how did this kid become this
monster?

2451
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,490
How did he become this monster?
His when his brother,

2452
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:29,440
right.
His brother was a big influence.

2453
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,900
His brother definitely was an influence,
but I mean he's,

2454
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:32,711
he's in there,
right?

2455
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:35,530
So he's in this magazine,
he's on the cover and they have this

2456
01:52:35,531 --> 01:52:37,450
picture of him that makes you go,
wow.

2457
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:38,330
Yeah,
what?

2458
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:40,210
What the fuck is wrong with that
picture?

2459
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:44,740
Is What's wrong with it is that he looks
like a cute young guy that shouldn't

2460
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:48,080
have that problem.
They're not saying young heartthrob

2461
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:52,280
contact him behind bars,
they're just showing an actual picture

2462
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:55,790
of what he actually looked like.
How is that any different than the Ted

2463
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:58,190
Bundy photos?
Because the Ted Bundy photos.

2464
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,820
One of the things that was most striking
about Ted Bundy was that he's a very

2465
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:04,150
handsome guy,
so it's kind of fucking crazy

2466
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:06,100
man,
but you don't put them on the cover of

2467
01:53:06,101 --> 01:53:08,800
rolling stone,
which is a space for the people in our

2468
01:53:08,801 --> 01:53:12,250
culture that you worship,
right?

2469
01:53:12,251 --> 01:53:15,850
They didn't put Ted Bundy on the cover
with the rolling stone logo around you.

2470
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:18,040
You know what I mean?
That's.

2471
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:18,993
That's a good point.

2472
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,980
A good point,
but should they bear the burden of that?

2473
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:24,860
Should they be able to be flexible
enough with their covers,

2474
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:27,590
their ideas to just say what happened
here?

2475
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:31,570
We take this guy who could be on our
cover because he's a pop star.

2476
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,760
He could be on the cover because he's a
star.

2477
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:35,360
If some new Sitcom.
It's Hilarious,

2478
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,870
right?
He looks right.

2479
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:40,320
He looks like a star.
He looks like a star and that's what I'm

2480
01:53:40,321 --> 01:53:41,490
saying.
Like these people know,

2481
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:43,980
they know what they're doing when
they're putting that cover on.

2482
01:53:43,981 --> 01:53:46,470
It's you are provoking,
hey,

2483
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:51,270
this is a regular kid that going this
way could have been on the cover of

2484
01:53:51,271 --> 01:53:52,540
rolling stone.
Maybe it's.

2485
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,750
They're definitely creating it to be
thought provoking.

2486
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,460
Bang them in prison.
They put that picture on the bag.

2487
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:02,980
They've got to want to know,
look,

2488
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:05,880
I'm fucking making it here.
Banging this guy.

2489
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,490
Yeah,
he's beautiful.

2490
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,770
Yeah,
it is kind of fucked up,

2491
01:54:10,771 --> 01:54:15,030
but I don't like they're saying there's
something wrong with that photograph.

2492
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:19,050
Particularly like they could have had a
picture of him being handcuffed in look

2493
01:54:19,410 --> 01:54:20,610
terrified,
look on his face,

2494
01:54:20,611 --> 01:54:23,760
shock covered blood or anything along
those lines and everybody would

2495
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:25,670
been okay with it,
right?

2496
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:26,930
Yeah.
Wouldn't they be?

2497
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:28,280
Yeah,
for sure.

2498
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:32,540
It's because of it because it's a
psaltery innocent.

2499
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,403
Yeah.

2500
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:38,580
That isn't that a problem with static
images in the first place,

2501
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:41,400
like static images as such.
Poor representations of what a person

2502
01:54:41,401 --> 01:54:44,430
actually looks like and who would that
person actually is.

2503
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:46,650
You know,
it's one of the weirder things about

2504
01:54:46,651 --> 01:54:49,830
photos and then you see like a bio below
the photo and you're standing there,

2505
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,491
oh,
Tom.

2506
01:54:50,491 --> 01:54:54,270
Papa has been doing standup clubs in
colleges all throughout the country.

2507
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:58,620
Like what is.
This is a a portrayal of two dimensional

2508
01:54:58,621 --> 01:55:00,420
pull portrayal of a person.

2509
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:05,720
There is a picture of me out from when I
hosted this game show on Fox just for a

2510
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:09,110
summer and there's this shot of me in a
suit.

2511
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:12,110
I look so douchey.
I'm leering at the camera.

2512
01:55:12,111 --> 01:55:15,920
I looked like a magician
for some reason.

2513
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:19,880
That picture is every.
Any time I go to a city and you go to go

2514
01:55:19,881 --> 01:55:22,040
to perform.
Anytime someone puts an ad out for a

2515
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:22,960
show,
that's the.

2516
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:26,660
That's the picture.
I would not buy a ticket to see that

2517
01:55:26,661 --> 01:55:29,630
guy.
I can't scrub it from the Internet,

2518
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:33,640
but what'd you buy a ticket?
I wouldn't buy a ticket to see any comic

2519
01:55:33,641 --> 01:55:36,310
ever based on any fucking shot have ever
seen.

2520
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:38,680
That's a good point.
That makes me feel a little better.

2521
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:39,730
Yeah.
Bill Hicks,

2522
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:44,040
Bill Hicks's headshot was him lighting a
cigarette with American flag.

2523
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:48,570
You will rebel.
So fucking clown.

2524
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:50,360
Oh,
do you?

2525
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:52,380
You're on the edge.
It's true.

2526
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:53,521
There's no.
Yeah,

2527
01:55:53,521 --> 01:55:54,630
there's no way to look.
Cool.

2528
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:55,250
Yeah,
that was,

2529
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,000
that was bill's head shot.
Yeah.

2530
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:59,520
But you know,
in his defense in 1988,

2531
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:01,930
that was a radical thing to do.
That was.

2532
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:06,760
And that was back when there was like a
big problem with people burning the flag

2533
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:09,660
he had during the Bush Bush one.
Bush one.

2534
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:10,920
Yeah.
I remember that.

2535
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:14,400
They were like trying to take measures
to stop people from burning the flag.

2536
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:17,760
We're burning the flag.
Bill Hicks had a bit about it.

2537
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:19,950
Yeah.
Know my daddy fought for this flag and

2538
01:56:19,951 --> 01:56:21,290
Korea.
He was.

2539
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,960
What a coincidence.
My fly was made in Korea rape joke.

2540
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:27,780
You hear about the controversy about the
football player this week and not

2541
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,810
wanting to stand during the national
anthem for Nick.

2542
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:33,090
What did he,
what was he protesting?

2543
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:38,090
The country hidden and hit whole.
If flat earth.

2544
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:41,820
He doesn't want to stand in for a
country that allows a violence against

2545
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:44,010
people of color.
Is that what it is?

2546
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,290
So black or white guy?
Oh,

2547
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:48,480
good.
Mostly who's a white guy.

2548
01:56:48,481 --> 01:56:52,260
Fucking hate him.
I kinda looks pretty white to me.

2549
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,150
You show that to black.
Okay.

2550
01:56:54,151 --> 01:56:56,610
That's very healing for me.
It was a little

2551
01:56:58,530 --> 01:56:59,520
boy.
He's where?

2552
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:02,340
He's the biggest trouble maker around
the pyramids.

2553
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:04,870
And
uh,

2554
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:07,530
so he.
What is he saying he wants to end?

2555
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,910
Did he have a statement?
Always.

2556
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:14,010
They always have a statement.
You have some fucking respect for

2557
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:16,890
people.
Especially people who says that it's on

2558
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:17,900
him.
Boone,

2559
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:21,020
someone's really upset drives me knowing
about it.

2560
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:24,450
My view is that the anthem is about
honoring the people serve.

2561
01:57:24,451 --> 01:57:27,270
This is another person to find out what
his actual quote.

2562
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:28,830
What was his quote?

2563
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:34,650
I'm here to play games out here to
salute symbols.

2564
01:57:34,651 --> 01:57:37,800
You fuck heads.
It's not a requirement by,

2565
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:42,480
for NFL players to stand during the
singing of the national anthem.

2566
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:44,410
It's suggested.
Oh really?

2567
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:45,900
They do not a requirement.
Right.

2568
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,320
That's probably constitutional.
Probably constitutionally can't require

2569
01:57:49,321 --> 01:57:52,680
someone to be patriotic.
Which is kind of ironic,

2570
01:57:52,681 --> 01:57:55,080
isn't it?
The freedoms that you get.

2571
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,270
But a company could probably in this
country,

2572
01:57:57,870 --> 01:58:00,060
could they require that other of their
employees.

2573
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:02,340
You could put the American flag on her
clothes maybe.

2574
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:06,210
Yeah,
maybe that's the big team putting on the

2575
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:07,830
uniform.
Big Team goes to war.

2576
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:11,730
We all get together.
It's like people go state the first

2577
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:13,890
thing,
legal local or like Husky highschool

2578
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:15,460
team versus highschool team.
Right.

2579
01:58:15,570 --> 01:58:20,570
Then they go statewide where it's like
state college versus other colleges.

2580
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,820
Then they go nfl and once it go nfl,
Dan,

2581
01:58:23,821 --> 01:58:25,210
it's like state franchises.

2582
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:27,840
That's the big league,
but the real big league was an all teams

2583
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:31,340
get together and they'd go to armies and
armies.

2584
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,810
The biggest big team and then we go to
fuck up other teams.

2585
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:38,830
So it's very important that we keep an
active organized sports program so that

2586
01:58:38,851 --> 01:58:43,570
we are investing in this idea of teams
so that we can fuel the big team.

2587
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:46,360
Yeah,
but the other part of it is if you

2588
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:49,390
didn't have the NFL,
Pittsburgh would be marching on

2589
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:50,980
Cleveland,
right?

2590
01:58:51,310 --> 01:58:54,160
Problem.
They would be right.

2591
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:56,710
If you didn't have.
If you didn't have sport,

2592
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:58,540
people would wear like taking that
aggression.

2593
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,090
They would.
They'd March across and go after

2594
01:59:01,091 --> 01:59:01,930
Cleveland.
Well,

2595
01:59:01,931 --> 01:59:02,764
it's,
well,

2596
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,770
that's how we keep ourselves from going
to war inside the country,

2597
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:08,050
inside the boundaries,
but it doesn't keep us from doing it

2598
01:59:08,051 --> 01:59:09,510
outside the boundaries.
No.

2599
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:13,660
There was a whole radio lab thing about
the invention of football and what it

2600
01:59:13,661 --> 01:59:14,690
really was was the.

2601
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:17,950
They had a bunch of men that came back
from the war and they were looking for

2602
01:59:17,951 --> 01:59:19,990
something to do to alleviate some of the
stress,

2603
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:23,140
the creative football.
One of the motivations for them creating

2604
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:24,760
football in the first place.
It makes sense.

2605
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:26,950
Totally makes sense and you need it.
You need that.

2606
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:28,610
You need an outlet.
Yeah,

2607
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:32,080
like guys just run around like maniacs.
Eighteen minutes long,

2608
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:35,990
but here's something I'll let you read.
His men was 18 minutes.

2609
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:38,950
It's him talking in the locker room
afterwards because all the reporters

2610
01:59:38,951 --> 01:59:41,020
were asking him questions.
I want him to explain himself.

2611
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:43,060
He says,
I am going to continue to stand with the

2612
01:59:43,061 --> 01:59:45,040
people that are being oppressed.
Capper,

2613
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,300
nick,
that's his name.

2614
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:49,060
Yeah.
This is something that has to change

2615
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,360
when there's significant change and I
feel like that flag represents what it's

2616
01:59:52,361 --> 01:59:54,490
supposed to represent.
This country is representing people the

2617
01:59:54,491 --> 01:59:57,010
way it's supposed to.
I'll stand her.

2618
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:01,540
He said,
I don't know if I did,

2619
02:00:01,541 --> 02:00:04,120
was write A.
I said he hasn't heard from the NFL.

2620
02:00:04,121 --> 02:00:06,460
Anybody else about his actions won't
matter if he does.

2621
02:00:06,461 --> 02:00:07,960
No one's tried to quiet me and to be
honest,

2622
02:00:07,961 --> 02:00:09,520
it's not something I'm going to be quiet
about it.

2623
02:00:09,521 --> 02:00:11,560
He said,
I'm going to speak the truth when I'm

2624
02:00:11,561 --> 02:00:13,750
asked about it.
This isn't for look,

2625
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,880
this isn't for publicity or anything
like that.

2626
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:19,240
This is for people don't have the voice
and this is where people that are being

2627
02:00:19,241 --> 02:00:21,310
oppressed,
that need to have equal opportunities to

2628
02:00:21,311 --> 02:00:23,740
be successful,
to provide for their families and not

2629
02:00:23,741 --> 02:00:25,090
live in poor circumstances.
Okay.

2630
02:00:25,091 --> 02:00:28,090
That's a lot.
He's added a bunch of shit there too.

2631
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:28,961
Yeah,
you got.

2632
02:00:28,961 --> 02:00:30,760
It's important.
You get your message out in just a

2633
02:00:30,761 --> 02:00:31,960
phrase.
Yeah.

2634
02:00:31,961 --> 02:00:33,180
Well we'll also.
This is.

2635
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:36,220
This is where it gets people being
oppressed that don't have the equal

2636
02:00:36,221 --> 02:00:40,990
opportunities to be successful,
to provide for families and not live in

2637
02:00:40,991 --> 02:00:42,280
poor circumstances.

2638
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:45,790
That's one sentence.
The word to provide for families and not

2639
02:00:45,791 --> 02:00:47,860
live in poor circumstances is one
sentence.

2640
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:49,630
Yeah,
that's idealistically.

2641
02:00:49,631 --> 02:00:52,360
That's interesting,
but America is supposed to represent

2642
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:56,620
like the entire group experiment.
This experiment in self government

2643
02:00:56,621 --> 02:00:59,050
that's still ongoing and it's not.
It's not perfect.

2644
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:01,480
It's not done and it's definitely got
some dark aspects to it,

2645
02:01:01,481 --> 02:01:03,190
but if you don't think it's the best
thing going,

2646
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:07,060
he should go look around this.
There's some dark parts of America.

2647
02:01:07,061 --> 02:01:10,060
There's some dark parts about how what
we're talking about today.

2648
02:01:10,061 --> 02:01:13,780
I mean how we were founded and how this
land was acquired in the first place.

2649
02:01:13,781 --> 02:01:17,610
It's acquired by fucking murder mean.
Do you ever think that that's when we

2650
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:19,320
have problems that maybe it's Karma?
Well,

2651
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:21,010
no,
because I don't think it's us.

2652
02:01:21,011 --> 02:01:24,550
It's not Uri,
but there is something incredibly fucked

2653
02:01:24,551 --> 02:01:29,551
up about a country that is so willing to
look at some aspects of our society that

2654
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:36,580
are discriminating or discriminatory.
Like the article that I pointed out

2655
02:01:36,581 --> 02:01:40,460
today where this woman was writing about
how women are drinking

2656
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:42,980
because of the patriarchy,
because of sexism is forcing them to

2657
02:01:42,981 --> 02:01:47,090
drink and the suppression.
The American Indians were slaughtered,

2658
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:51,740
the native Americans were fucking
slaughtered and they never come up

2659
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:55,880
genocide.
It almost never comes up when you talk

2660
02:01:55,881 --> 02:02:00,881
about equal opportunity in America,
it's very few conversations begin with

2661
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:06,650
we've got to do something about the
poverty and extreme alcoholism on these

2662
02:02:06,651 --> 02:02:09,410
native American reservations.
You know why it doesn't come up because

2663
02:02:09,411 --> 02:02:12,440
we wiped out so many of them.
There's just not that many left.

2664
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,150
Well,
there's enough left that they have a

2665
02:02:14,151 --> 02:02:16,880
voice and they talk,
but it's not something that people are

2666
02:02:16,881 --> 02:02:18,680
concerned with.
I mean slavery.

2667
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:21,410
Absolutely.
It was fucking awful and is something

2668
02:02:21,411 --> 02:02:24,950
that we absolutely should pay attention
to and we should absolutely look at the

2669
02:02:24,951 --> 02:02:29,951
impact of slavery over a long period
like where these people lived as slaves

2670
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:33,680
for hundreds of years and then they were
finally freed into this area where

2671
02:02:33,681 --> 02:02:35,360
there's massive amounts of racism.

2672
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:36,840
Not just racism,
like,

2673
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:37,970
like,
you know,

2674
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,130
I like to stick to my own car,
but racism,

2675
02:02:40,131 --> 02:02:43,550
like where people are denigrated in
their thought to be like a lesser human

2676
02:02:43,551 --> 02:02:44,450
being.
Systemic.

2677
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:49,470
It's systemic and it's deep and it's.
And then it's going to take hundreds of

2678
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:51,440
years,
like many generations to get past that.

2679
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:53,030
Right.
And we still definitely haven't gotten

2680
02:02:53,031 --> 02:02:55,280
past that,
a lot of those places and we concentrate

2681
02:02:55,281 --> 02:02:59,300
on that and it's a big part of our,
our national discussion conversation and

2682
02:02:59,301 --> 02:03:01,550
yeah,
but it ain't shit compared to what the

2683
02:03:01,551 --> 02:03:03,800
native Americans went through,
slaughtered,

2684
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:05,960
slaughtered,
and their land just taken.

2685
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:07,670
Just taken,
you know,

2686
02:03:07,671 --> 02:03:09,920
I mean,
if you read this article that I read

2687
02:03:09,921 --> 02:03:11,840
today,
I'm sure first of all,

2688
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:14,600
again,
is not taking anything away from the

2689
02:03:14,601 --> 02:03:18,320
people that suffered from slavery or the
genocide that was committed on black

2690
02:03:18,321 --> 02:03:19,154
people.

2691
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:23,250
Exactly to that.
A lot of people gone.

2692
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:26,990
But I feel like the,
it's not that I want less attention

2693
02:03:26,991 --> 02:03:29,450
being paid on what happened to African
Americans.

2694
02:03:29,451 --> 02:03:31,190
I think they,
there's not enough,

2695
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:34,640
there's not enough,
but w we should have way more than we

2696
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:36,710
have right now on native Americans.
It's,

2697
02:03:36,930 --> 02:03:37,820
yeah,
it's,

2698
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:38,751
it's,
you know,

2699
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:40,100
it's really crazy.
You know,

2700
02:03:40,101 --> 02:03:41,630
it's a real violation.
No,

2701
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:45,200
it felt really dirty when I saw it was
on my,

2702
02:03:45,201 --> 02:03:48,560
uh,
on my motorcycle and went through the

2703
02:03:48,561 --> 02:03:52,910
Dakotas and saw the mount rushmore and
when you're going,

2704
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,910
when you're driving through these areas
and you're stopping and you're reading

2705
02:03:55,911 --> 02:03:59,300
about the native Americans that were
there and what they were doing and how

2706
02:03:59,301 --> 02:04:03,290
many there were,
and then to know that that all that land

2707
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:06,770
was taken and all those,
the civilization was killed and then we

2708
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:11,120
carved in the side of the mountain.
These heads.

2709
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,090
It's really,
I mean like dudes,

2710
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:16,100
we couldn't find a single black guy.
I am,

2711
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:19,300
you know,
I am pretty patriotic to the,

2712
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:21,410
to a fault.
So like a naive level,

2713
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:24,890
but seeing that Mount Rushmore of just
felt me too bad.

2714
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:27,140
Look at my phone cover.
I like that patriotic.

2715
02:04:27,141 --> 02:04:29,910
It's fucking.
But seeing Mount Rushmore was just

2716
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:31,040
wrong.
And then there's a guy,

2717
02:04:31,041 --> 02:04:35,480
there's a native American carving,
carving a crazy horse in the side of the

2718
02:04:35,481 --> 02:04:38,280
mountain to counter it inside the
richest

2719
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:42,390
native American tribe in the U.
S work Asino CNL profits pay $1,000,000

2720
02:04:42,391 --> 02:04:44,490
a year to every member.
Wow.

2721
02:04:44,491 --> 02:04:47,670
How many members says between the mystic
lake and the six casinos,

2722
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:50,790
travel revenues are thought to be nearly
one point 4 billion,

2723
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:54,450
so that would mean that there's at least
a thousand.

2724
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:59,280
There's 460 people in the tribe.
They got about $84,000 a month each

2725
02:04:59,281 --> 02:05:02,040
person.
So there's only 460 of them,

2726
02:05:02,590 --> 02:05:05,220
one in this particular one right outside
of Minnesota,

2727
02:05:05,330 --> 02:05:08,100
but that's,
that's the reparations.

2728
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:10,350
Meanwhile,
the ghosts of their ancestors were in

2729
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:11,850
the woods.
Every time they go outside to take a

2730
02:05:11,851 --> 02:05:15,270
leak at night,
I just hear screams and see people with

2731
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,260
by them,
but no heads.

2732
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:19,700
It's like it's crazy,
but you know,

2733
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:22,590
it's disproportionate for the people
that lived there for sure.

2734
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:26,430
Has there,
has there been any culture in the world

2735
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:31,410
that didn't go in at some level and wipe
out the other people to take the land?

2736
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:34,140
I don't think so.
I mean it's pretty.

2737
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:36,000
I mean,
yeah,

2738
02:05:36,001 --> 02:05:37,010
but yeah.
Yeah,

2739
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:40,620
it's pretty standard.
It's what people do and it's also super

2740
02:05:40,621 --> 02:05:42,630
convenient when you don't know what the
fuck they're saying.

2741
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:44,700
You know,
when you pretend that they're not even

2742
02:05:44,701 --> 02:05:46,130
one of us there,
this tournament,

2743
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:47,300
gobbly Gook,
we're gonna.

2744
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:49,670
We're gonna fucking kill them.
They're sitting on their house,

2745
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:52,350
made a gold jacket.
Yeah,

2746
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,970
it happens everywhere.
It's just,

2747
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:56,770
I think this is the first time,
um,

2748
02:05:56,970 --> 02:06:01,740
over the last several hundred years,
especially the last 200 years since

2749
02:06:01,741 --> 02:06:03,720
slavery has been abolished,
less than 200 years,

2750
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:05,400
which is crazy,
right?

2751
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:06,480
18,
65.

2752
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,210
You think about that.
That's so recent.

2753
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:11,250
Insane.
But these last few hundred years of the

2754
02:06:11,251 --> 02:06:15,150
printed word being distributed,
reading,

2755
02:06:15,151 --> 02:06:19,680
becoming more and more common,
which is really a very important point.

2756
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:24,390
He had up until the 100 or so years ago,
it was not that common to be able to

2757
02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:25,770
read,
you know,

2758
02:06:25,771 --> 02:06:28,470
in a lot of parts of the world.
There's a lot of people that are

2759
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:30,990
illiterate,
so they know information to 100 years

2760
02:06:30,991 --> 02:06:32,970
before that.
Super common to be illiterate.

2761
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:35,150
I mean,
remember David used.

2762
02:06:35,151 --> 02:06:36,600
I'll always have that in those cowboy
movies.

2763
02:06:36,601 --> 02:06:38,310
We used to have to write your,
your mark.

2764
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:40,510
Make your mark on this contract.
Right?

2765
02:06:40,870 --> 02:06:41,900
They couldn't write.
Well,

2766
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,340
I don't know how to write.
No Sir.

2767
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:46,560
We'll make your mark.
They would make a mark member that

2768
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:50,090
little X.
nobody taught me how to write my name.

2769
02:06:52,370 --> 02:06:57,370
So what we have in comparison is now you
have a phone in your pocket and you

2770
02:06:57,571 --> 02:06:59,700
could talk to him and he'll answer
questions for you.

2771
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:02,910
I mean,
I was in Seattle this past weekend and I

2772
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:04,800
just pressed the button on my phone and
I said,

2773
02:07:04,801 --> 02:07:08,160
Siri,
navigate to the SEATAC airport,

2774
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:09,240
right?
It goes,

2775
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:12,300
here's the directions to the Seatac
airport and just starts going.

2776
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:14,000
It's amazing.
Within seconds,

2777
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:18,300
I know the amount of access to the
information that,

2778
02:07:18,301 --> 02:07:20,460
uh,
that you need to sort of form your view

2779
02:07:20,461 --> 02:07:23,190
of the world accurately.
It's just so much different now than

2780
02:07:23,191 --> 02:07:25,770
it's ever been before.
So now I think we're looking at like

2781
02:07:25,771 --> 02:07:29,400
what happened to the native Americans
are looking at what happened to the

2782
02:07:29,430 --> 02:07:33,030
slaves are looking what happened?
Like this whole Columbus Day thing.

2783
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,580
They're just now starting to decide that
they're not going to call it Columbus

2784
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:38,080
Day anymore.
They're going to call it native American

2785
02:07:38,081 --> 02:07:39,670
appreciation day or something like that.

2786
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:44,170
G about time,
but I have to say as an Italian that

2787
02:07:44,171 --> 02:07:46,450
grew up in New Jersey,
I hate to see that one go.

2788
02:07:46,510 --> 02:07:47,770
First of all,
I don't trust him.

2789
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:49,630
He's he's.
He's not a real Italian.

2790
02:07:49,631 --> 02:07:52,120
He's like me.
He doesn't have a vowel.

2791
02:07:52,121 --> 02:07:53,740
Is the last name Papa.
Why is it.

2792
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:56,920
How come it's Columbus?
What's with the ass bitch?

2793
02:07:57,620 --> 02:07:59,770
Yeah.
You're good point at Brown university.

2794
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:01,840
Columbus Day is now indigenous people's
Day.

2795
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:05,320
It's right after white privileged day.
It's weird.

2796
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:07,420
It's like they have white privileged
day.

2797
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,900
When did you see what you're.
Yeah.

2798
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,120
Chicago University said,
fuck you.

2799
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:15,040
Fuck you.
Safe spaces.

2800
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:19,060
Trigger trigger warnings.
You little fucking babies.

2801
02:08:19,061 --> 02:08:20,410
The ortho world.
Yeah.

2802
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:23,290
Well Great.
They've watched enough youtube videos.

2803
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:26,500
They gathered the information like a
good institute of learning and they go,

2804
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:28,480
oh,
the data's in and you guys are retarded.

2805
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:33,190
Yeah.
You guys are closing down free thought

2806
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:35,770
and discussion in the sense where it's
supposed to foster.

2807
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:36,571
Yeah.
You're.

2808
02:08:36,571 --> 02:08:40,600
You're not just stopping racism,
which will be a wonderful thing to do

2809
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:43,270
while you're.
What you're doing is you're controlling

2810
02:08:43,271 --> 02:08:47,260
the way people address ideas,
the way they behave and think and you're

2811
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:50,530
creating words that are dangerous,
like,

2812
02:08:50,531 --> 02:08:52,870
that were normal,
like words that used to be able to use

2813
02:08:52,871 --> 02:08:55,390
with no problems.
Now they're demanding things like,

2814
02:08:55,391 --> 02:08:57,230
you know,
don't call someone a spokesman,

2815
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,190
call them spokeswomen.
There's no more fresh man as first year

2816
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:02,620
students.
Like there's a whole list of them that,

2817
02:09:02,621 --> 02:09:04,810
uh,
I forget what university put it out,

2818
02:09:04,811 --> 02:09:08,450
but Dave Rubin put it up the other day,
this law,

2819
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:13,330
some university that made this new list
of all the things that would not be

2820
02:09:13,331 --> 02:09:14,910
tolerated anymore.
Uh,

2821
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:16,570
in,
in the nomenclature.

2822
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,740
All man's speak.
It's called speak.

2823
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:21,160
Yeah,
they saw it coming.

2824
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:23,500
Mankind.
How come it's okay?

2825
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:25,570
How come?
How come you can't be?

2826
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:28,270
How come a human could be a man or a
woman,

2827
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:32,380
but mankind,
we assumed that means male or it's a

2828
02:09:32,381 --> 02:09:37,120
masculine side of what a woman is in
that to mankind.

2829
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:39,490
Woolman special kind of man.
Good point.

2830
02:09:39,491 --> 02:09:40,151
It's like,
man,

2831
02:09:40,151 --> 02:09:43,570
that makes babies.
It's like it is a man that human part of

2832
02:09:43,571 --> 02:09:45,400
these creatures that came out of
Tanzania.

2833
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:48,510
Why are we so Goddamn fucking sensitive
and I wonder if I would think that way

2834
02:09:48,511 --> 02:09:49,990
if I was a woman,
if I was a woman,

2835
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:52,140
maybe I'm fucking tired of being a
freshman,

2836
02:09:52,250 --> 02:09:56,560
not a man piece of shit.
I'm a girl who's a first year student.

2837
02:09:56,561 --> 02:10:01,561
You can't face fucking freshman year.
He and Sally.

2838
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:04,180
Oh my freshmen.
You don't look like a man.

2839
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:09,660
Stupid Bitch
living with all women happens.

2840
02:10:12,570 --> 02:10:15,970
I'm sorry.
Living with all women as we do a.

2841
02:10:16,090 --> 02:10:21,090
You get an idea around the house of like
what's what's truly like something that

2842
02:10:21,131 --> 02:10:23,930
they would carry as an offense and wes
are.

2843
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:27,220
You also get a sense of how they feed
off each other and convince each other

2844
02:10:27,221 --> 02:10:28,270
what they're saying.
Makes Sense.

2845
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:30,730
That's a part of the problem,
right?

2846
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:31,810
Yeah.
I agree.

2847
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:34,340
Nail Polish to be mandatory and the next
thing you know,

2848
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:38,360
they're fucking passing laws.
Whether you get.

2849
02:10:38,361 --> 02:10:43,361
This is Clinton broad and office would
fucking wacky medication she's on.

2850
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:47,750
Who knows if she's even seeing straight
bro.

2851
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,340
Dude will work out perfect because the
vps at.

2852
02:10:51,341 --> 02:10:53,630
Dude,
here's a perfect example of people

2853
02:10:53,631 --> 02:10:56,450
writing for a,
like a lot of different people write for

2854
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:57,950
publications,
huff post,

2855
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:01,130
he,
they band to have daymond David Seaman,

2856
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:02,270
our board,
David Seaman.

2857
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:05,180
They banned two of his articles and
suspended as account.

2858
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:07,370
Why?
Because he wrote articles questioning

2859
02:11:07,371 --> 02:11:09,620
Hillary Clinton's health,
which is also.

2860
02:11:09,621 --> 02:11:10,610
That's true.
Yup.

2861
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:13,880
Which is also the same reason what Dr
drew show got canceled.

2862
02:11:13,881 --> 02:11:18,530
That's what they say because Dr Drew,
he was questioning Hillary Clinton's

2863
02:11:18,531 --> 02:11:18,740
health.

2864
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:23,740
Now what I've heard about Dr drew from
actual doctors in regards to what he

2865
02:11:24,411 --> 02:11:27,260
said,
I'd like they didn't agree with some of

2866
02:11:27,261 --> 02:11:28,820
the things you said.
One of the things that he said about

2867
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:29,990
armor,
thyroid,

2868
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:35,960
armour thyroid hasn't been prescribed.
I haven't heard about it being

2869
02:11:35,961 --> 02:11:40,640
prescribed since 19 seventies.
I'm on armour thyroid and I've been on

2870
02:11:40,641 --> 02:11:45,641
armour thyroid for about 10 years.
He's out of his fucking mind that it is

2871
02:11:46,191 --> 02:11:49,010
for hypothyroidism.
I have something called Hashimoto's.

2872
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:50,870
It's a,
it's a,

2873
02:11:50,871 --> 02:11:53,810
um,
a thyroid disease.

2874
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:54,561
No,
it's not.

2875
02:11:54,561 --> 02:11:59,330
It sounds like it's a thyroid disease
that is an autoimmune disease that's

2876
02:11:59,331 --> 02:12:01,250
hereditary.
My mom has it.

2877
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:04,190
My sister has it.
And I have it too,

2878
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,300
and it just,
uh,

2879
02:12:05,301 --> 02:12:08,240
your thyroid doesn't work so well and
for me it manifested itself in like

2880
02:12:08,241 --> 02:12:11,240
headaches.
I was taking this thing called synthroid

2881
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:13,040
and it didn't work as good.

2882
02:12:13,070 --> 02:12:14,870
It worked okay.
It was definitely better than nothing.

2883
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:18,830
But then when I got on this armor,
thyroid armour thyroid is thyroid

2884
02:12:18,831 --> 02:12:23,570
medication that has been made from pigs
glands and uh,

2885
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:28,600
it's very bio similar or are a bio
identical to your actual hormone.

2886
02:12:29,341 --> 02:12:32,840
So it's very clean and easy.
My body has zero problems with it.

2887
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:35,000
Like it really is a phase of.
Yeah.

2888
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:40,240
So I've been on this for 10 years and my
doctor is one of the best hormone

2889
02:12:41,481 --> 02:12:43,910
doctors in all of the country.
Yeah,

2890
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:47,510
you should meet my wife.
He said he'll just shoot her,

2891
02:12:48,220 --> 02:12:50,880
say we can't fix this one,
but I mean,

2892
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:54,500
my point is this guy's a state of the
art doctor and he.

2893
02:12:54,610 --> 02:12:58,100
And also I've told people about it that
had a problem with synthroid and they

2894
02:12:58,101 --> 02:13:02,630
got on it and then thanked me so much
because the armour thyroid works so much

2895
02:13:02,631 --> 02:13:03,464
better for them.

2896
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:06,620
So I didn't know why Dr Drew said that
because you said that Hillary Clinton

2897
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:08,420
had a thyroid problem,
but he thought it was weird.

2898
02:13:08,421 --> 02:13:10,790
They were prescribing armour thyroid.
It's very common.

2899
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:14,540
There's a reason why they still make it
and it and he should know more than

2900
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:18,720
anyone being a fucking doctor.
Is he a real diaper or not bioidentical,

2901
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:21,890
whereas you have one person is allergic
to peanuts.

2902
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:24,630
Another person can't be around cats.
You know?

2903
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:26,960
One person responds very well to certain
medication.

2904
02:13:26,961 --> 02:13:29,840
Other people like Jamie,
Jamie can eat pot and nothing happens to

2905
02:13:29,841 --> 02:13:32,970
them so we're fucking Weirdo.
But the point being,

2906
02:13:32,971 --> 02:13:36,120
if I ate with Jamie eight,
I'd be curled up in the fetal position.

2907
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:38,150
Call and girls I dated in high school
go.

2908
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:40,130
I'm sorry.
I don't know what the folks that spend

2909
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:41,460
so long,
but I'm still feel bad.

2910
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:43,043
You know what I mean?

2911
02:13:43,790 --> 02:13:46,330
We're all very different.
So you think he doesn't say,

2912
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,970
well hold on,
let me keep going.

2913
02:13:47,971 --> 02:13:50,190
I'm sorry.
But my point is people that I know that

2914
02:13:50,191 --> 02:13:52,770
her doctor said that what he did was
essentially malpractice.

2915
02:13:52,771 --> 02:13:55,410
You're not supposed to do that.
You're not supposed to diagnose someone

2916
02:13:55,411 --> 02:13:58,140
without any personal understanding of
their case.

2917
02:13:58,141 --> 02:14:00,920
You haven't talked to them,
you haven't studied their their blood

2918
02:14:00,921 --> 02:14:02,520
work.
You're not privy to their insight

2919
02:14:02,521 --> 02:14:04,560
information about their health,
how they feel.

2920
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:09,210
You're taking this guess based on what's
been what's been released and on top of

2921
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:12,240
that you're doing it kind of to get
publicity and attention,

2922
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,140
you know?
Yeah.

2923
02:14:14,230 --> 02:14:15,660
I mean that's essentially what you're
doing.

2924
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:20,040
If he did it in a respectful way where
he was speculating where he said,

2925
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:23,010
well,
I don't know about the specifics of this

2926
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:25,080
is how I would handle it.
Me being a doctor,

2927
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:25,920
I would say.

2928
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:29,550
I don't know about the specific
specifics of Hillary Clinton's case,

2929
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:34,700
but I do know here's what can be
problematic about brain injuries similar

2930
02:14:34,951 --> 02:14:37,350
to the one that she apparently suffered
right here.

2931
02:14:37,351 --> 02:14:39,240
Could hear.
It could be some issues and this is what

2932
02:14:39,241 --> 02:14:40,830
some people experience from brain
issues.

2933
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:44,880
Like if you say something like the
information that is a doctor talking

2934
02:14:44,881 --> 02:14:47,760
about a nonspecific,
you're not talking about a specific

2935
02:14:47,761 --> 02:14:49,500
person.
You're talking about like safe.

2936
02:14:49,501 --> 02:14:51,780
Tom.
Papa breaks his leg and Dr drew reads

2937
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:54,250
about a Tom Papa was riding a motorcycle
in Africa.

2938
02:14:54,251 --> 02:14:55,530
I broke his leg.
Well,

2939
02:14:55,620 --> 02:14:58,860
here's what happens when your leg breaks
and when people break their legs,

2940
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:01,560
your body has to heal it and here's some
of the complications that come along

2941
02:15:01,561 --> 02:15:02,131
with that.
Now,

2942
02:15:02,131 --> 02:15:04,920
if he did that,
that would be a doctor on television

2943
02:15:04,921 --> 02:15:09,921
informing us about some real issues.
Maybe he thought as a voter and as an

2944
02:15:11,341 --> 02:15:14,220
American,
as someone who's genuinely concerned,

2945
02:15:14,221 --> 02:15:18,060
knowing what he does know,
maybe he felt like he had to speak out

2946
02:15:18,061 --> 02:15:21,510
about the dangers of someone who's had a
traumatic brain injury.

2947
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:25,080
Having a position like being the
president and what could be a problem,

2948
02:15:25,081 --> 02:15:27,840
and then he looked at her medication
list and he disagreed with it.

2949
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:30,990
Doctors will disagree with.
I've talked to some doctors will say

2950
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:33,060
like we were talking about the bulging
disc issue.

2951
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,160
I talked to one doctor wanted me to get
an operation.

2952
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:36,240
Are you going to have to get that cut
out?

2953
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:39,360
It's not going to get any better,
and he's convinced clearly he was wrong

2954
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:41,190
because it got better,
but he really.

2955
02:15:41,370 --> 02:15:43,770
He didn't know shit about Regena King.
He had never heard of it.

2956
02:15:43,771 --> 02:15:44,700
He didn't want.
He's like,

2957
02:15:44,701 --> 02:15:46,200
well,
I wouldn't put any my eggs in that

2958
02:15:46,201 --> 02:15:46,801
basket.
I mean,

2959
02:15:46,801 --> 02:15:48,690
it's just a no,
there's no research and there's a reason

2960
02:15:48,691 --> 02:15:50,790
why it hasn't been approved yet by the
FDA.

2961
02:15:50,850 --> 02:15:51,280
No,
no,

2962
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:51,721
no,
no.

2963
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:53,020
There isn't.
You fucking done.

2964
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:56,430
And it works.
People are wrong all the time.

2965
02:15:56,431 --> 02:15:59,040
All the time.
So according to my friend who's a doctor

2966
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,620
who he said,
you're never supposed to do that.

2967
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:04,620
And then what he did by diagnosing her
publicly like that,

2968
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:05,633
you just don't do.

2969
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:06,950
So.
If that's true,

2970
02:16:07,010 --> 02:16:10,350
then they're probably justified in
taking these canning and.

2971
02:16:10,351 --> 02:16:10,610
Right.
Yeah.

2972
02:16:10,610 --> 02:16:14,480
So then would you say that that kind of
eliminates the idea that it's a

2973
02:16:14,481 --> 02:16:15,590
conspiracy?
Like when

2974
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:18,270
I'd say he's lucky he's alive because
she just kills bitches.

2975
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:21,180
That's what I hear.
Hillary's is out there,

2976
02:16:21,181 --> 02:16:24,630
whack it fools.
I mean if you pay attention to the same

2977
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:27,900
websites that tell you about chem trails
and the flat earth,

2978
02:16:27,930 --> 02:16:30,040
which are the ones that are truth,
hashtag truth,

2979
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:33,130
they'll tell you she's whacked like 100
people.

2980
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:34,420
Wow.
She's,

2981
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,000
she's like,
she's like Seagal,

2982
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:38,110
like a lighter Seagal.
Do not know this.

2983
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:40,060
Do you not know about this for real?
I really don't.

2984
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:40,943
Oh,
okay.

2985
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:46,000
There is at least 48 or 49 people that
have had dealings with the Clintons

2986
02:16:46,001 --> 02:16:50,260
who've been mysteriously murdered,
including the guy who released all those

2987
02:16:50,261 --> 02:16:53,710
emails about the DNC favoring hillary
over.

2988
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:57,310
He released him to wikileaks,
favoring hillary over Bernie.

2989
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:58,690
Remember that?
Yeah.

2990
02:16:58,691 --> 02:17:00,790
Well,
that guy got shot at 4:00 in the morning

2991
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,560
in front of his house,
in the back.

2992
02:17:02,950 --> 02:17:05,280
Murdered when?
Somebody recently.

2993
02:17:05,370 --> 02:17:06,760
Yeah,
like really recently,

2994
02:17:06,970 --> 02:17:11,970
and he's one of several people who had
been murdered that had ties to the

2995
02:17:12,190 --> 02:17:16,060
Clintons Clinton body count or left wing
conspiracy three with ties to the DNC

2996
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:17,920
mysteriously die.
Yeah.

2997
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:18,970
Yeah,
dude,

2998
02:17:18,970 --> 02:17:21,700
this is.
This is not die all the time.

2999
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:24,100
They do die all the time.
And here's the thing.

3000
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:26,560
You're not saying that she killed him
either,

3001
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:29,410
but here's what you do need to know.
This is like,

3002
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:31,030
this is what's really important to
consider.

3003
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:34,420
You're talking about when you're talking
about someone like the Clintons,

3004
02:17:34,421 --> 02:17:36,130
especially if you talk about for a
second,

3005
02:17:36,131 --> 02:17:38,920
you've confused the shit out of me.
If you're talking about just keeps

3006
02:17:38,921 --> 02:17:42,260
clicking on links.
Start doing that.

3007
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:45,510
What's going on over here?
What about our click this when when

3008
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:49,150
you're talking about someone like the
Clintons who run the Clinton Foundation,

3009
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:51,340
not I don't know if you've paid
attention to the Clinton Foundation,

3010
02:17:51,570 --> 02:17:56,380
but I have been slowly but surely going
down a rabbit hole with the Clinton

3011
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:59,890
Foundation over the last couple of
months and it is crazy what they got

3012
02:17:59,891 --> 02:18:00,680
away with.

3013
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:03,040
It's crazy and there's some pretty
direct evidence.

3014
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:07,330
There's some people that were involved
and they donated to the Clinton

3015
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:10,390
Foundation and they got arms deals.
Now whether or not they got arms deals

3016
02:18:10,391 --> 02:18:14,950
because they donated or whether they did
that as a thank you for the arms deal

3017
02:18:14,951 --> 02:18:17,260
that they would have had anyway.
Who the fuck knows?

3018
02:18:17,380 --> 02:18:20,650
But that's just one aspect of what's
problematic about this.

3019
02:18:20,651 --> 02:18:23,500
Now I'm no expert and I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

3020
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:25,510
Let me,
let me just state that for a fact,

3021
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:30,550
but what I've been reading about,
what people find problematic about the,

3022
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:35,620
the about of profit that's been made off
of this and the amount of influence that

3023
02:18:35,621 --> 02:18:38,980
is being sold with this and that.
How many of these people that they're

3024
02:18:38,981 --> 02:18:43,900
involved with these dealings are
donating to their foundation and then in

3025
02:18:43,901 --> 02:18:48,901
return they're getting these deals past
and like is shady as fuck.

3026
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:51,070
Okay,
and the people that you're dealing with,

3027
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:54,070
in some instances you're talking about
weapons.

3028
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:57,730
Talking about arms dealers,
you're talking about countries that kill

3029
02:18:57,731 --> 02:19:00,700
people,
countries with poor civil rights records

3030
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:04,450
like Saudi Arabia.
You're talking about decisions that you

3031
02:19:04,451 --> 02:19:07,360
make you fucking know for sure people
are going to die.

3032
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:09,520
Right?
And we know that about her.

3033
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:14,790
That's just what looked at video of her
laughing about the death of Omar Kadafi

3034
02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:16,340
received that.
Yeah.

3035
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:19,720
I interviewed just like we came,
we saw he died.

3036
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:25,360
Like
the fact that the bar for being a

3037
02:19:25,361 --> 02:19:28,880
president is so low that you could have
a video like that out there and it

3038
02:19:28,881 --> 02:19:31,430
doesn't freak people the fuck out
everybody back off.

3039
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:35,480
And then on top of that,
with all the evidence of all this weird

3040
02:19:35,481 --> 02:19:37,970
shit that it's probably just standard
operational procedure.

3041
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,970
So here's my point,
you're involved with this,

3042
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:46,300
this interconnected web of death of
killers,

3043
02:19:46,431 --> 02:19:50,540
of war,
of tough questions that demand tufts

3044
02:19:50,541 --> 02:19:53,210
solutions,
and then you're involved with all these

3045
02:19:53,211 --> 02:19:55,910
people that are used to killing people
right now.

3046
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,800
If something like this dnc leak comes
out and it's possible that this could

3047
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:04,790
bring down a ship and this ship is huge
and there's thousands of people involved

3048
02:20:04,791 --> 02:20:07,400
in this ship and you might be one of
those people involved in this ship.

3049
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:09,350
Remember,
like I didn't think I know how to take

3050
02:20:09,351 --> 02:20:11,540
care of this.
And you step in and,

3051
02:20:12,710 --> 02:20:14,990
and someone dies and everybody else
shuts the fuck up.

3052
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:16,880
And everybody panics and nobody gets
caught.

3053
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:20,330
And there's no ties to hillary because
Hillary didn't ask for it to be done.

3054
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:23,600
But it's a part of a fucking giant
machine.

3055
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:26,060
Right?
So it might not even be that she's out

3056
02:20:26,061 --> 02:20:28,040
there doing it,
but it might be the fact that

3057
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:32,360
her influence political power.
You're talking about,

3058
02:20:32,570 --> 02:20:35,360
you're talking about the presidency of
the United States of America,

3059
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:40,370
you talking about a gigantic amount of
the world that that controls and she's

3060
02:20:42,021 --> 02:20:43,350
in there,
right?

3061
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:47,180
Hasn't every president,
most likely hasn't.

3062
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:49,760
Every leader of whatever.
Sure.

3063
02:20:49,761 --> 02:20:51,560
That's it's the job.
It's a job.

3064
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:53,960
That's the thing that I keep.
What's us?

3065
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:56,330
What are you showing us?
This is one of the three guys that

3066
02:20:56,331 --> 02:20:57,950
they're talking about that just recently
died.

3067
02:20:58,190 --> 02:21:00,590
Okay.
Former president of the United Nations

3068
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:02,330
General Assembly,
John Ash mysteriously passed away on

3069
02:21:02,331 --> 02:21:04,310
June 22nd,
a few days before he was scheduled to

3070
02:21:04,311 --> 02:21:08,360
begin pretrial meetings involving shady
financial dealings regarding a former

3071
02:21:08,361 --> 02:21:11,480
Clinton crony.
Local police officer said he died from

3072
02:21:11,481 --> 02:21:14,210
dropping a barbell on his throat while
working out,

3073
02:21:15,410 --> 02:21:18,560
but the UN oddly first claim he died of
a heart attack.

3074
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:23,120
The 61 year old was supposed to testify
against Chinese real estate developer.

3075
02:21:23,121 --> 02:21:24,260
Oh God.
He's dead as fuck.

3076
02:21:24,570 --> 02:21:29,570
Nick lap saying who was implicated in
the China Gate scandal for funneling

3077
02:21:30,171 --> 02:21:34,070
money to the DNC for Bill Clinton
through Arkansas restaurant owner

3078
02:21:34,071 --> 02:21:37,460
trolley try.
Ash was arrested last year for allegedly

3079
02:21:37,461 --> 02:21:40,760
taking over $3,000,000 in bribes from
the Chinese businessmen,

3080
02:21:40,761 --> 02:21:45,761
including over a half a million from
nick see in exchange for building United

3081
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:50,270
Nations Conference Center in Macau.
There's a lot in there,

3082
02:21:51,290 --> 02:21:54,680
and he was arrested.
He was arrested for taking 3 million

3083
02:21:54,681 --> 02:21:58,340
bucks in bribes and then he was going to
testify he was going to spill the beans

3084
02:21:58,341 --> 02:22:03,140
and they killed him like a fucking like
a movie.

3085
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:04,190
What's that source?

3086
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:09,350
Website websites.
Townhall.com.

3087
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:13,040
What's townhall.com?
While the information I'm sure is not

3088
02:22:13,041 --> 02:22:16,130
made up,
we should just go just google his death

3089
02:22:16,131 --> 02:22:21,020
and find out Clinton body count or left
wing conspiracy three with ties.

3090
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:26,920
That's just one article in one website
to the of these people dying is

3091
02:22:27,061 --> 02:22:29,250
undeniable.
They've definitely died whether or not

3092
02:22:29,251 --> 02:22:32,580
they were murdered or whether it's on
some crazy coincidence that all of these

3093
02:22:32,581 --> 02:22:37,140
people were about to testify or had
secret information or leaked information

3094
02:22:37,141 --> 02:22:39,390
to wikileaks and then were murdered.
Right.

3095
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:40,470
Fuck it,
man.

3096
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,660
And there was a woman too.
What did,

3097
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:45,030
what did she,
some woman involved in DNC was also

3098
02:22:45,031 --> 02:22:45,864
murdered recently.

3099
02:22:47,420 --> 02:22:52,420
The staffer who dropped off the lawsuit,
I believe is who it was.

3100
02:22:52,851 --> 02:22:57,260
They're like filed the lawsuit in August
or maybe in July.

3101
02:22:57,530 --> 02:23:00,080
He was dead in August.
He was found dead in his bathroom step.

3102
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:02,750
What lawsuit against?
For the DNC?

3103
02:23:03,320 --> 02:23:04,610
For Bernie Sanders or something like
that.

3104
02:23:04,611 --> 02:23:07,040
I believe so.
He was killed too,

3105
02:23:07,310 --> 02:23:09,680
along with the kid who released the
documents.

3106
02:23:09,681 --> 02:23:11,630
It was.
He probably did it.

3107
02:23:11,631 --> 02:23:15,770
They don't know if he for sure did it,
but an analyst that had access to that

3108
02:23:15,771 --> 02:23:17,240
information,
I believe it was him and he was

3109
02:23:17,241 --> 02:23:18,074
murdered.
Look,

3110
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:20,300
they're killing people.
Everyone's killing people,

3111
02:23:20,301 --> 02:23:21,430
right?
I mean not are.

3112
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:24,740
You can't.
Are we on?

3113
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:26,640
Well,
the selten,

3114
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:30,150
no,
just occasionally to make dirty Mus.

3115
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:34,190
Think about what people do for just a
small amount of money,

3116
02:23:34,220 --> 02:23:36,680
right?
The horrible things people do to other

3117
02:23:36,681 --> 02:23:40,400
people for small amounts of money.
When you get up to that level of

3118
02:23:40,430 --> 02:23:45,430
billions of government size money,
come on,

3119
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:49,970
right?
You see all the accusations against a

3120
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:53,360
poot and over the weekend I was like,
those people are dying.

3121
02:23:53,810 --> 02:23:54,710
Porter,
just yesterday,

3122
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:55,921
yesterday,
yesterday,

3123
02:23:55,921 --> 02:23:57,860
a guy got shot in the head.
Guy was critical of Putin.

3124
02:23:58,010 --> 02:23:59,090
Suicide.
Yeah.

3125
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:00,320
Yeah.
Definitely.

3126
02:24:00,321 --> 02:24:01,830
Suicided himself.
What the fuck,

3127
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:03,620
man?
It's scary up there.

3128
02:24:04,310 --> 02:24:07,400
It's really scary up.
You see that video of that.

3129
02:24:07,401 --> 02:24:12,320
A guy took a surveillance camera at this
millionaire who's having some or

3130
02:24:12,321 --> 02:24:13,990
billionaire.
I guess it's happened.

3131
02:24:14,060 --> 02:24:18,020
Some big dispute with his girlfriend.
He broke up with her and so she led.

3132
02:24:18,021 --> 02:24:21,350
She beat him up.
She wants money and he has surveillance

3133
02:24:21,351 --> 02:24:24,110
video of her lying on the bed.
Punching herself in the face.

3134
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:25,393
No,

3135
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:29,960
I tweeted it today.
You did a wonderful,

3136
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:33,770
wonderful listen folks.
It's not an us or them thing.

3137
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:36,980
We have to stop this.
There's a thing that women do whenever a

3138
02:24:36,981 --> 02:24:40,340
woman is involved in any sort of a
domestic violence,

3139
02:24:40,341 --> 02:24:42,200
abuse,
rape type situation,

3140
02:24:42,470 --> 02:24:46,160
there's a thing that women automatically
do where they think that that woman is

3141
02:24:46,161 --> 02:24:50,450
not guilty and that woman has been
abused and that women is definitely not

3142
02:24:50,451 --> 02:24:55,451
lying and most of the time you're right,
but there are a lot of fucking liars out

3143
02:24:55,461 --> 02:24:59,930
there and some of them have penises and
some of them have vaginas and that this

3144
02:24:59,931 --> 02:25:03,710
is something as human beings,
we have to stop being on these fucking

3145
02:25:03,770 --> 02:25:05,420
gender based teams.
Yeah,

3146
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:10,040
it's stupid because there are nutty
pitches out there and some of them are

3147
02:25:10,041 --> 02:25:14,690
men and some of them are women and this
woman is just sitting there as a video

3148
02:25:14,691 --> 02:25:18,260
of her hitting her side in the face,
hitting herself in the face,

3149
02:25:18,410 --> 02:25:22,730
screaming and yelling and wailing
herself in the face.

3150
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:25,150
Look at her.
She's fucking bananas,

3151
02:25:25,151 --> 02:25:26,620
man.
Oh my God.

3152
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:30,790
So she gives herself marks all over her
face and then she calls the cops and

3153
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:33,910
she's having a temper tantrum and
storming around and she doesn't realize

3154
02:25:33,911 --> 02:25:35,980
that she's being filmed.
It's crazy.

3155
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:37,960
But meanwhile,
I don't even know how much of this is

3156
02:25:37,961 --> 02:25:41,020
admissible because she's fucking hitting
herself in the face so hard.

3157
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:45,250
I don't know how much of this is an
admissible in court in divorce court?

3158
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:46,480
I don't know.
Or in.

3159
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:49,000
Well,
well not even divorced court,

3160
02:25:49,001 --> 02:25:52,200
but if he's being prosecuted for it.
Yeah,

3161
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,720
it was his fiance.
But you know,

3162
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:58,810
this is what everybody said.
I mean this has been a lot of these

3163
02:25:58,811 --> 02:26:03,430
cases and this is the what Johnny Depp
is claiming happened where his ex

3164
02:26:03,431 --> 02:26:05,620
girlfriend was saying that he beat her
up and he said I.

3165
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:08,860
He didn't do it and she just did it to
herself or faked it or something like

3166
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:09,250
that.

3167
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:10,360
End Up.
Who knows?

3168
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:12,520
There's still disputing it.
She's suing Doug.

3169
02:26:12,521 --> 02:26:14,530
Stan hope she it.
Doug's Dan,

3170
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:17,500
because he was defended them.
She's Doug Stanhope wrote an article

3171
02:26:17,530 --> 02:26:21,350
saying that he knows that she's a liar
and that she was blackmailing him and

3172
02:26:21,370 --> 02:26:23,890
that Johnny Depp.
It told him about it before any of this

3173
02:26:23,891 --> 02:26:25,660
came out,
that she had some demands.

3174
02:26:26,140 --> 02:26:28,630
I don't know who's telling the truth.
I don't know if Doug really knows.

3175
02:26:28,631 --> 02:26:30,940
I don't know who the fuck knows I wasn't
there,

3176
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,740
but here's the thing,
man,

3177
02:26:32,770 --> 02:26:35,890
there are people like that nutty bitch
that you just saw in that video hitting

3178
02:26:35,891 --> 02:26:37,660
herself in the face.
There's people like that.

3179
02:26:37,661 --> 02:26:39,130
They're real people.
It's crazy.

3180
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:41,530
They have vaginas and some of them have
penises.

3181
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:45,250
They're not be men or women.
No one's infallible.

3182
02:26:45,251 --> 02:26:48,610
We got to get off these teams is because
this is a real problem.

3183
02:26:48,611 --> 02:26:49,720
This is very divisive.

3184
02:26:49,770 --> 02:26:53,980
It really separates people.
Is this idea that anytime a woman

3185
02:26:53,981 --> 02:26:55,810
accuses a man of something,
it must be true.

3186
02:26:56,290 --> 02:26:58,240
It's not true.
That's not right.

3187
02:26:58,241 --> 02:27:01,210
Like we have to be sure we have to and I
don't know how to do that,

3188
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:04,930
but I don't think the way to do that is
to automatically assume that even like

3189
02:27:04,931 --> 02:27:07,870
shady pitches are all telling the truth
always,

3190
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:10,720
and then every woman who's accusing
amount of something without a doubt

3191
02:27:10,721 --> 02:27:12,430
can't be lying.
That's crazy.

3192
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:15,430
It's case by case by case.
Lately different,

3193
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:16,510
and again,
you don't want to.

3194
02:27:16,511 --> 02:27:20,650
You don't want to blame the victim.
If someone is a victim and you go around

3195
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:21,820
and you know you,
you say,

3196
02:27:21,821 --> 02:27:23,230
I don't believe a fucking word you're
saying,

3197
02:27:23,231 --> 02:27:24,640
and meanwhile that actually did happen
to them.

3198
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:26,200
It's horrible,
brutal,

3199
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:28,240
but we have to be able to figure out
what is what.

3200
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:31,060
Yeah,
it's hard to cut to not come up with a

3201
02:27:31,061 --> 02:27:33,860
general generalization because those
cases,

3202
02:27:33,870 --> 02:27:36,820
that's the.
That's if there's some way that you can

3203
02:27:36,821 --> 02:27:40,360
get the people that are dealing with
these situations to break through that

3204
02:27:40,361 --> 02:27:43,140
barrier and look at everything as a case
by case basis.

3205
02:27:43,141 --> 02:27:46,180
I don't know how you do it.
We don't have enough knowledge of

3206
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:49,450
whether or not a person who's being
truthful and then there's also an issue

3207
02:27:49,451 --> 02:27:52,720
where people in their own minds changed
reality.

3208
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:56,110
Like you could have an argument with
someone and they can decide in their own

3209
02:27:56,111 --> 02:28:00,220
mind over the course of whatever weeks
have passed that that argument was a

3210
02:28:00,221 --> 02:28:03,670
completely different beast than what was
happening while I was going down.

3211
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:07,960
Your ego lies to you start telling the
story to other people with distortions.

3212
02:28:07,961 --> 02:28:09,970
Those distortions become a part of the
reality.

3213
02:28:10,300 --> 02:28:13,960
It becomes the narrative you get,
it gets more and more exaggerated.

3214
02:28:13,961 --> 02:28:15,790
Every time you talk about it becomes
real.

3215
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:17,170
It becomes real.
Yeah.

3216
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:21,190
Most people,
it's really hard for them to accurately

3217
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:22,310
and objectively

3218
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:25,130
talk about like a very traumatic
situation.

3219
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:28,880
Like if you did get in a fight with a
guy and you're a woman and you're

3220
02:28:28,890 --> 02:28:30,560
engaged this guy and he really did beat
you up.

3221
02:28:30,561 --> 02:28:31,430
Like,
fuck.

3222
02:28:31,550 --> 02:28:33,650
Yeah,
like just trying to relay that

3223
02:28:33,651 --> 02:28:36,350
accurately.
It's got to be terrifying and bizarre.

3224
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:37,820
And fleetingly.
Yeah.

3225
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:40,880
Out of your mind.
And then you've got to parse these tiny

3226
02:28:40,881 --> 02:28:44,150
little details about it.
How much is this dude laughing?

3227
02:28:44,180 --> 02:28:45,830
The studio has this video right now
though.

3228
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:49,190
Like when he saw,
when he knew he had his like,

3229
02:28:49,191 --> 02:28:53,780
oh fuck yeah,
and that's the thing.

3230
02:28:53,781 --> 02:28:55,670
She'll come,
she'll realize that.

3231
02:28:56,110 --> 02:28:57,280
Oh No,
about that show.

3232
02:28:57,290 --> 02:28:58,460
Rationalize it.
She'll be like,

3233
02:28:58,461 --> 02:28:58,701
yeah,
well,

3234
02:28:58,701 --> 02:29:01,000
you know,
I just never caught him in the act.

3235
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:03,980
Who knows what she'll do,
but she's crazy enough where she will

3236
02:29:03,981 --> 02:29:08,000
have a working system in her head of why
that's okay.

3237
02:29:08,330 --> 02:29:10,910
Well,
this is also what you get when women

3238
02:29:10,911 --> 02:29:13,580
fuck us for their money.
You get people who are mad,

3239
02:29:13,790 --> 02:29:15,800
like if you want to fucking a guy for
his money,

3240
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:18,380
say if you're an attractive woman like
this girl is and the guys,

3241
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:23,510
but she could probably do better.
She's beautiful that you get mad at

3242
02:29:23,511 --> 02:29:24,380
that,
right?

3243
02:29:24,950 --> 02:29:26,600
Powerless.
Never fuck over your head,

3244
02:29:26,970 --> 02:29:29,930
right?
Just stay within your means.

3245
02:29:30,470 --> 02:29:31,240
Yeah,
no,

3246
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:35,540
I know what you're dealing with.
People are not really attracted to you,

3247
02:29:35,541 --> 02:29:36,250
man.
It gets.

3248
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:38,930
It gets ugly.
It's ugly.

3249
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:40,250
It's true.
It's not good.

3250
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:42,110
You know,
everybody has this idea that got to get

3251
02:29:42,111 --> 02:29:44,800
a supermodel.
That's the dumbest move to it.

3252
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:46,090
Oh,
you not do it.

3253
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:47,970
Don't do it.
Don't fuck over your head because you'll

3254
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:49,160
have to pay.
There's a deficit.

3255
02:29:49,161 --> 02:29:51,860
It's like buying a corvette when you're
still in college,

3256
02:29:51,861 --> 02:29:53,960
but you got the student loan or I'm
going to spend it on the car.

3257
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:55,730
I'm crazy.
Bob bought a corvette.

3258
02:29:55,731 --> 02:29:57,610
Get the fuck out of here and you go
outside.

3259
02:29:57,640 --> 02:30:02,230
This fucking guy's like jump.
Start delivering it dominoes and I'm

3260
02:30:02,250 --> 02:30:04,670
going to pay this car off.
Brawler drove in a car.

3261
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:05,533
It's,
well,

3262
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,810
that's what the guys dealing with.
It takes a super hot wife if he's a

3263
02:30:08,811 --> 02:30:09,830
fucking fat,
ugly,

3264
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:11,210
Rich Guy.
Crazy.

3265
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:13,100
You have to know if that's what you're
getting.

3266
02:30:13,101 --> 02:30:16,580
Now you're competing with everyone who
wants to sleep with that and that is a

3267
02:30:16,581 --> 02:30:17,960
supermodel.
Just genetically,

3268
02:30:17,961 --> 02:30:21,800
you've now increased the number of other
Alpha males coming for this person.

3269
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:24,380
Plus,
I think a good move is to always go

3270
02:30:24,381 --> 02:30:27,140
foreign.
It's like that's how I feel about sports

3271
02:30:27,141 --> 02:30:29,870
cars.
That's how I feel about trophy bribed

3272
02:30:30,220 --> 02:30:30,890
you.
If you're gonna,

3273
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:34,040
get a trophy bride.
Get one from some war torn regions of

3274
02:30:34,041 --> 02:30:35,680
the world.
She don't know no better.

3275
02:30:36,320 --> 02:30:37,730
Happy.
She's got food.

3276
02:30:37,731 --> 02:30:39,920
She genuinely loves you for taking care
of her.

3277
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:44,630
She's so psyched and if you move her
family out of the ramshackle village,

3278
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:46,760
the ramp that the Jews are about to plow
down,

3279
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:49,540
you can move her whole family are your
family.

3280
02:30:49,550 --> 02:30:52,430
You guys will have a wonderful
relationship based on actual

3281
02:30:52,431 --> 02:30:54,500
appreciation,
but just like running water,

3282
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:58,880
but if you date some blonde and Florida
with big tits and she does coke,

3283
02:30:58,910 --> 02:31:02,150
who's come up through the minors,
she know she doesn't want to fuck you,

3284
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:05,360
you and your mediocre Dick.
She doesn't do it.

3285
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:08,390
She's with studying and how to get this
done her whole life.

3286
02:31:08,391 --> 02:31:11,270
She's trying to think of how the fuck
she can close this deal and make the big

3287
02:31:11,271 --> 02:31:14,390
money and right when she was at the
finish line,

3288
02:31:14,391 --> 02:31:16,640
you cut it off.
That's what happened.

3289
02:31:16,641 --> 02:31:19,300
He broke up with the fiance and she's a.
she's like,

3290
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:20,040
there's got be a

3291
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:23,460
way to make money out of this deal.
Bang,

3292
02:31:23,461 --> 02:31:24,180
Bang,
Bang.

3293
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:26,070
She's just.
She's just going.

3294
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:29,370
She's fucking throwing a hail Mary.
Will they have whole clinics like that

3295
02:31:29,371 --> 02:31:30,780
for,
for young athletes,

3296
02:31:30,781 --> 02:31:32,100
right?
Of that there's.

3297
02:31:32,150 --> 02:31:34,800
It's a business for do they,
but yeah.

3298
02:31:34,801 --> 02:31:37,080
It's a business for women to come after
these young,

3299
02:31:37,081 --> 02:31:38,940
get pregnant and get pregnant and all
these things.

3300
02:31:38,941 --> 02:31:42,090
They literally are counseled.
Then this is one of the threats to your

3301
02:31:42,091 --> 02:31:42,924
life.
Yeah.

3302
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:45,240
We'll definitely to your livelihood.
Yeah,

3303
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:48,120
yeah.
Well it's real and look,

3304
02:31:48,430 --> 02:31:51,660
it's also,
it makes sense because it's.

3305
02:31:51,661 --> 02:31:52,910
There's an imbalance,
right?

3306
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:53,731
If you're.
Yeah,

3307
02:31:53,731 --> 02:31:58,290
if you're like some baller,
rich dude who's worth billions of

3308
02:31:58,290 --> 02:31:59,400
dollars,
you got private jets,

3309
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:02,070
you're pulling up everywhere in the
Rolls Royce of people open the door for

3310
02:32:02,071 --> 02:32:03,510
you and you walk out with your
sunglasses.

3311
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:06,000
Walk Straight to your private jet.
Oh my God,

3312
02:32:06,090 --> 02:32:07,260
this is me this week.

3313
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:10,170
Yeah,
he's so unattainable and the resources

3314
02:32:10,171 --> 02:32:13,290
are so ridiculous that people are in
some way,

3315
02:32:13,291 --> 02:32:14,880
some strange way attracted to them.
Right?

3316
02:32:14,881 --> 02:32:16,920
Everyone around him like Mr Papas
coming,

3317
02:32:16,921 --> 02:32:20,420
Mr Bob was coming to see ms dot brava.
Don't make eye contact with Mr Papa.

3318
02:32:20,690 --> 02:32:24,100
Uh,
if he talks to you and be polite and be

3319
02:32:24,140 --> 02:32:25,620
egregious,
but whatever you do,

3320
02:32:25,621 --> 02:32:28,580
don't ask Mr Popper for money and just
pop up right there just above us here,

3321
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:30,530
Mr. Hi everybody.
How are you?

3322
02:32:30,690 --> 02:32:33,960
And you just get the best of the best
out of these people and they think of

3323
02:32:33,961 --> 02:32:34,830
you as like,
wow,

3324
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:38,130
if I could just get closer to Mr Pompa,
my whole world would change and it makes

3325
02:32:38,131 --> 02:32:39,750
sense because everybody's trying to be
nice to you.

3326
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:42,360
Which is like weird.
Totally weird.

3327
02:32:42,361 --> 02:32:45,810
If you're some super billionaire Richard
Branson type character,

3328
02:32:45,811 --> 02:32:48,570
everywhere you go,
everybody's kissing your ass and trying

3329
02:32:48,571 --> 02:32:49,230
to be nice to you.

3330
02:32:49,230 --> 02:32:53,300
You get this really distorted version of
humans and women are attracted you.

3331
02:32:53,301 --> 02:32:55,110
That shouldn't be attracted to you.
That's right.

3332
02:32:55,111 --> 02:32:57,110
It's natural,
but you think they should be.

3333
02:32:57,300 --> 02:32:59,340
You should think they should and they
get to fuck you.

3334
02:32:59,341 --> 02:33:01,790
And they get to smell you and realize
how what you,

3335
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:06,250
what you really are and who you really
are like you need to get this guy to

3336
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:08,910
fucking pain is terrible,
man.

3337
02:33:08,911 --> 02:33:10,230
Where's my Ferrari?
Stupid.

3338
02:33:10,570 --> 02:33:11,880
You know how come on,
I'm a villa.

3339
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:14,910
And then next thing you know you get
this guy buying you shit.

3340
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:20,040
And other women are coming after him.
So he's probably mad men like that.

3341
02:33:20,491 --> 02:33:24,060
Donald Sterling girl,
the girl who required down sterling St,

3342
02:33:24,061 --> 02:33:27,840
all that racist shit.
He bought her a Bentley or a Ferrari,

3343
02:33:27,841 --> 02:33:31,450
a fat condo.
He bought her a gang of shit and she was

3344
02:33:31,460 --> 02:33:33,340
like,
it wasn't enough enough.

3345
02:33:33,490 --> 02:33:38,490
You fucking disgusting bag of meat.
A whole leather saddle bag filled with

3346
02:33:40,921 --> 02:33:43,680
rotten hamburger.
Fuck you.

3347
02:33:43,681 --> 02:33:46,830
I can't believe I sucked your Dick.
Hey me.

3348
02:33:46,950 --> 02:33:50,280
Motherfucker pay me.
What do you think,

3349
02:33:50,281 --> 02:33:51,600
honey?
What do you think of?

3350
02:33:51,601 --> 02:33:54,960
Black people don't like it when they
fuck you.

3351
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:55,471
Wait,
wait,

3352
02:33:55,471 --> 02:33:56,304
hold on,
let me.

3353
02:33:56,310 --> 02:33:57,900
I didn't press record.
What do you think of?

3354
02:33:58,830 --> 02:34:01,320
What's record?
What are you doing over there?

3355
02:34:01,930 --> 02:34:03,050
And that person bought?
Yeah.

3356
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:04,680
Awful.
Yeah.

3357
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:09,560
Could you imagine when you hear stories
like that and aren't you just happy that

3358
02:34:10,010 --> 02:34:11,070
it's not you?
Yeah,

3359
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:14,280
but you just have like got married,
have some kids.

3360
02:34:14,281 --> 02:34:16,710
You're just like,
there's a lot of things that aren't sexy

3361
02:34:16,711 --> 02:34:17,590
about,
you know,

3362
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:21,250
all of that stuff.
Just being simple and just breaking it

3363
02:34:21,251 --> 02:34:24,040
down to just like I go to my kid's
school and I do my stuff.

3364
02:34:24,041 --> 02:34:28,510
Like having a smaller world is a relief.

3365
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:31,210
It definitely is.
There's a certain level that you can get

3366
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:34,030
too big and then things become like a
giant,

3367
02:34:34,031 --> 02:34:34,571
big,
fat,

3368
02:34:34,571 --> 02:34:36,580
crazy problem to complex.
Yeah.

3369
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:38,230
Well,
if you're at that level,

3370
02:34:38,380 --> 02:34:40,240
if you're at like a Richard Branson
level.

3371
02:34:40,370 --> 02:34:43,570
Yeah.
It's kind of a john or Johnny Depp level

3372
02:34:43,571 --> 02:34:44,404
even.
Yeah.

3373
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:47,330
Yeah.
It's got to be God damn problem Heti oh

3374
02:34:47,331 --> 02:34:48,300
yeah.
Heady.

3375
02:34:48,590 --> 02:34:49,860
Lots of heady.
Yeah.

3376
02:34:50,220 --> 02:34:53,890
You've got to be real disciplined person
and like come up with a structure for

3377
02:34:53,891 --> 02:34:57,610
yourself of working and taking care of
your life without spinning out of

3378
02:34:57,611 --> 02:34:59,020
control.
So I love of people lose it.

3379
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:03,220
Yeah.
I was talking to this dude in Seattle

3380
02:35:03,221 --> 02:35:07,720
this past weekend.
Who knew this guy who sued Paul Allen?

3381
02:35:08,050 --> 02:35:09,190
The Microsoft Guy?
Yeah.

3382
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:12,340
And one.
And now scared to be in Seattle.

3383
02:35:12,341 --> 02:35:14,200
No,
he never goes to Seattle anymore.

3384
02:35:14,790 --> 02:35:16,060
Yeah.
Oh my God.

3385
02:35:16,110 --> 02:35:19,320
Super Paranoid after he won.
Yeah.

3386
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:21,490
So that's what I'm talking about.

3387
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:24,910
You got for what you wish for.
To too high a level of the game,

3388
02:35:24,911 --> 02:35:27,990
son.
I want to unwind.

3389
02:35:28,510 --> 02:35:31,360
I don't want to look into it.
God that are worth $100.

3390
02:35:31,361 --> 02:35:32,194
Million Dollars.
Well,

3391
02:35:32,430 --> 02:35:34,870
we were owns islands.
Yeah,

3392
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:37,070
they have stupid money.
We were at the um,

3393
02:35:37,190 --> 02:35:42,190
there's an area called the locks where
the salmon swim through these ladders.

3394
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:46,870
It's really dope because you actually go
underground and there's a wall glass

3395
02:35:46,871 --> 02:35:51,871
wall and you can watch the fish swim.
Literally the wild fish swim up these

3396
02:35:52,661 --> 02:35:54,580
locks.
It's super fucking cool.

3397
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:56,740
It makes you want to go fishing right
near Seattle.

3398
02:35:57,050 --> 02:35:57,541
Yeah.
Yeah.

3399
02:35:57,541 --> 02:35:59,290
It's Ballard.
The ballard locks.

3400
02:35:59,350 --> 02:36:01,090
Cool.
Ballard is like a small area.

3401
02:36:01,091 --> 02:36:02,050
Seattle,
which is a really,

3402
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:07,000
really fucking cool area with a lot of
great little restaurants and bars and

3403
02:36:07,001 --> 02:36:09,820
great community.
And a friend of mine lives there and him

3404
02:36:09,821 --> 02:36:13,330
and his family took us to this place and
so we went to this ballard locks thing

3405
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:15,640
and we were checking around and we're
looking at it and one of the guys that

3406
02:36:15,641 --> 02:36:16,810
was there,
there,

3407
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:17,710
that's it right there.

3408
02:36:17,710 --> 02:36:21,520
So you get to look at it through this
wall and those salmon are all swimming,

3409
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:24,580
um,
up up this little ladder going home,

3410
02:36:25,010 --> 02:36:27,590
they're going to die.
That's where they were in Morton,

3411
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:28,120
right?
Yep.

3412
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:30,400
The Women Salmon,
the female salmon,

3413
02:36:30,460 --> 02:36:33,340
they pump out the eggs.
And the dude's just stand over him and

3414
02:36:33,341 --> 02:36:36,850
whack off.
They just on the eggs and then they die.

3415
02:36:37,030 --> 02:36:39,300
That's how they,
they don't even get to fuck right.

3416
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:42,010
Have you ever caught a fish that's,
that has come in it?

3417
02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:46,660
No.
When I was a kid I used to do a trick

3418
02:36:46,661 --> 02:36:51,430
question when I was a kid.
I used to go fishing all the time.

3419
02:36:51,431 --> 02:36:54,820
It was big into fishing and I would do a
lot of rainbow trout fishing and when it

3420
02:36:54,821 --> 02:36:58,960
was really great fun to catch them is
when they were responding and you would

3421
02:36:58,961 --> 02:37:01,180
throw out your lure and they would just
attack anything.

3422
02:37:01,181 --> 02:37:03,760
They were super aggressive.
But then when you would pick them up,

3423
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:07,560
they would be jizzing like you had
pulled them out of the water and they

3424
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:10,420
took a chance.
Maybe there's x near me because they

3425
02:37:10,421 --> 02:37:13,780
know it's over arches.
I don't taste it.

3426
02:37:14,610 --> 02:37:16,460
Tasted arches either.
Trick question.

3427
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:20,120
You almost got me.
You motherfucker.

3428
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:23,930
But um,
they would,

3429
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:27,260
you pick them up and they literally
would be orgasming as you're pulling

3430
02:37:27,261 --> 02:37:29,690
them out of the water.
There's just been all over the place.

3431
02:37:30,190 --> 02:37:30,741
Yeah,
it's apparent.

3432
02:37:30,741 --> 02:37:33,350
Was pretty common,
but I remember a lot from when I was a

3433
02:37:33,351 --> 02:37:35,330
kid.
I haven't had it happen in any sense,

3434
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:37,970
but I do remember it a lot when I was a
kid,

3435
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:41,330
but I don't do nearly as much fishing.
So wait.

3436
02:37:41,331 --> 02:37:44,350
So Paul Allen,
this guy suits and has um,

3437
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:47,570
this guy at the locks.
This is a circular sort of a thing.

3438
02:37:47,870 --> 02:37:51,110
The guy at the locks who I was talking
to it as asking them some questions

3439
02:37:51,111 --> 02:37:55,730
about some of the fish he was pointing
out the bays and how they change this

3440
02:37:55,731 --> 02:37:58,880
lake because there was a lake,
there's a lake there and they didn't

3441
02:37:58,881 --> 02:38:02,690
realize that when they cut this channel
that it lowered the level of the lake

3442
02:38:02,691 --> 02:38:05,330
and then that made it so the fish
couldn't get back to the lake.

3443
02:38:05,330 --> 02:38:08,630
And it was a real issue.
They had said they were stacks of dead

3444
02:38:08,631 --> 02:38:09,800
Salmon,
the like 20,

3445
02:38:09,810 --> 02:38:13,820
30 feet high.
She's crazy that they would just go to

3446
02:38:13,821 --> 02:38:16,250
the area where they had always gone,
but now the river didn't go all the way

3447
02:38:16,251 --> 02:38:18,350
to the end where the lake was and they
would just wind up dying.

3448
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:23,420
She's but he was saying that Paul Allen
and Bill Gates both have these insane

3449
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:28,040
$150,000,000 houses on this leg.
Wow.

3450
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:32,190
Imagine them what a hundred and
$50,000,000 house looks like.

3451
02:38:32,390 --> 02:38:35,750
I know.
What the fuck are we even talking about

3452
02:38:35,751 --> 02:38:39,140
it and it's great Wifi.
I bet the Wifi is dog shit.

3453
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:44,000
I better get viruses every time.
A lot of malware and every time he opens

3454
02:38:44,001 --> 02:38:45,920
up a room,
a new virus,

3455
02:38:45,921 --> 02:38:49,790
because everything's on computers.
You wear a tie clip at least this is the

3456
02:38:49,791 --> 02:38:50,624
way it used to work.

3457
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:54,860
You would wear a pin and you put that
pin on the pin and this is like many,

3458
02:38:54,861 --> 02:38:56,870
many years ago,
so I'm sure the technology is far more

3459
02:38:56,871 --> 02:38:59,510
advanced now,
but the way Bill Gates had it set up,

3460
02:38:59,511 --> 02:39:02,260
every time you'd walk into a room,
the pin would recognize the user,

3461
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:05,780
set the temperature to your preferences
and play the kind of music that you like

3462
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:09,110
and put certain type of lighting on.
Oh my God.

3463
02:39:09,111 --> 02:39:10,400
It's got to be amazing.
Yeah,

3464
02:39:10,401 --> 02:39:12,440
but it's probably all outdated,
which is kind of funny.

3465
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:14,750
Unless he's updated it constantly.
Dates,

3466
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:19,020
it gets a new lighting system.
Bill Gates,

3467
02:39:19,160 --> 02:39:20,840
did they ever do a tour of Bill Gates
House?

3468
02:39:22,450 --> 02:39:24,770
I heard that the.
That it was mostly because of the

3469
02:39:24,771 --> 02:39:27,440
technology that it's not that massive.
Oh really?

3470
02:39:27,530 --> 02:39:29,030
That's what I heard.
Well,

3471
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:31,940
that probably be a smart move.
It's not stand out too much.

3472
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,280
I already asked like a summary that he
could escape in.

3473
02:39:34,610 --> 02:39:38,510
We'd drop it a pod and dropped below.
Look in the basement because in case

3474
02:39:38,511 --> 02:39:41,180
somebody breaks into the house,
you just shoot out out of a tube and a

3475
02:39:41,181 --> 02:39:43,250
submarine.
Six thousand square feet,

3476
02:39:43,430 --> 02:39:44,960
and that's kind of big.
Sixty six.

3477
02:39:44,961 --> 02:39:49,310
That's a little bigger than normal.
Sixty $3 million to build Jesus Christ.

3478
02:39:49,311 --> 02:39:51,020
It's worth at least 100.
Twenty 3 million.

3479
02:39:51,021 --> 02:39:53,420
According to the King County public
assessors office,

3480
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:57,680
the property is worth 123 point five,
4 million.

3481
02:39:57,681 --> 02:40:00,590
As of this year,
Gates purchased the lot for 2 million

3482
02:40:00,591 --> 02:40:05,591
bucks in 1988 before windows 95
reportedly pays around a million dollars

3483
02:40:05,691 --> 02:40:08,270
in property taxes each year.
Oh my God.

3484
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:13,680
Half a million board feet of lumber was
needed to complete the project.

3485
02:40:13,970 --> 02:40:16,140
Wow,
the house is built with.

3486
02:40:16,410 --> 02:40:19,710
Scroll down a little.
The house is built with 500 year old

3487
02:40:19,711 --> 02:40:23,310
Douglas Fir trees.
300 construction workers labored on the

3488
02:40:23,311 --> 02:40:25,290
home,
100 of whom were electricians.

3489
02:40:25,470 --> 02:40:28,970
50 died mysteriously.
That part,

3490
02:40:29,470 --> 02:40:30,180
that part.

3491
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:33,990
What does it look like?
The House has uses natural surroundings

3492
02:40:33,991 --> 02:40:36,300
to reduce heat loss.
What's it looks like?

3493
02:40:36,301 --> 02:40:39,540
It's covered in woods stage,
like the side of the thing and there's

3494
02:40:39,541 --> 02:40:40,770
trees.
Dad added all around.

3495
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:42,360
What's above it?
What are those?

3496
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:45,210
That wall above it.
Is that a wall of China?

3497
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:47,220
It looks like an apartment building.
Probably other houses.

3498
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:51,030
The house can't be that close.
Bill Gates lives that close to his

3499
02:40:51,031 --> 02:40:53,130
fucking neighbors on the lake.
Maybe.

3500
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:54,390
Come on.
It's weird.

3501
02:40:54,391 --> 02:40:56,670
That's a house right above him.
He probably owns it to.

3502
02:40:56,671 --> 02:40:58,590
I would bet.
I would bet he would own everything.

3503
02:40:58,750 --> 02:41:03,300
Anyone fill it up with mercenaries?
He's worth too much money.

3504
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:06,720
Yeah.
Well it keeps the music system.

3505
02:41:06,721 --> 02:41:08,360
He did.
He did give a lot of money away.

3506
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:11,220
There's a trampoline room with 20 foot
ceilings,

3507
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:13,710
24 bathrooms.

3508
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:18,060
He has a reception hall that can
accommodate 200 guests,

3509
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:20,680
kitchen,
Jesus Christ,

3510
02:41:20,710 --> 02:41:22,780
enormous library.
How's the manuscripts?

3511
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:27,900
Gates paid more than $30,000,000 for.
What is the manuscript?

3512
02:41:27,971 --> 02:41:30,310
Great Gatsby.
Wow.

3513
02:41:32,170 --> 02:41:33,190
Well,
I don't know if that's it.

3514
02:41:33,310 --> 02:41:35,290
And so you'll find a quote from.
I'm sorry.

3515
02:41:35,350 --> 02:41:38,110
Yeah.
What is the manuscript Codex license?

3516
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:40,420
What is that?
Yeah,

3517
02:41:40,421 --> 02:41:42,820
what is that?
The 16th century?

3518
02:41:43,130 --> 02:41:45,710
It's a Davinci.
Oh man,

3519
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:48,410
you paid $30.
Million Bucks for a leaner Davinci

3520
02:41:48,430 --> 02:41:50,080
sketch.
Let's go get that.

3521
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:53,530
Let's go find it.
Well,

3522
02:41:53,531 --> 02:41:55,600
apparently that is,
that was talking to this real estate

3523
02:41:55,601 --> 02:41:59,290
agent who told me that that is a big
issue with houses that are,

3524
02:41:59,291 --> 02:42:00,820
um,
that are listed,

3525
02:42:00,850 --> 02:42:04,600
that are expensive houses and they are
framed up meaning,

3526
02:42:04,601 --> 02:42:05,880
you know,
like inside you go in there,

3527
02:42:05,890 --> 02:42:10,600
everything's already like there's really
nice sheets and artwork on the walls and

3528
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:11,710
staged is the right word.

3529
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:12,621
Uh,
so they,

3530
02:42:12,621 --> 02:42:14,770
they have this artwork.
There's a lot of these houses,

3531
02:42:14,771 --> 02:42:17,690
like if it's expensive house,
they have expensive artwork and so

3532
02:42:17,691 --> 02:42:20,290
people break into these houses while
they know that they're selling the house

3533
02:42:20,291 --> 02:42:22,630
and no one's living in it.
And take the stuff,

3534
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:24,250
take the artwork.
Let's do it,

3535
02:42:24,251 --> 02:42:25,150
dude.
Dude,

3536
02:42:25,151 --> 02:42:27,330
artwork is where a lot of money part of
it.

3537
02:42:27,460 --> 02:42:29,320
Our official stream is stocked with
fish.

3538
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:31,210
Wonder if he gets in there and fuck
those fish.

3539
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:35,830
He has a favorite tree that's monitored
electronically 24 hours a day.

3540
02:42:35,860 --> 02:42:39,010
He reportedly became fond of 40 year old
maple tree.

3541
02:42:39,011 --> 02:42:41,290
That glue grew close to the homes
driveway.

3542
02:42:41,590 --> 02:42:44,740
It's monitored by computer.
If at any point it becomes too dry,

3543
02:42:44,741 --> 02:42:47,620
water is automatically pumped into it.
Whoa.

3544
02:42:47,621 --> 02:42:49,510
He's in love with the tree.
He loves trees.

3545
02:42:49,570 --> 02:42:51,820
Tesla was in love with a pigeon.
It's not that weird.

3546
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:52,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

3547
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:55,430
Nikola Tesla fell in love with a pigeon.
Oh,

3548
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:59,200
sand on gates is beach is imported from
the Caribbean.

3549
02:42:59,510 --> 02:43:00,343
Want to continue?

3550
02:43:00,510 --> 02:43:01,610
Ooh.
Ooh.

3551
02:43:01,700 --> 02:43:04,030
Thirty five grand at tour it.
Wow.

3552
02:43:04,060 --> 02:43:08,170
Microsoft holds an auction each year.
Employees donate products and services

3553
02:43:08,380 --> 02:43:10,600
to bid on proceeds.
Go to the company's charitable fund.

3554
02:43:10,601 --> 02:43:13,810
Gates is private tours of Zana.
Dude.

3555
02:43:13,811 --> 02:43:15,630
That's what he calls it.
Zana do two point.

3556
02:43:15,750 --> 02:43:18,100
Oh,
you have to wear leg warmers when you go

3557
02:43:18,110 --> 02:43:22,240
in and fuzzy slippers.
According to the puget sound business

3558
02:43:22,241 --> 02:43:24,880
journal,
a Microsoft employee once one tour on a

3559
02:43:24,881 --> 02:43:25,870
bid,
$30,000.

3560
02:43:26,110 --> 02:43:29,500
He's an employee.
How about you give your fucking employee

3561
02:43:29,501 --> 02:43:30,970
a break?
You twat

3562
02:43:32,860 --> 02:43:34,000
he wants to give.
Well,

3563
02:43:34,010 --> 02:43:35,920
it actually goes to the charity.
That's nice.

3564
02:43:35,950 --> 02:43:40,000
He also has a 228 Acre ranch complete
with a horse racing track.

3565
02:43:40,690 --> 02:43:43,420
He's got a lot of cash.
When you read stuff like that,

3566
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:44,680
as you go,
man,

3567
02:43:44,681 --> 02:43:48,930
I got to become more of a baller,
like everything's free now.

3568
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:51,640
Him and his wife say,
we're going to try and size down.

3569
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,010
We're going to try and solve the world
hunger.

3570
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:57,370
That's not gonna work,
but we're going to applaud their

3571
02:43:57,371 --> 02:43:58,750
efforts.
Fixed malaria.

3572
02:43:59,050 --> 02:43:59,980
Oh,
well.

3573
02:43:59,981 --> 02:44:02,070
With the genetically modified
mosquitoes,

3574
02:44:02,071 --> 02:44:03,790
yes.
That might be possible.

3575
02:44:03,791 --> 02:44:08,560
Or 28 days later zombies.
They might happen to.

3576
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:09,880
Could be.
He had another.

3577
02:44:09,900 --> 02:44:13,010
The mosquitoes become even fiercer and
just come and kill us all.

3578
02:44:13,350 --> 02:44:17,780
Where mercy came from.
Who Murcia Mrs. Say

3579
02:44:20,490 --> 02:44:23,580
Medical Medication resistant.
Staph,

3580
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:28,600
old cockup office.
It's essentially medication resistant,

3581
02:44:28,811 --> 02:44:33,340
staph infections that are ruthless that
tear through people and kill a ton of

3582
02:44:33,341 --> 02:44:33,760
people.

3583
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:37,520
That's the campaign I was going to bring
this up when you're talking about the

3584
02:44:37,570 --> 02:44:40,630
mosquitoes earlier in China and like the
19 fifties,

3585
02:44:40,930 --> 02:44:43,300
they were having problems with a couple
of different paths,

3586
02:44:43,301 --> 02:44:46,660
mostly sparrows that said in this case
there were hundreds of millions of

3587
02:44:46,660 --> 02:44:49,030
sparrows,
so there's a government mandate to try

3588
02:44:49,031 --> 02:44:51,220
to get rid of them.
So people were literally going outside

3589
02:44:51,221 --> 02:44:54,700
and banging on pans for hours at a time
so that they couldn't land and they

3590
02:44:54,701 --> 02:44:58,990
would die from exhaustion,
exhaustion a 10 years later.

3591
02:44:58,991 --> 02:45:01,710
So there was a giant famine because
these,

3592
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:04,450
all the pes were stopping eating.
Uh,

3593
02:45:04,451 --> 02:45:06,640
all the bugs,
the bugs start eating all their bamboo

3594
02:45:06,641 --> 02:45:11,440
and rice and $30,
million people died in China from 19

3595
02:45:11,441 --> 02:45:12,140
six.
And I'm like,

3596
02:45:12,140 --> 02:45:13,000
God will not.
They did

3597
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:17,230
have a butterfly.
Can become the beginning of

3598
02:45:19,460 --> 02:45:20,740
really what it is.
Yeah,

3599
02:45:20,741 --> 02:45:21,940
you can't mess with nature.

3600
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:22,381
But,
uh,

3601
02:45:22,381 --> 02:45:26,120
on this mosquito thing that this
emergency they're doing in Florida,

3602
02:45:26,121 --> 02:45:29,270
they want to,
the officials are asking to skip a field

3603
02:45:29,271 --> 02:45:32,720
trial and they want to just go right
into it and not not test these

3604
02:45:32,721 --> 02:45:35,240
mosquitoes,
but whatsoever besides like that could

3605
02:45:35,241 --> 02:45:37,850
be a bigger problem where if Congress
had funded,

3606
02:45:38,210 --> 02:45:40,610
had funded this a year ago,
they would have

3607
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,050
all those tests.
Well there's a lot of fucking people

3608
02:45:43,051 --> 02:45:45,270
getting the Zika virus and on top of
that,

3609
02:45:45,271 --> 02:45:48,990
the latest thing is that now they find
out that men who don't show any symptoms

3610
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:53,100
can dismiss.
They can transmit the Zika virus

3611
02:45:53,101 --> 02:45:54,180
sexually,
right?

3612
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:59,300
So you could have no symptoms and you
just drop a load on walls in some

3613
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:04,140
portraits.
A trial who we found no people.

3614
02:46:04,490 --> 02:46:08,250
The people I'm with a girl not yet
affect girls and Florida.

3615
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:11,300
And apparently was another thing that
was an unlikely ally.

3616
02:46:11,301 --> 02:46:14,060
I was reading this.
An unlikely ally of the Zika virus is

3617
02:46:14,061 --> 02:46:17,750
high rise luxury condominiums.
For some reason,

3618
02:46:17,990 --> 02:46:22,800
high rise luxury condominiums make
excellent grounds for Zika viruses to

3619
02:46:23,030 --> 02:46:25,250
start breeding live in the vents.
I don't know.

3620
02:46:25,310 --> 02:46:27,220
I don't understand why,
but they,

3621
02:46:27,310 --> 02:46:30,500
there's areas where the CDC is thinking
about roping them off and going,

3622
02:46:30,501 --> 02:46:33,380
okay,
we got to fucking property really well

3623
02:46:33,381 --> 02:46:35,380
dude.
That the repercussions are the

3624
02:46:35,460 --> 02:46:37,300
repercussions.
What's the big ones?

3625
02:46:37,790 --> 02:46:40,110
Reproductive for women when they have
kids.

3626
02:46:40,111 --> 02:46:43,790
The kids develop this.
A horrible disorder with their heads.

3627
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:45,680
Yeah.
But uh,

3628
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:50,720
what if you could just like get a
balloon there and pull it up place?

3629
02:46:51,690 --> 02:46:54,340
Sure.
Zika is accidental ally.

3630
02:46:54,341 --> 02:46:57,820
Miami's luxury high rises,
low flying planes,

3631
02:46:57,850 --> 02:47:02,350
urban wind tunnels and imprecise
applications raise the risk of

3632
02:47:02,351 --> 02:47:04,750
mosquitoes.
Developing Resistance to insects

3633
02:47:04,780 --> 02:47:06,820
decides.
Whoa.

3634
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:09,310
Oh,
interests.

3635
02:47:09,311 --> 02:47:11,710
So it doesn't kill you.
It just gives your baby's little heads.

3636
02:47:12,610 --> 02:47:16,390
Low flying planes.
So that's a wind issue.

3637
02:47:17,140 --> 02:47:20,650
Aerial spraying with ultra low volume
can only

3638
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:23,930
come down,
can only be done when there's not much

3639
02:47:23,931 --> 02:47:28,931
wind.
So the wind and then the probably the

3640
02:47:29,451 --> 02:47:34,250
high rises are in the way and so around
the high rises they can't spray

3641
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:38,270
and they can't get low enough.
Whoo.

3642
02:47:38,300 --> 02:47:42,030
You got to get in there with like a,
like a bubbles one.

3643
02:47:42,090 --> 02:47:42,923
Wow.

3644
02:47:42,940 --> 02:47:45,760
This is scary shit though because this
is just one.

3645
02:47:45,940 --> 02:47:47,400
And I'm sure the other thing,
yeah,

3646
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:49,600
that's the thing.
We went to the CDC,

3647
02:47:49,601 --> 02:47:52,120
Duncan and I did for this episode of my
Scifi show.

3648
02:47:52,130 --> 02:47:56,470
We talked about um,
weaponized diseases and they were pretty

3649
02:47:56,471 --> 02:47:57,281
frank about it.
They said,

3650
02:47:57,281 --> 02:48:00,370
we are not worried about someone coming
up with a disease.

3651
02:48:00,460 --> 02:48:02,210
We're worried about nature,
right?

3652
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:05,140
Like no one has ever been able to
successfully come up with a disease.

3653
02:48:05,141 --> 02:48:07,930
And there's all this,
these fears and all these conspiracy

3654
02:48:07,931 --> 02:48:10,420
theories,
what you should really be terrified of

3655
02:48:10,750 --> 02:48:14,200
is just regular old nature taking a
terrible disease.

3656
02:48:14,201 --> 02:48:16,540
And it becomes airborne.
It mutates or changes.

3657
02:48:16,750 --> 02:48:19,960
And they do it all the time.
And they had Ebola.

3658
02:48:20,110 --> 02:48:24,060
They had all these crazy diseases locked
up in this lab where they had like these

3659
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:28,510
four foot cars and giant glass windows
he looked through and everyone,

3660
02:48:28,511 --> 02:48:32,530
they spacesuits on their,
attached over these exhaust vents,

3661
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:34,870
walking around with vacuum tubes hanging
off of him.

3662
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:36,790
It was really creepy.
Oh my God.

3663
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:38,080
Inside anyone.
Yeah,

3664
02:48:38,081 --> 02:48:39,760
just one,
one little sample of anything.

3665
02:48:40,130 --> 02:48:43,000
And these are hurricane proof buildings.
So the buildings designed because it's

3666
02:48:43,001 --> 02:48:45,180
right in Galveston.
It's near the gun.

3667
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:48,490
So these,
these buildings are designed to impact,

3668
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:52,180
get impacted by gigantic,
100 foot waves and shit and survive and

3669
02:48:52,181 --> 02:48:55,350
keep all the bacteria and tack.
Why are they saving this stuff where

3670
02:48:55,360 --> 02:48:56,680
they want to study it?
They want to trigger,

3671
02:48:56,750 --> 02:49:00,890
figure out how to solve it,
what they figure if they keep studying,

3672
02:49:00,910 --> 02:49:04,210
it might be able to find different ways
to keep it from killing all of us.

3673
02:49:04,750 --> 02:49:06,500
Good.
Tom Papa.

3674
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:08,240
Just take malaria medications.

3675
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:10,730
The dreams are awesome.
No,

3676
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:11,280
no,
no.

3677
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:13,350
So clear.
But it's not just that malaria

3678
02:49:13,351 --> 02:49:14,850
medication doesn't work against the
Zika.

3679
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:16,650
They don't have Zika medication.
You Fuck?

3680
02:49:16,840 --> 02:49:18,150
Well those people.
Bad Advice.

3681
02:49:18,420 --> 02:49:20,790
What about Ebola?
Again?

3682
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:24,590
Malaria medication.
You can dream that you have,

3683
02:49:25,050 --> 02:49:27,960
you taken the dreams are so vivid.
You believe you're actually don't have

3684
02:49:27,961 --> 02:49:29,040
it.
And then the placebo effect.

3685
02:49:30,490 --> 02:49:34,400
When I was,
when I was in the Africa with my,

3686
02:49:34,401 --> 02:49:37,960
uh,
you can't say like that when I was in my

3687
02:49:37,970 --> 02:49:39,450
privilege.
The Africa,

3688
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:44,300
Africa in Africa.
Like I said,

3689
02:49:44,301 --> 02:49:45,830
the malaria medication gives you a
little,

3690
02:49:45,831 --> 02:49:48,710
uh,
upset sometimes or you shit yourself.

3691
02:49:48,890 --> 02:49:51,140
So when we were stopping through one of
those little towns where I said I was

3692
02:49:51,141 --> 02:49:54,770
all paranoid and uh,
I went to go use a restroom.

3693
02:49:55,070 --> 02:50:00,070
Was it a hole in the ground now?
Almost a pretty much you kind of like a

3694
02:50:00,561 --> 02:50:04,700
Porta potty kind of thing.
But as you go running in this a little

3695
02:50:04,701 --> 02:50:06,080
boy,
this little boy,

3696
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:09,140
probably around eight went,
hey look,

3697
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:14,360
white tea man.
That didn't help with my paranoia that

3698
02:50:16,570 --> 02:50:19,530
hey,
white tea man should be the cover.

3699
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:21,960
The title of your new special.
Hey,

3700
02:50:21,961 --> 02:50:25,180
look white.
They look like that.

3701
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:26,680
It is pretty good.
I like,

3702
02:50:26,690 --> 02:50:30,840
that's catching me in a suit.
You would like Colonel Sanders type

3703
02:50:30,910 --> 02:50:35,220
Sudhana
white tea man to man.

3704
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:37,920
See,
you can't really offend people by

3705
02:50:37,921 --> 02:50:40,840
calling them yet though.
I know why he doesn't bother me at a

3706
02:50:40,841 --> 02:50:43,800
cracker that none of that bothers me.
Not at all.

3707
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:46,230
Anything that calls out my whiteness is
like,

3708
02:50:46,410 --> 02:50:47,041
Yo,
sorry.

3709
02:50:47,041 --> 02:50:52,041
I'm awesome.
Why are you pointing out my advantages?

3710
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:59,070
Why should one older kid said,
look at these motherfuckers.

3711
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:00,030
Whoa.
Yeah.

3712
02:51:00,030 --> 02:51:01,580
Yelled that on her way into town.
Winter.

3713
02:51:01,581 --> 02:51:03,560
We're in our little open safari via
really.

3714
02:51:03,930 --> 02:51:06,780
Was he saying that like in a mad way or
laughing?

3715
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:07,980
Oh,
like a mad way.

3716
02:51:08,010 --> 02:51:09,360
Like what?
What do you drive?

3717
02:51:09,390 --> 02:51:11,100
What are you looking at?
Oh,

3718
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:12,870
what are you looking at it?
I didn't feel comfortable.

3719
02:51:12,871 --> 02:51:14,940
Huh?
Now just keep driving.

3720
02:51:14,941 --> 02:51:17,490
Keep driving by people.
Just keep driving through this area

3721
02:51:17,491 --> 02:51:18,920
where people go and look at this mother
fucker.

3722
02:51:18,930 --> 02:51:21,120
Yeah.
With the name of the resort of the

3723
02:51:21,121 --> 02:51:22,290
place.
You're staying on the side.

3724
02:51:22,291 --> 02:51:24,330
They know that you know.
You got some money there.

3725
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:25,150
Fencing.
Yeah.

3726
02:51:25,150 --> 02:51:27,210
Some money.
People coming from another country.

3727
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:29,670
Fancy man.
Motherfucker.

3728
02:51:29,970 --> 02:51:31,920
Woo.
Yeah.

3729
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:34,410
Did you close your kid's ears?
Cover their ears.

3730
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:36,330
I just went up.
That was nice.

3731
02:51:37,140 --> 02:51:38,280
Yeah.
That guy.

3732
02:51:38,970 --> 02:51:42,510
Yeah.
Like if I went to Tanzania and I would

3733
02:51:42,511 --> 02:51:44,200
like to go,
um,

3734
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:46,770
I would want to think about how much
time to spend there.

3735
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:48,780
How much time did you spend there?
Ten days.

3736
02:51:49,230 --> 02:51:51,300
That seems like a right number.
It was perfect

3737
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:53,890
because your,
it's,

3738
02:51:54,170 --> 02:51:56,240
it's a big,
it's far.

3739
02:51:56,660 --> 02:51:58,540
Twenty four hours of travel.
And

3740
02:51:58,550 --> 02:51:59,640
what do you,
what do you fly into?

3741
02:51:59,660 --> 02:52:01,920
Do you find the Holland or did you go to
Amsterdam?

3742
02:52:02,130 --> 02:52:06,100
Dubai is another one.
Went to Amsterdam and I left from New

3743
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:06,250
York

3744
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:11,250
from here it's like a 11 hour flight and
then you switch and then it's another

3745
02:52:12,220 --> 02:52:16,720
eight to nine hours to Kilimanjaro.
Then you've got to get a puddle jumper

3746
02:52:16,721 --> 02:52:19,420
and get into the Serengeti,
get into grammatically.

3747
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:21,520
So did you,
um,

3748
02:52:21,521 --> 02:52:24,940
did you stay in Holland for now?
I just went.

3749
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,640
Wow.
I've done trips where you stopped and

3750
02:52:27,641 --> 02:52:29,080
like,
well just for a day,

3751
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:30,910
just get it over with,
just go,

3752
02:52:30,970 --> 02:52:33,040
just push it and get there.
We did.

3753
02:52:33,070 --> 02:52:35,550
I did them this weekend or this weekend
to summer.

3754
02:52:35,580 --> 02:52:36,670
Other.
It's the best.

3755
02:52:36,790 --> 02:52:39,430
We did Rome first and then we went to
the mafia coast.

3756
02:52:39,490 --> 02:52:41,380
Now he did both of those.
I've never been there.

3757
02:52:41,510 --> 02:52:43,150
I was in a room.
We were thinking about just staying in

3758
02:52:43,151 --> 02:52:45,250
one place,
but we fucking mix it up.

3759
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:48,040
It was the right move was a great.
Great.

3760
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:50,140
Both of them were awesome in different
ways.

3761
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:51,880
Yeah.
Amalfi coast is awesome because you

3762
02:52:51,881 --> 02:52:53,130
can't even believe it's real.
So yeah,

3763
02:52:53,150 --> 02:52:56,470
so pretty and so nice.
It doesn't even seem real or just and

3764
02:52:56,471 --> 02:53:00,670
then Rome is just the artwork and the
Vatican alone is worth the trip.

3765
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:04,000
It's amazing.
What I love about Rome too is that it's

3766
02:53:04,001 --> 02:53:08,440
still have a vibrant city.
It's so old and so much change in

3767
02:53:08,441 --> 02:53:11,230
history,
but it's a young hip city.

3768
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:14,890
People are working hard and doing stuff
where like you go to Florence and places

3769
02:53:14,891 --> 02:53:16,330
like that.
It's like it's beautiful,

3770
02:53:16,331 --> 02:53:19,540
but it's kind of like a museum.
Young people aren't going to make it

3771
02:53:19,960 --> 02:53:21,030
right there.
Yeah,

3772
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:24,760
they are in room.
Another thing that I felt was crazy was

3773
02:53:24,761 --> 02:53:28,240
that the Vatican is its own country with
its own rules.

3774
02:53:28,241 --> 02:53:31,780
That's why the pope's all stay there
after they leave because otherwise they

3775
02:53:31,781 --> 02:53:33,220
can't.
Like Pope Benedict,

3776
02:53:33,250 --> 02:53:37,000
they wanted to try him for crimes
against humanity and he's being shielded

3777
02:53:37,001 --> 02:53:37,870
by the Vatican.

3778
02:53:38,110 --> 02:53:40,210
This company,
there's countries rather that are

3779
02:53:40,570 --> 02:53:45,430
actively trying to extract him like
they're trying with legal action to get

3780
02:53:45,431 --> 02:53:47,890
him out of the Vatican.
Try Him.

3781
02:53:48,210 --> 02:53:52,060
Because the last pope was a really bad
guy.

3782
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:55,710
I know you know the whole shielding
child molesters.

3783
02:53:55,711 --> 02:53:58,810
I went onto rape deaf kids.
He was a big part of all that.

3784
02:53:58,840 --> 02:54:03,190
He was one of those cheap,
not just allegedly one of the key guys

3785
02:54:03,550 --> 02:54:06,790
when it came to relocating child
molesters where they would.

3786
02:54:07,150 --> 02:54:08,920
Yeah.
He was the new kid and a lot of the

3787
02:54:08,921 --> 02:54:09,760
people around.
Right?

3788
02:54:09,970 --> 02:54:12,220
Yeah.
Is there ever been an organization

3789
02:54:12,221 --> 02:54:15,550
that's fucked as many kids as the
Catholic Church didn't?

3790
02:54:15,610 --> 02:54:19,720
Wasn't there a party that kind of felt
at the Vatican like this is obscene?

3791
02:54:19,810 --> 02:54:20,800
Yes,
yes.

3792
02:54:20,890 --> 02:54:21,441
Yeah.
Well,

3793
02:54:21,441 --> 02:54:22,270
it's,
it's,

3794
02:54:22,270 --> 02:54:27,010
it's human.
It's human creativity and human ambition

3795
02:54:27,370 --> 02:54:31,750
and human.
This overwhelming desire to create

3796
02:54:31,751 --> 02:54:35,890
someone something magnificent.
Some these massive fucking temples,

3797
02:54:36,340 --> 02:54:38,770
these enormous cathedrals.
You know,

3798
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:41,380
like St Peter's Basilica,
you wander around,

3799
02:54:41,381 --> 02:54:45,340
they like this took how long have years
to make hundreds.

3800
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:47,200
It's amazing.
Amazing.

3801
02:54:47,201 --> 02:54:52,201
But it's also that same psychotic
behavior that make someone create

3802
02:54:52,331 --> 02:54:57,331
something like that is also responsible
for all these bizarre behavior traits

3803
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:01,810
that suppressive people that are in
those sort of situations.

3804
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:04,070
Press people and what's the difference
between

3805
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:06,690
the people that are creating it and the
people that are paying for it to be

3806
02:55:07,220 --> 02:55:11,090
those people that were just went in and
took countries over and slaughtered

3807
02:55:11,091 --> 02:55:12,860
people.
It's very similar to what we were

3808
02:55:12,861 --> 02:55:15,650
talking about with the native Americans.
It was so weird there time

3809
02:55:15,750 --> 02:55:17,850
that no,
that shit's even in the Bible that you

3810
02:55:17,851 --> 02:55:20,700
have to have a pope right this day.
I'll make that up.

3811
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:23,520
That's a completely made up thing by
human beings.

3812
02:55:23,600 --> 02:55:26,840
That's the hardest part.
When you go to Rome and you start trade,

3813
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:30,170
there was a place is great.
I forget the name of it,

3814
02:55:30,171 --> 02:55:34,100
but it has a church and active church
and then you can site so you can go

3815
02:55:34,101 --> 02:55:37,640
below.
That is a really old church that you

3816
02:55:37,641 --> 02:55:38,900
know,
just things you know in Rome,

3817
02:55:38,930 --> 02:55:40,760
things just set on.
They just build on top,

3818
02:55:41,150 --> 02:55:45,770
so it's this active church than
underneath a really old church and below

3819
02:55:45,771 --> 02:55:50,771
that way in the way underground is this
Pagan Temple and they weren't worshiping

3820
02:55:52,761 --> 02:55:55,610
Jesus.
They were worshiping these strange pagan

3821
02:55:55,611 --> 02:56:00,611
gods and you just see this was just man
interpreting this feeling and using it

3822
02:56:01,641 --> 02:56:05,030
for their advantage,
whatever at a pagan level to this level

3823
02:56:05,031 --> 02:56:08,480
to today it's the same.
And the thing about Rome is like if you

3824
02:56:08,481 --> 02:56:13,190
go in there wanting to hold onto your
Christian beliefs or any of that stuff

3825
02:56:13,191 --> 02:56:16,430
and you look at the history like
literally right there in the landscape

3826
02:56:16,431 --> 02:56:20,750
that this has just come from us trying
to figure stuff out as there's no one

3827
02:56:20,751 --> 02:56:21,600
truth.
Yeah.

3828
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:24,980
It breaks all that down.
I don't know how you can withstand it

3829
02:56:24,981 --> 02:56:26,540
without just pure faith.

3830
02:56:26,690 --> 02:56:28,400
They just put blinders on.
Yeah.

3831
02:56:28,590 --> 02:56:32,600
That mean it's the enemy that faith is
without a doubt the enemy of objective

3832
02:56:32,601 --> 02:56:35,270
thinking.
It really have to have faith in order to

3833
02:56:35,271 --> 02:56:38,180
buy into a lot of these stories and once
you have faith,

3834
02:56:38,181 --> 02:56:39,950
you just like,
I'm on the team no matter what.

3835
02:56:40,610 --> 02:56:43,490
No matter what Hillary did,
I am on the team.

3836
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:46,220
It's the same thing.
You being a loyal Democrat,

3837
02:56:46,221 --> 02:56:49,400
being a loyal Republican,
being a fucking loyal Mac user,

3838
02:56:49,640 --> 02:56:52,550
being a religious nut,
it's a lot of it is the same thing.

3839
02:56:52,551 --> 02:56:57,551
It's like this desire to just settled on
this.

3840
02:56:57,861 --> 02:56:59,750
I identify with this.
I'm locked in.

3841
02:56:59,940 --> 02:57:01,860
It's comforting.
You feel like you belong.

3842
02:57:01,910 --> 02:57:04,500
If this is a right way,
I don't have to think about this stuff.

3843
02:57:04,501 --> 02:57:06,330
They're going to do that part of the
thinking.

3844
02:57:06,650 --> 02:57:09,680
That's why that pussy,
the football player should have just

3845
02:57:09,681 --> 02:57:12,860
stood up.
Put your hand over your heart,

3846
02:57:12,861 --> 02:57:16,100
Pussy.
I don't want to hear all this black

3847
02:57:16,101 --> 02:57:20,840
lives matter bullshit about equality and
put your hand over your hair,

3848
02:57:21,020 --> 02:57:21,950
your heart,
whatever it is.

3849
02:57:21,951 --> 02:57:25,010
Your heart.
You're going to be a quarterback.

3850
02:57:25,011 --> 02:57:26,990
You act like quarterback.
Listen to this American.

3851
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:29,480
You want to.
You want to play soccer?

3852
02:57:29,980 --> 02:57:31,340
We won't.
Do you want to play cricket?

3853
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:36,200
Like how about you go play cricket.
You get yourself some freedom,

3854
02:57:36,201 --> 02:57:38,270
fries and shit,
Bro.

3855
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:40,310
I gotta get in this fucking thing.
I gotta to get out of here.

3856
02:57:40,490 --> 02:57:41,323
Tom,
Papa.

3857
02:57:41,450 --> 02:57:43,220
I always enjoy talking with you,
my friend.

3858
02:57:43,300 --> 02:57:46,300
I love coming by man.
I have to say when I was out there on

3859
02:57:46,301 --> 02:57:47,460
Safari,
you know,

3860
02:57:47,530 --> 02:57:51,130
cruising around for all this time,
I thought about you often.

3861
02:57:51,160 --> 02:57:53,980
I was like,
he would love to see.

3862
02:57:54,010 --> 02:57:56,410
I mean just animals,
eating animals anytime.

3863
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:59,800
Something like extreme it was like.
And it's controlled and your family

3864
02:57:59,801 --> 02:58:01,500
would be safe.
I can't recommend enough.

3865
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:04,890
They're too young right now,
but a couple of taking medication,

3866
02:58:04,891 --> 02:58:06,810
but I think the older I think I'm going
to definitely do it.

3867
02:58:06,980 --> 02:58:09,510
It seems like it seems like something
that should be done,

3868
02:58:09,870 --> 02:58:11,880
like I said,
of the Vatican was something that after

3869
02:58:11,881 --> 02:58:13,710
I did it,
it took a long time to get there and all

3870
02:58:13,711 --> 02:58:14,520
that jazz,
but I was like,

3871
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:16,320
I'm so glad I did it.
I needed to see that.

3872
02:58:16,380 --> 02:58:18,090
When you get home,
did you bring your family?

3873
02:58:18,450 --> 02:58:20,340
When you get home?
Don't you feel like,

3874
02:58:20,700 --> 02:58:22,080
yeah,
I did that.

3875
02:58:22,110 --> 02:58:24,900
I got those kids there.
That was the same thing with Africa.

3876
02:58:24,930 --> 02:58:28,080
It was one of those felt like for them,
they had a lot of questions too,

3877
02:58:28,081 --> 02:58:30,730
so it was really cool.
Like looking at all this art and means

3878
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:34,950
you're going one insane room filled with
sculptures to another insane room filled

3879
02:58:34,951 --> 02:58:38,820
with other things and still the hallway.
It's filled with incredible ancient

3880
02:58:38,821 --> 02:58:40,470
maps.
There's so much going on.

3881
02:58:40,770 --> 02:58:42,360
Amazing.
It's really amazing.

3882
02:58:42,390 --> 02:58:44,480
Then you get home.
You light a big fat cigar here.

3883
02:58:44,580 --> 02:58:47,600
That's right.
I did that a pretend a month car vishing

3884
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:50,730
pose.
So then when I am one day I'll get it

3885
02:58:50,731 --> 02:58:51,564
right.
I'd be like,

3886
02:58:52,850 --> 02:58:53,820
goodnight everybody.
See Tomorrow,

3887
02:58:53,821 --> 02:58:55,560
Donald Cowboy cerrone will be here
tomorrow.

3888
02:58:55,561 --> 02:58:58,230
Tom Papa on twitter.
Go watch him.

3889
02:58:58,231 --> 02:58:59,660
He's fucking hilarious.
He assumed.
