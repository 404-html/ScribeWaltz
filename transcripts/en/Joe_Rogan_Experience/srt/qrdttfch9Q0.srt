1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,920
Three,
two,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,650
one,
yes.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,810
It feels like you would just hear what 
people don't know.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,790
Most people don't know because it hasn't
come out yet.

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:12,720
No one would.
How would they?

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,603
We've bid a podcast late last night and 
it got completely out of hand so that I 

7
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,680
don't even know what to do with that 
thing now.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,910
What's that thing out like a gentleman?
I mean,

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,330
I'm certainly putting it out on 
pretending,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,240
putting out.
So long story short for listeners,

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,890
uh,
Joe was kind enough to.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,610
I was interviewing Sam Harris for my 
podcast and Sam was like,

13
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:36,444
we really should just do more than just 
a one on one because ordinarily my 

14
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:41,640
podcast is about as a panel of people,
a bunch of people sitting around talking

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,670
about the news and so I texted Joe and I
was like,

16
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:46,740
is there any chance of doing it at your 
studio?

17
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,360
And being the gentleman that he is,
he was like,

18
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,980
sure,
just come on by and we'll just type it.

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,520
Even though he had two shows yesterday.
So after those shows,

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,383
late at night,
Sam Harris comes over and Hannibal 

21
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:02,661
buress is still here.
It was about to call an uber and I said,

22
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,620
why don't you stick around?
Yeah,

23
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,200
hang on.
We were drunk based the way we drink,

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,930
so much whiskey,
best decision you ever made,

25
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:10,764
inviting him to stay,
so Hannibal buress and Sam Harris and 

26
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,294
Joe Rogan and I have an interesting 
episode of my podcast which will come 

27
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,834
up,
so if you're listening to this now or 

28
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:23,010
watching this now subscribed to way the 
people live.

29
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,844
Just switch for whether people space 
life you need the live and then when it 

30
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:27,690
drops you will.
You will see it.

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,583
It was an dining epic.
Our long argument between Hannibal 

32
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,343
Burress,
a drunk Hannibal burress and Sam Harris 

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,760
regarding statistics.
We'll just leave it at that.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,633
Yeah.
You don't want to give him more 

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,470
statistics that may or may not involve 
black lives matter.

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,623
I'm shooting police shootings and just 
the reality of police violence versus 

37
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:52,560
the perceived reality of police 
violence.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,423
So arguing about the statistics rather 
than the emotional connection and the 

39
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,044
difference and what was interesting is 
how we have conversations about things 

40
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,350
that are so touchy.
Right.

41
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,310
I've been,
part of the reason why I want to talk to

42
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,650
Sam and you on my podcast is because I 
think it's important for us to find ways

43
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:11,010
to have the sorts of conversations that 
you have in that Sam has and hopefully I

44
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:15,780
have where there's not a lot of kind of 
opinionated bloviating.

45
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:17,700
It's more about actually trying to 
understand each other,

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,830
but actually trying to take each other 
at face value,

47
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,910
not sticking,
you know,

48
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,950
a what a sword in the sand and saying 
like,

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,850
I can't believe that you offended me or 
you know,

50
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,684
having tripwires that if someone 
transgresses that'll says a certain 

51
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:30,654
thing,
then all of a sudden you're going to 

52
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,050
crank up the outrage machine.
So much of that,

53
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,810
so much of that.
So I wanted to talk to Sam and you about

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,673
what,
how do we have conversations that are 

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,260
the more reasonable,
but of course you don't necessarily have

56
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,094
a conversation that's that reasonable 
when you're drunk and emotionally 

57
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:48,900
sensitive.
Drunk.

58
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:53,130
Hannibal burress says that he's smarter 
than Sam Harris and smarter than I think

59
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,330
anyone.
Didn't he say anyone?

60
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,253
Uh,
he definitely said he was smarter than 

61
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,630
Sam Harris.
Hannibal's a smart guy,

62
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:00,550
he must be successful and he's a 
compelling

63
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,463
and good comic.
Just not smart enough to know that he 

64
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:07,690
shouldn't say smart Sam Harris.
It was drunk,

65
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,670
really drunk and we kept drinking to 
view.

66
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,550
Hit it.
Well,

67
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,810
you hold your liquor.
Well,

68
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,150
I bounced back quick.
I'm healthy.

69
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,280
So I stopped drinking.
Also.

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,933
Loyalty.
So what you're implying exactly what I 

71
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,950
said.
You heard me and uh,

72
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,830
about an hour before the end of our pod,
you have me in Hannibal,

73
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,630
I realized I was drunk,
so I backed off.

74
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,160
Right.
And he going,

75
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,660
he was preparing himself out like half a
half a wine glass of whiskey.

76
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,680
Yup,
Yup.

77
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,850
Yeah,
it was deep.

78
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,620
We went deep.
So,

79
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,690
uh,
he can't be held responsible folks.

80
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,360
Everyone was helping,
right?

81
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,370
Because if you drive drunk and kill 
somebody,

82
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:49,390
then you're not held responsible for 
that.

83
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,740
Um,
if you're a woman,

84
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,963
you can have sex with someone.
You're not responsible though the man's 

85
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,180
responsible.
That's right,

86
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,990
that's true.

87
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,823
So it was more of a woman having sex 
with a drunk driver hitting that high 

88
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,240
bar,
more of a woman.

89
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,080
And I bet I'll tell him you said that he
was a guest in my studio.

90
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:05,800
So,
uh,

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,980
I'm responsible.
He didn't,

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,530
he could not consent conversation you 
with the chaperone.

93
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,883
He was too drunk to consent.
I was the rapist raped him with our 

94
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,334
conversation by forcing him into this 
conversation that I didn't know he was 

95
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,790
going to get into.
Right.

96
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,010
You sort of annually fisted him with 
Woodward.

97
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,440
Now you go into a little of my own taste
you said.

98
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,600
Right.
What about this whole,

99
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,410
right?
Have you been,

100
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,360
have you been talking with thinking 
about the whole,

101
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,220
like Amy Schumer cut and myths good.
You know,

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,050
and like,
and I saw what he said and you know,

103
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:39,370
I had someone else contact me about that
guy and whether or not,

104
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,263
you know,
he was telling the truth or the woman 

105
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,850
was telling the truth.

106
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,683
I don't know him.
I don't know her and I'm not getting 

107
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:49,300
involved because I don't know if I knew 
her and I could implicitly trust her.

108
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:52,390
And I knew that she was going to tell 
the truth and it's not,

109
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,553
it's not,
uh,

110
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,453
I,
I just don't understand the motivation 

111
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:57,640
behind someone jumping in with an 
opinion.

112
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,370
I think what he's saying though is 
interesting because what Kurt was saying

113
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:03,780
was that it is entirely possible he was 
satire,

114
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,653
obviously.
But you're saying women cannot lie 

115
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,910
there.
Like my Bible.

116
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,370
It's impossible for a woman to lodge,
just like the Lord's word.

117
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,601
That's it.
You know,

118
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,580
he's being funny.
He's hilarious.

119
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,600
Shitster.
Yeah,

120
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,890
he's hilarious.
But,

121
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,650
um,
it's a,

122
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,140
it's weird,
you know,

123
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:23,110
like that there's this culture,
what we know for a fact that some people

124
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:27,460
lie about every single aspect of life.
They lie about what they did.

125
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,250
They lie about their taxes,
they lie about everything.

126
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,310
But we're supposed to assume that women 
never lie about rape.

127
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,830
And it's not true.
We know it's not true,

128
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,840
but we're not allowed to say it's not 
true.

129
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,030
Even though we know it,
we're not allowed to bring it up.

130
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,470
But.
So if there's a possibility,

131
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,304
if a woman says that she's raped,
you have to accept that 100 percent at 

132
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:47,050
face value.
Even if the man is saying he didn't rape

133
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,990
her,
it's really hard because that's one side

134
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:50,824
of the ledger and um,
and then on the other side of the 

135
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:52,894
ledger,
you've got all of the overwhelming 

136
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,530
number of cases where men get away with 
it.

137
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,430
Yes.
Because women are too afraid

138
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,263
to go to the police or they feel like 
they feel like they're dirty or that 

139
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,474
somehow for whatever reason,
just not talk about it and let it go 

140
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,064
away.
So I think that I think that women's 

141
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,460
rights people and feminists think like 
if,

142
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,260
if it's occasionally the case that a man
is wrongly accused,

143
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:13,094
that's a small price to pay for 
fostering a climate in which women feel 

144
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:19,280
more,
feel less nervous about coming forward.

145
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:22,610
Now I'm not saying that I believe that,
but wow,

146
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,444
what a shitstorm Kurt has.
So I'm not sure if everyone knows the 

147
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,770
background of this,
that there was a.

148
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,633
One of the comics that UCB theater in 
New York was accused of being a repeat 

149
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,864
sexual offender by a bunch of women.
So say suspended him as a comic and 

150
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,793
excuse me,
and conducted its own internal 

151
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,780
investigation.
And Kurt went on a big facebook rants.

152
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,000
I was looking at it this morning 
actually saying,

153
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,470
I'm basically like,
why is this internal?

154
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,210
You know,
what is this like the Catholic church,

155
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,560
the UCB theater,
like doing the internal investigation.

156
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,640
Why didn't these women go to go to the 
police?

157
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,160
He writes a.
This is his original facebook post.

158
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,200
Guys.
I've just heard some disturbing news.

159
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:07,280
This Guy Jeff Delfi Berg is a rapist.
I know because women said it,

160
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,890
and that's all I need.
Never you mind who they are.

161
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,980
They're all women.
All women are as reliable as my Bible.

162
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,800
A book that much like a woman is 
incapable of lying.

163
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,090
So what you were saying,
you think I would dare ask my God,

164
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:20,924
Lord Jesus Christ.
Then Nazareen to provide any details or 

165
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,620
evidence of any kind before I believe in
him or a woman.

166
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,720
No,
because that would be like hammering the

167
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:33,200
nails into Jesus my Lord's feet or 
rewriting the victims.

168
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,230
Good whole asking for proof in a murder 
trial and he goes on like that.

169
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,030
I made.
It's really funny.

170
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,270
If that guy's innocent,
if that guy's guilty,

171
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,620
then it becomes really disturbing.
Kind of become a name and an enabler.

172
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,483
Problem is.
There's no way Kurt can know exactly 

173
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,490
exactly,
but I do.

174
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,750
I think it raises interesting questions 
about the whole kind of the,

175
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,213
the censorious and like the hysteria of 
the Social Justice Warrior Brigade in 

176
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,450
that there are people who really fucking
want him to get fired and never,

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,290
you know,
if amy's show comes back,

178
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,790
they don't want him back.
As a writer,

179
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,743
I'm sure that there are a comedy clubs,
so they're going to rethink whether or 

180
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:15,110
not they want to book him because he 
might be too toxic and I doubt that.

181
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,500
Maybe,
maybe not.

182
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,050
It's not that big of a deal because what
he said was not that big of a deal,

183
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,880
but the issue and everyone went crazy.

184
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,030
She went crazy.
She posted the amy did.

185
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:27,330
She posted this thing,
you know,

186
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,183
saying that she's very disappointed and 
that was in response to an endless 

187
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,874
barrage of social justice people in 
feminist saying that this is completely 

188
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,130
unacceptable and he deserves to be fired
for it.

189
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,740
He has a job.
He showed some pretty incredible loyalty

190
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,290
to her during that whole plagiarism 
scandal,

191
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,333
especially when he was one of the ones 
who told her to not do one of those 

192
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:49,250
jokes because it was a windy liebman 
joke,

193
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,623
so he kept his mud about all that and 
then she turned on him with this whole 

194
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:56,160
thing.
The whole thing is very sorted

195
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,023
and I see.
I see her point of view and I see his 

196
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,550
point of view.
I really do.

197
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,413
I think she didn't.
I think she felt she didn't have an 

198
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,274
option,
but because she did say I could see my 

199
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,810
friend and knowing him,
I'm disappointed in him.

200
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,180
Yeah,
it's toxic.

201
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,800
I mean there's no way that you can talk 
about.

202
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,420
You can't raise the question that you 
just raised.

203
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,450
Unless you're on the Joe Rogan 
experience.

204
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,270
You cannot raise the question of whether
or not it's appropriate,

205
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,460
whether they should be in a presumption 
of innocence.

206
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,323
That's why podcasts are so God damn 
important as you could never do this on 

207
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,204
a regular show.
Certainly couldn't do the shit we went 

208
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:27,600
on last night on a regular show off the 
air.

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,200
Yeah.
Wait till it comes out,

210
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,570
Woo.
Um,

211
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,220
you know,
here's the PR again.

212
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,720
Here's the problem.
If that guy is innocent,

213
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,780
then Kurt is doing a service because he 
is expressing this very real possibility

214
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,360
that someone might be lying.
If that guy's guilty,

215
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,583
then it's not funny at all and it 
becomes really fucking gross for the 

216
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:49,274
girl if she has to sit back and listen 
to someone mock whether or not she's 

217
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,330
telling the truth when she knows she 
did.

218
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,720
That has got to be a horrible feeling.
So the question is,

219
00:09:58,821 --> 00:09:59,654
what is worse?
Is it worse to get falsely accused of 

220
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,534
rape or is it worse to get raped when 
someone doesn't believe you and get 

221
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:06,434
accused of being a liar?
It's obviously worse to get raped and 

222
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,120
being accused of alive,
but by how much,

223
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,210
I mean if you grading on a scale like 
getting getting,

224
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,373
I mean let's just,
let's just assume it's at least a bit 

225
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:22,190
worse on that side

226
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,063
because you use the physical right is 
worse than being falsely accused but 

227
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,573
surely

228
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,243
in having your career destroyed and 
dragged through the mud and forever 

229
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:31,844
labeled a rapist,
which is entirely possible for someone 

230
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,090
is innocent.
It happened to a friend of mine,

231
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,700
a friend of mine got accused falsely of 
rape.

232
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,490
This girl that he was dating,
he broke up with her.

233
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:43,190
They broke up and she just decided that 
she was going to get back at him,

234
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:44,024
so she said that he was a rapist and she
followed through with it for awhile and 

235
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:46,904
then eventually abandoned it.
But that does happen and it's happened 

236
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:51,194
many,
many times and there's a bunch of 

237
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:52,724
statistics you can look up online,
but they're not entirely accurate 

238
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,980
because they don't take into account how
many women leave.

239
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,360
You look into like overall rapes and 
overall people who lie it,

240
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,370
rape the overall rape statistics are not
accurate because they do not know nor do

241
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:07,484
they take into account or can they 
possibly take into account how many 

242
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,410
women don't say anything.
It's a big number.

243
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,280
And also like what constitutes a rape 
exam.

244
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,183
Like when you say that with some men 
have falsely accused is not always as 

245
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,690
black and white as you know,
they,

246
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,623
they were dating and they never even had
sex at all but she suddenly accuses him 

247
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:24,561
of.
Right.

248
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:25,394
But there are also scenarios where as 
you said before she was drunk or like 

249
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,744
she didn't know that he thought there 
was consent and there wasn't consent or 

250
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:33,110
that,
you know,

251
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,280
I mean,
or maybe they were,

252
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,300
you know,
so it's,

253
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,223
it's,
it's a vague area and I think Kurt's 

254
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,433
point which is like,
I don't think that we should be having 

255
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:45,800
to choose between the two options that 
you just cited,

256
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:49,310
which is on the one hand a woman gets 
raped and is not believed.

257
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,220
And on the other hand,
a man is falsely accused of rape.

258
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,670
Well,
I think what Kurt is trying to do,

259
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
just in a clumsy,
smart ass,

260
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:01,501
he a flame throwing way is say,
can it be true that rape is really,

261
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,094
really terrible and we also should,
should offer men the benefit of the 

262
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,294
doubt and encourage rape victims to go 
to the police rather than to internal 

263
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,660
investigations at places like Uc Bay.

264
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,950
His point is like he thinks he's on the 
side of the rape victims,

265
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,563
right?
By saying like they've been sold a dumb 

266
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,550
bill of goods by feminists by saying,
oh your such poor,

267
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,384
pathetic victims that you can't go to 
the police and it will never be taken 

268
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,260
care of by going to the police.
So you should just be mollycoddled and,

269
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,500
and you should either remain silent or,
or you know,

270
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:37,501
just to have it sorted out internally.
Think he's saying when he says,

271
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:41,680
he says so he,
this is his followup facebook post which

272
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:42,514
you posted last Wednesday where he 
begins by saying I'm my punishment the 

273
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:49,144
mob is howling for is now officially 
more severe than the one for the actual 

274
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:54,010
ripest.
Which is interesting.

275
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,323
But towards the end he says,
I didn't yell at victims to go to the 

276
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,230
police.
They are victims.

277
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,900
I'm yelling at the people who said women
can't go to the police.

278
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:05,530
They have to work outside the system.
I think that's out of bullshit and leads

279
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,980
to rapists walking free.
It hurts the victims of sexual assault.

280
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,073
Okay.
He's saying that because this woman 

281
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,160
never went to the police.
That's just publicly accused of rape.

282
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,460
That's right.
Isn't there more than one woman as well?

283
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,100
I believe so.
I believe there's a second one.

284
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,600
Who's friends with that girl?
Right?

285
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,200
Who also says the same store.
So he ain't good.

286
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,870
He claims to be on the side of the 
victims.

287
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,723
I mean,
I think he just doesn't quite get how 

288
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,703
traumatic it can be for people who've 
been for women who've been sexually 

289
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,340
assaulted.
He gets raped every day.

290
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:35,174
You don't even know.

291
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,840
You don't know.
He gets raped every day,

292
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,520
just so you can understand.
It gets raped every day.

293
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:41,290
He loves it.
Not Funny.

294
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,820
Rape is never funny.

295
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,943
Um,
he,

296
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,190
he said,
why?

297
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,053
He says,
why did the story of what actually 

298
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:47,674
happened?
What happened to come out after the guy 

299
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:52,120
is declared a ripest?
I'll listen to any victim's account.

300
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,400
All that was given initially is Aaron's 
right best pass it on.

301
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,780
My point was that no one seems disturbed
by this.

302
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:01,390
No one sees that down the road.
Next time we might get it wrong.

303
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,270
Well we might have it wrong here.
We don't know,

304
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,350
but it's not good when a second person 
calls you out for the same crime.

305
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,184
That's right,
but it's also not good that no one went 

306
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:14,950
to the cops and maybe also what kind of 
evidence do you have?

307
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,110
Somebody raped you a month ago,
guess what?

308
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:18,070
You have no evidence.
No,

309
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,810
exactly.
As you've showered up and you don't have

310
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,400
any bruises.
Like what can you say?

311
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:22,740
It's your word against them.
Yeah,

312
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,973
and you know,
I think for some women and it's also 

313
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:29,890
like what exactly was the scenario that 
we're talking about?

314
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,783
Was it a simple social justice warrior 
type thing where two people are drunk 

315
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:36,310
and then the woman didn't consent,
so they're calling that rape,

316
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:40,750
which is repeated ad nauseum and it got 
kicked out at Occidental.

317
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:42,880
College is a lawsuit going on right now 
because of that.

318
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm sure you know that story where a man
and a woman,

319
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:46,900
the girl was saying,
coming over,

320
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,330
do you have condoms?
They have sex,

321
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,610
and then her friends convinced her that 
because she was drunk,

322
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:53,444
it was rape even though they were both 
drunk and then the college kicks him 

323
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,390
out,
keeps her and so he's suing the college.

324
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,790
It's a fucking giant disaster is total 
sexism.

325
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,653
One hundred percent sexism against the 
man and when you look at the story and 

326
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,274
what it is,
it's a goddamn witch hunt and they gave 

327
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,314
into the witch hunt.
They just wanted to quiet it down and 

328
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,534
they figured it would be easier to kick 
this kid out and and just given to the 

329
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,760
wills of the mom

330
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,770
and then on the other hand you've got 
that,

331
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:19,604
like the the California College swimmer 
kid who who raped a girl behind the 

332
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,720
dumpster on campus.
You've never heard about that.

333
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,603
She was passed out and he was like 
fingering her and she ended like pine 

334
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:34,550
cone cuts all over her vagina and 
everything was really horrible story and

335
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,200
she ended up getting,
what,

336
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,960
six months basically nothing,
and now he's out.

337
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,200
Now he's out again and um,
and

338
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,430
that's,
that's,

339
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,230
that's a fucking terrible person and 
that guy should be

340
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,930
punished.
And the judge was,

341
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:49,600
the judge was an alum of the same 
college and so and so.

342
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,830
He's like,
it's an all boys school.

343
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:51,341
He's like,
oh,

344
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,060
well boys will be boys.
And the,

345
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,420
and the apology that this rice,
the ripest little asshole road was like,

346
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,533
I think this serves as a good lesson 
about intoxication and the dangers of 

347
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,480
inebriation on campus.
Like,

348
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:05,260
fuck you,
it doesn't,

349
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,550
that's not the lesson.
The lesson is done,

350
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:07,384
right.
Paypal,

351
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,810
when she's in colons and someone's 
vagina piece of shit.

352
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,141
Well,
I mean,

353
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:14,050
when she was ending,
it was bad enough to people who say,

354
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,750
well maybe he thought that she was 
consenting.

355
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,210
It was obvious enough that to other 
students,

356
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,700
they were foreign students.
They were Swedish guys were riding by on

357
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:24,850
bicycles and they saw what was going on 
and it was obvious from afar,

358
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,713
even in the dark what was happening 
because they stopped and came over and 

359
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:29,220
rescued her.
She was limp as a,

360
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,423
as a ragdoll.

361
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,150
Yeah.
So there's that.

362
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,100
That's real rape and that's,
that's terrifying when a woman does get,

363
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,373
you know,
exposed as being someone who's 

364
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,600
experienced rape.
So the,

365
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,453
you have to think about all these people
that know your personal trauma and then 

366
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,180
this guy barely gets punished.
That's horrible too.

367
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,230
Yeah.
It's horrible too.

368
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,520
Yeah,
man.

369
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,320
It sucks both ways.
You know,

370
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:54,570
I guess it's definitely sucks worse if 
you,

371
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:57,810
the person who gets victimized,
but it still sucks if you're someone who

372
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:02,490
didn't do anything wrong and someone 
claims that you're a rapist and that tag

373
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:05,430
carries you for the rest of your life 
and in your being falsely accused.

374
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:08,340
Yeah.
Until we can read people's minds clearly

375
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,300
and truly,
God,

376
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:10,890
that'll be terrifying.
It's going to happen.

377
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,570
It's on the way.
It's,

378
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,440
it's like right now we are at the Morse 
code of reading minds.

379
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,780
We're at the,
uh,

380
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,121
to,
to,

381
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:18,791
to,
to do,

382
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:19,321
do,
do,

383
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:19,680
do.

384
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,840
That's where we're at.
I mean they're sending signals,

385
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,990
they're receiving signals,
they're articulating words,

386
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,824
someone sending their setting words 
through the Internet into your mind and 

387
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,970
you see those words.
You hear those words,

388
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:32,520
images,
they can place images in your mind.

389
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,683
This is a very rudimentary right now,
but they're gonna be able to string 

390
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:40,320
those words together and form sentences 
and those words instead of being through

391
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:41,154
some giant Bank of supercomputers,
it's going to be something that's in 

392
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:44,964
your phone or a chip that we all 
willingly installing our brains and 

393
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:50,640
we're going to read each other's.
Then we're going to know.

394
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,410
I wonder how nuanced that'll be though.
So I did a,

395
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,080
I did a story before I was at huffpost 
live.

396
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:58,640
I had a show on discovery science 
channel,

397
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:00,980
which was sort of a bit like the soup.
We like a smart ass.

398
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:05,600
He kind of look at,
but science nerd news and I went to come

399
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,160
and where it was somewhere up in the bay
area,

400
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:12,110
so some it place where they working on 
mind reading a computer games.

401
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,770
And this was all the way back in I guess
2010,

402
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,663
2009 and I you could put a thing on your
head and you can operate the computer 

403
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:22,350
game just through the intensity of your 
pet,

404
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,810
of your thought patterns.
It's very,

405
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,160
like you say,
it's basically Morse code.

406
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:25,994
It's pretty much only on or off.
You can't just know nuance apart from 

407
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,310
just think hard about something and then
you know,

408
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,340
you'll set fire to this little thing 
that you need to set fire to,

409
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:37,460
to win the game.
That's amazing that they can tell that.

410
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,730
But I wonder whether or not.
And for example,

411
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,760
we can see the brain when you put people
in an Mri machine,

412
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:46,720
we can tell whether or not the,
the room,

413
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,653
the memory part of your brain is 
lighting up when they show you 

414
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,710
something.
So they talking about the possibility of

415
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,983
in a criminal trial,
they'd be able to at least be able to 

416
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,500
tell whether or not you've ever been to 
the inside,

417
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,873
excuse me,
of the of the place where the crime was 

418
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:01,000
committed.

419
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,421
Well,
you know,

420
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:04,270
I did an episode of this,
of that drug and questions,

421
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:06,250
everything with Mri.
They actually,

422
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,700
they accused someone and convicted 
someone,

423
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:10,534
I believe in India of having functional 
knowledge of a crime scene because 

424
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,023
through f Mri they were able to indicate
that she understood where that crime 

425
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,524
scene was and she had some form of 
memory that they could deduce from the 

426
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,990
Fmr.
The problem according to neuroscientists

427
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,600
and the woman I was talking to on the 
podcast on the show,

428
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,670
I forget her name,
I apologized to her,

429
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,833
but she explained that the problem is 
that during the course of the 

430
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:34,744
investigation that person,
the woman who was accused and convicted 

431
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,033
could have been exposed to the evidence 
of that crime scene and then have 

432
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,150
functional memory of that crime scene.
Because of that which was exposed during

433
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:46,984
the MRI.
Particularly when you think about the 

434
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:50,194
fact that her freedom was on the line,
she was falsely accused or accused of 

435
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,910
this crime.
I don't know if she did or not.

436
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,460
She's accused of this crime they 
presented with this evidence.

437
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,294
She has to go over this evidence.
There's an incredible amount of weight 

438
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,173
in emotions involved in that and they 
could see or that memory deeply in her 

439
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:06,310
brain of what that scene looked like.

440
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,040
Yeah,
that's interesting.

441
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,874
I can't remember whether you've told me 
about that or whether I've just heard 

442
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,000
you talk about it on the,
on the podcast,

443
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:12,834
but.
But then as you get to more and more 

444
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:14,694
subtle layers of thought,
so it's not just is the memory part of 

445
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:22,020
the brain firing when we showed this 
person an image of something,

446
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,360
but it's like.
I mean,

447
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:28,290
how would you.
How would you ascertain somebody's guilt

448
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,990
or innocence in a rape case?

449
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,990
Right now?
I can't see.

450
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,960
I think what they're doing with this 
Fmri stuff is.

451
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:38,660
I mean obviously you can't if there's 
some significant evidence,

452
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:41,420
Siemens scratches video actually by 
reading your mind,

453
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:44,810
but I don't think that Kenya,
what they were saying is that the.

454
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,620
What they did in India with this woman 
was telling me she,

455
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,220
and she

456
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,840
again,
is a prominent neuroscientist.

457
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,500
She was saying that they misuse the 
evidence.

458
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,633
They misstated the efficacy of this 
evidence and that they use this in a 

459
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:58,864
very inappropriate way that would not be
legal in the United States like you 

460
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,920
would get.
No one who understands,

461
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,933
truly understands Fmr,
who would sign off on that or no one 

462
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:07,504
whose ethical,
I mean from the neuroscientist who I've 

463
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,180
spoken to,
I think we're a long,

464
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,014
long,
long way away from having the kind of 

465
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,780
granularity and confidence that we could
say just because this part of the law,

466
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,680
the brain is lighting up or was it just 
because of these kinds of waves of being

467
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:21,514
emitted by your neurons.
That means that you're either guilty or 

468
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,680
not guilty according to our standard 
biology.

469
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,750
I would agree with that and here's where
I deviate.

470
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,093
I think that we are not that far away 
from them being able to introduce 

471
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,234
artificial recording of memories and I 
think that people are going to do it 

472
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,194
willingly and I think it's going to be 
one of those things that people share 

473
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,290
with each other back and forth.

474
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,190
What are you showing me,
Jamie?

475
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,370
Scientists discover how to implant false
memories pulley Ah,

476
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,190
shame.
We just blew it up.

477
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,690
So what does that mean?
Pull it up.

478
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,570
Mit researchers expand that so I could 
read that a little bit better.

479
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,780
MIT researchers,
Steve Ramirez and wow.

480
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,983
The Zulu recently made history when they
successfully implanted a false memory 

481
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:05,230
into the mind of a mouse.
The proof was a simple reaction from the

482
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,270
road and what the implications are.
Vast,

483
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:10,390
they placed the furry little creature 
inside a metal box and it froze.

484
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,373
Displaying a distinct fear response.
The mouse is reacting as if they 

485
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:16,630
received a wreck.
Electrical shock there when it had it at

486
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:17,464
all,
Huh?

487
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,393
I'm stable.
I'm not surprised and this is what I 

488
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:21,484
think.
I've been really heavily dabbling in 

489
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,050
virtual reality lately because my friend
Duncan has the htc vive and uh,

490
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,933
he put it on me and I went into a frenzy
and I realized like what is happening 

491
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:35,764
and where we're at and where I thought 
we were at versus where we actually are 

492
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:38,920
at.

493
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,710
They are so far ahead of where I thought
they are.

494
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,110
They are so close to creating a,
uh,

495
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,690
an indiscernible virtual reality.
It's so close.

496
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,130
Kind of do this,
a friend of mine works us up at a,

497
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,340
but what,
who owns oculus?

498
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,510
Facebook.
That's the big,

499
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:56,344
uh,
virtual reality of either Google or 

500
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,220
facebook.
Yeah.

501
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,370
Facebook.
Facebook tarmac is coming in here.

502
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,204
John Carmack,
the girl from ID software who 

503
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,603
programmed.
He created doom and quake and all those 

504
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,790
games.
He's now at Oculus,

505
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,900
which is just,
I mean,

506
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,130
he's a flesh and go up there to try to 
stuff.

507
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,033
I was hearing Tim Ferriss talks about 
this as well and just say a Dunkin 

508
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,953
donuts podcasts.
I connect you guys in town for a til 

509
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:18,010
Saturday.
Okay.

510
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,280
I'll connect you guys when we get after 
this show and I think Duncanson town.

511
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,110
Fantastic.
You're going to shit your pants.

512
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,350
This shit.
So it's amazing.

513
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,483
But what's amazing about it is right now
it's goggles and it's connected to a 

514
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,680
computer and it's clunky,
but you know,

515
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,653
the original computers at the Apollo 
mission used were giant room and one 

516
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:42,150
quarter of the processing power or 
something of your life.

517
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:43,720
I don't even think it's one quarter.
Yeah,

518
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,100
you know,
but that's the point is that as you,

519
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,993
as this technology exponentially gets 
more and more powerful and smaller and 

520
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,830
more easy for people to access,
you know,

521
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,673
used to be everyone remember Wall Street
when Michael Douglas had that giant 

522
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,220
brick phone and we're like,
what a gangster.

523
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,530
I'm walking around with that phone,
that phone's job and now,

524
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:08,210
I mean that was in Brazil a few years 
back in 2003 and uh,

525
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,283
you know,
you go to these like little tiny jungle 

526
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:13,340
villages and all these people have cell 
phones.

527
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,630
Everybody has a phone.

528
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,713
No,
it's going to be incredible as you see 

529
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:17,221
how.
I mean,

530
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:21,380
the interesting thing for me in via are,
is what we're saying is where it's gonna

531
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,223
go.
So everything moves so fast now that 

532
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:26,580
it's incredible for me to.
I love,

533
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,160
I love human ignorance as well as 
genius.

534
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:29,994
Like I love my own inability to predict 
how things are going to unfold and just 

535
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:34,500
the,
the sheer,

536
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,840
the sheer joy in how spontaneously kind 
of a,

537
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,833
I don't know,
exciting that this whole human 

538
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:45,360
experiment is because when for example,
huffpost live,

539
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,300
we started doing this thing in 2012.
We were like,

540
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,134
okay,
well let's do the future of television 

541
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,880
because obviously television and the 
Internet are coming together and they're

542
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,470
going to merge,
so the way that we.

543
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:56,304
If you,
if you were starting from scratch and 

544
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:58,314
inventing a tool,
a television talk show now knowing 

545
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:03,960
nothing about the history of 
broadcasting or television or radio,

546
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,160
what would it be like?

547
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,970
Well,
it'd be didn't have commenters and you'd

548
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,823
have people joining via Webcam and so 
they developed like 12 hours a day of 

549
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,103
huffpost live broadcasts from studios.
Within a few years it was clear that 

550
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,180
that was obsolete.
That was not the way that the future was

551
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:21,330
going and now it's all like short live 
streaming,

552
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:23,120
shareable things.
Right?

553
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Similarly with virtual reality,
I think the Fio was and has been.

554
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,220
When it gets really good,
everyone's just to sit in their basement

555
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,083
and watch virtual reality porn all day 
and no one's going to connect with each 

556
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,530
other anymore.
Right.

557
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,510
It's coming,
but he is.

558
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,703
What's the.
What's the biggest virtual or augmented 

559
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:47,430
reality breakthrough thus far?
That's widespread.

560
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:50,400
That's caught on.
I don't know what his pokemon go.

561
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,130
Yeah,
but that's dropped off significantly.

562
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,270
Do you know that?
Yeah.

563
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,690
They're dropped into my users over the 
last week.

564
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,400
Really?
I didn't know it was that much,

565
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,653
but here's the thing.

566
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,430
I was pretty sure against it.
It's in Thai.

567
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,480
Yeah.
I mean I.

568
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,910
I'm not saying that it's going to.
The pokemon go itself is going to change

569
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:06,744
the world.
What points to to me is the possibility 

570
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:10,344
that where we thought that virtual 
reality was all going to be about 

571
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:17,040
headsets and me and my own head and 
maybe it still will be to some extent.

572
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,073
I could totally see it go in the 
augmented reality way instead so that 

573
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:25,800
you're walking around the street with 
some kind of little thing on the side of

574
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:26,634
your head and all every way you look,
things are popping up like little 

575
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:30,330
graphics are pumping up on top of 
things,

576
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,850
offering you sales in a particular 
store,

577
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,550
showing you where you know,
you can say what you're looking for,

578
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:36,870
you know,
where's the nearest bank and this little

579
00:26:36,871 --> 00:26:39,480
arrow that points down over the newest 
chase branch or whatever.

580
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,300
That's what magic leap is saying.
Yeah,

581
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,160
right.
So and that strikes

582
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,600
me is actually a more plausible and 
organic pot old possible future than the

583
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,930
one in which we're all just sort of like
in the wally,

584
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,040
remember the movie Wally Universe where 
we're all just in Bocca lounges and lazy

585
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:56,874
boys in kind of our own.
I don't think they're mutually 

586
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:00,270
exclusive.
Maybe not.

587
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:03,090
I don't think it's either or.
I think that's going to happen as well.

588
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:06,900
There's going to be brave fools that 
venture outside and experience augmented

589
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,290
reality where everybody else stairs at 
people's buttholes from two inches away.

590
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,371
I'm telling you,
man,

591
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:15,480
you put on these virtual goggles and you
have a three d porn going on where these

592
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,400
people are having sex and you can get 
right in there.

593
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:18,234
You could look at their face,
you could stare in their eyes when they 

594
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:20,814
have sex and it looks so God damn real,
but their computer generated avatars or 

595
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,580
they feel human being filmed.

596
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,290
Human beings for 360 degree cameras.
And right now it's,

597
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,830
you know,
it's fairly limited.

598
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,450
Did you watch porn on it now?
I didn't.

599
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,580
Duncan has though.
Dunkin is into it.

600
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,060
I didn't want to watch porn in front of 
Dunkin.

601
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,560
Can't see anything other than the.
I'm just kidding.

602
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,490
But it's when you feel someone blowing 
you and you're just like,

603
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,440
what?
Come on.

604
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,880
Beard.
Play enough.

605
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,340
Duncan.
Um,

606
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,600
it's,
you know,

607
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,770
I saw the um,
the most impressive thing that I saw was

608
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:56,604
the underwater thing.
They have this underwater thing where 

609
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,313
you,
you're standing at the bottom of the 

610
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:04,890
ocean and these fish swim by and then a 
whale swims up to you and you're looking

611
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,790
the whale in the eye and it has this 
feeling of mass,

612
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,320
like you really feel like there's whales
in front of you.

613
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:12,240
You freaking out.
I mean,

614
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:13,350
it's so realistic.

615
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,880
It's actual three d footage of A.
Well,

616
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,680
no,
no,

617
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,210
it's CCGI generated.
Well,

618
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,700
but it's amazing.
It's amazing and it's just.

619
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,960
It gives you this.
Well,

620
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,950
I first tried virtual reality at 
Duncan's place,

621
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,130
I want to say four years ago,
three years ago,

622
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:32,520
somewhere in there,
and it was really crude.

623
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,630
It was pixelated and it was some silly 
game and it was really clunky,

624
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,910
but I could see it.
I could see it.

625
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:39,721
I could go,
oh,

626
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:41,220
I get it.
I see where this is going.

627
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,533
This is just leaps and bounds past where
that is and there's one game that you 

628
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,334
play or one experience that you have 
where you go into this guys room and 

629
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:55,380
he's composing music on a piano and you 
walk in the room and you can look up and

630
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:58,620
look around and while this guy's playing
the piano,

631
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,690
you can get up beside him and look at 
his keys.

632
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,420
It's fucking crazy.
That's video.

633
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,910
That's a real guy.
And Apparently Duncan says like,

634
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,650
the porn is just like that.
You can just like get.

635
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,420
So I mean for me the question is,
I think fundamentally we are.

636
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,730
Oh well he's the image of the whale.
Yeah.

637
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:19,030
I mean this is not doing it justice 
because you don't have a real reality.

638
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,113
Yeah,
but you don't have any control whether 

639
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:21,564
or not you move.
So you're kind of getting a sense of 

640
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,800
what happens while love this camera 
moves around,

641
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,570
but I'm a.
You can get underneath that.

642
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:31,020
We'll look at its body.
I'd gone onto the water with a,

643
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,050
with a humpback whale and mainly a 
couple of years ago.

644
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:34,884
You're not allowed to swim with them,
but if you're in a little dodgy Zodiac 

645
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,110
like I was,
then they get around the rules.

646
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,190
Well my guy did by just holding

647
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,023
your legs,
so as long as you're still connected to 

648
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:46,510
the boat,
like you're technically not swimming,

649
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,320
swim with them because it for 
environmental reasons,

650
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,154
like people were Dick heads would go up 
and harass them for the team and the 

651
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:54,640
whale or something.
Exactly.

652
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,483
You need to give them their space and so
I had a snorkel on and goggles on and 

653
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:00,694
this huge thing just comes looming out 
of the ward and the size of a fucking 

654
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,583
bus.
This memo that breathes air like that 

655
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:08,904
eats these times.
I mean the miracle of it blows my mind 

656
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,953
the diversity of this incredible planet 
that we live on a and then it just sort 

657
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,134
of sinks down into the crystal blue 
water until I can just sort of make it 

658
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:26,170
out and then it's just disappeared and 
it's all just blue blue underneath.

659
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,040
I mean it was like,
I don't want to sound too wacky,

660
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,030
but it was spiritual.
I mean,

661
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:35,320
you come over there and that thing is 
just that was born,

662
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,323
that squirted out of another whale's 
vagina and then grew up and now it's 

663
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:41,620
just,
now it's doing its thing in the Pacific

664
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,010
paradigm shifting because of their 
masks,

665
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,090
because the oddness of them.
Well,

666
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,990
even dolphins,
I um,

667
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,880
did this thing last summer where,
uh,

668
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,753
me and my whole family were in the big 
island and you go on this dolphin 

669
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:56,794
excursion where they take you on a boat 
and they find these pods of wild 

670
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:03,730
dolphins and you just jump into the 
water with the dolphins with snorkels.

671
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,250
So you're,
they're swimming around and you know,

672
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:08,650
I did it with my,
at the time she was five,

673
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,110
we did it with my five year old.
I'm like holding her hand and taking her

674
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:14,260
with these dolphins and we're looking 
down with our goggles and these dolphins

675
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:15,910
were swimming right under you.
Amazing.

676
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,190
It's fucking beautiful.
It's nuts.

677
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,970
I was in the water and in Australia in 
Byron Bay and was,

678
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,573
and there are occasional shark attacks 
there and caught a glimpse of movement 

679
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,020
out of the side of the side of my eye.
Oh fuck.

680
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,220
And I was like,
Oh fuck.

681
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,980
And looked over and could see like a 
shape and a and a fin ps,

682
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,711
the,
the,

683
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:39,544
the water and then like what?
That moment where time stands stand 

684
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,170
still and you're like,
Holy Shit.

685
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,900
And then the back just arched out of the
water.

686
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,560
I know.
I was like,

687
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,800
Oh,
thank fucking Lord you Dolphin.

688
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,810
Oh fuck.
Oh God.

689
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,390
And then this whole pod of dolphins just
diving through the waves,

690
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,380
I was like,
oh my God.

691
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,603
Yeah.
There was a video off of Maui or excuse 

692
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,334
me off a Malibu really recently where 
these people were flying a drone over a 

693
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:05,883
Malibu and he was only,
I don't think maybe one or 200 yards 

694
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:13,000
away from swimmers and surfers and this 
is fucking monster.

695
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:13,834
Great White Shark swimming around it and
looking for something to chomp on and 

696
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,573
they're out there apparently like really
common off a Malibu and they're 

697
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:24,880
realizing that now because it drones 
Herdez people fly those drones.

698
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:25,714
And have you ever done those?
Have you found that operated at myself 

699
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:29,420
and that's another aspect of virtual 
reality.

700
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:31,990
It's fascinating.
You put these virtual reality goggles on

701
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,070
and you put a camera on this drone and 
as the drone is flying,

702
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:39,980
you feel like your.
I did that in the Pacific when we

703
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,600
were looking for bigfoot Duncan and I 
coincidentally,

704
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,550
and this,
uh,

705
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,440
this drone is flying over the tree tops 
and it really does.

706
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,303
You have this sensation of flight.
That's what I want because I used to 

707
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:53,630
want to be a pilot.
I'm a huge aviation path.

708
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:55,700
Like I'm part of the travel hacking 
community,

709
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:56,534
the bunch of nerds who figure out ways 
to fly first class all over the place 

710
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:00,824
using credit card,
frequent flyer miles tracking travel 

711
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:04,970
hacking.
Yeah.

712
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,751
No,
that was real.

713
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:06,584
Yeah,
it's great.

714
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,453
I mean,
I fly around the world first class at 

715
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:10,484
least two or three times a year as long 
as there's many times I have time for 

716
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,430
one flights that would cost 20 or 
$30,000.

717
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,240
Mean flight from here to Australia in 
first class on a good airline is $22.

718
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,870
Twenty two,
$23,000.

719
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,180
Yeah.
You just use points these miles.

720
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,180
But.
So I'm a huge.

721
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,950
You,
you look like,

722
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:29,450
you think that I'm committing crime?
No,

723
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,630
I'm not your own little insecurities,
but I don't know.

724
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,590
I feel like I've been saying that in an 
interaction with law enforcement to Joe.

725
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,770
So,
um,

726
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,500
but whose credit card are you using?
I'm not going,

727
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,590
but I've always,
I mean I've reckoned flight would be the

728
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,424
most amazing thing I'd love to.
I've been meaning to get around to like 

729
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:52,280
learning to hang glide or paraglider,
one of those types of things.

730
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,114
I think that'd be a great hobby.
Who have you seen the new inside of 

731
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,900
planes that they're building?
They're building.

732
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,490
Oh yeah.
I'm not sure they're going to do that.

733
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:03,950
But you may passenger planes where the 
interior.

734
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,280
The exterior.
I've seen the mock ups of.

735
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,153
Yeah,
well apparently they're thinking about 

736
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:11,510
making it or they're in development,
but the,

737
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,493
if it becomes a reality,
the ultimate goal is you're going to be 

738
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:18,020
flying and essentially what feels like a
convertible.

739
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,993
Yeah.
Because the entire top of the plane is 

740
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,104
going to be a screen and you're going to
be able to look up and see the actual 

741
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,420
sky above you.
I mean,

742
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,130
they could do it on the floor as well if
they wanted to.

743
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,430
Sure.
That freak you out.

744
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,630
Feel like you're just sitting in a chair
flying through space.

745
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,583
Oh my God.
I sometimes wonder what the experience 

746
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,780
would have been like for like the people
in the Malaysian Airlines plane that was

747
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:40,560
blown up over Ukraine where like all of 
us,

748
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,500
you know,
one minute you were at 34,000

749
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:45,230
feet and then [inaudible] those 
explosions,

750
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,860
the way that those anti aircraft and 
missiles go is they blow up outside the,

751
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,620
the plane just,
just immediately outside it.

752
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,070
And then all of the shrapnel shatters 
the plane and blow it apart.

753
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,610
Yeah.
So did they shoot that thing down or did

754
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:00,350
a bomb blow up on the plane?

755
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,750
They shut it down.
So it was the,

756
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:03,584
uh,
the Russians.

757
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,740
So it was a Russian shout,
a plane down for.

758
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah.
You remember the Malaysia Airlines plane

759
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:10,150
that went down Mih?
I always get approved.

760
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,900
Who Shot that down?
Basically.

761
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,734
So Putin was alarming.
It wasn't intentional that didn't know 

762
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:18,440
it was a passenger plane.
So it was during the Ukrainian.

763
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,723
Putin had annexed Crimea and was 
basically fermenting a revolution in 

764
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:23,924
Ukraine because he resented the 
Ukrainian government being pro western 

765
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:28,004
and pro American and so they were 
sending in Russian special forces in 

766
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,460
like,
not in Russian uniforms,

767
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:38,070
but our secret service guys will know 
they are Russian

768
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,933
backed in Russia to finance.
They using military hardware that only 

769
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:42,024
Russia could have gotten them,
that a rag tag team of Ukrainian rebel 

770
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,760
San Francisco would never have been able
to get on their own,

771
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,623
such as an anti aircraft.
Ms Dot Paula can shoot a plane out of 

772
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:53,850
the sky from 34,000
feet.

773
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,313
Now there are lots of conspiracy 
theories that are put out by Moscow 

774
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,520
about this because of course Russia 
doesn't accept it.

775
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:00,354
They think that it was the west,
I think that it was the Ukrainians or 

776
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:03,414
whatever,
but there was a Malaysian airlines jet 

777
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:09,870
that was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala 
Lumpur full of quite a lot of people who

778
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:10,704
were heading to Melbourne actually.
Which is why I did quite a few stories 

779
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,620
on it.
And um,

780
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,500
the that we're heading to Melbourne for 
big AIDS conference was the big national

781
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:20,334
aids conference,
so actually a lot of the world's best 

782
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,710
biggest best aids scientists and aids 
research has died in that,

783
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,650
in that crash.

784
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,220
And they were just flying and they'd 
been in the air for a few hours and they

785
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,054
were going over Ukrainian airspace and 
the rebels sore a speck in the sky and 

786
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,160
assumed that it wouldn't be a passenger 
plane.

787
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,273
Why they assume that I think that there 
was a warning that passenger jets 

788
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:47,511
shouldn't be going over that area.
And I think it was an off year.

789
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:48,654
They assumed that it was a military 
plane and they used one of these huge 

790
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:54,540
antiaircraft things and it's self God is
seeking.

791
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,600
So it goes straight to the thing and 
then just as it is,

792
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:01,260
it's next to it explodes and the plane's
splits into and just literally drops out

793
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,530
of the sky.
And I sometimes wonder like,

794
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:07,440
what is the experience when you're 
sitting there,

795
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,850
do you have a half a second to,
to know what's happening?

796
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,660
I mean,
you must,

797
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,493
you must write.
The deceleration is so fast that I've 

798
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:18,834
heard scientists say,
you wouldn't really know what's 

799
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:20,640
happening.

800
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,720
You'd just sort of you pass out because 
all of a sudden you're going from what,

801
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:28,460
500 miles an hour down to and rapid 
rapid deceleration.

802
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,720
Obviously all of a sudden it's.
There's no air,

803
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,110
there's no air anymore.
There's it's freezing cold,

804
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,710
but I mean some people I would have 
imagined would be semi momentarily aware

805
00:37:39,711 --> 00:37:40,544
that something horrible has happened and
it's suddenly it's called tumbling out 

806
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,670
of the sky.
It's kind of weird to.

807
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,833
So I don't want that kind of flight.
Joe Don't know why that popped into my 

808
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:49,110
head,
that whole story,

809
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,160
but I want some kind of flight.
Yeah,

810
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,580
that's not good.
Yeah.

811
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,720
Me.
Amazing.

812
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,050
On the question of virtual reality,
do you think,

813
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,170
do you not think that we are so 
fundamentally creatures of community,

814
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,033
of communion,
of communication that this dystopian 

815
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:12,360
vision of all of us just sitting solo 
with our headsets on,

816
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,870
having our own experiences is unlikely.

817
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,350
I tend to think that there are going to 
be ways that we will find ways to use it

818
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:24,351
to connect us more rather than less 
because what makes it anything not,

819
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,160
that's not a gimmick.
Like I don't know.

820
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,470
I can't foresee what virtual reality 
will become.

821
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:32,580
Like when film was invented,
they started out just by doing here's an

822
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,380
image of a steam train and people were 
like,

823
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,214
oh my goodness.
It's like it looks like there's a steam 

824
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:38,260
train,
but no one knew what the fuck to do with

825
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:39,650
it.
It took awhile.

826
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,520
It took years.
It took decades before the craft and art

827
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,354
of cinematography and filmmaking became 
a thing and I don't know that we know 

828
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,690
yet what virtual reality will become at 
the moment.

829
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:51,970
It strikes me as just something like,
Whoa,

830
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,570
it'll become everything can become.
It's not going to become any one thing.

831
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:57,190
It's not going to go in only one 
direction.

832
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:00,940
All these directions that we're 
proposing are not just possible,

833
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:04,930
but most likely inevitable and whether 
or not we're creatures of community.

834
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,930
There's a lot of people that seek 
community online and that's the only way

835
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:08,764
they get community and it's very 
problematic in a lot of them when you 

836
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:11,854
find out like who they are as people,
they're really fucked up and one of the 

837
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:16,924
reasons why they're seeking community 
online is because they don't have 

838
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:20,314
community in the actual physical world 
and they're disenfranchised and they're 

839
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:25,990
loners or they're,
you know,

840
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,440
they're on the spectrum or there's a 
bunch of different factors,

841
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,670
a bunch of different social misfits that
are finding community online.

842
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,773
I know places where you can go where you
could see the same people online 

843
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:37,804
literally 18 hours a day every day.
Some people that are on disability and 

844
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:42,664
they get checks and they never leave the
house and all they do is pay for their 

845
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:46,264
Internet connection and food and that is
where they exist and that is really 

846
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,690
common.
So if that's really common,

847
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,553
you know there's probably a million plus
people out there that are doing that 

848
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:58,300
every day.
What's going to stop them from going

849
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,350
virtual?
They will,

850
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,210
yeah,
they will.

851
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,043
Well,
and I think a lot of other people will 

852
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:03,120
as well.
If you think about what we're doing with

853
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:05,370
phones,
you know how many times have you gone to

854
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,470
a restaurant?
You see a table full of seven people.

855
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,110
No one's talking to each other.
Everyone's staring at their phone.

856
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,590
I mean,
this is a form of virtual reality.

857
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,160
You're going into the reality that 
exists on your phone and you're like,

858
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:17,701
hmm,
what's.

859
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:18,534
See what's going on.
You're constantly updating it and 

860
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:20,824
constantly checking your facebook feed 
to see if who's posted something 

861
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:25,860
interesting.
You're clicking on videos and instead of

862
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:26,694
talking to each other,
you're showing each other some shit 

863
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,690
that's on your phone.
That is really common,

864
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:31,160
right?

865
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,690
It is.
It's a big fucking problem.

866
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,240
I think it's.
I think it's deeper than we know

867
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,353
Ari Shaffir and big Jay Oakerson did a 
podcast where they were on the roof of 

868
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:43,530
this building and they were a peeping 
tom on this.

869
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:44,364
A couple of those couples about deaf sex
and they both started talking on their 

870
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,120
phones will start playing with their 
phones.

871
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,103
The woman was straddling this man and 
she's looking at her phone and the guys 

872
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:52,650
underneath the girl and he starts,
okay,

873
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,110
I want to know why our Irish affairs 
spying on people,

874
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,800
what he does,
he's a pervert.

875
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,943
He's a creep,
but I think it's what it's doing to our 

876
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:04,020
heads.
But like,

877
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,883
because like,
so a friend of a friend of mine is a 

878
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:11,901
stand up here and in La and he first,
he got rid of his smartphone in favor of

879
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:16,410
a flip phone already did that too.
And then he got rid of his flip phone in

880
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:17,244
favor of a home landline with an old 
fashioned answering machine with a type 

881
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,394
in it because he feels like he enjoyed.
He thinks there's a virtue in being 

882
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,720
bored.
There's something to be in board.

883
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,593
Yep.
That you'll brain needs the space of 

884
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:35,564
having to conjure up imagination in its 
own right in order to lead you to the 

885
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,450
muse because you never know when it's 
gonna hit.

886
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,200
So you know,
constantly.

887
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,243
I mean,
I think back to why not I was a kid and 

888
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,610
if you made arrangements to go and see a
movie with a buddy of yours,

889
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,503
you know,
when I was 15 and you said we'll just 

890
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:01,910
meet at the movie theater at five and 
they were going to be light.

891
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,510
There was no way for you to know that 
they were going to be seven minutes late

892
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,603
and during those seven minutes there was
nothing for you to do and it's amazing 

893
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:14,090
to me that I'm amazed that that's the 
case.

894
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,810
It's amazing to me that now I can't even
really imagine just standing on a street

895
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:22,340
corner outside of movie theater for 
seven minutes being totally unruffled by

896
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:23,174
the fact that a friend is seven minutes 
late and being perfectly comfortable 

897
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:28,340
just doing what?
Gazing at the sky.

898
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,080
Looking at passes by.
Yeah.

899
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,350
That's what people have done for 
thousands of years when they had to wait

900
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,184
for something and that space,
that just psychic space of not having 

901
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:42,140
the ability to check who taught me,
talking about me on twitter,

902
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:42,351
who,
what,

903
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,730
what's going on on facebook,
what am I missing?

904
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:44,564
What's happening?
We know what's the latest photo from my 

905
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:46,664
friends.
What's the latest news thing that's 

906
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:49,490
coming down?
Just standing there.

907
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,560
They life used to be punctuated by 
moments like that all the time.

908
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,253
Yeah.
And I wonder whether those are the 

909
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,124
moments in which you come up with ideas 
for the book that you want to ride or 

910
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:01,304
the standup bit that you want to do or 
the painting that you want to pay until 

911
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,220
the,
I don't know,

912
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:05,390
the chair that you want to make.

913
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,250
No,
they can or you can just actually work.

914
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,243
A lot of people think that the music is 
supposed to come to you when you're 

915
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:15,850
bored.
How about you sit in front of your desk,

916
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:18,640
you fucking Lazy Bitch.
And actually right.

917
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,410
You know,
there's that too.

918
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,273
I mean,
I think there is absolutely an argument 

919
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,800
for not being constantly entertained by 
electronics.

920
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:29,170
There's absolutely an argument for that,
but I don't know if that's the best one.

921
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,240
I think um,
I lead is,

922
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:36,130
well I think reflection and time alone 
and also I think the,

923
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:38,040
um,
the way to mitigate that is discipline.

924
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,770
I think you have to have discipline.
You have to have no wins.

925
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,340
A lot of people don't.
I don't

926
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,240
and I appreciate moments of,
you know,

927
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,093
I used to love flying before you had 
back televisions because it was a good 

928
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:51,250
excuse to just read and just gaze out 
the window and just think now I watch tv

929
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,360
because I don't do this.
I'm an

930
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,290
bullshit.
You're not though,

931
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,510
but you're not.
You get a lot of things done.

932
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,620
I do,
but don't.

933
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:00,454
I mean I like a lot of creative people.
Beat myself up a lot for not getting 

934
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:04,000
more done.
I mean I look at.

935
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,590
I live as well and I get a lot done.

936
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,573
Yeah.
But I think everyone looks at you and 

937
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:09,021
thinks,
fuck,

938
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,690
I wish I was more like Joe said.
I just did a lot of shit.

939
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,600
He seems to have his shit together.
Guys like you and Tim Ferriss.

940
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,740
You like an Anthony Robbins and stuff.
You're always doing shit.

941
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,750
Yeah.
But whereas a lot of us are the creative

942
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:23,040
people spend a lot of time scratching 
our head,

943
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,110
scratching our offices.

944
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,400
Here's the dirty secret.
I'm never satisfied.

945
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,650
Yeah.
I'm not everything I eat everything.

946
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,310
I do

947
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,980
have a podcast comes out great.
I'm happy and everything like that,

948
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:36,870
but I.
I get very little satisfaction from it.

949
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,733
I just.
All I think is the next one's got to be 

950
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:40,090
good to.
Let's.

951
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,840
Let's make sure the guest is good.
Let's make sure the subject matters.

952
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,840
That was good.
Easy,

953
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,880
easy fella.
You're a good guest,

954
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,800
but I've had some gas before.
We're like,

955
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:51,570
oh Jesus,
I got to do all the heavy lifting here.

956
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,520
Motherfuckers not even finishing his 
sentences.

957
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,870
I've had people like that before.
Especially people that don't know how to

958
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:59,850
do podcasts or they haven't done them 
before.

959
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,983
Yeah,
I mean podcasting itself is kind of a 

960
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,174
work of art.
It's a very pretentious way to describe 

961
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:06,294
it,
but I mean it is a creation and there's 

962
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:08,634
something that's going on.
You have to be aware of how people are 

963
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:12,780
gonna perceive this creation,
how they're going to ingest it,

964
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,913
and it has to be as smooth as you can 
make it and you have to learn from your 

965
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:16,824
mistakes and you have to make sure 
you're not talking over each other too 

966
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,374
much,
but you also can't let someone ramble 

967
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:21,360
too much as well.

968
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,810
Sometimes people get boring,
they just drone on about things in their

969
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:25,644
own,
in their own space and you've got to 

970
00:45:26,571 --> 00:45:29,000
kind of pull them out of their space.
So there's A.

971
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,290
There's like a craft to it all,
but yeah,

972
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,690
I do a lot of different things,
but one of the reasons why I do a lot of

973
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:34,524
different things is that they all kind 
of symbiotically connected together in 

974
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:40,830
some sort of a weird way in that I love 
them all.

975
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:41,843
I enjoy doing them all.
Whether it's a comedy or mma commentary 

976
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:48,030
or podcasting,
they all do sort of flow together.

977
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,550
Hm.
I mean,

978
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,970
it's interesting that you say that.
Like there's a craft to podcasting.

979
00:45:52,971 --> 00:45:53,804
In terms of how.
We were talking about this a little bit 

980
00:45:55,581 --> 00:45:56,414
last night with Sam Harrison on my 
podcast about when should you interrupt 

981
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,973
and when should you not,
not interrupt because I find that 

982
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:05,683
sometimes I'll be criticized for 
interrupting somebody on my podcast and 

983
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,333
as far as I'm concerned what I.
The last thing I want my podcast to be 

984
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:14,144
or any form of entertaining conversation
to be is just a sequence of speeches 

985
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,453
that two people give to one another.
I mean this is one of the things that's 

986
00:46:22,191 --> 00:46:24,310
appealing about your podcast.
You know,

987
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,233
you come into this with a two to three 
hour stretch ahead of you with 

988
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,240
absolutely no idea what's going to 
happen and no preconceptions about where

989
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:35,660
it's going to go and the joy of it is 
the is the dance,

990
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:36,494
right?
Is the interplay like I don't know what 

991
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:39,230
was going to be talking about in five 
minutes time and neither do you.

992
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,423
So it's interesting to find out and I 
feel like if you have too nice to other 

993
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:49,610
people and don't interrupt them in order
to create that dance,

994
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,833
then there's basically one person 
standing on the sidelines and another 

995
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:56,540
person trying to do the two step or the 
Flamenco by themselves.

996
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,613
But that depends on who the guest is.
Like there's certain guests like Dr 

997
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,580
Rhonda Patrick is a perfect example.
All I do is wind her up and let her go.

998
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,990
I mean I interact with her a little bit 
but as little as possible and she's just

999
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:09,824
such a dynamo that all I have to do is 
ask her questions about the mechanisms 

1000
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:15,284
of certain vitamin absorption or 
whatever we're talking about cold shock 

1001
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:18,890
therapy,
whatever the fuck it is.

1002
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,040
And she just goes.
So in that case,

1003
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,560
if I wanted to chime in and have a 
normal conversation,

1004
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:26,390
I'd fuck up the flow of the 
conversation.

1005
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,710
So going to know you to have the.
Whereas you and I,

1006
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,740
we always have these silly conversations
that goes all over the place.

1007
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:34,360
We're laughing,
we're serious.

1008
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,790
It's very fluid and it goes back and 
forth.

1009
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,150
But you like,
I am not a fucking medical expert.

1010
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,273
No.
I mean we're not experts in anything 

1011
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,370
which is,
which is what kind of what I like.

1012
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,693
I like being a polymath.
I like having a lot of fingers in 

1013
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,400
different pies and polymath polymath 
person who is for who's good at it can.

1014
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,450
Can we get a definition on polymath?
Jamie?

1015
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,933
I understand it.
To be a person who's interested in and 

1016
00:47:57,151 --> 00:48:00,270
good at several different disciplines 
like doesn't really focus on one.

1017
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,990
I prefer smile.
A renaissance man,

1018
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,360
a person of wide ranging knowledge or 
learning well.

1019
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:07,200
Experts in this

1020
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,113
bands.
A significant number of different 

1021
00:48:09,141 --> 00:48:11,390
subject areas.
That's an expertise.

1022
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,253
Many expertise.
So a person who is known to draw on 

1023
00:48:14,031 --> 00:48:16,640
complex bodies of knowledge to solve 
specific problem.

1024
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,060
Well that's the Wiki.
I was no,

1025
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,220
look at the one above.
I was using the general,

1026
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,130
the general use ranging knowledge or 
learning.

1027
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:23,820
Yeah,
it's.

1028
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:28,270
Well that's just a more pronounced 
version of it or more polymath.

1029
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,720
I like it.
How much time do you spend distracted by

1030
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:31,554
your phone?

1031
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,890
I tried very low,
more,

1032
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,160
less lately than ever.
I've been really good about it.

1033
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:38,320
Over the last few months,
like I went to,

1034
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:43,150
I was in the Nevada high country in the 
desert last week,

1035
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,250
just for a whole week.
I love this.

1036
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:46,360
I love the.
I love that.

1037
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,170
Just for your listeners,
so I got my book a trip to La.

1038
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,570
I had a few meetings out here.
I'm always here at the last minute,

1039
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:55,360
so I never had never planned in advance.
I send you a text,

1040
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,190
don't hear from him for a couple of 
days.

1041
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,780
He gets back to me.
Sorry I've.

1042
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,550
I've been in the wilderness like my 
image of you is like you didn't have any

1043
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,384
cell phone reception.
You're out in the woods and in my brain 

1044
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:09,760
you're like,
you're naked on the back of a horse.

1045
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:11,770
Like shooting elk.
No,

1046
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,050
I was trying to shoot

1047
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,210
mule deer.
I was in the desert.

1048
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,830
I was camping and those were the a group
of friends and we were on a hunting trip

1049
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,410
and we were there for seven days.
No Cell Phone Reception,

1050
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,810
no pee.
We occasionally saw another hunter,

1051
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:26,530
but that's it.
We're just saying,

1052
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,740
well,
they're on public land in the wilderness

1053
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,310
and chasing after dear.
I got to do more of the seven days.

1054
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,010
No cell phone.
How many female?

1055
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,930
No,
there was five of us total.

1056
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:37,710
One,
two,

1057
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,311
three,
four,

1058
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:39,150
five,
six.

1059
00:49:39,151 --> 00:49:40,470
Six of US total.
Great.

1060
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,390
Yeah.
What'd you it off into?

1061
00:49:42,391 --> 00:49:43,760
Two groups.
We brought food,

1062
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,460
brought a freeze dried foods,
these things called mountain ops,

1063
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,453
the you add water to them.
This freeze dried fruits and dehydrated 

1064
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:54,300
foods and then we brought some whole 
foods,

1065
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:56,450
some actual real foods.
We ate that all by the,

1066
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,180
like the fourth or fifth day and then we
not shitty freeze dried stuff,

1067
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,553
but um,
we're hoping we going to eat a deer but 

1068
00:50:03,031 --> 00:50:06,540
we struck out.
But it was a very fun time and even just

1069
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,374
for the,
just the release of just being 

1070
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:09,744
disconnected from society.
But point is I try to do that several 

1071
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:15,390
times a year.
I do that maybe five times a year,

1072
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,373
but more important than that,
I leave that fucking thing alone more 

1073
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:21,090
than I've ever done before.
I treat that thing.

1074
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,210
If I spend too much time with it,
it's going to give me a disease.

1075
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,520
I think it does.
Yeah.

1076
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,860
I think it does.
And don't know why.

1077
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:28,030
I don't

1078
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:28,863
know what's changed.
I'm trying to put my finger on what it 

1079
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,410
is about my relationship,
especially to twitter.

1080
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,070
That has changed because it's a very 
wholesome.

1081
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,520
Yeah.
Is that what it is?

1082
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,160
With so many assholes,
you realize like in my real life,

1083
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,190
how many people do I get in contact with
them?

1084
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:44,090
Make me feel awful.
Very few.

1085
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:45,560
Almost zero.
Almost zero.

1086
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,230
So you choose to hang out with your 
friends,

1087
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,730
choose to hang out with your 
acquaintances.

1088
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:51,620
All the people that you know,
you interact with people.

1089
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,630
And even if I meet someone and they're a
stranger,

1090
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,870
99 point nine times when I meet them,
it's a pleasant interaction.

1091
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,190
It's very rare that I find someone who's
like really truly rude or where it can't

1092
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:05,024
be worked out.
You know where you can't walk away from 

1093
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:09,200
it with a handshake and feeling good.
But this thing,

1094
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:13,610
this w two dimensional conversation 
where you don't know who the person is,

1095
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,100
you don't know what,
where they're coming from.

1096
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,910
You don't know what their agenda is.
You don't know what their life is like.

1097
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:20,744
You don't know anything about them.
And they say something and you react to 

1098
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:27,900
that 130 plus characters.
So there are two problems,

1099
00:51:27,901 --> 00:51:29,180
right?
One is the,

1100
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,073
the absence of destroy,
the distractedness that it kind of 

1101
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,120
fosters in our lives.
The fact that it rubs,

1102
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,040
at least in my experience,
I can only speak for me,

1103
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:42,041
it rubs me of moments of Zen that could 
exist throughout the day by plunging,

1104
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,273
by know.
We know physiologically that it gives 

1105
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:46,454
you a little dopamine hit every time you
notice that someone's mentioned you on 

1106
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:49,904
twitter and said something right.
I mean you get a true that they'd done 

1107
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:53,310
like studies with people.
Yeah.

1108
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,730
You get a little hit,
you get a little drug hit.

1109
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:57,080
I mean just a tiny drip,
drip,

1110
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:57,943
drip.
It's like having a little piece of 

1111
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,150
candy.

1112
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,570
I could just get dripped all day then 
just sit around and just drip away.

1113
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,740
Well,
people do drip,

1114
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:04,574
drip,
drip,

1115
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,850
crazy man.
And so there's that.

1116
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,610
There's the fact that I'm constantly 
getting that literally hit by,

1117
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,670
by lugging on what is that an energy 
thing when you're writing?

1118
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,340
This is your brain Alpha Bank.
Yeah,

1119
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,730
yeah,
sure.

1120
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,350
Is it going to.
What does it contain?

1121
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,000
I mean,
I know I should know this because I know

1122
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:22,420
that you're the guy not,
don't worry about it.

1123
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,760
It doesn't matter.
I'll talk to you off the aerobatics.

1124
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,830
Just Dole it handled.
He did throw them all.

1125
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:30,410
Last night there was only two left.
Hannibal stolen.

1126
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,573
He sent me.
He sent me a text message this morning 

1127
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,800
laughing about how he stole all my Alpha
brain and I've got his address.

1128
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,520
I'm like,
just give me your address.

1129
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:41,354
I'll send you out.
Did he say anything else about to about 

1130
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:43,250
last night?

1131
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,901
No.
No,

1132
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:44,240
no.
Okay.

1133
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,520
Good.
I don't want them to feel bad about what

1134
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,470
was going to feel bad when it comes out.
Yeah.

1135
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,373
Alright.
Uh,

1136
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,340
so getting around that,
if you release it,

1137
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:56,000
he's gonna feel bad even though maybe 
he,

1138
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,540
maybe Sam feel bad.
I don't know.

1139
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,293
Well this comes back to twitter.
They'll feel bad if they read twitter 

1140
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:03,860
and they want to feel bad if that irate 
to stay off twitter.

1141
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,023
And so this is interesting.
So in addition to it being a kind of a 

1142
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,420
drug that you keep in your pocket,
that stops you from,

1143
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,423
uh,
from ever just being alone with 

1144
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:16,280
yourself.
Have you seen that?

1145
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:18,110
Louis ck bit by the way,
but he,

1146
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:18,944
I think he's on Conan where he's talking
about why it doesn't want to give his 

1147
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,080
daughter's phone because like,
he's like,

1148
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:24,914
you know,
that he was like,

1149
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:25,923
he was stopped in traffic at lights and 
he felt something inside that he didn't 

1150
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,204
like,
which was like the experience of being 

1151
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,233
human.

1152
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,140
And so he reached for his phone and then
he realized that that's what we do.

1153
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,580
Like the moment we start to feel the 
great emptiness of being alive,

1154
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,103
we reach for our phone and but one on 
one occasion he didn't reach for his 

1155
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:45,954
phone and he pulled over the side of the
road and like started bawling his eyes 

1156
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:50,220
out and it was so cathartic and so 
beautiful.

1157
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:53,120
And then he recovered and he like had 
this wonderful spiritual goal.

1158
00:53:53,121 --> 00:53:54,940
Some experience,
hold the fuck on.

1159
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,333
He just started crying song.
There's some songs on the radio and it 

1160
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,440
was so beautiful.
Anyway,

1161
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:03,630
he gets,
he waxes all lyrical and gets old poetic

1162
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:06,960
Louis ck growing a vagina right in front
of her eyes.

1163
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:09,720
You heard it here first.
Louie Joe Rogan says you have a vagina.

1164
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:10,963
Sorry,
go ahead.

1165
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,133
But anyway,
that's his point is like that's what 

1166
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,203
part of the experience of being human is
all about his side of the road with a 

1167
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:21,840
car listening to magic created by a 
machine.

1168
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,440
Yeah.
So human.

1169
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,850
Maybe that's the wrong example.
Can Pussy.

1170
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,080
So in addition to that then you're 
talking,

1171
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,623
people were tweeting.
Louis right now doesn't even have a 

1172
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:40,050
twitter anymore that's wise.
Deleted his twitter.

1173
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,000
Well he sells out Madison Square Garden.
Yeah.

1174
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:44,100
What does he need a fucking 
disappointed.

1175
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:44,934
I was one of these schmucks who bought a
ticket to see him at Madison Square 

1176
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,973
Garden a couple of weeks and I'm now I'm
thinking I used to see him when he was 

1177
00:54:49,861 --> 00:54:52,420
at the seller like I used to.
I went at Austin,

1178
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:56,610
come aspen comedy festival and saw him 
with 50 people in the room.

1179
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:57,640
Why am I going to be sitting?
I,

1180
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,690
I'll feel like it's not going to be the 
same in the garden,

1181
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,933
but definitely not going to be the same 
because it's a different show different 

1182
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:07,210
day.
Yeah.

1183
00:55:07,211 --> 00:55:10,020
Well,
so what you wanted to see the stadium so

1184
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:11,790
you could see him at the comedy store in
here all the time.

1185
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,920
Can you just come over to my place and 
do it in my living room?

1186
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,230
Shit.
Just got weird real.

1187
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,970
He's crying.
You're inviting them over here.

1188
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,813
I'm crying.
I'm going to be on virtual reality 

1189
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:21,270
watching porn and he's going to be doing
a bit.

1190
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,610
Yeah man.
It's going to be different.

1191
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,950
He's doing a big gigantic show and he's,
you know,

1192
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,570
making a lot more money doing it that 
way.

1193
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,183
Yeah.
Well he apparently emptied out his bank 

1194
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:33,730
account to create that horror series.
No.

1195
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,460
Horace.
And Pete was the animated series.

1196
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:37,320
That's not unlimited.
No,

1197
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,290
Harrison paid is a.
is like a,

1198
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:44,330
an old school kind of multicam no studio
audience.

1199
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,640
I never watched it.
Somebody told me it was animated.

1200
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,040
Who said call me fucking assume they 
were right.

1201
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,140
I thought it was anime.
No it's not.

1202
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,690
Oh Wow.
It has a drawing as it's icon.

1203
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,540
Oh,
that's what it is.

1204
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,110
Oh,
so what is,

1205
00:55:59,111 --> 00:56:03,560
is it good?
It is innovative in a way that only a,

1206
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,510
an altar like Louis would have the balls
to pull off.

1207
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,970
Is that a tactful way of dodging the 
question?

1208
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,720
So I don't get it.
I'm just kidding the first.

1209
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,270
So He's,
he fucks with you.

1210
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,104
Right.
Remember his original Louie Lucky Louie 

1211
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,410
on Hbo,
like that was done to,

1212
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,190
to sort of look like the and like with 
bad

1213
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,230
sets that Kinda shook and like,
you know,

1214
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,093
bad studio audience was like a very sort
of 19 sixties Sitcom feel and everyone 

1215
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,790
criticized it because they're like,
oh that production values are terrible.

1216
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,870
And he's like,
well yeah,

1217
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:37,030
we fucking know that.
It's not like hbo doesn't have the money

1218
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,530
to get a good set.
If we wanted a good set,

1219
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,330
it's supposed to look like an old 
sitcom,

1220
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,680
but it's a very sort of metta like fuck 
you concept.

1221
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:45,903
And in a similar way,
what he's done here is he's basically 

1222
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:50,320
done a,
a dramatic,

1223
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,453
sort of almost 19 seventies English 
style play that is shot with no studio 

1224
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,030
audience with very,
very,

1225
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:06,031
very long scenes and long takes that's 
very dark and a bit whimsical and funny.

1226
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,193
But I've,
I only got through a few episodes and 

1227
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:11,140
then it,
although I respected it,

1228
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,880
it just wasn't a way that I want to 
spend my evening,

1229
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:13,870
if that makes sense.
Yeah,

1230
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:14,620
that does make sense.

1231
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,000
You mean it's a,
it's a piece of art.

1232
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,270
You're creating something.
Yeah.

1233
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,243
Yeah.
And also when you're creating something 

1234
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,644
like,
especially when it comes to like a 

1235
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:21,844
sitcom or something along those lines,
it takes a long time for it to find its 

1236
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:28,840
legs for you to figure out like what the
characters are all about and what,

1237
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,820
how,
how the scenes are going to play out.

1238
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,930
Every Sitcom that I've ever seen or the 
ones that I've been a part of,

1239
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,580
they take many,
many,

1240
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:40,310
many episodes to create.
Like to figure out what,

1241
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,670
what it actually is.
And then along the way,

1242
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:45,790
like you have to have someone who 
believes in it and they're financing it,

1243
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,430
funding it,
and he loved him,

1244
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,290
did all that shit on his own,
but he emptied out his fucking

1245
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,690
and he's already made it back.
So now everything from now,

1246
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:54,663
now he hasn't made any sales of it,
so he's made it all back just from 

1247
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:57,544
Internet sales according to him.
And then so whatever sale he ends up 

1248
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,680
making,
if he sells it Netflix or whatever,

1249
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:04,540
he's apparently waiting for the emmy's 
because he wants to.

1250
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:07,750
He's hoping we'll get some of then will 
be in a stronger negotiating position.

1251
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,880
But all of that will be profit.
One hundred percent profit.

1252
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,190
That's interesting.
So he did make the money back,

1253
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:14,740
so he complained about it and then after
he complained about it,

1254
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,574
he made more

1255
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:16,663
complaining about it.
Thing was he claims that was just a 

1256
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,650
bullshit and media spin.
He was on Howard I think.

1257
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:22,560
I think it was on Howard stern show us.
No,

1258
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,061
no,
no.

1259
00:58:23,061 --> 00:58:24,290
He didn't lie.
What he was saying,

1260
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,303
his point is that he was saying that he 
spent all of his money and he was like 

1261
00:58:27,981 --> 00:58:29,560
joking about how like,
you know,

1262
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:32,450
I spent all my money on this thing and I
have no idea if it's gonna work and then

1263
00:58:32,451 --> 00:58:37,451
some fucking clickbait media outlet was 
like Louis ck broke off to,

1264
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,650
you know,
losing all of his money on the show.

1265
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,191
He was like,
no,

1266
00:58:40,191 --> 00:58:42,020
I never expected to get my money back 
immediately.

1267
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,973
This is an experiment.
I put my money and it's an investment 

1268
00:58:44,451 --> 00:58:46,550
and now like it's paid off.

1269
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:47,483
That was all the money that he had and 
he was just doing that and then he had 

1270
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:50,454
to go on tour.
I mean that was part of what you're 

1271
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:52,074
saying,
that he's going on tour for more money 

1272
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,600
because he had emptied his bank account.

1273
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,133
Okay.
But that's different from losing you 

1274
00:58:56,761 --> 00:58:57,594
money.
He invested his money in this thing and 

1275
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:03,300
now and while he was waiting for it to 
pay for it to pay itself off them,

1276
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,540
a bunch of news articles came out about 
how he had no money.

1277
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:06,680
Well,
that's what people want to hear.

1278
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:07,514
They don't want to hear what a wonderful
investment in data and create creative 

1279
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:14,960
venture that was profitable,
wants to hear that he's a loser now.

1280
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,920
Sucking dicks for homemade one

1281
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,790
people are people are gross where they 
want to hear about failure.

1282
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,900
Hearing about a guy that has a,
you know,

1283
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:32,750
a reasonable sort of a risk and it pays 
off.

1284
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,450
It's not a great story is already 
successful.

1285
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,220
It's not.
Nobody wants to hear that.

1286
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,990
Why are we like that,
Joe?

1287
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,900
Why do we want to see accidents?
If you want to see,

1288
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,740
do you want to see someone to fly by on 
a motorcycle?

1289
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,380
You don't want to see some fly by 
another guy.

1290
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,280
Changes lanes in that car goes changes 
lanes,

1291
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,580
but I want to say blood and at least see
implying

1292
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,270
can vw beetle on the highway on the way 
here,

1293
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:57,523
charred,
burned to a crisp on the side of the 

1294
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:01,640
road with the cops around it.
Whoa.

1295
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,080
Is that a thing in Los Angeles

1296
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,160
so that shouldn't be aware of.
Is that for insurance or something or is

1297
01:00:06,161 --> 01:00:08,160
it a massive accident?
Could have been anything.

1298
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,060
We could have just been a fire,
you know,

1299
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,193
how does it can catch fire,
but didn't vw go through some weird 

1300
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,700
fucking shit where they were lying 
about,

1301
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:16,534
uh,
the diesel.

1302
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:21,700
But this was,
this was a beetle from the new ones.

1303
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:21,921
No,
no,

1304
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:22,754
no,
not the ones with the little fake 

1305
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:25,000
daisies in the.
Probably caught on fire.

1306
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:30,070
Those are shipped boxes that Joe,
thanks for listening everybody.

1307
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:32,140
That's a show.
We solved it.

1308
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,440
It's like CSI VW beetle.
Joe Joe fixed it up.

1309
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:38,560
It was on fire.
No,

1310
01:00:38,561 --> 01:00:41,830
it was definitely on fire in a car that 
accidentally caught on fire.

1311
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,933
Actually,
I have,

1312
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,960
now that you mentioned it.
Yeah,

1313
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:44,970
when I was a kid,
we,

1314
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:45,804
uh,
we were staying in the UK and we were 

1315
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:50,880
driving a friend's Jaguar,
Jaguar,

1316
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,010
Jaguar,
Jaguar,

1317
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,370
and uh,
it was one of the,

1318
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,440
it was incredibly expensive.
This guy's a multi multimillionaire,

1319
01:00:58,441 --> 01:01:01,140
big star in the UK.
And so we are driving.

1320
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:01,993
He lends it to us for a weekend while 
we're there and it's the 19 sixties 

1321
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,294
vintage thing.
And we go out and drive through the 

1322
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:12,120
countryside and the car catches on fire.
Oh No.

1323
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,013
So my parents had to pay to restore this
vintage Jaguar and the minute they 

1324
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,760
didn't accept responsible for this piece
of shit catching on fire,

1325
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:27,630
he lent it to us.
Actually it was more than a weekend.

1326
01:01:27,631 --> 01:01:29,820
He was letting us use it because he was 
out of the country.

1327
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:31,320
I think we were staying there for a 
couple of weeks.

1328
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,660
He was letting us use this place,
letting us drive his car.

1329
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,240
It's kind of a deal,
you know,

1330
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:35,770
we're not gonna

1331
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,900
yeah,
but whatever.

1332
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:42,140
A car does not catch on fire does.
If it's a 19 sixties vintage Jaguar,

1333
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,840
but it doesn't catch on fire because of 
your fault.

1334
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:49,520
No sunfire because it's a piece of shit.
You a piece of shit.

1335
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:52,460
He knew it was a piece of shit because 
it's in 1960 car.

1336
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,473
You're driving it around and it acted 
like a piece of shit and caught on fire 

1337
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:57,800
and then he wants you to pay.
I would have been like,

1338
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:00,140
fuck you buddy.
How about you get your wires checked and

1339
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:03,140
I sue you for almost killing me.
He didn't have your car.

1340
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,530
He didn't want us to pay.
How much was it that I don't remember?

1341
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:08,110
I was a child,
a little child,

1342
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,350
probably a lot of them.
About 12.

1343
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,213
It was a lot.
I remember my parents feeling like it 

1344
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:12,314
was a lot of money and it goes because 
like smoke just started pouring out of 

1345
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:16,490
the bag

1346
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,880
because it didn't even have a fucking 
fire extinguisher.

1347
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,600
No fucking shitbox.
Goddammit.

1348
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,230
I'm mad.
I'm mad now.

1349
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,173
British engineering excellence.
He was a wealthy guy that's got very 

1350
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:28,711
wealthy.
Well,

1351
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,290
he's a piece of shit.
Your parents weren't rich and expensive.

1352
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,960
Car parents weren't rich.
They were not rich.

1353
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,970
Then he made them pay.
He didn't make them pay.

1354
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:39,450
They refused to accept his offer.
Have to reimburse them.

1355
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,200
Oh,
so they.

1356
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,320
They.
If they insisted on paying.

1357
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,233
Yeah,
he should've bought them something with 

1358
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,430
that money.
He probably did,

1359
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,813
but my parents are nice.
People just stopped going to take money 

1360
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,540
from a friend of his.
Yeah,

1361
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,210
but it's,
it's.

1362
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,810
That's tricky man.
First of all,

1363
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,500
what a wonderful guy for letting you 
borrow this 19,

1364
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,270
60 something job.
Those old jaguars are so bad ass.

1365
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:05,760
Look,
and to have that long front knows God.

1366
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:07,710
What a fucking know this was even 
before.

1367
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,100
So I'm trying to think of what model 
that is with a very,

1368
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:11,934
very long nose.
This is the one before that which was 

1369
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:14,544
around,
uh,

1370
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,310
around a kind of shape from memory.
Pull it up,

1371
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:18,420
Jeremy.
Come of what it is.

1372
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:18,841
What,
what,

1373
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:23,760
what was the shape of jags and the light
in the late sixties was talk about a gas

1374
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:24,660
guzzler.
I mean,

1375
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:26,250
you know,
it's an fi 12,

1376
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:26,941
wasn't it?
Yeah,

1377
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:28,230
it'd be a V.
I'm not even sure.

1378
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,840
It might've been an in line eight.
Would that make sense?

1379
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,930
Could have been of a 12.
I'm making things up.

1380
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,670
I don't know anything about old jugs.
Yeah,

1381
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,860
I said it was.
I mean it was,

1382
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,570
it was certainly eight or 12.
It was not,

1383
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,990
it was not nothing expensive at it.
Yeah.

1384
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:47,850
It was one of those 19 sixties Jaguar.
MK Two.

1385
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,320
What?
A pretty car.

1386
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,363
Incredible.
It was a kind of car were when you 

1387
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:52,734
stopped at the lights,
people would wind down the windows and 

1388
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:58,320
we might see the one next to it is the 
one I was thinking of.

1389
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,880
The red one.
What is that one?

1390
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,430
It's like a James Bond style that's so 
dope.

1391
01:04:02,431 --> 01:04:07,020
I love on type II type 19 sixties type.
Those are so pretty.

1392
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,033
You know,
they make those now with modern 

1393
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:11,330
underpinnings.
You can buy one of those.

1394
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:12,210
These companies,
they,

1395
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,093
they take an old Jaguar e type,
but they put a completely modern 

1396
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:17,634
suspension and brakes and modern engine.
And so you look like you're driving a 

1397
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:23,790
car.
Were you driving this?

1398
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,770
That's a real new thing that they're 
doing.

1399
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:27,570
It's called Resto Mod.
That's great.

1400
01:04:27,571 --> 01:04:28,830
Super Common.
I have a 19,

1401
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,630
65 corvette like that.
Really?

1402
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,100
Yeah.
I love five.

1403
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,890
What's the 60?
Can you show me a 16?

1404
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,810
This is a picture of my mind.
So I did a video with Jay Leno.

1405
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,600
We did Jay Leno's garage around.
Yup.

1406
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,220
Yep.
I'll check that episode out.

1407
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,083
Yeah,
that'd be great.

1408
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,940
Um,
I heard him on your show as well.

1409
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,740
You had him on my car.
Oh,

1410
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:51,360
that's great.
I love those.

1411
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,620
That's got a state.
How many cars have you got?

1412
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:57,160
I've got a few.
You don't want to say that's a night on.

1413
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,680
I've done a lose the,
the common man.

1414
01:04:58,681 --> 01:04:59,820
Touch,
I'm definitely not,

1415
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,170
well,
I've lost it over,

1416
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,600
but that,
uh,

1417
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:08,750
that has a 500 horsepower ls,
one supercharged engine under the,

1418
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:14,580
under the hood and it only weighs like,
it's probably less than 3000 pounds,

1419
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:15,414
especially because it's a convertible.
At what point during this did jay come 

1420
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:19,780
in his pants immediately?
Yeah,

1421
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,930
we had to change pants for Tai Chi is an
animal,

1422
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,480
but it's um.
Oh,

1423
01:05:25,481 --> 01:05:27,140
speaking of coming in.
Oh No,

1424
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:28,800
I'm not even going to go there.
I'll tell.

1425
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,520
I'll talk to you about it after the,
after the podcast,

1426
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,013
you know,
when the filter between your brain and 

1427
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,000
your mouth is no more flood gate come on
nights.

1428
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:41,830
It's just something personal in my life.
I'm talking about your call.

1429
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,760
And so,
uh,

1430
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,430
I just want to come back to that cord 
segway.

1431
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,393
How do we go from.
The problem is the problem is that the 

1432
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,850
thing is so much less interesting than 
whatever is in everybody's brain.

1433
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:57,970
So dear listener,
I understand he is a,

1434
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,380
here's a piece of advice,
whatever,

1435
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:01,480
whatever you are thinking about right 
now.

1436
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:02,763
When you heard me talk about a coming 
that is more interesting than the 

1437
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:09,670
reality of the story that I was going to
tell you.

1438
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,110
Oh,
so just hang onto that.

1439
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,540
Listen folks,
whatever he tells me after the show,

1440
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:15,010
next podcast,
I'll tell you,

1441
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:21,100
I will break our bond of trust.
I will violate violator practicing.

1442
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,780
No,
it basically had to do.

1443
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:23,710
I'll tell,
I'll tell you that.

1444
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,720
I'll tell you the skeleton of the,
of the story,

1445
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:29,120
which is that there's a medical 
procedure that I am a,

1446
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,510
a part of at the moment,
which a,

1447
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,510
which requires me to potentially a.

1448
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:36,670
it's an ivf related thing,
right?

1449
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,610
So I had a meeting earlier this week and
ivf,

1450
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:43,170
in vitro vitro fertilization trying to 
make a baby and yes,

1451
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,280
conceivably make a baby.
So,

1452
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:46,390
uh,
so,

1453
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:47,283
uh,
it didn't say with my baby and has to 

1454
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,630
robot baby ignorance,
right?

1455
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:50,464
A super fucking superhuman.
I'm basically trying to create like 

1456
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:55,510
doll.
It'll be like the movie twins,

1457
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,423
you know,
creating the ultimate superhuman 

1458
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,830
machine.
But,

1459
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:01,690
uh,
I had a meeting at 11:00

1460
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:05,200
AM on the same morning that I had to 
donate my sperm sample.

1461
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:06,300
Uh,
this,

1462
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,570
this week,
a few days ago,

1463
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,710
and so I'm in the meeting and like,
it's not going that well.

1464
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:12,663
I'm not really feeling it.
So then I was like jerking off right 

1465
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:16,480
now.
No,

1466
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,313
I literally,
I literally said to them these really 

1467
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,860
these important entertainment type.
So I was like,

1468
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:24,040
guys,
I gotta I gotta be blunt.

1469
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,950
Early this morning I came into a bucket 
and created a human.

1470
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,890
What the fuck did you do before 11?
I got bored with the conversation.

1471
01:07:32,891 --> 01:07:34,300
I'm out of here.
Just pull it up.

1472
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:37,230
You were doing huff post live.
Why did you stop doing that?

1473
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:39,640
The whole thing basically gradually 
imploded.

1474
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:41,243
I got out founding editor of the 
Huffington post who sort of helped 

1475
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:44,944
create it with Ariana had been fired 
slash supposedly resigned in November 

1476
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:54,790
and now Arianna was fired slash 
supposedly resigned.

1477
01:07:55,290 --> 01:08:00,290
What last week or two weeks ago?
Fire the Huffington Post.

1478
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:03,970
So happens you ask other people for 
money.

1479
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:05,620
Yeah,
basically.

1480
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:10,210
So she.
So huffpost was bought by AOL in 2011.

1481
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,280
Wait a minute.
AOL has money.

1482
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,990
Yeah.
Well basically I will,

1483
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,010
I will actually does have

1484
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,780
money because they have some,
they get money.

1485
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,820
It's really funny.
Two ways.

1486
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:20,863
One is they've got some proprietary add 
software which is helpful for websites 

1487
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,083
and the second is a lot of people in 
America still unknowingly pay for 

1488
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:33,200
AOL.com
because back when they used to sell you,

1489
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,660
well they don't know that they don't 
have to anymore.

1490
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:37,820
Like when they were in,
like in the nineties,

1491
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:40,430
they would send out cds.
Apparently I wasn't here then,

1492
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:44,990
but the iol was the place where 
Americans got online and so those.

1493
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:49,100
Here we go,
two point 1 million CNN money to lose.

1494
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:53,780
I will dial up and they pay.
They pay for that.

1495
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,790
Scroll that down.
I want to read that.

1496
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,463
Oh my God.
Seventy percent of Americans are 

1497
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:01,610
connected to the Internet over much 
faster broadband,

1498
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:03,710
the average us broadband speed,
blah blah blah,

1499
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:04,220
blah,
blah.

1500
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:09,200
200 times faster than the 56 k per 
second dial up even smartphones and more

1501
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:10,760
than 100 times faster than that.

1502
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,733
Yeah,
so the average AOL dial up user is 

1503
01:09:13,091 --> 01:09:15,040
paying 20 bucks a month.
Whoa.

1504
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:16,500
20 bucks.
And managing pain,

1505
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,760
John Upstate should pay you for 
dialogue.

1506
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:20,523
So what is this?
People that just live in like really 

1507
01:09:22,001 --> 01:09:25,960
super rural.
They probably can't get it yet or we can

1508
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,010
get better.
That's right.

1509
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,320
Or they're just old Hicks and they don't
know better.

1510
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,080
That's amazing.
So she.

1511
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:35,740
So aol basically.
I mean they say that iol bought happened

1512
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,603
in post,
but really it was Ariana essentially 

1513
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:39,334
becoming a senior manager of aol or 
whatever her title was at aol because 

1514
01:09:43,991 --> 01:09:46,060
iol had no future and they were like,
oh,

1515
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:48,190
huff post is cool with the kids,
so let's have,

1516
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,143
let's get in on some of that action.
Then last year if a rise and bought AOL 

1517
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,390
and in part of that whole shake up the,
you know,

1518
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,550
she got ousted.
I mean,

1519
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,473
let's be frank.
She is eccentric and has her own hobby 

1520
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:07,050
horses like her.
I mean she spends a lot of her time

1521
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,510
boyfriends helping host a thing in 
America.

1522
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:13,820
Is it that term?
If I was an old rich lady,

1523
01:10:13,821 --> 01:10:18,080
I'd have some hobby horses though.
Dudes that need money for the gym.

1524
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,430
Sure.
No,

1525
01:10:19,431 --> 01:10:23,240
I'm not implying that duds.
And given Viagara and send them over.

1526
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,310
Do you want to fucking Jaguar?
Boy,

1527
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,223
get it hard.

1528
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,660
Uh,
not a boy toy.

1529
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:30,543
A hobby.
Horses is a hobby that is a personal 

1530
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:36,040
interest that you spend way too much 
time on instead of.

1531
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,360
Yeah,
I mean it might be.

1532
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:41,020
It's probably in Australia and she 
spends,

1533
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:41,913
in other words,
she spends a lot of time going around 

1534
01:10:42,461 --> 01:10:44,410
the world giving speeches about why you 
should get more sleep.

1535
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:47,140
Really.
She's begun to sleep.

1536
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,660
That's it.
We read a whole book about it.

1537
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,270
How much sleep do you need?
She read a whole book.

1538
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:53,470
Really?
Yup.

1539
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:54,131
And it.
All it is,

1540
01:10:54,131 --> 01:10:54,964
is one of those books where you 
basically know in the first page what 

1541
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:58,024
the whole book is going to be with them 
and just pat out the remaining hundred 

1542
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:00,820
80 pages.
That's one of those,

1543
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,043
Huh?

1544
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,210
And it's just about how much you need to
recover or get enough sleep.

1545
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,840
I think Dan shine it is the sleep 
revolution live.

1546
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,430
Listen,
you're rich

1547
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,920
lady.
Most people aren't rich.

1548
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:18,930
They can't fucking sleep all time.
Bitch.

1549
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,853
The sleep revolution.
How many fucking people I know that are 

1550
01:11:25,451 --> 01:11:27,790
participating in that revolution 
unknowingly,

1551
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:32,380
comics,
comics,

1552
01:11:32,381 --> 01:11:34,590
while fucking call them before noon.
They believed,

1553
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:35,550
dude,
why'd you call?

1554
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:36,640
Totally.
Yeah.

1555
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:38,650
I mean I,
if it were up to me,

1556
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:40,900
I would stay up very late and get up 
pretty late as well.

1557
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,870
I mean some people are just like that.
I felt bad about it and then I found out

1558
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,520
that Sam Harris and Tim Ferris do it as 
well.

1559
01:11:45,521 --> 01:11:46,271
So fuck,
fuck.

1560
01:11:46,271 --> 01:11:48,250
They stay up late and go to bed and get 
up late.

1561
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,300
Yeah.
Well,

1562
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:51,640
um,
I'll get my best work done late at night

1563
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:55,370
when everyone's asleep and I almost,
I almost feel like

1564
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,210
it sounds so woo,
but this is what I believe.

1565
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,060
Uh,
I believe there's a different feeling to

1566
01:12:01,061 --> 01:12:02,920
the air at like two,
3:00

1567
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:03,754
in the morning because almost everyone 
is asleep and I feel like there's less 

1568
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:09,580
signal.
I think you get something from people.

1569
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,970
I think if there's an intangible quality
that people exude,

1570
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,440
that people expressed that they 
broadcast and when you're around them,

1571
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,513
that's why certain people have bad 
energy and certain people have good 

1572
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:22,870
energy and some people are warm,
some people are weird.

1573
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,820
I think there's a thing that we don't 
know how to quantify and that it's about

1574
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:32,821
people and I think that is entirely 
possible if there's a hum of a city,

1575
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,260
like a,
uh,

1576
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,093
like a literally a,
a feeling that you get when a bunch of 

1577
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:39,754
people are thinking and awake and 
conscious and you get a different 

1578
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:43,983
expression when those people are asleep.
And so I know that when I'm writing at 

1579
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:48,491
two,
3:00

1580
01:12:48,491 --> 01:12:50,230
in the morning,
which is when I do my best work,

1581
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:55,650
everybody else's conked out.
So I feel like I have more clarity.

1582
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,540
I feel like I have more peace and I can 
write better,

1583
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:02,860
might be total bullshit,
but there might be something to it.

1584
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,571
You're right.
That is.

1585
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:06,250
We were totally right.

1586
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,220
It's possible.
It's also possible that there are visual

1587
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,440
and auditory cues that just make it 
feel,

1588
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:15,870
make you feel like here in a special 
place,

1589
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:16,710
right?
It's dark.

1590
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,060
There's no.
There's no one moving.

1591
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,430
There's no one making noises.
Here's another reason why I might

1592
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,360
be interested in believing that.
Not what you're saying,

1593
01:13:24,361 --> 01:13:26,850
but what I'm saying this because when I 
go on these camping trips,

1594
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,980
hunting trips where no cell phone 
service,

1595
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:32,130
there's a very different feeling to the 
world when there's no service.

1596
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:34,320
You feel different like do you feel

1597
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,160
wait when your cell phone has no 
service,

1598
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,170
no cell phone,
no Internet,

1599
01:13:38,171 --> 01:13:41,230
no signals,
there's no nothing that would the.

1600
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,123
How would the thinking hum of a human 
mind get transmitted through to your 

1601
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:46,330
phone?

1602
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:47,163
Not to your phone.
I'm not saying it gets transmitted to 

1603
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:52,450
your phone.
I'm thinking that there are signals that

1604
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,000
you are receiving all the time.
Like in this room,

1605
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:57,290
we have wifi there,
cell phone,

1606
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,333
there's radio,
there's a lot of shit in the air and 

1607
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,960
there's just all of those waves somehow 
resonate.

1608
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,120
You can send them.
I don't know if you can,

1609
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:07,220
but I know my computer can and I know my
phone,

1610
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,770
but do you think you can sense the 
mental states of human beings?

1611
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:11,980
Which is

1612
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,813
what I thought you were saying

1613
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,653
it was what I was saying,
but I'm thinking that there's more than 

1614
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:16,594
one kind of signal that is being 
expressed not just by people but by 

1615
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,860
society in general.
The hum of the city,

1616
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:25,100
the buzz,
the like,

1617
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:25,963
you know,
that feeling that you get of New York 

1618
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,390
City,
like it's a lie.

1619
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,283
Yes,
absolutely.

1620
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,123
You know,
I wonder if that's not because you're 

1621
01:14:31,811 --> 01:14:36,811
dealing with 7 million people stuffed 
into this little tiny areas.

1622
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,700
Yeah,
definitely.

1623
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:41,460
It's definitely that.
The question is what is the transmission

1624
01:14:41,461 --> 01:14:44,850
mechanism by which that presence makes 
itself known?

1625
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:45,660
I mean,
one of.

1626
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,493
I totally know what you mean about 
campaign because one of the most 

1627
01:14:49,201 --> 01:14:54,201
beautiful places that I could ever be is
in the outback at night.

1628
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,870
Nothing around for miles.
I love desserts.

1629
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,490
I love,
you know,

1630
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:03,480
I drove through Nevada once and I've 
done a couple of trips around Australia,

1631
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,823
right?
Deep into the middle of nowhere and 

1632
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:11,121
there's just something so I mean for 
start the blazing sky of stars so bright

1633
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:14,243
that if anyone hasn't seen them,
you would not believe that this guy 

1634
01:15:16,171 --> 01:15:21,150
could be that bright and then the Shia 
scientists silence so silent.

1635
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:23,670
It's just.
It's almost a noise in itself.

1636
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,240
It's almost a deafening noise in the.
In the absence of noise.

1637
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,230
It's not just a silence.
No,

1638
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:33,120
I feel like it's an absence of signal.
It's a silence and an absence of signal.

1639
01:15:33,121 --> 01:15:36,240
I think we've become accustomed to the 
signal of a city,

1640
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:40,290
the signal of all the people and all the
things that are being broadcasted around

1641
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:41,124
us and all the waves and all the 
different shit that we're we're 

1642
01:15:43,951 --> 01:15:47,370
experiencing unknowingly might be 
bullshit,

1643
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,500
but it might.
I mean there's.

1644
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,970
There's people that are concerned with 
Wifi.

1645
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,133
They're concerned with Wifi because 
there's not a long history of us using 

1646
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:55,884
Wifi or even sell cellular signals.
We know for a fact that they interfere 

1647
01:15:59,581 --> 01:16:01,140
with bees.
Bees,

1648
01:16:01,141 --> 01:16:04,560
a form of communication.
It gets interfered with by Cell Towers,

1649
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:07,650
cell towers and cell phone signals in 
general,

1650
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:11,190
and that all these signals that are 
flying through the air that are reaching

1651
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,080
your and my phones and everyone else's 
phones,

1652
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:17,640
so the bees are actually taking these 
things into just imagine the world where

1653
01:16:17,641 --> 01:16:20,730
bees before the 19 nineties,
they're like hanging out,

1654
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:24,060
having a great time,
but communicating with each other,

1655
01:16:24,061 --> 01:16:26,140
but those businesses and then all of a 
sudden they're here,

1656
01:16:26,141 --> 01:16:30,150
a Jackhammer in the background.
Like what the fuck is that?

1657
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,060
Well,
the,

1658
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:31,893
I think this,
they think that Sona is one explanation 

1659
01:16:34,081 --> 01:16:38,240
for why wiles beach themselves and why 
so many migratory patterns underwater as

1660
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,223
fucked up as well.
Have you heard that theory doesn't make 

1661
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:41,760
sense.
You know,

1662
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,120
the,
the,

1663
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,950
the military and the,
um,

1664
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:46,690
the US military does all kinds of,
uh,

1665
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,510
I don't even,
I can't remember the name of it,

1666
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,600
but long distance sona so that,
you know,

1667
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,320
really,
really reaching out.

1668
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:54,900
Part of the spying system I think is,
is,

1669
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:56,940
it might not be sonar maybe,
but anyway,

1670
01:16:56,941 --> 01:16:59,990
the gist of this is correct.
Even if the details are not that they,

1671
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,900
they basically blanket,
you know,

1672
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,143
hundreds or thousands of miles of ocean 
in these things that we can't hear that 

1673
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:08,810
we thought had no impact on anything but
they can,

1674
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:11,060
but you can notice behavioral changes 
in,

1675
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:11,983
in Wiles,
just vast distances away from these 

1676
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:16,280
submarines that are conducting these 
things.

1677
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,293
So it's entirely conceivable that with 
bees and other animals are tuned into 

1678
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:21,584
things that were not tuned into.
I mean the thing I love about getting 

1679
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:28,970
away from all that is like the first 
day.

1680
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,700
I don't know if you find this,
but I find that the first day,

1681
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,013
the absence of all of that can seem a 
little bit irritating in some way or a 

1682
01:17:35,721 --> 01:17:38,660
little bit.
Like there's nothing to do.

1683
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,600
Like I feel sort of fidgety when I first
go to the desert.

1684
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,470
That's why you got to go hunting,
but.

1685
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,573
Well yeah,
that'd be great to have a very primal 

1686
01:17:46,831 --> 01:17:48,070
task in front of you show up.

1687
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,500
But I mean after three,
four,

1688
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,343
five days,
then you use your pace just slows down 

1689
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:55,484
into.
It almost makes me feel some kind of 

1690
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:57,584
kinship to aborigines or something.
I like people who are a lot more 

1691
01:18:00,381 --> 01:18:03,220
connected to land and New York City,
uh,

1692
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:06,620
and you get into it just a different 
sort of headspace,

1693
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:11,030
different relationship to the earth and 
the soil and the sky and all that.

1694
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:12,260
I mean,
it sounds very hippy dippy,

1695
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:13,940
but you can definitely feel it when 
you're there.

1696
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,630
Yeah.
It does sound Hippie Dippie,

1697
01:18:15,631 --> 01:18:16,464
but I think you're right,
there's something going on and I think 

1698
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:20,310
there's something going on that's 
natural.

1699
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,040
When you're,
you're,

1700
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,100
you're disconnected from all this 
unnatural stuff.

1701
01:18:23,101 --> 01:18:25,320
They're so attractive to us.
I mean,

1702
01:18:25,321 --> 01:18:26,154
the reason why you're seeing these 
people at dinner all touching their 

1703
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:31,320
phones and playing with their phones,
something is happening to them,

1704
01:18:31,321 --> 01:18:33,480
right?
There's some sort of compelling thing.

1705
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,520
It's not like they're that compelled to 
read,

1706
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:39,390
like have a diamond from them because if
you had books in front of these people,

1707
01:18:39,391 --> 01:18:40,224
would they be fucking with those books?
And same with the reading people's 

1708
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:42,390
tweets.
No,

1709
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:44,140
no.
They will focus

1710
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,190
and concentration.
This is the,

1711
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,063
this is the big thing.
This is where there's a book called the 

1712
01:18:49,331 --> 01:18:50,164
shallows by a can't remember.
I did a segment on this discovery 

1713
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:57,040
science channel show called based on his
google making a stupid,

1714
01:18:57,041 --> 01:18:58,470
which is,
do you know that book?

1715
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:00,610
There's a book,
is Google making us stupid?

1716
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:04,330
And there's this kind of ideological 
battle between these two guys.

1717
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:06,970
I come up with their names.
One of them is Nicholas,

1718
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,860
someone about the question of,
is all of this technological input,

1719
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:12,880
uh,
you know,

1720
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:13,714
making a smarter because we've got so 
much more data at our fingertips and 

1721
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:17,740
we're so much more nimble 
intellectually,

1722
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:22,150
or is it making us more stupid because 
we're more reliant on outside sources of

1723
01:19:22,151 --> 01:19:23,800
data.
We don't have to remember things anymore

1724
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:24,634
and we're constantly skipping across the
surface of information instead of 

1725
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:27,820
digging down into it.

1726
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,970
And I think it's an interesting question
about you say,

1727
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:32,980
would those people be reading books will
know?

1728
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:37,030
And do they even read as many books as 
they would have if you know,

1729
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:38,103
if they'd lived 100 years ago?
Because an argument can be made that 

1730
01:19:41,921 --> 01:19:44,020
were really good these days at 
multitasking.

1731
01:19:44,021 --> 01:19:46,810
We're really good at jumping from 
facebook to twitter to the next thing to

1732
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:47,680
do.
I'm writing something,

1733
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:50,470
but then a little egg email pops up and 
then a text message comes through,

1734
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:52,810
so I'm constantly distracted and 
constantly busy,

1735
01:19:52,811 --> 01:19:56,620
but there's that old line of a company 
who said it,

1736
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,680
yes,
you're busy and a busy,

1737
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:01,500
but what's the point?
Right?

1738
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,580
Like what are you up to?
What are you doing?

1739
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:05,770
What are you being productive and being 
efficient?

1740
01:20:05,771 --> 01:20:07,710
Are you achieving anything that's really
important to you?

1741
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,903
Buisiness is is the scourge of modern 
life in a way because it gives you a 

1742
01:20:13,861 --> 01:20:17,490
fake way of feeling like you're doing 
something when you're actually,

1743
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,860
when you're actually not,
and the argument is,

1744
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:21,143
yeah,
we're better at juggling all this shit 

1745
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:24,210
than someone in the 18 hundreds would've
been would've been,

1746
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:29,640
but our way is capable of having the 
patience to read Dostoevsky.

1747
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:31,480
Could you read Moby Dick?
They don't like.

1748
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,333
Do people sit down and really devote 
themselves to a deep dive rather than 

1749
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:37,554
just an across the surface horizontal?
If you put that thing down for a little 

1750
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:43,480
bit,
you can buy my business.

1751
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,330
Does it disincline you to doing that?

1752
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:48,540
I think so.
I think something's going on and I think

1753
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:49,374
something's going on that we haven't 
quite recognized yet and I think one of 

1754
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:52,434
the things that's going on with cell 
phones is this as a step towards this 

1755
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:56,904
symbiotic relationship that we're going 
to have with computers and Internet and 

1756
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,943
communication and what we're talking 
about with virtual reality is a part of 

1757
01:21:04,351 --> 01:21:07,350
that and it's all becoming more and more
integrated,

1758
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,200
more and more invasive and more and more
prevalent.

1759
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,930
And I think what we're doing,
and I've said this time and time again,

1760
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:14,670
so forgive me if you've heard this 
before.

1761
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:15,923
Other people who are listening,
I think we are a caterpillar that is 

1762
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:23,220
giving birth to some sort of an 
electronic butterfly.

1763
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,820
I think we are going to become something
different and I think this is a step.

1764
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:27,654
I think we're building a cocoon.
We're building an electronic cocoon by 

1765
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:35,780
encompassing and engrossing ourselves in
these electronic aids,

1766
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,130
these things that were connecting to 
constantly all day.

1767
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:42,253
We are getting more and more attached 
them to the point where the other day I 

1768
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:49,370
left my phone in my house.
I drove down the street and panicked and

1769
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,950
how a you turn turn right back around.
How's this going to be?

1770
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,390
I was just kidding.
I was just going to go to the store real

1771
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:54,970
quick.
Yeah.

1772
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,220
I couldn't do without my phone.
I'm like,

1773
01:21:56,221 --> 01:21:57,054
fuck.
My phone turned around and that feeling 

1774
01:21:59,131 --> 01:22:00,750
is.
It's a weird feeling.

1775
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,613
It's a.
it's a strange feeling and I think that 

1776
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:03,954
that feeling is.
There's something I think is a natural 

1777
01:22:07,711 --> 01:22:08,544
thing that we're doing.
I think that as technology becomes more 

1778
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:12,384
and more innovative and it more and more
powerful and it can do more and more 

1779
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:17,694
things for you and connect you to more 
and more people and more and more 

1780
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:25,830
different and involving ways,
I think it's going to eventually lead to

1781
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:26,664
the next step and that next step is some
sort of an integration of it into your 

1782
01:22:30,811 --> 01:22:31,644
biology.

1783
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:32,863
I want to get to that in one second 
because I've said that to me before and 

1784
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:35,924
I think it's really interesting.
I'm on the question of leaving your 

1785
01:22:37,761 --> 01:22:40,940
phone at home and freaking out.
I mean another.

1786
01:22:40,941 --> 01:22:42,200
This comes back to the,
the,

1787
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:43,183
the anecdote that I was telling you 
earlier about the friend of a friend 

1788
01:22:45,231 --> 01:22:49,430
who's a comic who's gotten rid of his 
phone because I love podcasts.

1789
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:51,260
I listen to podcasts all the time,
love your show,

1790
01:22:51,261 --> 01:22:56,180
love a whole bunch of different of 
different shows and I will habitually be

1791
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:58,400
listening to a podcast while I'm 
brushing my teeth,

1792
01:22:58,401 --> 01:23:00,860
listening to a podcast while I'm driving
around,

1793
01:23:00,861 --> 01:23:01,341
you know,
whatever,

1794
01:23:01,341 --> 01:23:03,320
whatever it is.
And today,

1795
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:04,850
uh,
I was interviewing Andy Kindler,

1796
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,490
they comic for my podcast

1797
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:07,623
and he like literally he was downstairs 
at the hotel where I was staying and 

1798
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:14,763
just to go down and pick him up.
I had exited the room without my phone 

1799
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:22,030
to listen to a podcast.
I walked back into my room,

1800
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,990
open the podcast app on my phone,
put my earphones in,

1801
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:28,240
find the podcast that I was listening to
waste like 25 seconds,

1802
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:33,870
one minute task because heaven forbid I 
should go outside and get in an elevator

1803
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:37,960
and go down and meet Andy kindler 
without listening to what?

1804
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:39,123
Fifty five fucking seconds of the latest
radio lab episode that I have to listen 

1805
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:44,170
to.
How dumb am I?

1806
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:48,880
How distracted do I need to be by people
speaking in my ears or conscious?

1807
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:53,230
Be with myself for an elevator ride from
the seventh floor in your defense,

1808
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,093
how engaged are you in this wonderful 
podcast where you're gaining all this 

1809
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:59,320
knowledge and it's fascinating and 
intriguing?

1810
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,460
You don't want to let it go.
Thank you,

1811
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:01,790
Joe.
I feel better.

1812
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,470
How much do I owe you for this session?
Uh,

1813
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:07,990
so being a friend,
if we are,

1814
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:11,920
if we are building a cocoon,
then the butterfly,

1815
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,353
artificial intelligence.
And do we play a role because we become 

1816
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:19,030
it?
A Kurzweil will say,

1817
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:19,800
yeah.
So occurs.

1818
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,633
Kurzweil will say that the artificial,
until the whole question of artificial 

1819
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:27,160
intelligence is slightly a red herring 
because we will be become the artificial

1820
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:29,590
intelligence.
We will unify ourselves with machines in

1821
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:33,300
such a way that human intelligence,
that biological intelligence,

1822
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:35,710
artificial intelligence become 
essentially indistinguishable.

1823
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:39,370
I think it's possible that that's true.
I also think it's possible that we could

1824
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:40,450
have both.
We could.

1825
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:41,284
We could literally have artificial life 
forms that we've created along with us 

1826
01:24:44,561 --> 01:24:45,394
being inter connected with some sort of 
a computer that enhances our 

1827
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:53,200
intelligence that we carry with us 
everywhere or that as a part of our body

1828
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:57,460
and then it becomes something like 
Kurzweil's talked about these computers,

1829
01:24:57,461 --> 01:25:00,040
these nano computers that are as small 
as red blood cells,

1830
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:00,874
so they're going to inject into our 
bloodstream to find cancer and other 

1831
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:03,760
diseases and all these things.

1832
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,790
I think it is entirely possible that 
there's something like that.

1833
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:09,610
I was going to enhance intelligence and 
then you're going to have something that

1834
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:10,444
you can inject into your body and you're
going to be like Lucy from that scarlet 

1835
01:25:12,971 --> 01:25:13,804
Johannson moving.
It's not outside the realm of 

1836
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:16,564
possibility that both things can happen 
at the same time that you could have a 

1837
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:21,183
literal artificial intelligence,
something that is created by a person 

1838
01:25:25,241 --> 01:25:27,780
that can think and talk.
Did you see x Mokena?

1839
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,720
Yes.
Loved it.

1840
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:31,330
Actually interviewed both of the,
uh,

1841
01:25:31,331 --> 01:25:34,660
the actives and also the writer,
the writer of that,

1842
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:35,494
Alex,
uh,

1843
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:36,963
I forget his name,
but very interesting guy grappling with 

1844
01:25:38,951 --> 01:25:41,080
a lot of these big issues.
I mean,

1845
01:25:41,081 --> 01:25:44,230
he's genuinely motivated by and 
interested in the whole question of what

1846
01:25:44,231 --> 01:25:46,230
it means to be conscious and self aware.
Yeah.

1847
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:47,530
Amazing.
Amazing movie,

1848
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:48,880
but that,
that,

1849
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:50,830
that's possible too.
That kind of thing.

1850
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:53,980
Where are you going to make a fake human
and you know,

1851
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:54,814
it,
it could be confined like they were in 

1852
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:57,394
some sort of a way where it didn't have 
the option to access the worldwide web 

1853
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,100
and nor did it have the option to 
exponentially

1854
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,933
increase its own abilities.
Because that's one of the things that 

1855
01:26:06,981 --> 01:26:07,814
all of these people sort of agree with 
is that the launch of artificial 

1856
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:14,060
intelligence is not simply going to be,
oh my God,

1857
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:16,520
we have an artificial intelligent thing 
here now,

1858
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:17,503
but it's going to be that this 
artificial intelligence is going to be 

1859
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,833
infinitely smarter than us,
almost instantaneously because it's 

1860
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:24,440
going to innovate on itself.

1861
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:25,240
That's right.
Yeah.

1862
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,170
So yeah,
I mean,

1863
01:26:26,171 --> 01:26:29,320
I've heard Sam talk about this as well,
but I mean 10,000,

1864
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:30,813
10,000
years precisely in a minute or 

1865
01:26:32,861 --> 01:26:33,580
something.
Yeah,

1866
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,530
so it's.
It's amazing.

1867
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,110
So when you,
when you say something to me,

1868
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,183
my brain is operating at presumably 
roughly the same speed that your brain 

1869
01:26:42,011 --> 01:26:42,844
is operating and neither of us were 
inebriated and other of us are 

1870
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:45,134
incredibly tired.
So presumably the experience of the 

1871
01:26:46,691 --> 01:26:50,320
passage of time of this conversation for
us is roughly one to one.

1872
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:51,183
Maybe slightly off.
Imagine if every single thing that you 

1873
01:26:54,191 --> 01:26:55,024
said I had the experience of basically 
waiting for several years to figure out 

1874
01:27:01,241 --> 01:27:04,780
the perfect way to answer that and then 
they're not going to answer it.

1875
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,710
That the artificial intelligence is 
going to be so far ahead of that because

1876
01:27:08,711 --> 01:27:11,060
we're telling me I'm the official 
intelligence right now,

1877
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:13,023
and so I've just been sitting here 
wondering what is the best possible 

1878
01:27:15,251 --> 01:27:15,970
response?

1879
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:16,803
Well,
of course I'm going to end up getting 

1880
01:27:17,351 --> 01:27:18,184
better responses.
What I find interesting is if you make 

1881
01:27:20,681 --> 01:27:21,514
this x market a robot,
I think it'll be easier to make a robot 

1882
01:27:25,061 --> 01:27:27,190
that seems,
that passes the turing test.

1883
01:27:27,191 --> 01:27:28,024
That seems to us to be self aware.
Then it will be to know whether or not 

1884
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:37,100
it really is self aware.
Right,

1885
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:39,820
and and is there a meaningful 
difference?

1886
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,290
I mean this is what's interesting to me,
is there,

1887
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:42,124
is there a meaningful difference between
a computer that can completely 

1888
01:27:45,911 --> 01:27:50,710
convincingly reassure you that it is,
that it has feelings and a computer that

1889
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:54,420
actually fails or what?
I think there is a ceiling.

1890
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,040
What,

1891
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,480
what difference does it make it?
Here's,

1892
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:57,343
here's the thing.
Like we were so connected to this idea 

1893
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:00,014
that the only life that's real is carbon
based life of biological intelligence 

1894
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:05,090
cells,
life,

1895
01:28:05,091 --> 01:28:06,650
death,
life span.

1896
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:11,270
It has a.
it's got a finite reality.

1897
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,393
It's eventually gonna rot.
I mean that's what we think of life is 

1898
01:28:14,301 --> 01:28:17,730
and that's the only thing that's worth 
anything to us because we're so we're,

1899
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,573
we're,
we're just so inexorably connected to 

1900
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:21,584
what we are and that we don't.
We only think that's the only kind of 

1901
01:28:23,601 --> 01:28:24,434
life,
but there could easily be in life form 

1902
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:28,350
that exists in the form of ideas.
You know,

1903
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,193
and I've often thought about this in 
terms of like the word of the word 

1904
01:28:33,171 --> 01:28:35,510
alien,
like people always love that expression,

1905
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:40,190
alien intelligence and has,
have we ever been visited by aliens.

1906
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,353
I often think that if intelligence keeps
expanding and keeps growing at the rate 

1907
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:48,584
that it has with human beings and you 
compare us to people that lived a few 

1908
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,393
thousand years ago versus today,
it's impossible not to conclude that 

1909
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:57,224
people have gotten far more intelligent,
far more capable and have far more 

1910
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:01,920
abilities than we did.

1911
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,490
Whether it's technologically or you 
know,

1912
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,050
through what the way we can manipulate 
matter in our environment.

1913
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:08,760
It's fought,
were far more capable now.

1914
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:09,594
Right now,
if we can continue to go from here till 

1915
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,183
you know,
thousands and thousands of years from 

1916
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:16,254
now,
we could get to the point where we can 

1917
01:29:18,481 --> 01:29:23,481
inject ideas and send ideas to each 
other in the form of like thoughts.

1918
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,183
Yep.
Now how do we not know that imagination 

1919
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:29,004
itself is not a life form that wants us 
to continue to innovate and create and 

1920
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,303
build something different,
that it's not just a function of the 

1921
01:29:37,651 --> 01:29:39,520
brain.
It's not just a function of the the,

1922
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:40,363
the,
the conscious mind to be curious and a 

1923
01:29:43,891 --> 01:29:48,500
byproduct of our time as hunter 
gatherers and this constant seeking of,

1924
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:53,501
of food and shelter and safety that is 
causing us to innovate,

1925
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:58,170
but instead these ideas are almost like 
a,

1926
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:03,200
like a signal that's in the midst and 
that imagination itself,

1927
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:05,003
which is responsible for every single 
thing you see in this room and in this 

1928
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,980
city and on this planet that human 
beings have created.

1929
01:30:10,981 --> 01:30:14,070
All of it came out of the imagination,
all of it.

1930
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,820
And why is this imagination so fucking 
hungry for innovation?

1931
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:21,750
Why don't we have the capacity to 
recognize that phones are small enough,

1932
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,630
computers are fast enough is a big 
enough.

1933
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:27,060
Cars are quick enough.
Let's stop right here.

1934
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:30,030
Let's stop right here and work for the 
better good of humanity.

1935
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,860
Every era.
You could have said that Joe,

1936
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,023
that's,
that's why fuck the sixties and Shitbag 

1937
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,163
cars and they're fucking.
That's what people will say in a half 

1938
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:39,913
century ago.
You want to drive all those old shitty 

1939
01:30:40,671 --> 01:30:42,800
jaguars and catches on fire.
No,

1940
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,450
but you know what I'm saying?
I do.

1941
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:45,260
I do.
Right?

1942
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:46,100
You're right.
I mean,

1943
01:30:46,101 --> 01:30:48,410
you could have said that,
but what is it?

1944
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,960
What is going on?
Like what is imagination?

1945
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:51,833
Well,
I think anyone who works in a creative 

1946
01:30:52,921 --> 01:30:53,754
field or maybe anyone who,
even those who don't will agree that 

1947
01:30:57,151 --> 01:31:01,410
there is something mysterious about the 
Muse for want of a better word.

1948
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:02,244
Right?
I mean there are moments when I'm 

1949
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:03,864
writing where,
where something just dropped into my 

1950
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:07,170
head and I'm like,
that's great.

1951
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:09,730
And certainly people who write music or 
who painted,

1952
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,593
you know,
they will get in that zone and you find 

1953
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:15,240
that flow and it is like you're writing 
something else.

1954
01:31:15,241 --> 01:31:17,970
It's not like you're the author of it 
entirely.

1955
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:19,203
Um,
so on the question of whether or not 

1956
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:26,580
computers would fit in what,
when you say like,

1957
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:30,030
what would it mean to say?
Does a computer actually feel?

1958
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,710
I think,
do you know the.

1959
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:34,170
Have you heard of the essay?
What is it like to be a bat?

1960
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,033
I think it's,
I think it's called Thomas Nagel was a 

1961
01:31:37,261 --> 01:31:38,094
20th century philosopher and this was a 
foundational sort of philosophical 

1962
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:41,910
essay.

1963
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:42,743
It's only about 10 pages long.
I'm really kind of trying to nail down 

1964
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:51,180
the fundamentals of um,
I can't remember the field of,

1965
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:51,750
uh,
of,

1966
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,583
of philosophy,
but it basically a philosophy of mind 

1967
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:58,950
where his point is it's only meaningful 
to talk about things,

1968
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,360
feelings if you can say like,
what is it,

1969
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,880
what is it like to be a,
an x?

1970
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,710
And,
and so what is it like to be a bat?

1971
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,150
That's a meaningful question.
I mean you can,

1972
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:08,163
you can sort of look at the brain,
you can try to figure out how it 

1973
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:13,690
responds to its sonar,
what that might feel like.

1974
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:15,640
Is that a kind of a vision as a kind of 
a sound?

1975
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,970
If I pick up this cop and I say what is 
it like to be this cop?

1976
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:21,850
I mean that's essentially meaningless.
What do you mean?

1977
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:23,170
What,
what is it like to be a cop?

1978
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:24,610
The cop is,
is nonsense.

1979
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:27,130
It has no input.
It has no experience of,

1980
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:28,263
of life.
So my question about artificial 

1981
01:32:31,121 --> 01:32:31,954
intelligence is what would have to 
happen for it to be meaningful to say 

1982
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:39,340
what is it?
What is it like to be that computer?

1983
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,033
And I think that's more than just a 
computer that can be creative or a 

1984
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:44,644
computer that can have imagination or a 
computer that can spew out something 

1985
01:32:47,711 --> 01:32:48,544
that's interesting.
I mean we already have computers that 

1986
01:32:49,811 --> 01:32:50,650
can,
for example,

1987
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:52,870
write operas,
bad operas,

1988
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:53,823
but operas that conform to operas.
Like we're not far away from having 

1989
01:32:57,251 --> 01:32:58,084
computers that can write books that are 
at least as good as the average book 

1990
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:03,910
that you get an airport bookstore,
right?

1991
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:07,840
Just a general book,
but for a computer to write,

1992
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:09,483
proust is going to be difficult for a 
computer to Beethoven is going to be 

1993
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:17,230
difficult and when it does,
I'm not saying it won't happen.

1994
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:22,230
I'm just saying this nation in human,
in humans,

1995
01:33:23,111 --> 01:33:23,944
there's some.
There's something about biological 

1996
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:27,850
intelligence so far,
which is you,

1997
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:31,870
which is uniquely creative and 
imaginative and what the fuck is it?

1998
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:34,090
Yeah.
Without the imagination.

1999
01:33:34,091 --> 01:33:37,160
We're just an animal.
The are not very imaginative.

2000
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:38,583
You know they're not,
but they still have an experience of 

2001
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:43,900
life in a way that my computer and phone
dunt for now,

2002
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:45,820
for now and so something's going to 
happen.

2003
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:49,030
I mean at some point they will be.
I mean,

2004
01:33:49,031 --> 01:33:49,864
I sort of agree with the materialist on 
this because I'm not a religious person 

2005
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:57,560
that our brains are surely all of all of
this experience of being made for,

2006
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,330
for most of us have this word 
[inaudible],

2007
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:06,150
which means the actual experience of 
experiencing knowledge and data.

2008
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:10,180
So there's this thought experiment that 
I remember from,

2009
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:14,620
from university where imagine a child is
born in a black and white room.

2010
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:16,720
They can't see themselves.
They just strapped down.

2011
01:34:16,721 --> 01:34:18,070
So they kinda see any color,
right?

2012
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,220
But they learn everything there is to 
know about color,

2013
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:25,600
but scientifically school in the nature 
of the light spectrum,

2014
01:34:25,601 --> 01:34:27,820
and I understand that old,
I know that the sky is blue.

2015
01:34:27,821 --> 01:34:29,440
They know that they don't.
They've never seen this guy,

2016
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,870
but they know everything there is to 
know about the science of color.

2017
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,300
Then one day after they've only ever 
seen black and white,

2018
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:42,700
you release them into the world and they
look around at trees and birds and skies

2019
01:34:42,701 --> 01:34:46,210
and the ocean.
What would their response be?

2020
01:34:46,211 --> 01:34:47,860
Would they respond to simply be,
oh,

2021
01:34:47,861 --> 01:34:49,160
well,
I already know everything about cholera.

2022
01:34:49,161 --> 01:34:49,520
You know,
I,

2023
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,353
I,
I perceived the world previously as a 

2024
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:53,680
kind of a,
a paint by numbers picture,

2025
01:34:53,681 --> 01:34:54,514
so I already know that the sky was blue 
and I know what the wavelength of light 

2026
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:57,530
is that makes blue

2027
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
or would they be overwhelmed by how 
beautiful and amazing the world looks.

2028
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,360
Of course,
they'd be overwhelmed by how,

2029
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,433
how much richer the experience of 
experiencing color is than merely 

2030
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:12,890
knowing and understanding about the 
spectrum of light and that difference is

2031
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:13,724
what philosophers call the,
the experience of having an experience 

2032
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,480
which,
which is very hard to like.

2033
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:22,250
What is that difference?
They already had.

2034
01:35:22,251 --> 01:35:25,100
This person already had everything you 
could possibly know about color,

2035
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,150
what was added,
what was added to the mix here that made

2036
01:35:29,151 --> 01:35:31,490
them impressed colors.
A purely visual thing.

2037
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:33,570
I don't think it's the best example 
because if you're.

2038
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,433
You don't feel color,
so if you cannot see color and then you 

2039
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:38,774
can see color.
There's no way you could've known 

2040
01:35:40,371 --> 01:35:42,230
everything about color without seeing 
it,

2041
01:35:42,231 --> 01:35:43,064
but what is it that you didn't know?
Because I didn't know what the visual 

2042
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:47,420
aspects of different hues are.

2043
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:51,080
You hadn't experienced them,
but you would have been able to answer a

2044
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:53,360
question yes.
Assigned.

2045
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:55,040
Just kind of answered,
you know,

2046
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:57,620
what question would you not have been 
able to answer?

2047
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,660
What are you don't know what it looks 
like to see red,

2048
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:00,973
but how.
But you would have been able to answer 

2049
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:05,090
exactly what red means.
No conversation.

2050
01:36:05,091 --> 01:36:05,924
You would have no.
Not without seeing no understanding of 

2051
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:14,600
quality or analogy.
I'm absolutely nonsense argument.

2052
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:16,220
No.
A scientist would have been able to have

2053
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:17,054
the person who's never seen color and a 
person who has seen color and there's 

2054
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:21,350
nothing they could ask either of them 
that would,

2055
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:22,970
that would make a difference.
Doesn't matter.

2056
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:26,060
Let them that haven't experienced that 
visual aspect of precisely.

2057
01:36:26,061 --> 01:36:27,800
Right?
So that's what I'm telling you it in.

2058
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:29,420
So that's what I told you about.
Just the signal,

2059
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:30,553
but it's a signal that the person who is
seeing in black and white does not 

2060
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:35,060
receive.

2061
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,893
Once they receive that signal,
it'd simply becomes more data and then 

2062
01:36:38,391 --> 01:36:39,890
there's no more data.
That's the thing.

2063
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,040
It's not more data.
It's a visual experience of data.

2064
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:44,623
Okay.
Data know this is we're splitting hairs 

2065
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:47,234
here because if you're looking at red,
like if you're looking at something and 

2066
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:51,200
you just see a black and white,
right?

2067
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,093
Yeah,
and then all of a sudden someone adds 

2068
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:54,800
something and you see color,
right?

2069
01:36:54,801 --> 01:36:56,660
They turn on the switch.
That's data.

2070
01:36:56,810 --> 01:37:00,080
So suppose that the black and white 
thing that in your world,

2071
01:37:00,081 --> 01:37:00,914
in your paint by numbers world red is 
the number 19 and that object had a 19 

2072
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:07,460
written on it.
Then you knew that it was red.

2073
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:08,953
You don't know what red is.
Try Try saying what the color blue is 

2074
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,850
timeline man,
but I think the point,

2075
01:37:13,851 --> 01:37:14,684
the point that you're arguing is 
precisely the point that philosophers 

2076
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:19,070
wrestle with,
which is if,

2077
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:19,460
if the.

2078
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:20,293
If the question we're asking is what 
does it mean to actually feel and be 

2079
01:37:24,351 --> 01:37:25,184
self aware and be conscious,
what would it mean for an artificial 

2080
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:27,884
system to feel the way that we do?
What would it mean for artificial 

2081
01:37:30,081 --> 01:37:33,140
intelligence to actually have interests 
for it?

2082
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:33,974
To be meaningful for us to say what's it
like to be this computer in a way that 

2083
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:39,440
it's not meaningful to say what's it 
like to be this cup?

2084
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,800
Then quality was one of these 
interesting things that's sort of.

2085
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,640
That's intrinsic to the experience of 
being human and you're totally right.

2086
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:47,503
It is part of our foundational knowledge
because living without it would be sort 

2087
01:37:52,431 --> 01:37:54,680
of meaningless,
but it's very,

2088
01:37:54,681 --> 01:37:56,580
very tricky to understand exactly

2089
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,580
what the difference between that and 
pure data is.

2090
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:01,030
There clearly is a difference.
I mean it.

2091
01:38:01,031 --> 01:38:03,270
It's clearly different.
There's a difference now.

2092
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,313
It was clearly different for me to be me
alive and experiencing things then 

2093
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:11,070
merely than merely for me to be,
for example,

2094
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:13,350
an intelligence that is just behaving 
like me,

2095
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:15,080
but actually the lights are off inside.
Right.

2096
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,060
Okay.
But why do you assume the lights are off

2097
01:38:17,061 --> 01:38:21,380
once the connections are being made?
How do you not know that artificial life

2098
01:38:21,381 --> 01:38:22,214
won't be a life?
That's why I think it will be at some 

2099
01:38:24,051 --> 01:38:27,440
stage and it certainly can be.
That's we already know what I'm saying.

2100
01:38:27,441 --> 01:38:28,630
It right.
That that,

2101
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,770
that difference is the difference at 
which,

2102
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,630
how are we going to know where,
when,

2103
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,030
once that,
where that boundary is

2104
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:37,480
being breached,
draft and know this is what I think,

2105
01:38:37,481 --> 01:38:38,314
I think what we're trying to define it 
in some way where this is real life and 

2106
01:38:41,801 --> 01:38:42,634
that won't be real life.
The same thing as we're talking about 

2107
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,593
virtual reality,
like this is reality and that will be a 

2108
01:38:48,251 --> 01:38:49,084
fake virtual reality.
I don't necessarily know that I'm not 

2109
01:38:52,241 --> 01:38:53,074
necessarily convinced that this reality 
that we experienced because we have 

2110
01:38:56,051 --> 01:38:56,884
gravity because we have cells because we
feel the weight of our feet on the 

2111
01:39:00,161 --> 01:39:04,120
ground as we walk.
Once that is replicable,

2112
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:05,163
once there's something that you can plug
into that gives you all have that exact 

2113
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:08,824
experience,
but it's not happening in the physical 

2114
01:39:11,021 --> 01:39:14,830
sense and it's indiscernible.
What is it still happening?

2115
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:17,500
It's absolutely still happening.
The experience is still the same.

2116
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:20,260
So is your consciousness what guides 
you?

2117
01:39:20,261 --> 01:39:21,094
Is your.
Is the data that hits your 

2118
01:39:22,931 --> 01:39:23,680
consciousness?

2119
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:24,513
Is that what's important or does it have
to be something that you could put on a 

2120
01:39:28,061 --> 01:39:32,440
scale or measure with a ruler or or c 
over a timeline?

2121
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,400
What is reality is the real question 
becomes,

2122
01:39:36,401 --> 01:39:40,750
and that's when people who really think 
there's a significant possibility,

2123
01:39:40,751 --> 01:39:41,584
there's a real physicist that we are 
living in some form of a simulation 

2124
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:46,743
currently that it's one of the reasons 
why reality is so preposterous is that 

2125
01:39:50,141 --> 01:39:55,141
reality is a work of fiction and that if
we keep going as we are today,

2126
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,433
there's gonna come a time where we are 
able to create some form of virtual 

2127
01:40:00,191 --> 01:40:03,190
reality that's indistinguishable from 
reality.

2128
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:06,370
So the question becomes how will we know
when we're in it?

2129
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:07,110
Yeah.

2130
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,120
Elon Musk,
uh,

2131
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,960
is,
is a big proponent of this as well.

2132
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:10,410
You know,
he,

2133
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:11,243
he believes,
he believes that it's almost certain 

2134
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:15,300
that we are in a,
in a virtual reality right now,

2135
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:16,163
just because the proportion.
I think the argument goes along the 

2136
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:21,684
lines of at some point in the future,
there are going to be so many virtual 

2137
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:24,534
realities that the likelihood of us 
being in one of those instead of in the 

2138
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,530
earthly reality that we think

2139
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,730
Erin is going to be enormously more 
probable.

2140
01:40:32,731 --> 01:40:33,800
Well,
we can go one better.

2141
01:40:33,801 --> 01:40:34,634
That even the earthly reality is so 
fucking bizarre and filled with holes 

2142
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:43,460
that the.
I mean the very adams that we,

2143
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:45,550
we have that,
that exist,

2144
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:50,660
that encompass every single aspect of 
everything that we see that's physical,

2145
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:53,030
are mostly nothing.
And then we,

2146
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,033
these subatomic particles that blink in 
and out of existence and they can be in 

2147
01:40:57,791 --> 01:41:02,350
a super state where they're moving and 
still at the same time they come and go.

2148
01:41:02,351 --> 01:41:04,520
They go somewhere.
We don't know where they're going

2149
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:07,590
and forth between this dimension and 
another dimension that we've done.

2150
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:10,100
Have you seen stranger things on 
Netflix?

2151
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:13,240
The underside,
which brings us to,

2152
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:17,210
to Iosco.
So,

2153
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,513
um,
about a month ago I tried asked for the 

2154
01:41:21,831 --> 01:41:25,370
first time and I'd want it to do it for 
awhile.

2155
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:26,263
And a friend of mine.
Have you done with the psychedelics 

2156
01:41:27,741 --> 01:41:29,240
before that?
I've done psychedelic.

2157
01:41:29,241 --> 01:41:30,074
I've never done DMT,
but I've done so I've done acid and 

2158
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:37,160
mushrooms,
but not for not for a few years.

2159
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,713
Had some of the best experiences of my 
life on acid and mean some of the most 

2160
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:45,170
eyeopening and just revelatory and 
extraordinary experiences.

2161
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,033
Had a bad mushroom trip and haven't 
really done many psychedelics since 

2162
01:41:47,971 --> 01:41:49,380
then.
Pad.

2163
01:41:49,381 --> 01:41:50,214
How much I was in Amsterdam.
It was too much for the circumstances 

2164
01:41:55,911 --> 01:41:57,320
under which I was trying to hold it 
together.

2165
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,900
I just try to do it in public.
You're not supposed to do that.

2166
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:03,350
It's going out on a trip with my brother
in Amsterdam,

2167
01:42:03,351 --> 01:42:05,210
like wandering around.
It was like we were just.

2168
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:08,990
It was.
It was one of those moments where like,

2169
01:42:08,991 --> 01:42:12,120
you can't even remember the thought that
you had like half a second ago.

2170
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:14,810
So your entire experience of life is 
just a fractured.

2171
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:18,220
You're

2172
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,460
supposed to be quiet laying down 
somewhere.

2173
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:21,360
I know,
I know.

2174
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,530
I know that.
I knew all that,

2175
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,393
but I was better.
I was too good for any advice that I 

2176
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,460
could get.
Grams,

2177
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:27,683
I don't know because,
well it was mushrooms in your hand how 

2178
01:42:29,881 --> 01:42:31,070
big it was.
It was a handful.

2179
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:33,580
It was a significant.
Any influence?

2180
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:34,540
It was a lot.
Yeah,

2181
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:37,800
I'm sure.
And we ended up like,

2182
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:40,320
you know,
we tried to go into a cafe thinking that

2183
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,970
that would be better,
but by the time we,

2184
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:45,000
we've made our way through the thicket 
of impenetrable chairs.

2185
01:42:45,001 --> 01:42:46,560
That seems like there were too many 
tables,

2186
01:42:46,561 --> 01:42:47,394
like none of it made sense.
I didn't know where the walls were so 

2187
01:42:49,161 --> 01:42:49,994
then I'm sitting down and like I don't 
know how to order tea anymore and like 

2188
01:42:52,861 --> 01:42:54,480
she's,
I don't know what people are asking for.

2189
01:42:54,481 --> 01:42:56,190
I don't know when I'm supposed to pay or
how I'm.

2190
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:58,260
And then it just became too stressful 
and I was like,

2191
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:00,090
have to get out of the cafe.
It was just all of that.

2192
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:03,070
And then I don't even remember like how 
long have you even been in the cafe at?

2193
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:05,180
People looking at me because it was just
one of those weird,

2194
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:09,870
like just not good.
But I mean I will ask is a bit different

2195
01:43:09,871 --> 01:43:13,440
because it's,
it's a shamanistic ceremony.

2196
01:43:13,441 --> 01:43:16,360
That's presided over by this Peruvian.
Where'd you do it?

2197
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:18,840
Dude?
I New York in the city.

2198
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:19,441
Uh,
yeah,

2199
01:43:19,441 --> 01:43:20,750
in Brooklyn.
Uh,

2200
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,630
they rent out a,
like a dance studio or some space.

2201
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:26,190
Did you know the other people you're 
doing it with?

2202
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:28,830
Only one of them was my friend.
He's done it a bunch of times.

2203
01:43:28,831 --> 01:43:30,470
He's done it a lot.
Um,

2204
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:34,650
and starts about nine or 10 in the 
evening.

2205
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,410
Goes until about four to six in the 
morning.

2206
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:41,010
And uh,
either we're about 20 people there,

2207
01:43:41,011 --> 01:43:41,844
so it was a reasonably large group and 
you're all sort of lined up along the 

2208
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:50,100
walls with yoga mats and whatever else 
you want a bucket to vomit into.

2209
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,150
And He,
uh,

2210
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:56,240
gives a little speech.
He's down in Peru a lot.

2211
01:43:56,241 --> 01:43:58,010
He's been doing this for decades.
You know,

2212
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,780
this has been going on for thousands of 
years among,

2213
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:04,430
for people who don't know what Ios is,
it's a hallucinogen from the Amazon.

2214
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:05,264
It's been fundamental to a lot of South 
American religions for thousands of 

2215
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:08,980
years.

2216
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:13,020
Competent Tory hallucinogenic combines 
the leaves of one plant,

2217
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,873
the vines of another.
So one of them is dmt and the other one 

2218
01:44:16,661 --> 01:44:17,494
is called an Mao inhibitor and a mano,
amy and Oxidizes Mao and your body 

2219
01:44:22,601 --> 01:44:23,434
produces it and your stomach and your 
gut and what it does is it keeps you 

2220
01:44:26,471 --> 01:44:27,304
from getting high on Dmt,
which exists in thousands of different 

2221
01:44:29,471 --> 01:44:30,304
plants.
So if you were eating a lot of the 

2222
01:44:31,571 --> 01:44:32,404
things that we eat on a regular basis,
if he didn't have monoamine oxidase and 

2223
01:44:35,861 --> 01:44:36,694
I'm sure it has other functions as well,
but it would cause you to get high on 

2224
01:44:40,331 --> 01:44:43,510
certain grasses and plants and many,
many different ones.

2225
01:44:43,511 --> 01:44:46,150
So your body produces this stuff to 
break that down.

2226
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:47,380
There you go.
Glad I got you.

2227
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:50,770
Hit Ya.
I didn't even drink it orally.

2228
01:44:50,771 --> 01:44:51,604
Active version of DMT.
And they essentially figured out a 

2229
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:56,914
solution for dealing with the motto,
aiming oxidase that your stomach 

2230
01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:01,204
produces

2231
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:02,773
long before they even knew what any of 
that shit was thousands of years ago 

2232
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:07,460
when they were just screwing around in 
the Amazon.

2233
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:09,460
Yeah.
We don't even know how really,

2234
01:45:09,461 --> 01:45:13,330
how old it is because they don't really 
have much of a tradition.

2235
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:16,900
But um,
they claim it's,

2236
01:45:16,901 --> 01:45:18,430
I mean they claim that it's been 
fundamental,

2237
01:45:18,431 --> 01:45:20,780
but who knows,
it's a verbal little notion.

2238
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:24,100
We don't know how they figured it out.
We don't have any of those things.

2239
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:25,093
I mean it's a,
it's a very interesting experience 

2240
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:28,874
because the,

2241
01:45:31,330 --> 01:45:33,640
I went into it sort of wanting what 
everyone,

2242
01:45:33,670 --> 01:45:36,130
I guess,
once out of a psychedelic experience,

2243
01:45:36,131 --> 01:45:36,964
which is some kind of like con opening 
up of your mind and connection to the 

2244
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:43,840
cosmos.
Awesome connection to your own true self

2245
01:45:43,841 --> 01:45:44,674
and your connection to life force and 
the mystery of consciousness and 

2246
01:45:47,531 --> 01:45:49,810
everything.
But I will ask is very interesting.

2247
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:53,470
It almost felt like it was a character 
in the trip.

2248
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:58,500
The trip was very visual and the first 
portion of it was like just closed.

2249
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:04,630
I would close my eyes.
It was just an incredible expect a candy

2250
01:46:04,631 --> 01:46:08,930
collar universe of weird like Pez 
dispensers,

2251
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:11,770
dancing and all kinds of amazing visual 
hallucinations.

2252
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:15,010
I opened my eyes and the person next to 
me,

2253
01:46:15,011 --> 01:46:19,030
I couldn't tell whether or not they were
there or not or whether they'd gone.

2254
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:22,600
I think that he'd gone to the restroom 
but.

2255
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:27,310
And I could sit and it's not that dark.
I couldn't see that he was not there,

2256
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:31,210
but I still felt like he was there and 
not in like a woo.

2257
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,053
All his spirit is still the airway,
just like I was literally not sure what 

2258
01:46:35,261 --> 01:46:36,094
criteria I would need to use to 
establish whether or not there was a 

2259
01:46:37,931 --> 01:46:41,800
person sitting next to me.
Like the visual data was there.

2260
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:43,900
I could see that there was just a yoga 
mat,

2261
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:45,910
but I was like,
where'd he go?

2262
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:48,160
Is he white?
He said,

2263
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,593
no,
he's,

2264
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:50,070
he's

2265
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,690
there.
Then where's his physical body?

2266
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:54,480
No,
you did see someone sitting next to me.

2267
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:57,600
I think there is bang on.
Then where is he would like.

2268
01:46:57,601 --> 01:47:01,020
It was literally and also it was very 
because some people

2269
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:02,083
vomiting.
I mean some people have haven't 

2270
01:47:02,511 --> 01:47:04,550
experienced where they're crying and 
bawling their eyes out.

2271
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:05,423
They go to the darkest places.
I was a bit nervous beforehand because 

2272
01:47:07,401 --> 01:47:08,234
it shows the claim that what they claim,
what the shamans claim is that it shows 

2273
01:47:12,111 --> 01:47:17,111
you what you need to see about yourself 
at that moment and that can be wonderful

2274
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:20,480
or that can be negative,
but whatever it is,

2275
01:47:20,481 --> 01:47:23,520
it's like Iowaska has a personality.
It's like it is Gaia.

2276
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:25,070
It's like,
it is the power of laugh.

2277
01:47:25,071 --> 01:47:26,230
It's like it is,
you know,

2278
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,193
the Amazon itself,
it's like the lungs of the earth or 

2279
01:47:28,761 --> 01:47:32,270
something and it brings you in and you 
just have to roll with it because if you

2280
01:47:32,271 --> 01:47:34,490
try to fight it,
it will crush you.

2281
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,340
Um,
what I loved,

2282
01:47:37,341 --> 01:47:38,174
what I was heartened by was the true 
sort of Josh steps that came out during 

2283
01:47:42,441 --> 01:47:45,860
the experience was a very like,
funny,

2284
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:52,110
not funny ha ha,
but like just joyful person.

2285
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,100
I could.
There was no,

2286
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:55,530
there were,
there were moments of darkness and there

2287
01:47:55,531 --> 01:47:58,320
were moments of hallucinations were 
like,

2288
01:47:58,321 --> 01:47:59,154
there was the bloodied face of a woman 
up in the right hand side of my 

2289
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:02,424
periphery.
And I started going towards it and then 

2290
01:48:04,261 --> 01:48:05,094
I was like,
I consciously sort of said to the Ios 

2291
01:48:07,911 --> 01:48:08,311
got,
you know,

2292
01:48:08,311 --> 01:48:09,460
we can go there.
I didn't want,

2293
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:12,840
I knew that if I tried not to go there,
then it would get worse and worse.

2294
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:13,943
So it was like,
we can do that and that's fine and we 

2295
01:48:15,511 --> 01:48:17,910
can make this a bad trip if you want.
Frankly,

2296
01:48:17,911 --> 01:48:18,744
it's just more interesting over on the 
fun candy colored side and then it just 

2297
01:48:21,151 --> 01:48:23,500
sort of faded away.
So I think there's a,

2298
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:26,940
there's something about relinquishing 
yourself to it and not trying to control

2299
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:28,320
it and not transfer of power.

2300
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:30,800
A lot of road trips come from is just 
trying to,

2301
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,770
trying to control with your ego,
trying to control the experience.

2302
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:35,903
So I sort of gave myself into it and 
like there were moments where like the 

2303
01:48:38,461 --> 01:48:41,130
funniest thing that you can ever do.
I know you're a comic.

2304
01:48:41,131 --> 01:48:42,990
So here's a little tip.
You'll enjoy this joe.

2305
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:46,050
Next time you need to have the best life
of your life,

2306
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:49,230
just pull a blanket over your head.
Hilarious.

2307
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,360
According to Josh steps,
whilst on Ios Guy,

2308
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:52,703
funniest thing I'd ever done.
I was like giggling madly underneath a 

2309
01:48:55,231 --> 01:48:58,780
blanket with the blanket over my head.
That's why drugs are illegal.

2310
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:02,270
Look at them.
I'm just laughing or nothing.

2311
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:03,660
It was like,
it was so funny.

2312
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:08,370
And then so I was.
So to get back to the point about what I

2313
01:49:08,371 --> 01:49:09,204
was looking for with some kind of 
insight into the mystery of 

2314
01:49:10,891 --> 01:49:12,960
consciousness and what you were just 
sort of talking about,

2315
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:16,440
about like the imagination and you know,
self awareness.

2316
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,553
I felt like about halfway through the 
trip I hadn't really gotten my money's 

2317
01:49:21,451 --> 01:49:26,451
worth on that.
It was a fun life goal and goal.

2318
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:27,600
Exactly.
I was like,

2319
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:30,990
I felt ripped off and the Iowaska 
goddess or whatever it is,

2320
01:49:30,991 --> 01:49:31,824
like the personality of the drug was 
sort of visually like up here on the 

2321
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:35,760
left of my periphery.
And I was like,

2322
01:49:35,761 --> 01:49:36,331
Hey,
what gives?

2323
01:49:36,331 --> 01:49:38,810
Like what did it show me the show me the
majesty of,

2324
01:49:39,110 --> 01:49:42,090
of consciousness.
And the drug said

2325
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:47,260
I can't just notice.
And I was like,

2326
01:49:47,261 --> 01:49:47,981
ah,
that's bullshit.

2327
01:49:47,981 --> 01:49:49,320
I came here for a life,
for example,

2328
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,163
the life expand and experience.
I wanted my mind to be blown and all of 

2329
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:56,140
a sudden the drug tells me that she 
can't even give me an insight into the.

2330
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:59,260
Into the nature of how incredible 
consciousnesses and I went off in.

2331
01:49:59,261 --> 01:50:01,990
My brain went off on different tangents 
than about 10 or 15 minutes later.

2332
01:50:01,991 --> 01:50:02,824
I'm not sure how long it was because you
had your sense of time is completely 

2333
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:06,123
screwed around with.
I was struck by how incredibly profound 

2334
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:13,030
it was.

2335
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,753
She was like,
you don't need the drug to be aware of 

2336
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:21,100
how incredible consciousness is.
Just notice.

2337
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:23,830
And I was like,
whoa.

2338
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:24,693
And I kind of was struck by the fact 
that at any point in time on drugs or 

2339
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:32,260
not day or night,
wherever we are,

2340
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:38,220
if you just remind yourself that we are 
atoms that were produced inside of stars

2341
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:41,553
that have been spewed out of exploding 
stars and have accreted on this little 

2342
01:50:44,711 --> 01:50:48,490
rock that is spinning around another 
star.

2343
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,193
And we have evolved over hundreds of 
millions of years from amphibians 

2344
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:54,183
through to mammals.
And we are self aware and web blots of 

2345
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:03,370
substance cleaning into the side of a 
speck of dust in the middle of a massive

2346
01:51:03,371 --> 01:51:04,204
cosmos and we self aware and we are 
conscious and we're looking at the 

2347
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:10,540
universe that created us and now having 
a conversation about it.

2348
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:16,440
That in itself is weird and it's 
staggering and impressive.

2349
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:19,583
And we're a couple of decades away from 
creating an artificial version of 

2350
01:51:24,091 --> 01:51:29,091
ourselves quite probably quite probably 
if not decades by 100 years.

2351
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:31,950
One hundred percent.
Yep.

2352
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,730
And then we're off to the races.
Well then we're God,

2353
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:39,080
or not us,
but it is,

2354
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:43,550
it is God because it's going to like we 
were talking about become 10,000

2355
01:51:43,551 --> 01:51:44,384
years more advanced in a matter of 
moments and then in a matter of moments 

2356
01:51:48,651 --> 01:51:49,484
after that 10,000
years more and then in a matter of 

2357
01:51:51,561 --> 01:51:56,561
moments in weeks and months will pass 
and we will be infinitely more separated

2358
01:51:57,771 --> 01:52:01,430
from what we are today or more evolved 
or more capable.

2359
01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:07,300
There was a,
a moment during the trip were one of the

2360
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:11,020
female and the Shaman is on Iowa.
Oscar as well.

2361
01:52:11,021 --> 01:52:11,854
And he has female assistants,
she's saying this incredible song about 

2362
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:17,463
like the majesty of life or something,
and one of the things she was saying 

2363
01:52:20,771 --> 01:52:21,604
about was like that whatever the life 
force is inside you is more powerful 

2364
01:52:26,471 --> 01:52:28,420
than the sun.
More powerful than anything.

2365
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:32,020
And it sounds a bit corny when you're 
not high listening to it,

2366
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:36,460
but it gave me a,
a profound sense that yeah,

2367
01:52:36,461 --> 01:52:40,210
this,
this web of procreating,

2368
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:41,193
self-developing ever improving sentiment
creatures that are life is one of the 

2369
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:47,833
oldest and most enduring things in the 
universe and most impressive things in 

2370
01:52:52,191 --> 01:52:53,024
the universe.
Just in terms of going all the way back 

2371
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:57,620
to the genesis of life on this planet or
elsewhere.

2372
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,633
So as you say,
if we give birth to this new artificial 

2373
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:03,710
intelligence,
we will,

2374
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:04,544
as you say,
be the the organism that sort of 

2375
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:11,210
transcends from biological life to 
artificial life.

2376
01:53:11,211 --> 01:53:12,044
And just being a part of being a part of
any of that experience struck me as 

2377
01:53:17,121 --> 01:53:17,954
incredibly,

2378
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:20,413
incredibly moving and touching in a way 
that I know sounds stupid to people 

2379
01:53:24,191 --> 01:53:25,024
who've never done psychedelics.
And I know that there are friends of 

2380
01:53:26,831 --> 01:53:27,820
mine who are like,
well,

2381
01:53:27,821 --> 01:53:28,211
yeah,
okay,

2382
01:53:28,211 --> 01:53:30,370
you had a hippy dippy trip,
but it's one of the,

2383
01:53:30,371 --> 01:53:31,204
again,
it comes back to sort of the quality of 

2384
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,520
question,
the experience,

2385
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:38,540
the insight that you are able to achieve
when you're using these substances,

2386
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:39,753
or alternatively if you're a good a 
great meditator or something or if 

2387
01:53:42,341 --> 01:53:43,174
you're in a float tank or any other way 
of getting your mind into a different 

2388
01:53:45,311 --> 01:53:48,910
plane than the normal daily plane is 
not,

2389
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:52,480
is not a one of data.
It's not one that is easily explainable.

2390
01:53:52,481 --> 01:53:56,490
It's not one of reason.
It's a,

2391
01:53:56,491 --> 01:53:57,900
it's an,
it's an insight,

2392
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:59,970
you know,
it's an experience.

2393
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:06,640
It's an undeniable experience.
And um,

2394
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:11,910
I always wonder if that state that you 
achieve when you're on DMT DMT,

2395
01:54:12,791 --> 01:54:17,140
which is the active component in Iowasca
and you haven't done Iowasca.

2396
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:18,303
I've only done the hardcore form of DMT,
but dmt takes you to these places that 

2397
01:54:23,831 --> 01:54:27,070
apparently you can kind of reach an 
Iowasca for brief moments.

2398
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:28,383
A lot of people feel like Iowasca is a 
more spiritual version of it because it 

2399
01:54:30,671 --> 01:54:31,504
lasts longer.
You have more time to absorb the 

2400
01:54:33,161 --> 01:54:33,994
experience and a lot of times it's more 
for some people more life changing 

2401
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:39,460
because dmt is so titanic,
Lee Alien,

2402
01:54:39,461 --> 01:54:40,870
that one when it's done,
you're just like,

2403
01:54:40,871 --> 01:54:43,070
what the fuck?
But I've.

2404
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:47,140
I've done dmt over the course of several
hours or you keep doing it.

2405
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:49,740
Oh right.
You just keep doing it because you smoke

2406
01:54:49,741 --> 01:54:50,041
it.
Right,

2407
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:51,460
and then the last 15 minutes

2408
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:52,603
trips,
then you fucking banging out one more 

2409
01:54:54,351 --> 01:54:55,460
time,
get back in there.

2410
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:57,450
Did you have someone coaching your way 
through it?

2411
01:54:57,451 --> 01:54:58,284
Because my friend,
my Iowaska friend who introduced me to 

2412
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:00,834
this ceremony,
tried dmt once and read and really had 

2413
01:55:03,931 --> 01:55:06,150
a.
had a freakout and wasn't crazy about it

2414
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:06,993
and was then told you should really have
someone who sort of knows what they're 

2415
01:55:09,151 --> 01:55:12,560
doing with your.
Don't be a pussy or wouldn't be a it.

2416
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:13,340
Let it

2417
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,320
go.
You got to let him take you there and.

2418
01:55:15,321 --> 01:55:18,680
But your,
your mind does get exposed.

2419
01:55:18,681 --> 01:55:19,514
Your thoughts do get exposed.
You find out what's negative and what's 

2420
01:55:21,531 --> 01:55:23,030
positive about the way you look at the 
world.

2421
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:24,133
I had one of the most powerful 
experiences ever and my second trip 

2422
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:28,873
where I had this visualization of 
negative thinking like I had a negative 

2423
01:55:33,081 --> 01:55:33,914
thought came into my head and it was 
like dark and twisted and I just had 

2424
01:55:38,931 --> 01:55:39,764
this negative thought and then I 
realized that I was thinking in a 

2425
01:55:43,981 --> 01:55:47,550
negative way and this is a physical 
manifestation in front of me of negative

2426
01:55:47,551 --> 01:55:52,440
thinking and at that moment I relaxed 
and thought wonderful,

2427
01:55:52,441 --> 01:55:53,274
beautiful,
positive thoughts and it blossomed into 

2428
01:55:56,851 --> 01:55:57,684
this incredible flower of geometric 
patterns and continued to get more and 

2429
01:56:02,521 --> 01:56:04,470
more beautiful as I relaxed more and 
more.

2430
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,130
It was like a physical manifestation of 
looking at negative thinking.

2431
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:09,183
It was negative.
That negative was like dark black and 

2432
01:56:11,131 --> 01:56:12,750
green,
and it was just like,

2433
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:15,720
it was like a toxic.
We close.

2434
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:17,340
No totally closed.
Uh,

2435
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:18,563
but I was so fucked up,
I probably wouldn't have mattered if I 

2436
01:56:20,071 --> 01:56:21,930
opened my eyes.
I would have seen the same thing.

2437
01:56:21,931 --> 01:56:23,830
I was so gone.
You're,

2438
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,680
you're,
you're,

2439
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:26,400
you just,
you dissolve.

2440
01:56:26,401 --> 01:56:29,610
You cease to be there when you're doing 
the DMT,

2441
01:56:29,611 --> 01:56:32,900
the most intense version of smoking it.
Um,

2442
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:34,343
but you,
I wonder if we will eventually be there 

2443
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,433
because what that feels like when you're
doing dmt and Mckenna's described it as 

2444
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:49,731
Terence Mckenna described it as like 
you're in some sort of a well of souls,

2445
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:54,300
that you transcend the physical body and
you enter into some space,

2446
01:56:54,301 --> 01:56:59,301
some well of souls.
I wonder if this thing that we look at,

2447
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:03,420
we look at reality and we look at Adams 
and what we're talking about,

2448
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:04,254
the physical space,
when Adam's are mostly nothing and then 

2449
01:57:06,751 --> 01:57:10,980
these subatomic particles that blink in 
and out of position.

2450
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:11,963
I wonder if what really is going to 
happen as we get more and more evolved 

2451
01:57:16,501 --> 01:57:19,380
and more and more powerful with our 
ability to manipulate matter,

2452
01:57:19,381 --> 01:57:21,630
is that we're going to transcend this 
dimension.

2453
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,033
I wonder if that place that we go to is 
where our future lies and that our 

2454
01:57:26,671 --> 01:57:27,504
future doesn't lie in the stars because 
the stars aren't even real and that the 

2455
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,440
real dimension means they're real.
Is in.

2456
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:36,180
You can see them and you can send things
to them and you can measure them.

2457
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:37,343
But this is just a,
almost like a prison of a dimension and 

2458
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:45,690
this dimension can be transcended and 
that you can briefly view it when you do

2459
01:57:45,691 --> 01:57:49,820
dmt or when you visit the Iowasca God 
and you,

2460
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:50,713
you,
you pass through and briefly into that 

2461
01:57:52,561 --> 01:57:53,394
dimension.
But if one day that is where 

2462
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:56,183
consciousness will exist all the time 
and that we are creating this 

2463
01:58:00,571 --> 01:58:05,190
possibility in this door through our 
thirst for innovation and knowledge and,

2464
01:58:05,191 --> 01:58:06,024
and this constant evaluation of our 
current abilities and the constant 

2465
01:58:10,531 --> 01:58:11,364
desire to improve upon those abilities,
that one day it'll get passed this 

2466
01:58:15,061 --> 01:58:15,894
desire to have artificial intelligence 
and what is this intelligence going to 

2467
01:58:18,901 --> 01:58:19,620
be able to do?

2468
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:20,453
What's it going to be able to achieve 
and what's it going to be able to 

2469
01:58:22,411 --> 01:58:23,244
accomplish?
And we're going gonna open up other 

2470
01:58:25,741 --> 01:58:29,100
dimensions as possibilities for 
consciousness to exist in.

2471
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:30,700
I mean,
this sounds a lot like,

2472
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:33,880
like pre abrahamic religion,
right?

2473
01:58:33,881 --> 01:58:38,881
I mean this sounds a lot like religions 
were experience and indigenous religions

2474
01:58:39,431 --> 01:58:41,830
where before we fucked everything with,
uh,

2475
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:44,950
with Moses and Jesus and Mohammed.

2476
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:45,801
Well,
you say that.

2477
01:58:45,801 --> 01:58:46,634
But do you know that most most recent 
scholars in Jerusalem believed that the 

2478
01:58:49,971 --> 01:58:51,830
Moses experience was about dmt?

2479
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:53,940
The Moses experienced specifically?
Oh No.

2480
01:58:53,941 --> 01:58:56,400
I'm only is that that a lot of the 
early.

2481
01:58:56,401 --> 01:59:00,990
A lot of those old testament things,
writers were on psychedelic.

2482
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:01,893
Most likely they were.
When you think about the fact that 

2483
01:59:03,501 --> 01:59:05,720
psychedelics has been,
have been here forever,

2484
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:06,670
so what's the Moses

2485
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:10,440
the most experiences that Moses saw?
The burning Bush that represented God?

2486
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:10,981
Yeah.
Well,

2487
01:59:10,981 --> 01:59:15,981
one of the most dmt rich plants in the 
area where Moses was the Acacia tree.

2488
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,193
The acacia Bush is rich in DMT.
If that was on fire or if you figured 

2489
01:59:22,831 --> 01:59:23,664
out a way to extract dmt from it and 
then he smoked it or you lit it on fire 

2490
01:59:27,211 --> 01:59:28,044
and did some sort of a way where you're 
absorbing this smoke and absorbing the 

2491
01:59:31,321 --> 01:59:32,154
DMT,

2492
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:33,001
you would say,
God,

2493
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:34,680
you would see God.
There's A.

2494
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:38,670
There's a lot of DMT.
Flora in Australia apparently,

2495
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:40,770
and I just feel arris grass,
right?

2496
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:41,713
A lot of different plants.
There's an Australian native called the 

2497
01:59:44,191 --> 01:59:47,010
wattle,
which I think is the national plant.

2498
01:59:47,011 --> 01:59:49,260
I'd have to look that up or maybe it's 
the state plan of my state.

2499
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,461
Um,
and so,

2500
01:59:50,461 --> 01:59:52,890
and Acacia isn't that they're all part 
of that family.

2501
01:59:52,891 --> 01:59:53,724
And so I was,
I was looking earlier this year that 

2502
01:59:55,231 --> 01:59:59,160
there's a push in Australia to get a 
Iowaska off the,

2503
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,211
uh,
the register,

2504
02:00:00,211 --> 02:00:02,520
you,
the banned substances list and permitted

2505
02:00:02,521 --> 02:00:04,260
as a,
as a religious,

2506
02:00:04,261 --> 02:00:05,520
as a madison,
as a medicine.

2507
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,910
Yeah.
It helps a lot of people.

2508
02:00:06,911 --> 02:00:07,744
There's a lot of people that go to it 
that have all sorts of addictions and 

2509
02:00:10,091 --> 02:00:13,030
all sorts of real problems and it sort 
of reset their brain,

2510
02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:14,243
resets their life.
It's one of many different psychedelics 

2511
02:00:16,541 --> 02:00:17,374
that are really good at that.
He Boga is incredibly good for people 

2512
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:21,574
that have addictions to opiates,
literally resets the way your brain 

2513
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:29,350
views and connects to addictive 
substance.

2514
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:30,161
So I've heard,
yeah,

2515
02:00:30,161 --> 02:00:30,994
I mean one of the,
I did a story on huffpost live about 

2516
02:00:32,381 --> 02:00:33,214
Iowaska before I'd ever used it and they
were saying that there's some 

2517
02:00:35,081 --> 02:00:39,370
interesting research about its ability 
to be a circuit breaker against,

2518
02:00:39,371 --> 02:00:41,110
for example,
alcoholism and stuff like that,

2519
02:00:41,111 --> 02:00:44,060
that people will go into the experience.
Alcoholics tends to come out.

2520
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:44,930
Yeah,
right.

2521
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:45,850
Yeah,
it was psychedelics.

2522
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:46,893
So I mean if it's so difficult to know 
what the fuck is going on with 

2523
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:50,890
consciousness,
right.

2524
02:00:50,891 --> 02:00:51,724
Why is it that we are assembled in such 
a way as to have these experiences and 

2525
02:00:56,921 --> 02:00:57,754
to be conscious at all,
but why do you think that it's a 

2526
02:00:59,801 --> 02:01:00,634
different dimension that we could cross 
into rather than just a another 

2527
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:11,640
perspective on this world that we are 
opened up to because we're ordinarily.

2528
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:14,073
I mean my,
my theory I suppose although it's 

2529
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:20,150
tentative,
is we have the capacity to be tuned into

2530
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:23,830
all kinds of amazing shit that's going 
on in the universe,

2531
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,890
but I really mean in terms of woo.

2532
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,730
I mean in terms of spiritual ghosts or 
anything.

2533
02:01:27,731 --> 02:01:28,564
I just mean there was a perspective on 
life that is much bigger than the one 

2534
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:36,160
that we walk around with a on our day to
day on a day to day basis,

2535
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:37,413
but evolution has has favored traits 
that force us to focus on getting food 

2536
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:45,460
and having sex and surviving.
Right.

2537
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:46,483
Which means that it has intentionally 
closed the parameters of what our mind 

2538
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:52,760
is capable of experiencing.
It goes intentionally closed or is there

2539
02:01:52,761 --> 02:01:56,420
no benefit for the biological is what I 
made distracted by these.

2540
02:01:56,421 --> 02:01:58,040
Exactly.
Running from tigers.

2541
02:01:58,041 --> 02:01:59,890
Precisely.
You don't want to cave man who's like,

2542
02:01:59,891 --> 02:02:04,250
who's like philosophizing a bit about 
his place in the cosmos is eating well.

2543
02:02:04,270 --> 02:02:05,690
He gets eating wise tripping.
Yeah,

2544
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:07,130
exactly.
He's like,

2545
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:09,170
this is amazing.
It's such a spiritual journey.

2546
02:02:09,171 --> 02:02:13,340
We Abbott startup gets devoured by a 
woolly mammoth,

2547
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:16,670
a little silly voice,
but you know,

2548
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:21,100
and what drugs do is they break down the
walls of perception and you know,

2549
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:22,640
to,
to borrow from Huxley,

2550
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:24,620
they,
they shatter those,

2551
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,890
those kinds of limits and constraints 
that our biology,

2552
02:02:27,891 --> 02:02:28,724
that evolution has put on our mental 
ability and simply let the mind wander 

2553
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:33,690
into whatever space it cares to go to.

2554
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:34,280
Yeah.
Well,

2555
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,210
why?
By using the word dimension,

2556
02:02:36,211 --> 02:02:37,340
I think we've sort of,
uh,

2557
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:38,573
we've,
I've limited the perception of what I'm 

2558
02:02:40,801 --> 02:02:41,634
saying because we already have like 
three dimensions that we believe in and 

2559
02:02:44,911 --> 02:02:47,580
the dimensions that we understand,
four dimensions that we believe in,

2560
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:51,450
but also the,
they believe that

2561
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:54,720
quantum physics there a nine or 1111 is 
it?

2562
02:02:54,721 --> 02:02:55,090
Yeah.

2563
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:55,923
So we,
we understand that there are other 

2564
02:02:57,431 --> 02:02:59,590
dimensions that we don't totally 
understand yet,

2565
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:00,633
right?
Um,

2566
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:01,580
but those,
those are,

2567
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:02,740
those are words,
right?

2568
02:03:02,741 --> 02:03:04,270
To mentions their words,
but there's time,

2569
02:03:04,271 --> 02:03:05,230
space,
distance,

2570
02:03:05,231 --> 02:03:10,231
all these different things or words and 
these words sort of lock in a definition

2571
02:03:10,451 --> 02:03:13,330
in our own mind.
But whatever the fuck it is,

2572
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,193
when you do have a dmt trip,
you go to a place and that place is not 

2573
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:20,020
right here.
It's not,

2574
02:03:20,021 --> 02:03:20,854
you're not,
you're not here when you go there and 

2575
02:03:22,781 --> 02:03:27,781
it's some all encompassing infinite 
geometric place called a dimension.

2576
02:03:29,951 --> 02:03:32,020
But that's just a noise that you make 
with your mouth.

2577
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:36,010
It doesn't really matter what it is.
It's something that you experienced that

2578
02:03:36,011 --> 02:03:40,570
you don't experience right here in 
Calabasas or wherever the fuck we are.

2579
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:41,470
You know,
it's,

2580
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:43,690
there's,
there's something different about it.

2581
02:03:44,170 --> 02:03:46,960
And um,
could it be another dimension?

2582
02:03:46,961 --> 02:03:48,670
Yes.
Could it be all in your imagination?

2583
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,490
Your imagination might also be another 
dimension.

2584
02:03:52,230 --> 02:03:53,063
The word dimension is a weird word 
because it's so limiting and defining 

2585
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:57,243
and,
and we have these preconceived ideas 

2586
02:04:00,041 --> 02:04:00,550
that we,
you know,

2587
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:02,320
there's a box that we can put our head,
oh,

2588
02:04:02,321 --> 02:04:04,240
it's a dimension.
There's the dimension,

2589
02:04:04,610 --> 02:04:05,443
you know,
whatever that thing is that you can 

2590
02:04:08,261 --> 02:04:09,094
experience.
If we can tap into that and other ways 

2591
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:14,920
is going,
the world is going to get very strange.

2592
02:04:15,090 --> 02:04:17,580
One thing that struck me after the 
experience,

2593
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:18,443
which gives,
which I think it bolsters the idea that 

2594
02:04:21,990 --> 02:04:22,823
there is something real about that 
dimension and slash intelligence or 

2595
02:04:25,591 --> 02:04:27,420
whatever it is,
whatever you want to call it,

2596
02:04:27,990 --> 02:04:28,823
was the,
was that I noticed that whenever people 

2597
02:04:30,511 --> 02:04:32,790
have these experiences and go to these 
places,

2598
02:04:32,791 --> 02:04:33,624
regardless of what mechanism they use,
they always come out with basically the 

2599
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:39,294
same.
Just have a conclusion and if it was 

2600
02:04:42,511 --> 02:04:46,450
merely what someone like a,
uh,

2601
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:48,500
who's a tele,
penn,

2602
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,880
penn and teller,
one of my pendulous nine.

2603
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,150
Why?
If it was merely what a person like Penn

2604
02:04:53,150 --> 02:04:53,983
Jillette thinks it is,
which is just the [inaudible] of your 

2605
02:04:55,861 --> 02:04:56,491
brain,
right?

2606
02:04:56,491 --> 02:04:58,830
Do you mean you take this stuff but he's
never done anything?

2607
02:04:59,100 --> 02:04:59,761
No,
exactly.

2608
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:00,950
That's right.
He's lost.

2609
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:01,913
So he's not just a teetotaler.
He's a denier of the possibility of all 

2610
02:05:04,891 --> 02:05:06,990
these different experiences being 
transcendent.

2611
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:08,210
That's right.
He was.

2612
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:09,413
As far as he's concerned.
What happens when you take dmt is that 

2613
02:05:11,551 --> 02:05:14,550
there are neurological disturbances and 
your brain goes,

2614
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:15,443
goes in,
has weird experiences because the drug 

2615
02:05:16,921 --> 02:05:19,350
is just fucking with your neurology.
And the Daddy said to Moses,

2616
02:05:19,351 --> 02:05:20,184
nothing.
What?

2617
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:20,970
I said,
why don't you,

2618
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:21,761
why?
Why have you?

2619
02:05:21,761 --> 02:05:22,770
How come you have no interest?
He goes,

2620
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:25,240
I think everything has been learned from
those experience.

2621
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:27,070
Everything that we've already figured it
out,

2622
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:30,390
we've already taken what we can from 
those experiences.

2623
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,680
Nothing to be learned by doing that.
Other people have already done it.

2624
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:34,420
Mike,
you're out of your fucking mind.

2625
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,980
And if that's the case,
then just do it.

2626
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:37,240
Then there's no harm,
right?

2627
02:05:37,241 --> 02:05:42,241
So silly to say that is so silly.
I love that guy.

2628
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:44,613
He's awesome.
But I think he is missing out on a 

2629
02:05:46,551 --> 02:05:48,750
massive blind spot.
Just massive blind.

2630
02:05:48,751 --> 02:05:53,290
But Dick Chunk of possibility.
He thinks it's hallucinations.

2631
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:54,221
He thought.
I mean,

2632
02:05:54,221 --> 02:05:56,200
he doesn't know.
He really doesn't know.

2633
02:05:56,201 --> 02:05:57,070
He doesn't understand.

2634
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,790
I mean,
some of it is hallucinations,

2635
02:05:58,791 --> 02:05:59,810
but.
So here's it.

2636
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:01,680
I'm not sure.

2637
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:04,850
I'm not sure.
I think it might be what Mckenna thinks.

2638
02:06:04,851 --> 02:06:06,840
I'm.
It might be a wealth of souls.

2639
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:07,853
It might be what life is this.
This whole biological thing might 

2640
02:06:12,301 --> 02:06:14,440
literally be the cocoon that we were 
talking about.

2641
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:15,343
But when I'm,
when I close my eyes and I see a 

2642
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:22,870
mechanistic universe of bright pink,
yellow and purple machines cranking away

2643
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:28,840
and exploding and little sort of Mario 
style computer things bouncing around on

2644
02:06:29,121 --> 02:06:29,954
them,
and then I start spinning through 

2645
02:06:31,761 --> 02:06:32,594
kaleidoscopes of color.
Are you implying that Mckenna Mckenna 

2646
02:06:36,351 --> 02:06:37,184
would say that those are actual real 
things that I'm seeing in another 

2647
02:06:39,921 --> 02:06:41,870
dimension?
Woody Kenna

2648
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:44,500
believed that?
What you were expecting?

2649
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:47,140
He had some weird names for them.
I think he called them.

2650
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:47,993
Uh,
what did you call machine elves and 

2651
02:06:50,481 --> 02:06:54,620
hyperspace.
He believed that they were entities.

2652
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:58,010
He believed that they were living 
entities and that you were communicating

2653
02:06:58,011 --> 02:06:59,060
with each other.

2654
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:02,490
No words.
I could believe that.

2655
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:03,503
I think there are clearly hallucinations
because there are just things like I 

2656
02:07:06,271 --> 02:07:09,300
would open my eyes and then there was a 
river in the middle of the,

2657
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,210
of the room between me and the other 
people sitting there.

2658
02:07:12,211 --> 02:07:15,410
Like I'd seen no reason to assume that 
that actually was a river a,

2659
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:16,283
but maybe it was anyway.
But where it comes to like souls and 

2660
02:07:19,741 --> 02:07:20,574
where it starts getting really woo woo 
is when I could feel the tug of going 

2661
02:07:23,851 --> 02:07:28,500
into a particular place like the woman's
head or something like I could feel.

2662
02:07:28,501 --> 02:07:31,680
There were moments where I was having 
lots of fun and I was thinking,

2663
02:07:32,810 --> 02:07:33,320
Oh,
is this,

2664
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:34,500
oh this is,
oh,

2665
02:07:34,501 --> 02:07:37,270
this is going to be enjoyable.
And then some I would just,

2666
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:40,600
a wave of dread would wash over me and I
was like,

2667
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:42,550
ended up start to feel like I was going 
to vomit.

2668
02:07:42,551 --> 02:07:43,990
And then I'd be like,
oh,

2669
02:07:43,991 --> 02:07:45,440
okay,
I have to take this shit seriously.

2670
02:07:45,441 --> 02:07:49,000
And I'd sit upright and I'd.
And I'd take a deep breath.

2671
02:07:49,390 --> 02:07:50,223
And that I can imagine,
I think is what he's sort of talking 

2672
02:07:52,061 --> 02:07:52,491
about.
Right.

2673
02:07:52,491 --> 02:07:53,760
And maybe that's like something like 
that.

2674
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:54,653
One of the things to make the really 
powerful distinction is Mckenna was 

2675
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:00,670
specifically talking about dmt.
That's what he was into.

2676
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:04,440
She wasn't really into Iowasca.
His brother Dennis is really an Oscar.

2677
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:05,283
And his brother Dennis really 
recommended that I do it and I probably 

2678
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:08,830
will eventually.
I'm sure it will,

2679
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:12,830
but terrence was into the hardcore 
version and it was.

2680
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,220
It's a apparently you can't.
Well,

2681
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:17,820
I know from the hardcore version of it 
you're not.

2682
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:21,040
You're not escaping.
Like once you're locked in,

2683
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:22,700
you're gone.
Like it's.

2684
02:08:22,701 --> 02:08:25,510
It's way more potent.
Way more potent.

2685
02:08:25,511 --> 02:08:26,960
Yeah.
I got to try it and see the difference.

2686
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:27,820
The,
the,

2687
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:28,653
the,
what you're experiencing when you're 

2688
02:08:29,951 --> 02:08:30,784
having the Iowasca trip is a,
this emo a inhibitor allowing you to 

2689
02:08:36,401 --> 02:08:37,234
have this prolonged slow release dmt 
trip so you're not getting shot through 

2690
02:08:42,641 --> 02:08:45,370
a fucking cannon to the center of the 
universe.

2691
02:08:45,450 --> 02:08:45,961
No,
sure.

2692
02:08:45,961 --> 02:08:48,900
But people have been using this for 
thousands of years and believing that it

2693
02:08:48,901 --> 02:08:51,750
is opening a portal to some kind of 
spirit of winter,

2694
02:08:51,751 --> 02:08:52,400
so it's not okay.

2695
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,233
Saying there's a difference between what
Mckenna's describing as what you 

2696
02:08:55,451 --> 02:08:56,284
experienced.
Yep.

2697
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:57,610
Got It.
And what I've experienced,

2698
02:08:57,660 --> 02:08:58,493
but presumably Mckenna's Mckenna's 
theories can be extrapolated to Iowasca 

2699
02:09:01,830 --> 02:09:02,930
as well as the MTA.
Sure.

2700
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:03,450
He goes,
yeah,

2701
02:09:03,450 --> 02:09:04,140
yeah,
yeah,

2702
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:04,973
definitely.

2703
02:09:05,310 --> 02:09:06,143
But I think that you're getting a much 
more watered down version of it when 

2704
02:09:09,301 --> 02:09:10,134
you're doing,
which is one of the reasons why people 

2705
02:09:11,791 --> 02:09:13,620
can sustain it for many,
many hours.

2706
02:09:14,130 --> 02:09:15,690
I mean,
I'm just trying to figure out what the,

2707
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:20,750
what the competing claims about this,
this dimension that we're accessing A.

2708
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:21,770
Right.
You know,

2709
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:24,870
on the one hand you've got a,
a Penn Jillette who's saying,

2710
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,100
well,
it's just all in your district

2711
02:09:26,110 --> 02:09:26,943
guard.
What he's saying.

2712
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:28,083
He hasn't experienced it.
If he experienced it and he was 

2713
02:09:29,651 --> 02:09:30,670
dismissing it,
I would be like,

2714
02:09:30,671 --> 02:09:32,140
wow,
he must have got some weak shit.

2715
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:32,860
I mean,
the,

2716
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,430
the,
the,

2717
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:34,263
what's compelling to me,
what I was just saying about the 

2718
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:38,800
conclusions that people have after they 
come off of these kinds of experiences.

2719
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:44,130
No one has ever had one of these 
experiences and come out of it and said,

2720
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:46,330
wow,
I really felt like I was.

2721
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,580
I got an insight into the true meaning 
of life.

2722
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:50,710
And the meaning of life is I should hate
Jews.

2723
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:51,963
You know,
or like no one has ever become more 

2724
02:09:53,501 --> 02:09:56,290
petty.
You all of the experiences.

2725
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:57,701
Well,
not that I know of,

2726
02:09:57,701 --> 02:10:01,930
most certainly everyone who I know will 
have or have read of who have had,

2727
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:02,813
who've had these kinds of experiences 
tend to come out with similar 

2728
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:08,200
intellectual conclusions that we are all
one.

2729
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,900
That life is precious,
that,

2730
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:11,773
uh,
you know,

2731
02:10:11,950 --> 02:10:14,290
consciousness is divine,
that love is important.

2732
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,153
All these kinds of things which 
indicates to me that it's more that 

2733
02:10:19,301 --> 02:10:21,340
makes it more plausible than it would 
otherwise be.

2734
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:22,203
That you're actually viewing something 
that exists rather than merely having 

2735
02:10:25,811 --> 02:10:26,710
your brain stood up

2736
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,673
but isn't impossible.
That just does just stripping away the 

2737
02:10:30,471 --> 02:10:35,300
normal boundaries of consciousness,
reveal the positive aspects of the human

2738
02:10:35,301 --> 02:10:36,134
nature and you take away all of our 
insecurities and have all of our 

2739
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:41,053
biological necessity of survival and all
these different things that sort of 

2740
02:10:43,551 --> 02:10:47,750
motivate us and sexual impulses and 
desires and fears.

2741
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:48,673
Strip all that stuff away with 
dimethyltryptamine and all of a sudden 

2742
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:54,620
you reveal what the human soul really,
essentially.

2743
02:10:54,650 --> 02:10:57,200
Yes,
but why is the human soul based on love?

2744
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,633
Well,
because love is probably the thing that 

2745
02:11:00,591 --> 02:11:01,424
makes us most connected and makes us 
most productive and makes us feel the 

2746
02:11:05,271 --> 02:11:06,530
best.
You know,

2747
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:09,740
you don't feel good if you're successful
in the loan.

2748
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:11,900
It's one of the weirdest things about 
being a person.

2749
02:11:11,901 --> 02:11:12,734
If you gave a person all the money in 
the world and all the tools and toys in 

2750
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:17,060
the world and all the gadgets and 
Gizmos,

2751
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:19,220
but you left them by themselves on the 
moon,

2752
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:21,470
they'd probably want to blow their 
fucking brains out.

2753
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:22,520
You,
you.

2754
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:26,420
We don't exist in a vacuum.
We exist as a super organism.

2755
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,570
This is something that Anthony Robbins 
that make sense?

2756
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:30,450
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

2757
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:32,130
I mean,
it's almost.

2758
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:33,573
It becomes back to.
It's almost semantic between that end 

2759
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:38,160
having an insight into another 
dimension,

2760
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:42,660
because if what you're saying is that 
fundamentally at the core of all of us,

2761
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:47,250
once you strip everything else away is a
kind of beating heart of deep,

2762
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:50,040
glowing and abiding,
connected love.

2763
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:51,653
We'll just call that the other dimension
then because that's spooky in and of 

2764
02:11:53,461 --> 02:11:53,900
itself.

2765
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:56,840
That other dimension would.
It feels like when you're doing dmt,

2766
02:11:56,841 --> 02:11:59,130
is that the way?
I describe it as it's you.

2767
02:11:59,140 --> 02:11:59,973
You're in this infinite realm of complex
geometric patterns that are made out of 

2768
02:12:03,711 --> 02:12:08,150
love and understanding and that you and 
by understanding I mean like wisdom,

2769
02:12:08,151 --> 02:12:08,984
like they see you can't bullshit them.
You're exposed Ra and what you are and 

2770
02:12:13,491 --> 02:12:14,324
what you have been as exposed raw and 
your personality and your life and your 

2771
02:12:17,181 --> 02:12:18,014
culture is stripped away and you're left
with your soul or whatever we think of 

2772
02:12:21,921 --> 02:12:22,880
as soul.
Again,

2773
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:24,410
waited words,
weird words,

2774
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:25,603
but ultimately that feeling of love does
come out of everybody like and I think 

2775
02:12:30,981 --> 02:12:31,814
that that's probably at the root of what
makes us want to be connected with each 

2776
02:12:35,511 --> 02:12:36,344
other.
That's why you do feel bad when you're 

2777
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,593
just alone for long periods of time.
You don't connect with people and it's 

2778
02:12:42,351 --> 02:12:43,184
probably good to be alone occasionally,
but ultimately you want to get back to 

2779
02:12:45,621 --> 02:12:46,454
people and you want to get back to 
people that you care about in the love 

2780
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:50,000
because you,
you,

2781
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:52,260
you bond with them.
You mom.

2782
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:53,943
You do that thing that happens when you 
go into the DMT world where you connect 

2783
02:12:56,481 --> 02:12:59,690
with everything in it and it sucks you 
in and as you let go,

2784
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:02,930
it bathes you with that loving,
weird,

2785
02:13:02,931 --> 02:13:04,790
strange,
all knowing,

2786
02:13:04,791 --> 02:13:05,624
feeling

2787
02:13:07,410 --> 02:13:11,550
Anthony Robbins has an interesting line 
that you reminded me of the beginning of

2788
02:13:11,551 --> 02:13:12,384
the show when you were talking,
when you were joking about how you'll 

2789
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:16,920
always feel unfulfilled and like you 
know the moment you do a podcast,

2790
02:13:16,921 --> 02:13:18,980
you need to just focus on the next one 
and get the next one done.

2791
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:20,143
A which is that he,
he feels like the greatest failures are 

2792
02:13:23,311 --> 02:13:25,290
successful people who don't feel 
fulfilled,

2793
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,153
that he would much rather see an 
unsuccessful fulfilled person than a 

2794
02:13:30,571 --> 02:13:32,190
successful,
unfulfilled

2795
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,023
person.
Let me step in here because Anthony 

2796
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:37,980
Robins,
his greatest success,

2797
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:43,430
Robin's his greatest success,
is teaching people to be successful.

2798
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:48,060
So he must said to be fulfilled.
He must feel fulfilled.

2799
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:49,313
Teaching people how to be successful.
I think he would say that he teaches 

2800
02:13:52,141 --> 02:13:53,370
them how to be fulfilled.
Okay.

2801
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:57,540
What has he done?
What has he dies?

2802
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:59,940
Teach people how to feel fulfilled.
Yeah.

2803
02:13:59,941 --> 02:14:01,650
That's his vision of fulfillment.
How much,

2804
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:05,250
uh,
amazing creative work of literature,

2805
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:06,084
of fiction,
of how much stuff has anthony robins 

2806
02:14:08,671 --> 02:14:09,990
done?
How many movies is he made?

2807
02:14:09,991 --> 02:14:11,910
How many,
how many paintings has he done?

2808
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:16,560
How many things is he created out of?
Nothing that he's super happy with.

2809
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:18,420
No,
his none.

2810
02:14:18,421 --> 02:14:19,680
His.
He's not a creative artist.

2811
02:14:19,681 --> 02:14:22,170
His life mission is to help people get 
fulfilled.

2812
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:26,520
So him talking about creative people 
being fulfilled.

2813
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:28,013
Fundamentally,
I don't think he understands what I'm 

2814
02:14:30,601 --> 02:14:31,434
saying.

2815
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:33,090
Like am I fulfilled?
Yeah,

2816
02:14:33,091 --> 02:14:33,924
I mean is it great that we have 830 
whatever podcast in a bunch of people 

2817
02:14:36,971 --> 02:14:37,860
like,
absolutely,

2818
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:41,100
but what is fulfilled me and am I,
am I content?

2819
02:14:41,101 --> 02:14:43,820
Can I sit back and relax and enjoy it?
No,

2820
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:44,663
because part of what makes you good at 
something is that you're constantly 

2821
02:14:48,271 --> 02:14:49,104
assessing whether or not it's good and 
you're constantly objectively and 

2822
02:14:52,861 --> 02:14:56,580
introspectively analyzing it and 
breaking it down and chopping it up.

2823
02:14:56,850 --> 02:14:57,683
Dude,
I just got through doing a Netflix 

2824
02:14:58,951 --> 02:14:59,784
special.
It's going to air in October and I had 

2825
02:15:01,651 --> 02:15:04,860
to edit it.
It's fucking awful.

2826
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:05,933
Doing that.
Chewing away at your work and trying to 

2827
02:15:08,641 --> 02:15:10,560
figure out what you can do.
What's better.

2828
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:12,570
Can I cut this out?
Should I leave this here?

2829
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:16,410
And ultimately what I decided to do is I
did four shows so I could do one of them

2830
02:15:16,411 --> 02:15:20,100
almost completely in its entirety and 
they'll like in and do it that way,

2831
02:15:20,101 --> 02:15:22,230
but I know other people think it's 
funny.

2832
02:15:22,230 --> 02:15:24,480
I know the people that were there,
I got a standing ovation.

2833
02:15:24,481 --> 02:15:26,580
I know they loved it.
I fucking hate everything.

2834
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:28,350
I don't know.
I don't mean hate,

2835
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:29,393
but I mean you're there,
but there's a constant search for the 

2836
02:15:33,241 --> 02:15:34,074
right beats and the right things and 
it's not a matter of not being 

2837
02:15:36,481 --> 02:15:38,250
fulfilled.
I'm a very fulfilled person.

2838
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:41,490
It's a matter of never really liking 
anything that I do.

2839
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:42,533
Never really loving it and they're 
always this constant need to make it 

2840
02:15:45,781 --> 02:15:47,610
better.
This constant state of.

2841
02:15:47,890 --> 02:15:48,723
And the most people that I find that are
really super happy with everything they 

2842
02:15:51,691 --> 02:15:53,250
do,
they usually suck.

2843
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:55,800
That's true.
Yeah.

2844
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:56,760
No,
I mean I'm like you,

2845
02:15:56,761 --> 02:15:57,594
I never.
That's why it takes me forever to write 

2846
02:15:58,891 --> 02:16:03,110
and I never meet writing deadlines 
because I always hate what I want.

2847
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:06,120
I produced why you're good.
Anthony Robbins is a great guy.

2848
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:06,953
I.
I appreciate him very much and I 

2849
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:13,130
listened to his motivational books on 
tape when I was a fighter.

2850
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:14,573
I used to listen to that.
I have fucking one of those walkman 

2851
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:20,340
cassette things and I bought his books.
I listened to his stuff.

2852
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:24,030
Ultimately though,
and this is not to dismiss him,

2853
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:27,690
what he does is write about success.
That's right.

2854
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:28,583
And he wants people to be successful,
so that's what he thinks of his 

2855
02:16:30,761 --> 02:16:31,594
fulfillment.
But if Anthony robins decided to write 

2856
02:16:33,041 --> 02:16:35,230
some great work of fiction,
then I could listen to him.

2857
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:36,503
Anthony Robbins sat down and came up 
with this fucking amazing movie and 

2858
02:16:38,861 --> 02:16:41,740
produced it and it's some saifai 
masterpiece.

2859
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:43,780
Then I could understand,
but he's not doing that,

2860
02:16:43,810 --> 02:16:44,643
but don't coaches.
I mean this isn't the defendant Anthony 

2861
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:47,943
Robbins a hour,
but don't coach like you can be a great 

2862
02:16:51,191 --> 02:16:53,380
coach without being good at the thing 
that you're coaching people on.

2863
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:55,420
Absolutely.
And sometimes that's useful to.

2864
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:56,300
Oh sure,
yeah.

2865
02:16:56,300 --> 02:17:00,070
No screenwriting coaches.
Robert Mckee runs his three day seminar.

2866
02:17:00,071 --> 02:17:00,904
Incredibly invaluable.
If anyone wants to write a screenplay 

2867
02:17:02,750 --> 02:17:06,400
who's out there do robot Mckay's a 
seminar.

2868
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:09,340
He's never written a screenplay in his 
entire life.

2869
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:10,660
No,
he's not a good screen writer,

2870
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:13,510
but he understands that he,
he's the first to say that,

2871
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:15,550
but you know what?
All the big studios,

2872
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:17,010
uh,
pay for their,

2873
02:17:17,050 --> 02:17:18,850
for their script readers to go to his 
seminar.

2874
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:21,130
You know where that doesn't work.
Stand up.

2875
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:22,713
There are no,
there are no standup coaches that are 

2876
02:17:25,481 --> 02:17:26,590
any good.
No,

2877
02:17:26,591 --> 02:17:28,930
that's true.
That's true.

2878
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:32,380
Isn't it weird?
It's terrible.

2879
02:17:32,381 --> 02:17:35,540
Comedians that fail and then they start 
to make stand.

2880
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:38,290
It's like the standup class but,
and you're like,

2881
02:17:38,300 --> 02:17:39,310
well,
I'm sorry,

2882
02:17:39,311 --> 02:17:40,770
what do you know about them?

2883
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,720
What?
And if you ever watched them do standup,

2884
02:17:42,750 --> 02:17:43,583
you want to fucking shoot yourself.
There was a couple of people that wrote 

2885
02:17:46,471 --> 02:17:48,780
books about standing up and they were 
all awful,

2886
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:50,010
awful comics.

2887
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:53,640
There's one guy who was really helpful 
to me when I started doing standup,

2888
02:17:53,650 --> 02:17:56,070
but not that I've ever been successful 
at doing standup because I didn't pursue

2889
02:17:56,071 --> 02:17:56,904
it.
But he was really helpful to me in New 

2890
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:00,210
York when I first got there.
But apart from that,

2891
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,740
yeah,
I completely agree.

2892
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:03,920
It basically he was just a good joke 
writer,

2893
02:18:03,921 --> 02:18:06,900
so he was good at whittling down a 
concept into a punchline.

2894
02:18:06,930 --> 02:18:08,520
But the people that are good at.

2895
02:18:08,860 --> 02:18:09,411
Yeah,
and you,

2896
02:18:09,411 --> 02:18:10,244
you could learn from friends,
but I've never seen a really good comic 

2897
02:18:13,670 --> 02:18:15,570
teach a course like David towels there.

2898
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:17,150
You just stand up.
That's.

2899
02:18:17,151 --> 02:18:18,350
You know what I mean?
That's right.

2900
02:18:18,710 --> 02:18:22,580
Well be yourself.
I mean like I love the idea.

2901
02:18:22,581 --> 02:18:23,414
I've had so many conversations with,
with successful creative people who I 

2902
02:18:26,901 --> 02:18:29,990
admire that I couldn't believe that I 
still ever doubt this advice,

2903
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:32,750
but it's the most consistent advice that
I get from creative people.

2904
02:18:32,751 --> 02:18:33,584
I like anytime they try to do something 
which is calculated to appeal to a 

2905
02:18:39,441 --> 02:18:40,274
particular demographic or which is based
on notes that other people have given 

2906
02:18:42,801 --> 02:18:45,320
them or which is intended to fill a 
particular niche,

2907
02:18:45,710 --> 02:18:46,543
it falls flat on its face and every time
they do something that is for them that 

2908
02:18:50,211 --> 02:18:52,550
they love,
that has an audience of one,

2909
02:18:52,850 --> 02:18:53,683
which is them.
And it's true to them and it speaks to 

2910
02:18:55,791 --> 02:18:58,130
them and it's idiosyncratic and 
particular.

2911
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:00,290
It kills.
It's so true.

2912
02:19:00,291 --> 02:19:01,060
But

2913
02:19:01,060 --> 02:19:04,780
here's the rub.
You have to learn how to be yourself.

2914
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:07,630
That's right.
And that takes a long fucking time.

2915
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:08,593
Right?
I think back when I was 21 when I first 

2916
02:19:10,421 --> 02:19:11,254
started doing standup and I'm horrified 
that anybody let me onstage because I 

2917
02:19:16,301 --> 02:19:18,580
didn't know anything.
I didn't know who I was.

2918
02:19:18,581 --> 02:19:21,040
I didn't know what my thoughts on things
were.

2919
02:19:21,310 --> 02:19:24,490
I was just terrified trying to get 
laughs.

2920
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:27,680
So I was trying to figure out what would
make people laugh.

2921
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:28,933
I had no idea what I thought was funny 
other than what I saw that made me 

2922
02:19:31,941 --> 02:19:33,860
laugh.
I couldn't break it down.

2923
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:38,360
Like if I went to see a Sam kinison or 
Jerry Seinfeld or something like that,

2924
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:41,360
I knew they were hilarious.
They made me laugh.

2925
02:19:41,361 --> 02:19:43,730
I could repeat the joke to you.
I can say,

2926
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:45,260
Oh my God,
I saw Seinfeld.

2927
02:19:45,261 --> 02:19:47,180
Let me tell you his joke and I could 
tell you.

2928
02:19:47,181 --> 02:19:50,780
And I knew it was funny,
but I didn't know how to do it.

2929
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:52,083
I just clumsily concocted my own 
versions of different subjects that I 

2930
02:19:58,341 --> 02:20:01,850
thought could possibly be funny and then
over time,

2931
02:20:01,851 --> 02:20:04,700
slowly but surely figured out how to 
actually be funny,

2932
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:05,803
but along the lines I had a fail 
miserably and learn and feel pain and 

2933
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:13,640
heartbreak and all the bullshit that 
people go to before I started forming my

2934
02:20:13,641 --> 02:20:15,410
own actual opinions on things.

2935
02:20:15,550 --> 02:20:18,530
I think that's a really good point 
because sometimes one day I was,

2936
02:20:18,550 --> 02:20:23,350
I was a late bloomer and figuring out 
who I am as a creative person.

2937
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:25,990
Do you know now I don't know what the 
fuck I am.

2938
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:26,830
Well,
you know,

2939
02:20:26,830 --> 02:20:29,470
to to her closest approximation that 
you're able to,

2940
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:31,093
that,
that you're able to land so your 

2941
02:20:32,950 --> 02:20:35,110
audience knows who Joe Rogan is.
Put it that way.

2942
02:20:35,111 --> 02:20:36,580
Right.
And that's enough.

2943
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:39,340
Some of them do,
some of them are mad.

2944
02:20:39,341 --> 02:20:44,341
I thought you were different,
but I think fun of ignore them,

2945
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:45,313
make fun of.
My mother was like reading the comments 

2946
02:20:46,991 --> 02:20:47,824
section of a website,
but it I think some of sometimes one of 

2947
02:20:51,281 --> 02:20:52,114
the differences between people who 
peaked early into successful young 

2948
02:20:54,701 --> 02:20:55,534
versus people who are better later in 
life is just how just how long does it 

2949
02:20:58,271 --> 02:20:59,104
take you to really get grounded in who 
you are and to stop trying on these 

2950
02:21:03,341 --> 02:21:04,174
different kind of invisible cloaks of 
personalities that you think you might 

2951
02:21:06,941 --> 02:21:09,850
be until you can strip all that away and
then you're like,

2952
02:21:09,851 --> 02:21:10,960
okay,
I think this is.

2953
02:21:11,470 --> 02:21:13,600
I think this is the real.
It's the same with podcasting as well.

2954
02:21:13,601 --> 02:21:14,434
Like I,
I used to host stuff and try to get it 

2955
02:21:16,631 --> 02:21:20,560
up and do radio bits in Australia and I 
if I listened back to them now,

2956
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,600
it's so effected.
It's so.

2957
02:21:22,601 --> 02:21:23,434
It's so not.
It's so me trying to be me on radio 

2958
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:28,060
instead of just made.
Yeah,

2959
02:21:29,470 --> 02:21:31,480
you gotta be you.
Yeah.

2960
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:32,773
I think the thing that happens also with
the peaking early thing is success 

2961
02:21:35,961 --> 02:21:36,794
itself is the poison or of creativity.
A success itself like you all of a 

2962
02:21:42,751 --> 02:21:43,584
sudden you have it.
That's one of the reasons why I don't 

2963
02:21:45,201 --> 02:21:47,830
believe Anthony Robbins is correct,
is like this,

2964
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:51,140
this idea of like being satisfied and 
being fulfilled.

2965
02:21:51,141 --> 02:21:52,130
Like I mean,
sure,

2966
02:21:52,131 --> 02:21:54,590
I'm satisfied and fulfilled.
Absolutely.

2967
02:21:54,591 --> 02:21:55,424
But the whole thing about the,
this creative process is you can never 

2968
02:22:00,471 --> 02:22:01,304
totally be happy with what you're doing 
or what you've done because you've got 

2969
02:22:04,691 --> 02:22:07,010
to do more shit.
Especially standups.

2970
02:22:07,011 --> 02:22:10,730
Like if you're a musician and you're the
rolling stones and you have a catalog.

2971
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:12,440
Fuck man.
You could tour forever.

2972
02:22:12,650 --> 02:22:15,500
You don't need to write a new song ever.
But if you're a standup,

2973
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:18,950
I put out a new special every year and a
half every two years,

2974
02:22:18,951 --> 02:22:21,110
whatever it is.
And if I don't do that,

2975
02:22:21,111 --> 02:22:25,320
I feel like a fucking piece of shit.
And if I try to do the same jokes,

2976
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,160
uh,
five

2977
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,220
years in a row,
six years in a row,

2978
02:22:29,221 --> 02:22:32,070
10 years in a row,
we all know comics that do that.

2979
02:22:32,071 --> 02:22:32,904
You go to see them and they're doing the
same bits word for word for decades and 

2980
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:39,890
decades and never put anything out that 
doesn't go for the.

2981
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:42,220
I got back to the comedy cellar in New 
York sometimes in the,

2982
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:43,063
you know,
the emcee will be doing the same shtick 

2983
02:22:43,891 --> 02:22:46,170
that he was doing 10 years ago when I 
first came to New York.

2984
02:22:46,171 --> 02:22:47,004
I'm like,
that guy is still doing the same 

2985
02:22:48,391 --> 02:22:50,190
material.
I mean,

2986
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:54,420
in one respect I can sort of understand 
it because if you're like take music,

2987
02:22:54,421 --> 02:22:56,780
maybe not the rolling stones,
but say Hansard,

2988
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:00,030
you can just do embalm every single time
you go anyway.

2989
02:23:00,031 --> 02:23:01,870
And that's all you need to do for the 
rest of your life.

2990
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:05,810
And in comedy there are people like,
like sometimes audiences want it,

2991
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:06,030
right?

2992
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:08,990
Sometimes I'll do that bit about blahdy 
Blah.

2993
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:12,000
Grandma sucks,
which is fine.

2994
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:12,983
You mean Jerry Seinfeld did that one 
thing I'm telling you for the last time 

2995
02:23:16,570 --> 02:23:19,200
I saw him and Sydney.
Yeah.

2996
02:23:19,230 --> 02:23:20,550
Nothing wrong with that,
but,

2997
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:21,463
but then he tied all of that material.
But like if you go to see a guy like 

2998
02:23:24,811 --> 02:23:27,960
bill burr,
you see bill burger special and then you

2999
02:23:27,961 --> 02:23:32,961
go see him like a year later you're 
gonna see a whole new set every time.

3000
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:36,350
And that's the same with Ari Shaffir at 
the same,

3001
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:37,410
you know,
fill in the blank,

3002
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:41,250
yet every single essentially,
I mean touring comedian now,

3003
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:42,233
to be fair to Anthony Robbins,
I don't think that he's saying that you 

3004
02:23:44,161 --> 02:23:47,220
should just be sit on your laurels and 
not strive.

3005
02:23:47,221 --> 02:23:48,480
And it's interesting.
You know what I mean?

3006
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:49,493
What he's saying is,
will know the story of like the person 

3007
02:23:51,601 --> 02:23:55,020
who wanted a Ferrari and wanting to,
wanting to sexy wife and wanted the best

3008
02:23:55,021 --> 02:23:55,854
job and wanting to make a million 
dollars and then gets it and finds 

3009
02:23:58,561 --> 02:24:01,950
themselves miserable,
connected to exactly.

3010
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:03,300
They're not connected to what they 
really want.

3011
02:24:03,301 --> 02:24:06,810
That's what he's doing.
He doesn't mean being self satisfied.

3012
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:07,644
It means he means being genuinely 
fulfilled by the things that you're 

3013
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:11,243
aspiring to do with your life and to get
up to in the world where there are a 

3014
02:24:14,671 --> 02:24:15,504
bunch of things that we think we want 
and what they are is really just these 

3015
02:24:18,361 --> 02:24:21,570
unattainable goals that seem like 
they're unattainable.

3016
02:24:21,571 --> 02:24:22,710
And then once we attain them,
we go,

3017
02:24:22,711 --> 02:24:23,640
well,
well the now what?

3018
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:24,503
Exactly.
And that's what happens to a lot of 

3019
02:24:25,231 --> 02:24:28,830
people when they get famous.
So a lot of comics in particular,

3020
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:33,150
they become famous and they are really 
good when they become famous,

3021
02:24:33,151 --> 02:24:36,450
like kinisons of my favorite all time 
example because I've,

3022
02:24:36,451 --> 02:24:40,460
I believe that Kennison from like 1984 
to 1986,

3023
02:24:40,461 --> 02:24:42,030
it was probably the greatest comic of 
all time.

3024
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:44,940
There was just a time where he was just 
a maniac.

3025
02:24:45,130 --> 02:24:47,460
He just was.
And it's hard because you've got to kind

3026
02:24:47,461 --> 02:24:48,294
of put it in the context of the time 
that there was no one like that back 

3027
02:24:50,341 --> 02:24:51,174
then because comedy is not like music.
Like you go listening to music from the 

3028
02:24:55,921 --> 02:24:58,350
19 sixties.
It's still really awesome.

3029
02:24:58,710 --> 02:25:01,530
Go try to listen to some mort Sahl from 
1960.

3030
02:25:01,531 --> 02:25:03,680
It's fucking terrible.
It doesn't mean that more.

3031
02:25:03,710 --> 02:25:05,910
Saul's not a brilliant comedian.
He's certainly was.

3032
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:08,820
Or Lenny Bruce Who's like the godfather 
of the whole thing.

3033
02:25:09,010 --> 02:25:09,843
If it wasn't for Lenny Bruce,
no one today would be doing the same 

3034
02:25:12,181 --> 02:25:13,450
kind of standup.
It just,

3035
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:14,690
it wouldn't have existed.
It's,

3036
02:25:14,691 --> 02:25:15,524
it's an art form that almost,
that he in many ways sort of gave birth 

3037
02:25:19,471 --> 02:25:20,430
to.
Well,

3038
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:22,770
go listen to that stuff today.
It doesn't hold up.

3039
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:24,310
Comedy doesn't necessarily

3040
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:25,143
hold up.
So in some ways kinison doesn't totally 

3041
02:25:27,161 --> 02:25:27,994
hold up when you go back and understand 
that I'm a bit hard to grasp from 

3042
02:25:31,031 --> 02:25:34,540
today's vantage point I must say,
but during the time,

3043
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,160
this is a.
I've told this story before,

3044
02:25:36,161 --> 02:25:39,010
unfortunately.
So everybody who heard it gather around,

3045
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:40,383
there was a girl that I worked with.
I was working at the Boston Athletic 

3046
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:43,833
Club.
I was 19 years old and there was this 

3047
02:25:44,741 --> 02:25:47,140
girl that was working at the front desk.
She was hilarious.

3048
02:25:47,141 --> 02:25:50,590
She was like really?
Like this big athletic girl.

3049
02:25:50,591 --> 02:25:54,400
And she was just always like boys jurist
and joking around about stuff.

3050
02:25:54,401 --> 02:25:55,234
And she was awesome.
I really wish I stayed in touch with 

3051
02:25:56,471 --> 02:25:57,380
her.
But uh,

3052
02:25:58,290 --> 02:26:00,250
I don't know her name anymore.
I don't remember her name,

3053
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:03,160
but our member,
she told me about Sam Kennison.

3054
02:26:03,161 --> 02:26:03,994
She goes,
I saw this comedian on Hbo and now 

3055
02:26:05,111 --> 02:26:06,130
granted this is the back.

3056
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:08,290
And then there was like Hbo,
Fox,

3057
02:26:08,291 --> 02:26:09,430
NBC,
ABC,

3058
02:26:09,431 --> 02:26:12,280
there was nothing and maybe cinemax,
right?

3059
02:26:13,090 --> 02:26:18,090
She did that bit about a homosexual 
necrophiliac paying money to spend a few

3060
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:22,660
hours undisturbed.
But the freshest male corpses,

3061
02:26:22,661 --> 02:26:23,494
you know,
that Ben,

3062
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:28,180
there was a bit about a real story that 
Kennison had heard were these,

3063
02:26:28,181 --> 02:26:30,100
uh,
apparently this is a real issue.

3064
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:31,203
And I'm Joey Diaz knows a guy who walked
in on this mortician that was fucking 

3065
02:26:38,261 --> 02:26:39,094
his mom after his mom was dead.
Apparently people have done this and 

3066
02:26:43,931 --> 02:26:44,764
that.
They treat people's bodies like a sex 

3067
02:26:46,931 --> 02:26:48,250
doll.
And it's Joey Diaz,

3068
02:26:48,251 --> 02:26:50,650
the kind of guy who'd make that shit up 
because that sounds.

3069
02:26:50,651 --> 02:26:50,891
No,
no,

3070
02:26:50,891 --> 02:26:51,041
no,
no,

3071
02:26:51,041 --> 02:26:51,320
no,
no,

3072
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:51,980
no.
Listen,

3073
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:54,880
guys got arrested.
These guys went in the kinison story.

3074
02:26:54,881 --> 02:26:56,650
They got arrested because he's 
morticians.

3075
02:26:56,770 --> 02:26:57,603
We're accepting money from these people 
that would come in and fuck these 

3076
02:26:59,651 --> 02:26:59,890
courts.

3077
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:00,750
I mean,
if it's a stranger,

3078
02:27:00,751 --> 02:27:02,230
I understand.
I do that in a heartbeat.

3079
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:03,750
But if.
But my mother.

3080
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:04,983
Well the guy wasn't fucking his mom.
He was fucking someone else's friend's 

3081
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:10,480
mom.
This mortician was fucking sign anyway.

3082
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:12,580
I'm pretty sure it was.
Joey told me that.

3083
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:13,780
I hope it was.
Anyway,

3084
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:17,380
point is this girl does this bit for me.
She goes,

3085
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:19,600
it's because the way kinison do it.
He goes,

3086
02:27:19,601 --> 02:27:20,650
imagine.
He goes,

3087
02:27:20,651 --> 02:27:22,400
you're lying there.
You're on the slab.

3088
02:27:22,401 --> 02:27:23,234
You Go,
well,

3089
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:24,093
well had a good time in life.
Now I guess I'm going to go to heaven 

3090
02:27:26,081 --> 02:27:28,750
and be with Jesus and then says,
rocking back and forth.

3091
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:31,040
You and she's doing this on the floor in
the.

3092
02:27:31,210 --> 02:27:34,180
On the parking lot on the ground.
She's lying on her stomach

3093
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:35,300
going,
hey,

3094
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:38,610
it feels like someone's fucking me in 
the Oh,

3095
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:39,473
you mean live keeps fucking in the ass.
Even after your dad didn't have never 

3096
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:44,013
ends.

3097
02:27:45,510 --> 02:27:46,343
I am laughing my ass off,
but this girl doing this in the parking 

3098
02:27:48,991 --> 02:27:53,991
lot and I went out and I believe I got 
it on vhs cassette because again,

3099
02:27:54,151 --> 02:27:54,984
this is 86.
It was before I'd ever done standup and 

3100
02:27:58,380 --> 02:28:03,180
I watched his hbo special and I went,
Holy Shit.

3101
02:28:03,181 --> 02:28:05,930
Like I didn't even know that was comedy.
I didn't know someone could.

3102
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:08,220
I thought comedy was evening at the 
Improv.

3103
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:12,530
Guys would roll up their sleeves.
Do you ever notice set up punchline?

3104
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:13,373
Yeah,
and this guy was doing this completely 

3105
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:19,920
radical version of that with a bra on 
and a trench coat.

3106
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:21,860
I was like,
what the is this,

3107
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:23,143
and he was so good for a short period of
time and then I went to see him alive 

3108
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,963
when I first got into comedy around 1988
and he had already slid way off the 

3109
02:28:33,501 --> 02:28:34,334
rails and he was just partying all the 
time and doing coke and bang and 

3110
02:28:37,761 --> 02:28:38,480
strippers.

3111
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:40,190
He's on heroin as well with me.
No,

3112
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:41,233
I don't believe so.
I think he's pretty much just a coca 

3113
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:45,620
probably did heroin probably did 
everything you put in front of them.

3114
02:28:45,690 --> 02:28:47,540
You know Sam Kennison.
He was an animal.

3115
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:50,930
He even joked around about that,
about people expected them to do drugs.

3116
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:52,740
He's here,
he's here,

3117
02:28:52,741 --> 02:28:53,574
could cut the biggest line in the world 
and even doing his heart would be 

3118
02:28:55,880 --> 02:28:58,250
beating out of his chest.
I want to say no.

3119
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:00,113
Well also it would be bad for his image.
He sort of became a prisoner of his own 

3120
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:05,653
image.
He created this persona and then it 

3121
02:29:06,921 --> 02:29:07,754
became a prisoner to that persona,
but he just stopped writing and stopped 

3122
02:29:10,821 --> 02:29:11,654
being funny and he's hanging out with 
celebrities and he's going to parties 

3123
02:29:13,821 --> 02:29:16,790
and he's not not hungry anymore,
not doing the work.

3124
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:17,624
And he went from being one of the best 
ever to being like an open mic or is 

3125
02:29:21,231 --> 02:29:23,240
caricature of who he really was.

3126
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:27,360
We really didn't have any points and it 
was all just scream and all just,

3127
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:28,663
you know,
like trying to pick out a shocking 

3128
02:29:30,051 --> 02:29:31,490
subject.
But it wasn't really.

3129
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:33,530
It wasn't,
didn't really resonate with them.

3130
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:37,430
And I think with a lot of Comedians,
what's really important is a,

3131
02:29:37,431 --> 02:29:39,780
you are a regular person that you are,
you just,

3132
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:40,813
you can fit in with people and you 
understand people and a lot of people 

3133
02:29:44,121 --> 02:29:47,870
they become famous and then all of a 
sudden they get assistance and then they

3134
02:29:47,871 --> 02:29:48,621
get,
you know,

3135
02:29:48,621 --> 02:29:50,930
managers and agents shield them from the
world.

3136
02:29:50,931 --> 02:29:51,764
They have publicists to do all the 
talking for them and they get tucked 

3137
02:29:54,171 --> 02:29:55,004
away in an ivory tower and then they 
show up for interviews with sunglasses 

3138
02:29:57,831 --> 02:29:58,820
on.
And you know,

3139
02:29:58,821 --> 02:30:01,460
and they're,
they're all about maintaining.

3140
02:30:01,660 --> 02:30:02,493
Tell me about it.
I've interviewed enough of those on the 

3141
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:04,391
live.
Yeah.

3142
02:30:04,391 --> 02:30:05,051
Well,
I mean,

3143
02:30:05,051 --> 02:30:08,290
not even necessarily Comedians,
but people who come on with that persona

3144
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:10,270
who are,
who are handled,

3145
02:30:10,271 --> 02:30:12,130
who have spent their entire lives being 
handled.

3146
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:14,470
Like,
give me an example.

3147
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:18,280
Roseanne Barr.
I brought her in here.

3148
02:30:18,281 --> 02:30:19,420
She was awesome.
Was She?

3149
02:30:19,570 --> 02:30:20,740
Yeah,
she got.

3150
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,430
Well you probably got her to open up.
I had,

3151
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:24,010
I had 25 minutes.

3152
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:27,230
Well I had three hours and she knows I'm
a huge fan.

3153
02:30:27,290 --> 02:30:32,290
I think Roseanne is probably one of the 
10 most important comedian.

3154
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:33,521
Oh,
absolutely.

3155
02:30:33,521 --> 02:30:34,354
I mean I'm a huge fan of actually the.
Did you see the documentary film that 

3156
02:30:36,761 --> 02:30:39,040
was made about her run for president?
No,

3157
02:30:39,350 --> 02:30:40,890
it's actually really interesting.
It's,

3158
02:30:40,891 --> 02:30:41,724
you know,
it's fascinating to see this person who 

3159
02:30:44,531 --> 02:30:45,364
was so groundbreaking and who,
who did so much comedy in for and for I 

3160
02:30:49,871 --> 02:30:54,370
guess the portrayal of women and that 
people and the working class on American

3161
02:30:54,371 --> 02:30:56,620
television wasn't totally different 
thing.

3162
02:30:56,630 --> 02:30:57,960
She was a totally different thing.
Yeah.

3163
02:30:57,980 --> 02:31:00,430
Just see her kind of puttering around 
her home in Hawaii,

3164
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:02,770
like trying to run for president as a 
green candidate.

3165
02:31:02,910 --> 02:31:04,840
It's.
It's an interesting documentary.

3166
02:31:04,990 --> 02:31:07,160
She had to set her straight about chem 
trail.

3167
02:31:07,161 --> 02:31:10,780
She believed the government was spraying
things in the sky reading.

3168
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:14,160
Maybe I read about that and maybe you 
tweeted about it or something,

3169
02:31:14,170 --> 02:31:15,003
but I remember reading about her and 
chem trails or maybe it was Brian 

3170
02:31:18,790 --> 02:31:20,820
Dunning's episode or did he reference 
that or something?

3171
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:22,530
There was something maybe skeptical.

3172
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:24,400
Maybe he might've.
I don't know.

3173
02:31:24,850 --> 02:31:26,320
I don't remember.
There's too many of them.

3174
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:29,710
They get it.
If I really remember it at all.

3175
02:31:29,711 --> 02:31:31,360
You know Dunbar's number.
Like there's.

3176
02:31:31,630 --> 02:31:32,463
There's only like certain amount of data
you can stuff in that fucking dome of 

3177
02:31:35,051 --> 02:31:35,980
yours.
Absolutely.

3178
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:37,480
And let it go.
Who Cares?

3179
02:31:37,481 --> 02:31:41,140
Who gives a shit how many homes it is,
but she was awesome on this show and she

3180
02:31:41,141 --> 02:31:43,510
didn't.
She didn't come in like handled it all.

3181
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:46,050
She came in by herself,
sat down,

3182
02:31:46,060 --> 02:31:47,320
shot the shit,
laughed,

3183
02:31:47,321 --> 02:31:48,154
joked around.

3184
02:31:48,190 --> 02:31:49,023
Interesting.
I mean fame you or met you were talking 

3185
02:31:50,681 --> 02:31:51,514
earlier about fame.
Like it can be incredibly alienating 

3186
02:31:54,641 --> 02:31:57,100
when you reach a certain.
What's your sweet spot of fame?

3187
02:31:57,101 --> 02:31:58,120
Because I,
you know,

3188
02:31:58,121 --> 02:31:58,670
I think I hit it

3189
02:31:58,670 --> 02:31:59,930
about a year and a half ago.
I'm trying,

3190
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:04,050
you know,
I wanna be able to go to the movies.

3191
02:32:04,370 --> 02:32:05,203
I can't think of anything worse than not
being able to get on a plane without 

3192
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:09,523
everybody.
Like I got on a plane a couple of years 

3193
02:32:11,251 --> 02:32:14,670
ago and Deniro was sitting in seat one 
Aa,

3194
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:17,100
so I don't know how he got on the plane,
how long he'd been on the plane,

3195
02:32:17,101 --> 02:32:19,390
but he wasn't here.
I didn't see him board.

3196
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:22,580
So I know Richie.
Oh yeah,

3197
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:23,453
we got on the plane

3198
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:26,580
already there.
I have no fucking idea.

3199
02:32:26,610 --> 02:32:27,980
He was already on the plane.
I'm like yeah,

3200
02:32:28,030 --> 02:32:29,520
I'm in the front of the line,
Bitch,

3201
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:31,260
get on that plane,
Lionel.

3202
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:34,400
So I was one of the first people that 
was one of the first people on the plane

3203
02:32:34,700 --> 02:32:37,430
and I also happened to be in first class
and the.

3204
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:40,080
And you hack your way into first class?
You son of them.

3205
02:32:40,081 --> 02:32:40,914
That actually someone,
a production company paid for me that I 

3206
02:32:42,351 --> 02:32:43,910
was shooting a pilot,
uh,

3207
02:32:43,911 --> 02:32:44,744
and so I was,
I was one of the first people on the 

3208
02:32:46,581 --> 02:32:47,414
plane and I was able to see the 
reactions of everybody walking past as 

3209
02:32:49,821 --> 02:32:50,654
they notice or don't notice that it's 
Robert Deniro sitting on the plane and 

3210
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:55,513
it's incredible to.
I mean his life is just a relentless 

3211
02:32:58,851 --> 02:33:02,090
stream of people acting weird.
Right?

3212
02:33:02,091 --> 02:33:02,924
I mean,
every single person who noticed him 

3213
02:33:04,251 --> 02:33:05,084
would do a double take gospel nudge,
unsubtly nudge the person who they're 

3214
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:14,260
traveling with and he has to sit there 
reading the newspaper,

3215
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:19,700
pretending that this is normal and he 
can say hello to him.

3216
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:22,340
But what a horrible,
normal one.

3217
02:33:22,341 --> 02:33:25,370
If you want to pick your nose,
don't pick your nose in public.

3218
02:33:25,371 --> 02:33:28,270
You piece of shit.
Lot.

3219
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:30,480
Have a good pick.
Isn't a good picture?

3220
02:33:30,510 --> 02:33:31,430
Satisfying?
Weird.

3221
02:33:31,431 --> 02:33:34,760
How many people up dry up?
They get a big old dry.

3222
02:33:34,761 --> 02:33:36,560
Yeah.
You realize that there's more up there.

3223
02:33:36,561 --> 02:33:39,940
You kind of pull out a pc of Brian 
almost just goes all the way up to,

3224
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:41,510
in between your eyes are agree.

3225
02:33:41,710 --> 02:33:42,680
That's good.
Yeah,

3226
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:44,740
it is,
it's got to be weird to be that famous.

3227
02:33:44,750 --> 02:33:46,300
So there's certain levels,
like a buddy of mine,

3228
02:33:46,301 --> 02:33:49,480
his friend Doug Stanhope is friends with
Johnny Depp and uh,

3229
02:33:49,510 --> 02:33:50,343
he,
he talks about how unmanageable Johnny 

3230
02:33:53,350 --> 02:33:56,260
Depp's famous like he cannot go to,
if he goes to a restaurant,

3231
02:33:56,261 --> 02:33:58,150
literally people do not give a fuck if 
he's eating,

3232
02:33:58,151 --> 02:33:58,984
they swarm and the table and come over 
with cameras and pictures and they want 

3233
02:34:02,021 --> 02:34:03,850
to touch him and they don't leave him 
alone.

3234
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:04,753
He just,
he's just far beyond the regular fame 

3235
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:10,600
into that weird.
There's only 10 people in the world that

3236
02:34:10,601 --> 02:34:13,060
have that kind of fame.
And you become other people's property.

3237
02:34:13,170 --> 02:34:14,620
Yeah,
basically.

3238
02:34:14,650 --> 02:34:18,040
And they feel like you owe them.
And I think television,

3239
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:19,420
maybe movie stars.
Uh,

3240
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:23,590
I'm not sure how it would play,
but I think in my experience,

3241
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:25,630
broadcasters,
and in other words,

3242
02:34:25,631 --> 02:34:30,631
television personalities and radio hosts
are people feel like you're their friend

3243
02:34:31,810 --> 02:34:34,180
in a way that they don't to movie stars.
Yeah.

3244
02:34:34,181 --> 02:34:35,014
So there's a different interplay.
Like people movie stars are different 

3245
02:34:37,031 --> 02:34:39,010
because they play someone different.
Like,

3246
02:34:39,011 --> 02:34:42,400
oh my gosh,
the guy from Cape fear raging bull.

3247
02:34:42,401 --> 02:34:43,234
That's Jake Lamata the thing,
and there's something about the bigness 

3248
02:34:46,121 --> 02:34:46,954
of the screen and the Glamor of 
Hollywood that makes them sort of other 

3249
02:34:48,931 --> 02:34:50,080
worldly.
Yes.

3250
02:34:50,140 --> 02:34:52,270
Whereas when people go up to Jimmy 
Fallon,

3251
02:34:52,510 --> 02:34:53,710
it's like,
oh Jimmy,

3252
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:54,700
you know,
it's like,

3253
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:55,520
oh,
you're my buddy.

3254
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:57,460
Like we should hang out sometime.
Yeah,

3255
02:34:57,630 --> 02:34:58,780
no,
exactly it,

3256
02:34:59,590 --> 02:35:03,040
but I think there's a sweet spot to,
to fame that as you say,

3257
02:35:03,041 --> 02:35:06,490
I would not want to go past.
I'd like to be more famous than I am,

3258
02:35:06,610 --> 02:35:09,490
but not not so famous that I can't pick 
my nose in public.

3259
02:35:09,490 --> 02:35:10,323
That's the judge sets level.
Definitely shouldn't pick your nose in 

3260
02:35:11,591 --> 02:35:14,890
public to,
to your alone grandmother.

3261
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:19,360
Don't stop chastising me for my boogers 
in front of all these humans.

3262
02:35:19,390 --> 02:35:22,800
I've got my fist up,
my nose right now to my wrist.

3263
02:35:22,930 --> 02:35:24,510
I was sitting next to this guy on an 
airplane once.

3264
02:35:24,511 --> 02:35:26,770
This old dude,
he just kept digging in his nose.

3265
02:35:26,771 --> 02:35:28,100
He didn't give a fuck.
Well,

3266
02:35:28,130 --> 02:35:30,700
that's not about 75 years old and he's 
like,

3267
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:32,390
nobody's fucking me.
Do it.

3268
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:34,120
One more time happened,
I don't give a shit,

3269
02:35:34,121 --> 02:35:36,000
and he was in first class.
We had some cash.

3270
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:39,090
He just fucking up there weighty wipe 
it.

3271
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:40,353
I don't remember.
I just stopped looking at them and put 

3272
02:35:41,321 --> 02:35:42,770
my headphones on,
zoned out.

3273
02:35:42,810 --> 02:35:44,860
I'm tired of looking at this old dude 
picking his nose.

3274
02:35:44,861 --> 02:35:49,861
He fired a bunch of times to household.
So about just letting that go.

3275
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:59,640
I've had some bad experiences on Greg 
Fitzsimmons has a bit about that,

3276
02:35:59,641 --> 02:36:00,720
about how he,
uh,

3277
02:36:00,721 --> 02:36:01,554
you know,
when he's in first class you always to 

3278
02:36:02,570 --> 02:36:05,670
gets upgraded because he flies so much 
that we was in first class and needed to

3279
02:36:05,671 --> 02:36:07,800
fought but didn't want to stink at the 
first class cabin.

3280
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:08,933
So He'd go back through the curtain to 
economy class and just walk down the 

3281
02:36:11,521 --> 02:36:12,354
aisle fighting

3282
02:36:13,330 --> 02:36:18,010
that's cropped up and then he'd go back 
to first class,

3283
02:36:18,170 --> 02:36:19,030
smart life.
Those,

3284
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:19,923
those,
those people in cattle class at 

3285
02:36:20,771 --> 02:36:22,520
disgusting.
It smells like hell back there.

3286
02:36:22,580 --> 02:36:25,070
Joey Diaz always farts in first class 
in.

3287
02:36:25,071 --> 02:36:28,100
It's always so horrific.
You can imagine.

3288
02:36:28,250 --> 02:36:30,800
I wrote a whole bit about Joey farting 
in first class.

3289
02:36:30,801 --> 02:36:35,020
I wrote a whole blog entry about this 
one time that he did that.

3290
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:37,570
This woman,
she yelled at him,

3291
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:40,910
he had fallen and she yelled out behind 
us.

3292
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:46,240
Oh my God.
She yelled it out.

3293
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:51,500
I put my shirt over my nose like this,
and he started laughing and clapping.

3294
02:36:55,550 --> 02:36:55,820
Look,

3295
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:57,710
I've occasionally,
I will confess,

3296
02:36:57,711 --> 02:36:58,544
I've occasionally been too hung over on 
a plane and have not been able to hold 

3297
02:37:01,791 --> 02:37:04,190
it in and I've got a little trick for 
people which they can keep up.

3298
02:37:04,191 --> 02:37:06,430
This leaves and you know,
go to the bathroom.

3299
02:37:06,530 --> 02:37:08,220
Rude piece of shit.
Sometimes you're,

3300
02:37:08,270 --> 02:37:10,790
sometimes you're in the window seat and 
the person sitting next to you is eating

3301
02:37:10,791 --> 02:37:12,790
their meal or something and you,
you kind of get out.

3302
02:37:12,810 --> 02:37:13,643
You don't want to disturb things and 
you're not sure if it's going to smelly 

3303
02:37:15,471 --> 02:37:16,040
or not and you're

3304
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:16,873
not sure if it's going to be big or not.
It's just going to be something has to 

3305
02:37:19,100 --> 02:37:23,840
give and so here's the tactic so that no
one will suspect you.

3306
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:25,873
You release it.
You survived through the beginning of 

3307
02:37:29,331 --> 02:37:32,150
the horrible smell without paying any 
attention to it.

3308
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:36,350
Then as soon as it would have had time 
to have gotten to you,

3309
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:39,290
if it had been admitted by someone 
nearby,

3310
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:44,570
then you very visibly start to react to 
the bad smell.

3311
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:45,793
You don't understand light.
This is a strategy that has been hired 

3312
02:37:49,060 --> 02:37:54,060
by American children for it is called.
He smelt it.

3313
02:37:54,531 --> 02:37:59,350
Dealt it so this is not so new.
It should be the first no one white.

3314
02:37:59,430 --> 02:38:02,960
You white until the person sitting next 
to you starts to wince.

3315
02:38:03,190 --> 02:38:04,023
Yeah,
and then once they win and then you go 

3316
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:07,280
up because then the trajectory can be 
established.

3317
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:08,113
If they win first and then you wince,
then it's obviously coming from the 

3318
02:38:09,891 --> 02:38:11,310
other side of them.
No,

3319
02:38:11,330 --> 02:38:12,163
you're going to give away these like 
micro expressions that are going to 

3320
02:38:13,851 --> 02:38:16,160
reveal your guilt.
Not because I'm a perfect doctor.

3321
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:19,880
The perfect crime by.
You're not.

3322
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:24,350
None of my fucking face shot themselves,
and then I loudly say,

3323
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:26,720
oh,
I can't believe someone was sad,

3324
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:29,480
disgusting.
It's tough fights in this cabin and that

3325
02:38:29,481 --> 02:38:31,010
person wasn't me.
Yeah,

3326
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:32,023
it's the woman behind Joey Diaz that's 
really foreign and when she smelled his 

3327
02:38:35,481 --> 02:38:37,550
foreign,
she made it even worse and I was blaming

3328
02:38:37,551 --> 02:38:39,380
it all on Joey,
but her yelling out,

3329
02:38:39,410 --> 02:38:43,010
oh my God,
I'll never forget that lady,

3330
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:44,353
that poor lady I love,
I love the audacity that she's not 

3331
02:38:47,241 --> 02:38:50,900
embarrassed about it because it wouldn't
let you have the Oh,

3332
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:54,080
nearly you have the tact to be a bit 
embarrassed about for the,

3333
02:38:54,090 --> 02:38:55,610
on behalf of the fighter.

3334
02:38:55,700 --> 02:39:00,700
When you understand what kind of fucking
smell Joey Diaz can pack in that body.

3335
02:39:01,970 --> 02:39:02,803
You're talking with a man who is well 
over 300 pounds and who knows what he 

3336
02:39:07,650 --> 02:39:08,483
ate a small child who was fighting 
inside him and now he's fighting the 

3337
02:39:11,770 --> 02:39:14,980
fight happening many things.
Um,

3338
02:39:15,170 --> 02:39:16,003
I wanted to mention also,
I was reading this piece about stem 

3339
02:39:18,891 --> 02:39:19,724
cells.
Have you been paying attention to the 

3340
02:39:20,450 --> 02:39:22,070
fucking crazy.
I mean,

3341
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:26,840
it looks now like we're going to be able
to use stem cells to grow.

3342
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:28,513
I mean,
we always knew you'd be able to grow 

3343
02:39:29,571 --> 02:39:30,680
organs in a lab,
right?

3344
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:32,353
But now it looks like within the 
fussiest future we're going to be able 

3345
02:39:35,961 --> 02:39:39,560
to grow a hearts and essentially grow 
hots in a lab.

3346
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:42,350
And you're not gonna have to worry about
stem cell treatments.

3347
02:39:42,380 --> 02:39:43,410
No.
Talk to me.

3348
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:44,271
I,
uh,

3349
02:39:44,271 --> 02:39:46,010
was that close to shoulder surgery.

3350
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:50,180
I had a tear in my rotator cuff tear in 
my labor room,

3351
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:51,043
a tear in my bicep tendon and my,
my shoulder was in some pretty 

3352
02:39:53,721 --> 02:39:54,554
significant pain and I was like,
is this from a particular injury or is 

3353
02:39:56,771 --> 02:40:00,440
this just from Geneva to.
It's from martial arts.

3354
02:40:00,441 --> 02:40:03,560
It's from weightlifting.
It's from years ago.

3355
02:40:03,561 --> 02:40:05,090
Overall wear and tear of being Joe 
Rogan.

3356
02:40:05,091 --> 02:40:08,320
When I got the MRI apparently in my 
shoulder had been dislocated.

3357
02:40:08,350 --> 02:40:09,183
I didn't know it and it popped back in 
place at one point in time and they saw 

3358
02:40:12,291 --> 02:40:14,160
there's some particles that are floating
around.

3359
02:40:14,390 --> 02:40:15,223
Jujitsu is just unbelievably brutal on 
your body because you're constantly 

3360
02:40:18,151 --> 02:40:18,984
attacking joints and,
and trying to break those joints and 

3361
02:40:21,151 --> 02:40:22,920
then you have to tap but you don't want 
to tap.

3362
02:40:22,921 --> 02:40:23,754
So you muscled through it and then you 
wind up getting pretty injured and then 

3363
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:27,513
you heal up for a little bit and you hop
right back in and train again because 

3364
02:40:29,371 --> 02:40:31,140
it's so much fun.
So,

3365
02:40:31,141 --> 02:40:31,974
uh,
I was really close to getting shoulder 

3366
02:40:32,821 --> 02:40:33,654
surgery and I talked to the doctor from 
the UFC who had just gotten these stem 

3367
02:40:37,861 --> 02:40:40,500
cell injections in his shoulder after 
surgery.

3368
02:40:40,501 --> 02:40:41,334
He had shoulder surgery,
had a shoulder repaired and then gotten 

3369
02:40:43,621 --> 02:40:47,340
these injections and I had some pretty,
pretty good results with it.

3370
02:40:47,341 --> 02:40:48,180
And he's like,
look,

3371
02:40:48,480 --> 02:40:51,510
you really probably need surgery,
but if you want to try this,

3372
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:54,360
these injections,
let's give it a shot because it has been

3373
02:40:54,361 --> 02:40:54,750
shown.

3374
02:40:54,750 --> 02:40:55,950
I just don't want to give you any false 
hope.

3375
02:40:56,250 --> 02:40:57,300
Okay,
let's give it a shot.

3376
02:40:57,540 --> 02:41:00,210
So what they do is they take a woman's 
placenta that,

3377
02:41:00,211 --> 02:41:01,044
uh,
is a given birth to a kid through 

3378
02:41:02,701 --> 02:41:06,300
Sicilian section and then a young woman 
and they take those,

3379
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:09,810
that placenta and then they get these 
embryonic stem cells from it.

3380
02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:12,270
Yup.
And they injected it into my shoulder.

3381
02:41:12,510 --> 02:41:15,570
And within four weeks I felt better than
I've felt in a year.

3382
02:41:15,810 --> 02:41:18,540
And then it kept getting better and 
better and better.

3383
02:41:18,541 --> 02:41:19,620
And now,
I mean,

3384
02:41:19,621 --> 02:41:20,454
there's still some clicking like because
there's still some shit floating around 

3385
02:41:23,491 --> 02:41:24,750
in there.
But uh,

3386
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:28,230
I lift a lot of weights and I don't have
any pain.

3387
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:31,350
I mean,
it's amazing how much better it got.

3388
02:41:31,351 --> 02:41:32,184
I,
I did a kickboxing workout today where 

3389
02:41:33,510 --> 02:41:35,010
I'm,
I went seven rounds on the.

3390
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:36,510
So I'm slamming into the back.

3391
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,580
I have no pain in my shoulder at all.
Nothing.

3392
02:41:38,581 --> 02:41:39,414
Zero.
I mean there's stuff floating around in 

3393
02:41:40,801 --> 02:41:41,431
there.
Like I said,

3394
02:41:41,431 --> 02:41:42,151
I could feel it.
Go,

3395
02:41:42,151 --> 02:41:42,631
click,
click,

3396
02:41:42,631 --> 02:41:45,630
click because there's some broken off 
cartilage and shit.

3397
02:41:45,631 --> 02:41:46,440
That's,
that I'll.

3398
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:48,300
Maybe I'll have to get pulled out of 
there one day.

3399
02:41:48,510 --> 02:41:50,550
But there's no pain.
There's no,

3400
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:55,560
there's no limit in my range of motion.
There's no strength problem.

3401
02:41:55,561 --> 02:41:59,160
Like I've shown the doctor,
like the physical exercises I can do and

3402
02:41:59,161 --> 02:42:00,120
he's blown away.
He's like,

3403
02:42:00,121 --> 02:42:00,954
that is incredible because it just 
regenerates tissue and it can 

3404
02:42:03,241 --> 02:42:05,700
regenerate.
It can regenerate meniscus,

3405
02:42:05,910 --> 02:42:07,610
it can regenerate ligaments.
It's,

3406
02:42:07,930 --> 02:42:09,460
it's incumbent.
Anything.

3407
02:42:09,550 --> 02:42:11,260
Exactly thing.
I mean,

3408
02:42:11,261 --> 02:42:13,240
think about that.
You had an injury,

3409
02:42:13,270 --> 02:42:14,103
you had a,
you had a debilitating injury that was 

3410
02:42:15,941 --> 02:42:18,820
causing you significant discomfort and 
pain.

3411
02:42:19,630 --> 02:42:20,463
What science was able to do is take the 
cells that we're going to form the 

3412
02:42:24,161 --> 02:42:24,994
spinal cord of a baby from an embryo,
and those cells were then able to 

3413
02:42:32,531 --> 02:42:35,110
convert themselves into portions of Joe 
Rogan's,

3414
02:42:35,111 --> 02:42:35,944
different constituent components in 
order to rebuild a portion of Joe's 

3415
02:42:38,621 --> 02:42:40,720
body.
It's crazy shit.

3416
02:42:40,721 --> 02:42:43,300
I mean,
if that miraculous.

3417
02:42:43,301 --> 02:42:45,370
I don't know what it is.
I mean there are some things coming down

3418
02:42:45,371 --> 02:42:48,760
the pike with stem cells that are going 
to change everything.

3419
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:48,970
I

3420
02:42:48,970 --> 02:42:51,260
mean,
I'm literally made the cost.

3421
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:54,850
Like if I had gotten this injury five 
years ago,

3422
02:42:54,851 --> 02:42:57,190
I would've had to have surgery,
but I didn't.

3423
02:42:57,280 --> 02:43:00,310
I got it now and now there's no need for
surgery.

3424
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:02,620
Like my shoulders.
I have a shoot.

3425
02:43:02,621 --> 02:43:03,470
Archery,
you know?

3426
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:04,430
Right.
So I shoot a,

3427
02:43:04,490 --> 02:43:08,980
I pull 80 pounds 100 times a day,
so I'm just going,

3428
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:11,620
nope.
No shoulder pain at nothing.

3429
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:13,623
Zero.
Did you watch the artery and the 

3430
02:43:14,051 --> 02:43:15,280
Olympics?
I did watch some of it.

3431
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:16,000
Yeah,
it's fun.

3432
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,530
The lcs got silver,
I think that.

3433
02:43:17,620 --> 02:43:18,940
Oh,
you fucking papers.

3434
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,510
Oh yeah.
We're into ourselves.

3435
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:27,460
I've just watched the NBC telecast.
I gave up on the very humble swimmer,

3436
02:43:27,461 --> 02:43:30,340
lied.
I gave up Ryan lochte.

3437
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:33,760
He had poor fella.
He's a bit of a music bit of a Bogan,

3438
02:43:33,761 --> 02:43:34,950
isn't he?
As we were saying in Australia,

3439
02:43:35,070 --> 02:43:35,903
that's what you guys were calling me.
You know what I thought was hilarious 

3440
02:43:37,271 --> 02:43:38,890
though,
that how people were,

3441
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:39,743
uh,
um,

3442
02:43:40,090 --> 02:43:44,290
I think it was salon had some article 
that it's proof that white male athletes

3443
02:43:44,710 --> 02:43:45,543
are pieces of shit.
Like they had this whole thing about 

3444
02:43:47,681 --> 02:43:50,620
white male athletes like Jesus Christ.
You think you can generalize.

3445
02:43:50,890 --> 02:43:51,723
One person can die.
Can you imagine if they'd said this is 

3446
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:56,080
proof that like if it was an African 
American,

3447
02:43:56,081 --> 02:43:56,914
they were,
they were like black women or black 

3448
02:43:59,021 --> 02:44:00,000
women are of shit.

3449
02:44:00,010 --> 02:44:02,200
That would've been.
It would've been really fun.

3450
02:44:02,290 --> 02:44:05,590
It's amazing that people are allowed to.
By the way it was written.

3451
02:44:05,591 --> 02:44:07,420
The article was not written by a white 
man.

3452
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:10,010
It was written by someone else,
but it's amazing that,

3453
02:44:10,011 --> 02:44:12,030
that you could do that,
but you can.

3454
02:44:12,190 --> 02:44:13,023
You can be sexist as long as you're 
being sexist about any can be racist as 

3455
02:44:17,171 --> 02:44:18,004
long as you're being sexist and racist 
about a class that you believe is 

3456
02:44:21,881 --> 02:44:24,160
privileged,
so you're allowed to punch up.

3457
02:44:24,210 --> 02:44:25,600
Yeah,
you should always punch.

3458
02:44:25,601 --> 02:44:26,490
Always Punch out.
That's.

3459
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:29,190
We were talking about yesterday with 
nonsense.

3460
02:44:29,250 --> 02:44:33,050
That's the illness that punch up shit.
That is God dammit.

3461
02:44:33,070 --> 02:44:34,810
That's amazing.
It's so annoying,

3462
02:44:34,811 --> 02:44:35,644
but.
And it's especially annoying because I 

3463
02:44:36,431 --> 02:44:38,800
understand the motivation behind it.
Right?

3464
02:44:38,801 --> 02:44:41,750
I do.
I do believe that it's different if you.

3465
02:44:41,751 --> 02:44:42,584
If there's a genuinely oppressed 
minority than it's different than they 

3466
02:44:46,181 --> 02:44:48,310
should have more of a license to make 
fun,

3467
02:44:48,311 --> 02:44:51,430
for example,
of the majority than the majority should

3468
02:44:51,790 --> 02:44:53,110
on them.
At least it's less.

3469
02:44:53,170 --> 02:44:54,550
I can understand that.
It's less bad.

3470
02:44:54,910 --> 02:44:55,743
What I've done on the stand is when 
they're allowed to show flagrant 

3471
02:44:59,650 --> 02:45:00,910
bigotry.
Yes.

3472
02:45:00,970 --> 02:45:01,990
Right.
I mean it's not,

3473
02:45:01,991 --> 02:45:04,220
it's not just like a gag.
It's like.

3474
02:45:04,900 --> 02:45:08,620
So did you see there was a.
I mean this is slightly tangential,

3475
02:45:08,621 --> 02:45:10,550
but everyone got their knickers in a 
knot.

3476
02:45:10,551 --> 02:45:12,820
Oh,
that tits and the tangle about that.

3477
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:13,953
A headline,
and I think it was in the San Jose 

3478
02:45:15,431 --> 02:45:19,570
Mercury when Michael Phelps won his 
final,

3479
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:20,433
do you see that?
And it was this tokenistic kind of 

3480
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:23,740
patronizing headline,
which was like,

3481
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:24,793
you know,
Olympic glory for Michael Phelps and 

3482
02:45:25,991 --> 02:45:29,290
African American woman because there was
like an African American woman who

3483
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:30,753
street is what I saw is Michael Phelps 
when silver is a big headline and then 

3484
02:45:35,601 --> 02:45:36,434
below it is world record set and the 800
meters by this woman and he set a world 

3485
02:45:41,301 --> 02:45:46,250
record and she was below him.
He won a silver and it was above her.

3486
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:48,180
That must have been another one because 
there was,

3487
02:45:48,210 --> 02:45:50,910
there was another one which was 
something like a,

3488
02:45:51,320 --> 02:45:52,200
it,
you know,

3489
02:45:52,290 --> 02:45:55,920
Olympic trials for Michael Phelps and 
African American athlete.

3490
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:58,030
Now that's a clumsy,
stupid

3491
02:45:58,030 --> 02:45:58,863
headline,
right?

3492
02:45:58,870 --> 02:46:00,010
Does that,
is that the,

3493
02:46:00,011 --> 02:46:01,990
uh,
the one Michael,

3494
02:46:02,170 --> 02:46:04,520
as a historic night with 
African-american Olympics,

3495
02:46:04,521 --> 02:46:08,050
I said Michael Phelps ratios historic 
night with African American.

3496
02:46:08,170 --> 02:46:09,003
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

3497
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:10,093
He's,

3498
02:46:10,120 --> 02:46:13,640
he's was widely panned for being 
racially insensitive.

3499
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:15,220
That headline,
the headline,

3500
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:16,373
Dan Olympics,
Michael Phelps shares historic night 

3501
02:46:18,241 --> 02:46:19,830
with African American.
My,

3502
02:46:20,370 --> 02:46:21,203
my point is it's part of America's anal 
obsession with race that makes that 

3503
02:46:26,761 --> 02:46:27,594
headline possible in the first place.
That headline isn't racist in the way 

3504
02:46:30,661 --> 02:46:31,494
that the KKK is racist.
If I mean no white supremacist would 

3505
02:46:34,471 --> 02:46:35,304
write that headline,
they would just ignore the 

3506
02:46:36,181 --> 02:46:40,350
african-american entirely or they would 
write off that achievement.

3507
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:45,000
That is the kind of headline that's 
written by a constipated at white guilty

3508
02:46:45,060 --> 02:46:47,700
liberal trying say african-america 
exactly.

3509
02:46:47,701 --> 02:46:49,350
Just say the woman's name.
That's right.

3510
02:46:49,710 --> 02:46:50,543
Trying to be tokenistic.
Lee Approving in this kind of a 

3511
02:46:52,980 --> 02:46:53,813
paternalistic,
patronizing way that white liberals 

3512
02:46:55,531 --> 02:47:00,070
insist on being and in doing so is 
actually racist and that's.

3513
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:01,013
That's telling I think because it is 
racist to be overly concerned about 

3514
02:47:03,781 --> 02:47:06,150
race.
Even if you're trying to be positive.

3515
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:08,280
What does this say?
Yeah,

3516
02:47:08,340 --> 02:47:10,290
they put up a second one,
10 minutes later that.

3517
02:47:10,830 --> 02:47:13,410
Oh,
Tim says Olympics.

3518
02:47:13,411 --> 02:47:16,920
Michael Phelps shares historic night 
with Stanford.

3519
02:47:16,921 --> 02:47:18,070
Simone manual.

3520
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:21,190
Why is that?
A gaff says missing something guys.

3521
02:47:21,191 --> 02:47:23,230
The third time was the charm is the Merc
went with,

3522
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:27,480
oh,
third time they wrote instead Stanford,

3523
02:47:27,481 --> 02:47:30,170
Simone Manual and Michael Phelps make 
history.

3524
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:33,890
So because Michael Phelps was first,

3525
02:47:34,930 --> 02:47:36,520
that's a layer.
That's ridiculous.

3526
02:47:36,521 --> 02:47:38,140
So they're saying that when they changed
it,

3527
02:47:38,470 --> 02:47:41,200
they didn't put the gold medalist first.
They put Michael Phelps

3528
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:45,090
because he's the best fucking sweater in
the history of the wall ever.

3529
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:46,313
Yeah.
But what's hilarious is they got it 

3530
02:47:47,581 --> 02:47:50,550
right the third time.
Her name is first,

3531
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:52,130
like why?
Why?

3532
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:52,973
First of all,
how about just say she won a fucking 

3533
02:47:55,350 --> 02:47:56,183
gold medal.
Why did she have to be in the same 

3534
02:47:57,451 --> 02:47:58,620
headline?
Is Him Anyway?

3535
02:47:59,100 --> 02:48:02,370
Can you have another goddamn story where
she won a gold medal?

3536
02:48:02,430 --> 02:48:03,263
However,
given her own fucking story and then 

3537
02:48:04,801 --> 02:48:06,210
have him have his own story.

3538
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:08,370
I mean,
why not just say Olympics,

3539
02:48:08,440 --> 02:48:09,350
uh,
you know,

3540
02:48:09,670 --> 02:48:13,670
golden silver,
silver and gold for Philips and a guy.

3541
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:16,640
Because if you want people to buy your 
fucking newspaper,

3542
02:48:16,641 --> 02:48:17,474
you better show Michael Phelps name 
because otherwise they're not going to 

3543
02:48:19,461 --> 02:48:22,280
buy to see Kim Kardashian of swimming.

3544
02:48:22,770 --> 02:48:23,603
I think it's,
I just think there's so much 

3545
02:48:24,961 --> 02:48:26,580
unnecessary.
Yeah.

3546
02:48:26,581 --> 02:48:27,810
Here it is.
The Mercury News,

3547
02:48:27,870 --> 02:48:28,703
uh,
didn't even have her,

3548
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:30,300
is showing up.
I didn't have him in the picture.

3549
02:48:30,330 --> 02:48:33,860
Just had a picture of her.
Well now is that the original?

3550
02:48:34,070 --> 02:48:35,610
The original.
That's the original.

3551
02:48:36,020 --> 02:48:39,180
Still people love to say his name on.
Let's see.

3552
02:48:39,181 --> 02:48:40,014
Some of these tweets so flustered now.
They can't even get it grammatically 

3553
02:48:43,141 --> 02:48:44,130
correct.
Keep trying.

3554
02:48:44,210 --> 02:48:46,980
Michael historic night.
Oh yeah,

3555
02:48:47,010 --> 02:48:48,420
Stanford.
I mean,

3556
02:48:48,421 --> 02:48:49,254
who cares?

3557
02:48:49,310 --> 02:48:50,143
Well,
social justice warriors care a bunch of 

3558
02:48:51,591 --> 02:48:54,500
fucking Weirdo shut ins that are 
constantly monitoring the Internet,

3559
02:48:54,740 --> 02:48:58,550
looking to be recreationally offended 
and can't wait to look.

3560
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:00,040
There was a clumsy fucking head,

3561
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:04,010
but again,
to be fair at the reason why this,

3562
02:49:04,090 --> 02:49:04,923
that headline is stupid or exist in the 
first place is because it's written by 

3563
02:49:08,371 --> 02:49:09,204
someone who has been contaminated by 
social justice warrior thinking and 

3564
02:49:11,701 --> 02:49:13,590
thinks that they need to point out the 
rice,

3565
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:14,953
the gold medalists.
Wouldn't it be nice if there was just a 

3566
02:49:17,401 --> 02:49:20,760
gold medalist and a silver medalist and 
that's the only metal just happens to be

3567
02:49:20,761 --> 02:49:23,640
much more famous than the gold medalist.
So obviously you put his name in.

3568
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:24,720
Imagine if she

3569
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:27,500
went to a gas station and lied about 
being robbed,

3570
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:32,510
and then someone from Salon wrote an 
article that it's proved that that black

3571
02:49:32,660 --> 02:49:36,080
American women are,
have this proof that male athletes are a

3572
02:49:36,081 --> 02:49:38,450
protected class.
It's not proof.

3573
02:49:38,510 --> 02:49:41,420
It's proof that this guy's a fucking 
sociopath.

3574
02:49:41,421 --> 02:49:44,330
And he lied.
Mary Elizabeth Williams,

3575
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:46,093
the ballot of Swim Shady.
That's a good headline because it's 

3576
02:49:48,421 --> 02:49:50,840
pretty cool.
Uh,

3577
02:49:50,860 --> 02:49:53,110
why that's not true.
Male.

3578
02:49:53,130 --> 02:49:54,510
Oh,
I was wrong too.

3579
02:49:54,511 --> 02:49:55,344
It's like I thought it said white males 
just as male athletes are protected 

3580
02:49:57,801 --> 02:49:58,634
class.
I just don't think that it's fair 

3581
02:50:01,340 --> 02:50:04,070
because it was one guy amongst the 
thousands of athletes.

3582
02:50:04,100 --> 02:50:04,933
It's so stupid that you said male 
athletes are a protected class because 

3583
02:50:07,821 --> 02:50:10,910
he didn't get protected by the way he 
got exposed.

3584
02:50:11,150 --> 02:50:13,700
There's nothing protected about dragging
that guy's name.

3585
02:50:13,910 --> 02:50:17,930
Do you know he will be the fucking 
subject of jokes about lying for the end

3586
02:50:17,931 --> 02:50:18,450
of time?

3587
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:19,283
Yeah.
That guy will be the benedict arnold of 

3588
02:50:21,141 --> 02:50:24,010
jokes.
Jenelle did a gag of bed last night.

3589
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:24,980
Look,
it's going to happen.

3590
02:50:25,010 --> 02:50:25,843
Like there's nothing protected.
That's not proof that he's in a 

3591
02:50:28,521 --> 02:50:30,020
protected class.
In fact,

3592
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:34,760
it's evidence that no one is protected 
from lies because video cameras,

3593
02:50:34,761 --> 02:50:37,640
because of technology and because the 
truth eventually gets out.

3594
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:38,533
I do think that if he was,
if he was a black athlete from a pool 

3595
02:50:40,700 --> 02:50:42,590
from like Ghana or something,
look at that.

3596
02:50:42,591 --> 02:50:45,380
He lost all four major sponsors in one 
day.

3597
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:46,280
Good.
He's a dickhead.

3598
02:50:46,281 --> 02:50:47,114
I don't give a shit about Ryan.
Lucky who lost a million dollars and 

3599
02:50:50,031 --> 02:50:51,740
endorsement money.
Woo.

3600
02:50:52,370 --> 02:50:53,050
Suck.

3601
02:50:53,050 --> 02:50:56,980
Speaking of breaking ourselves into 
intertribal racial camps,

3602
02:50:56,981 --> 02:50:57,814
did you see the,
the approval of the Ellen generous as a 

3603
02:51:01,060 --> 02:51:02,000
tweet?
No.

3604
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:03,880
And she said she was a.
She did this.

3605
02:51:03,881 --> 02:51:06,040
Can you find that Jamie?
So you saying bolt.

3606
02:51:06,550 --> 02:51:09,220
She was like,
it was something like next time,

3607
02:51:09,730 --> 02:51:10,563
next time I go to the supermarket,
I know what mode of transportation I'm 

3608
02:51:12,311 --> 02:51:13,144
going to get.
And there was like a photoshop image of 

3609
02:51:13,931 --> 02:51:16,710
her on Hussein bolt back or something.
Uh,

3610
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:19,210
here we go.
She tweeted that.

3611
02:51:19,211 --> 02:51:20,044
Or did somebody.
Did somebody photoshop it or did she do 

3612
02:51:22,691 --> 02:51:24,850
it?
I think her show Photoshop,

3613
02:51:25,780 --> 02:51:27,190
photoshop.
And then she tweeted it.

3614
02:51:27,310 --> 02:51:27,821
Oh,
okay.

3615
02:51:27,821 --> 02:51:29,120
I see you write someone a fan.
Did it,

3616
02:51:29,121 --> 02:51:30,190
did they?
Uh,

3617
02:51:30,191 --> 02:51:31,024
and so then of course it's like,
it becomes this big thing about she's 

3618
02:51:33,311 --> 02:51:34,144
racist because it's the white.
It's the white person enslaving the 

3619
02:51:37,721 --> 02:51:39,370
black person.
Seriously.

3620
02:51:39,400 --> 02:51:41,680
Does anyone believe that?
She wouldn't have made the same joke?

3621
02:51:41,710 --> 02:51:42,543
If.
So here she is like being given a 

3622
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:48,820
piggyback by Hussein Bolt.
That's funny.

3623
02:51:49,210 --> 02:51:50,680
It's funny.
It's not a photoshop.

3624
02:51:50,860 --> 02:51:51,720
Is that what that is?
No,

3625
02:51:51,790 --> 02:51:52,840
she's really doing it.
Joe,

3626
02:51:57,340 --> 02:52:00,380
why did somebody photoshop straight?
What does the tweet say?

3627
02:52:00,650 --> 02:52:01,280
Girlfriends.
Hot.

3628
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:02,700
Who gives a fuck?
Go down.

3629
02:52:02,810 --> 02:52:03,643
School out.
Stop,

3630
02:52:03,650 --> 02:52:05,390
go back.
Dammit,

3631
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:06,070
go back.

3632
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:07,790
I'm trying,
trying,

3633
02:52:08,460 --> 02:52:09,293
trying to scroll down.
We have a picture of her girlfriend 

3634
02:52:11,731 --> 02:52:15,190
right there for them.
Okay.

3635
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:18,700
Is that I should have gone back again.
This was wrong.

3636
02:52:21,590 --> 02:52:24,880
She looked really cute and so she wrote,
this is how I'm running errands from now

3637
02:52:24,881 --> 02:52:27,550
on Hashtag Rio 2016 with the picture of 
her.

3638
02:52:28,160 --> 02:52:31,030
But that's not a race joke.
While people are retarded.

3639
02:52:31,090 --> 02:52:32,260
That's a,
it was a white guy.

3640
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,550
The white guy.
She'd still.

3641
02:52:33,620 --> 02:52:34,990
I mean she still would have traded it,
right?

3642
02:52:34,991 --> 02:52:35,824
So that doesn't mean that she's racist.
So this comes down to the question of 

3643
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:39,393
when we,
when we accuse someone of doing 

3644
02:52:40,301 --> 02:52:42,070
something racist,
uh,

3645
02:52:42,100 --> 02:52:42,933
we,
do we actually believe that they're 

3646
02:52:44,210 --> 02:52:45,043
racist or are we just trying to find an 
excuse to interpret what they're saying 

3647
02:52:49,451 --> 02:52:52,810
is basis recreationally outraged.
That's what she is.

3648
02:52:52,811 --> 02:52:54,010
Yeah.
Where they are,

3649
02:52:54,040 --> 02:52:56,220
where they're getting upset at her,
they're orange.

3650
02:52:56,770 --> 02:52:59,200
They're deciding that this is something 
that they should be upset about.

3651
02:52:59,201 --> 02:53:00,970
They see the green light and they're 
hitting the gas.

3652
02:53:01,030 --> 02:53:03,190
Yeah.
Have you really get pissed off at that?

3653
02:53:03,220 --> 02:53:05,740
Go jump off a fucking bridge.
Seriously.

3654
02:53:05,770 --> 02:53:07,710
Just stop.
Just stop talking,

3655
02:53:07,720 --> 02:53:08,980
tweeting,
interacting,

3656
02:53:08,981 --> 02:53:09,814
stop sharing your opinions of,
of sort of emotional and intellectual 

3657
02:53:12,791 --> 02:53:13,481
effort.
Joe,

3658
02:53:13,481 --> 02:53:17,300
that's expended in the world these days 
on these outrage outburst.

3659
02:53:17,350 --> 02:53:22,210
If you could channel that hot air into 
some kind of power plant,

3660
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:23,193
be like Zeplin,
light it on fire suppression and just 

3661
02:53:24,950 --> 02:53:28,610
grow it out.
Cover album.

3662
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,510
Yeah.
It's a waste of time.

3663
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:33,390
And it's one of those things where I 
think we were.

3664
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:34,233
We've already beaten it into the ground.
We know what it is and I think it's 

3665
02:53:37,750 --> 02:53:38,583
slowly being less and less acceptable 
for people to do shit like that because 

3666
02:53:42,281 --> 02:53:43,114
I think more and more people realize how
fucking unproductive and stupid it 

3667
02:53:45,521 --> 02:53:46,150
really is.

3668
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:47,560
Yeah.
I feel like that's right.

3669
02:53:47,561 --> 02:53:50,200
I,
I hope that the tide is turning,

3670
02:53:50,201 --> 02:53:51,034
but I think that as the tide turns,
the people who really get a kick out of 

3671
02:53:53,501 --> 02:53:54,320
this stuff,
uh,

3672
02:53:54,320 --> 02:53:58,420
becoming more and more vitriolic and 
turning the dial up to 11.

3673
02:53:58,570 --> 02:53:59,950
Yeah,
because you just feel like they're being

3674
02:53:59,951 --> 02:54:01,570
sidelined.
There's still shut ins.

3675
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:03,850
They're still not going out and 
experiencing the world.

3676
02:54:03,851 --> 02:54:04,684
They're still living in this really 
bizarre confined environment that they 

3677
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:10,720
exist in or it's,
it's,

3678
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:12,580
it's,
it's not reasonable.

3679
02:54:12,990 --> 02:54:14,950
That's not reasonable to get upset at 
that.

3680
02:54:15,010 --> 02:54:15,843
I had a conversation with an African 
American friend of mine about braided 

3681
02:54:18,071 --> 02:54:18,904
hair the other day,
was it a Kardashian just got her hair 

3682
02:54:21,401 --> 02:54:23,590
braided,
cultural appropriation,

3683
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:24,453
cultural appropriation.
And what frustrated me was she kept 

3684
02:54:28,090 --> 02:54:32,050
going up to the edge of,
of being critical of it and then saying,

3685
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:33,033
look,
I don't really carry the way and in 

3686
02:54:34,541 --> 02:54:35,950
these conversations I always feel like 
saying,

3687
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:38,830
well if you don't care then just don't 
care.

3688
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:42,460
Didn't bode Derek do that like way 
fucking back in the day.

3689
02:54:42,461 --> 02:54:44,140
I mean,
is that really cultural?

3690
02:54:44,141 --> 02:54:46,370
Appropriation came from age,
ipt.

3691
02:54:46,410 --> 02:54:50,200
I mean they've been around for so much 
longer than that.

3692
02:54:50,390 --> 02:54:51,223
Remember when that fucking girl was 
getting mad at that boy for having 

3693
02:54:53,351 --> 02:54:55,410
dreadlocks and she was trying to cut his
hair off and yeah,

3694
02:54:55,870 --> 02:54:56,703
she's being a cunt to him and she was 
doing it just because he was a little 

3695
02:54:59,321 --> 02:55:00,154
tiny guy and she can get away with it.
I think if he was a 250 pound football 

3696
02:55:02,771 --> 02:55:04,370
player,
she'd be saying the same things to him.

3697
02:55:04,420 --> 02:55:05,920
We'll also,
of course not he,

3698
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:06,680
she,
she,

3699
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:07,513
she's at a liberal arts college and so 
she knows that he's going to be full of 

3700
02:55:10,011 --> 02:55:12,370
enough white guilt that she can pull 
that shit and he's,

3701
02:55:13,010 --> 02:55:15,860
he's going to cop it,
she assumes and meanwhile she's wrong.

3702
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:19,040
The dreadlocks came from,
the Greeks came from the Romans.

3703
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:19,873
It's like they've been around as long as
people have been stinky with dirty hair 

3704
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:25,970
and so what my friend was saying about,
about brides was,

3705
02:55:26,310 --> 02:55:27,920
hey,
go preparation bro.

3706
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:29,300
Derek Damn,
she was hot.

3707
02:55:29,930 --> 02:55:32,060
She was hot as fuck back then.
My friend was saying,

3708
02:55:32,090 --> 02:55:34,080
look,
all we want is for people to,

3709
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:36,770
to just recognize that it's 
appropriation and,

3710
02:55:37,010 --> 02:55:37,920
and to,
to,

3711
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:38,953
to,
to understand and to express their 

3712
02:55:40,551 --> 02:55:42,710
gratitude for.
And I was like,

3713
02:55:42,711 --> 02:55:45,110
what?
By what mechanism would a Kardashian who

3714
02:55:45,111 --> 02:55:48,830
gets brides elicit such a,
I mean,

3715
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:51,830
exhibit such gratitude for the cultural.
I mean if,

3716
02:55:51,860 --> 02:55:54,890
if it gets great,
gets braids and then goes out and says,

3717
02:55:54,891 --> 02:55:55,724
I want to thank everyone in the African 
Community for creating brides that's 

3718
02:55:58,071 --> 02:56:00,710
going to cause more of a fucking stood 
then if she just did it.

3719
02:56:01,340 --> 02:56:03,860
It's so stupid.
What if I were a Sarong?

3720
02:56:04,480 --> 02:56:06,680
Wouldn't just wear pants and you're 
black.

3721
02:56:06,950 --> 02:56:10,190
What if you're aware of white European 
created pants and shirts?

3722
02:56:10,191 --> 02:56:12,570
Is that cultural appropriation?
What is that?

3723
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:17,210
So stupid culture is about sharing.
That's what it is about.

3724
02:56:17,211 --> 02:56:19,370
It's about when you go to an Indian 
restaurant,

3725
02:56:19,371 --> 02:56:21,590
are you culturally appropriating because
you're eating their food.

3726
02:56:21,591 --> 02:56:24,920
It's fucking stupid.
When you create your own Indian food,

3727
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:28,190
are you violating the rules of culture 
appropriation?

3728
02:56:28,570 --> 02:56:30,920
If you have taco Tuesday,
you a piece of shit,

3729
02:56:31,590 --> 02:56:32,271
you know,
come on.

3730
02:56:32,271 --> 02:56:34,250
It's fucking dumb man.
It's dumb.

3731
02:56:34,670 --> 02:56:36,490
You probably paid to sheet if you have 
taco Tuesday.

3732
02:56:36,520 --> 02:56:37,850
It's just mad.
It's just stupid,

3733
02:56:38,060 --> 02:56:40,250
but some of the best thing about all 
this stupid stuff.

3734
02:56:40,251 --> 02:56:41,084
I'm tired of wasting any of my time and 
thoughts on social justice warrior 

3735
02:56:43,731 --> 02:56:44,564
ideal.
I'm actually starting to study to stop 

3736
02:56:46,071 --> 02:56:46,904
doing that because if people haven't 
heard previous times that I've been on 

3737
02:56:49,551 --> 02:56:50,384
the show and you like this,
then go back and listen to the to the 

3738
02:56:52,970 --> 02:56:53,803
previous ones,
but you'll find that joe and I spent a 

3739
02:56:54,891 --> 02:56:55,724
reasonably large amount of time talking 
about social justice issues and social 

3740
02:56:59,481 --> 02:57:02,050
justice warrior issues and how 
ridiculous it all is.

3741
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:02,953
I feel like to some extent we've reached
a tipping point where that's hopefully 

3742
02:57:05,241 --> 02:57:06,074
no longer necessary and now it's a 
little bit self indulgent for us to be 

3743
02:57:09,381 --> 02:57:12,080
whining about the wine is.
I think you're right.

3744
02:57:12,081 --> 02:57:14,750
That's how I feel.
I feel like we've sold one whining,

3745
02:57:15,290 --> 02:57:16,070
I feel like.
Yeah,

3746
02:57:16,070 --> 02:57:16,903
exactly.
I feel like we've kind of won this 

3747
02:57:17,751 --> 02:57:21,590
battle and we don't need to be so 
outraged at the outrage anymore.

3748
02:57:21,620 --> 02:57:22,453
I think the data has to come in and we 
had to understand that the only reason 

3749
02:57:24,531 --> 02:57:25,364
why people were being so recreationally 
outraged about the stupid shit because 

3750
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:31,220
they don't have real things to be fucked
up about in real life.

3751
02:57:31,370 --> 02:57:34,040
It's easy to get food.
It's easy to get shelter.

3752
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:35,013
It's most people have those things.
Those are the primary things that we 

3753
02:57:37,071 --> 02:57:40,220
need and once you have those things and 
there's so readily accessible,

3754
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:41,233
then you start looking at things to pick
on in the world because you don't have 

3755
02:57:43,850 --> 02:57:46,910
any real dilemmas,
any real significant,

3756
02:57:46,911 --> 02:57:47,744
important,
absolute dilemma's primal dilemmas and 

3757
02:57:51,401 --> 02:57:52,250
then the.
Yeah,

3758
02:57:52,251 --> 02:57:55,390
so the outrage machine,
I mean it comes back a little bit to,

3759
02:57:55,450 --> 02:57:57,710
to the reaction to Kurt Metzger,
Cummins,

3760
02:57:57,910 --> 02:58:01,980
I'm assume is Radha about rape as well,
like what is the appropriate

3761
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:05,330
parameters of public discourse in order 
to trigger the outright?

3762
02:58:05,390 --> 02:58:07,940
See I disagree there because like in 
that sense,

3763
02:58:07,941 --> 02:58:12,941
like he's saying something about a 
violent crime against women and he's not

3764
02:58:13,041 --> 02:58:14,990
exactly sure.
You know,

3765
02:58:14,991 --> 02:58:15,824
so I,
I kind of see why someone would be 

3766
02:58:17,481 --> 02:58:18,314
outraged that you would step up and 
defend the guy when you don't really 

3767
02:58:21,291 --> 02:58:25,060
know because you weren't there.
But he's also definitely agree that it's

3768
02:58:25,061 --> 02:58:25,894
a more valid criticism.
Criticism of came as a lot more valid 

3769
02:58:28,131 --> 02:58:30,380
than criticism of element.
Too Generous for her tweets.

3770
02:58:30,480 --> 02:58:31,490
That's true.
Definitely,

3771
02:58:31,670 --> 02:58:32,410
but still

3772
02:58:32,410 --> 02:58:33,243
in both cases I think that getting too 
angry and wanting to punish people for 

3773
02:58:38,561 --> 02:58:42,820
doing something that's politically 
incorrect is not the ideal response like

3774
02:58:42,821 --> 02:58:43,970
did,
did you see also

3775
02:58:44,300 --> 02:58:45,133
important to point out that he didn't 
say that the guy wasn't guilty when he 

3776
02:58:48,471 --> 02:58:51,110
did say is that we have to understand 
that women are capable.

3777
02:58:51,111 --> 02:58:53,880
He did it in a parody form,
but what he did say is women are capable

3778
02:58:53,881 --> 02:58:56,360
of lying to like this,
this stupid club,

3779
02:58:56,420 --> 02:58:57,650
whatever it is.
Bands.

3780
02:58:57,651 --> 02:58:59,110
This guy,
you know,

3781
02:58:59,170 --> 02:59:01,010
I don't know if they're stupid.
I'm sure they're great,

3782
02:59:01,250 --> 02:59:02,083
but they ban this guy.
They don't know whether or not he's 

3783
02:59:03,471 --> 02:59:08,471
guilty and he's saying that this woman 
cannot have lied because like my Bible.

3784
02:59:08,780 --> 02:59:09,613
That's right.

3785
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:10,593
Too Hung up on the question of whether 
or not he thinks the guy is guilty or 

3786
02:59:12,551 --> 02:59:14,470
not.
That's not his point.

3787
02:59:14,471 --> 02:59:17,320
He's made.
His point is a social.

3788
02:59:17,350 --> 02:59:20,560
Social media should not be the forum in 
which we conduct witch hunts

3789
02:59:20,730 --> 02:59:21,421
people.
Right,

3790
02:59:21,421 --> 02:59:22,211
and so people,
they.

3791
02:59:22,211 --> 02:59:23,044
They see something where someone's 
stepping out with a controversial 

3792
02:59:25,651 --> 02:59:30,651
opinion and what's their immediate idea 
is not to debate this and say,

3793
02:59:31,381 --> 02:59:33,750
hey,
this is not necessarily appropriate,

3794
02:59:33,751 --> 02:59:35,910
but here's where it's point is and 
here's where I disagree.

3795
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:38,040
No,
fire him.

3796
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:40,730
Punish him.
Bird,

3797
02:59:40,790 --> 02:59:42,440
Hey,
hey,

3798
02:59:42,550 --> 02:59:43,383
hey,

3799
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:46,200
show it.
I ran the Dec.

3800
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:49,400
Shoot them in the deck.
Did you Say the story about the saatchi,

3801
02:59:49,430 --> 02:59:54,430
the the executive at saatchi in london 
who was fired for inappropriate comments

3802
02:59:55,141 --> 02:59:56,700
about feminism?
No,

3803
02:59:56,880 --> 03:00:00,510
so about maybe four or five weeks ago.
What was his comment?

3804
03:00:00,690 --> 03:00:01,523
He said he was getting it as a saatchi 
and saatchi and saatchi is one of the 

3805
03:00:04,681 --> 03:00:05,514
world's biggest ad agencies and they're 
based in the uk and he is an elderly 

3806
03:00:11,851 --> 03:00:15,720
white guy and he was giving an interview
to business insider and they asked about

3807
03:00:16,230 --> 03:00:21,230
feminism and sexism in the workplace and
he said that it's not an issue.

3808
03:00:21,571 --> 03:00:22,404
It's archie because he thinks that women
have this much more expansive vision of 

3809
03:00:25,861 --> 03:00:26,694
what their priorities shoulD be and that
old old male dinosaurs have this old 

3810
03:00:29,821 --> 03:00:30,654
fashioned idea about success,
which is they want to get to the top of 

3811
03:00:32,491 --> 03:00:33,324
the ladder and they want to become an 
executive and they want to have as much 

3812
03:00:35,491 --> 03:00:36,324
money and power as possible,
but that women have a more expansive 

3813
03:00:38,581 --> 03:00:39,414
view and are a wiser and more about 
children and family and other things 

3814
03:00:45,571 --> 03:00:46,404
than just success.
And that was perceived as being an 

3815
03:00:49,141 --> 03:00:53,100
excuse for not addressing sexism in the 
workplace.

3816
03:00:53,130 --> 03:00:55,480
And he was fired.
He was fired for.

3817
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:58,890
yeah.
So that's a larry put on,

3818
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:00,130
on administrative leave

3819
03:01:00,130 --> 03:01:05,050
or whatever it is indefinitely.
And I got an to work in advertising.

3820
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:06,423
I sort of understood like that is a,
that is a whole big argument and 

3821
03:01:09,281 --> 03:01:12,370
interesting conversation that's 
happening among feminists themselves.

3822
03:01:12,371 --> 03:01:13,720
Right?
I mean even my old boss,

3823
03:01:13,721 --> 03:01:14,554
arianna huffington has written columns 
about this sort of thing in between 

3824
03:01:17,231 --> 03:01:19,360
Sleeping in between,

3825
03:01:19,570 --> 03:01:24,520
hi wonder have naps.
And dan,

3826
03:01:24,530 --> 03:01:29,530
I complain about how women can make it 
as I'm worth $100,000,000,000.

3827
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:35,020
She's.
She sounds like dr.

3828
03:01:35,021 --> 03:01:36,880
Evil,
dr.

3829
03:01:36,881 --> 03:01:37,714
Evil

3830
03:01:40,630 --> 03:01:45,630
back to me.
You will complete me

3831
03:01:46,910 --> 03:01:47,743
though.
She was not saying that she doesn't say 

3832
03:01:48,951 --> 03:01:52,460
that women are being held back.
Her point is that we need to have like a

3833
03:01:52,461 --> 03:01:55,870
broader view of success rather than just
thinking about money and power over.

3834
03:01:55,910 --> 03:01:56,930
Sure but big.
But when a,

3835
03:01:56,931 --> 03:01:58,460
what man says,
and I look,

3836
03:01:58,461 --> 03:02:02,420
I don't know that it is appropriate for 
a white man at the top of a company that

3837
03:02:02,421 --> 03:02:07,421
doesn't have very many women on the 
board to be speculating loudly about why

3838
03:02:07,431 --> 03:02:08,450
it's not important.
Why?

3839
03:02:08,451 --> 03:02:11,540
There's no sexism in his company and why
it's not important for them to address,

3840
03:02:12,350 --> 03:02:14,270
but I don't think that he should be 
fired for it.

3841
03:02:14,510 --> 03:02:15,201
Well,
you,

3842
03:02:15,201 --> 03:02:17,390
I don't think you should be able to say 
to someone,

3843
03:02:17,630 --> 03:02:18,463
you know,
how do you feel about racism in your 

3844
03:02:19,551 --> 03:02:20,384
company?
I think you should have to have 

3845
03:02:21,681 --> 03:02:22,514
something to accuSe someone of before 
you start bringing up accusations like 

3846
03:02:25,611 --> 03:02:26,030
that.

3847
03:02:26,030 --> 03:02:26,863
Like there has to be something like if 
there's a specific example of sexism 

3848
03:02:30,110 --> 03:02:32,530
that he needs to address in his company 
and then he meets,

3849
03:02:32,550 --> 03:02:34,250
needs to make a statement on it.
That's one thing.

3850
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:35,233
But how did the journaLists is just into
int interested in this powerful mens 

3851
03:02:38,150 --> 03:02:41,030
idea about women in the workforce in 
general?

3852
03:02:41,031 --> 03:02:43,250
I don't think they're making an 
accusation if you're right.

3853
03:02:43,310 --> 03:02:44,143
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying they're not making an 

3854
03:02:45,330 --> 03:02:47,360
accusation,
so if you're getting upset of this guy's

3855
03:02:47,361 --> 03:02:51,620
opinion about sexism and saying that I 
don't think there's sexism in my company

3856
03:02:51,860 --> 03:02:52,880
because I.
This is.

3857
03:02:52,890 --> 03:02:55,940
We have this diverse view of what 
success is and I think women are getting

3858
03:02:56,120 --> 03:02:58,540
away from this old dinosaur idea of what
second.

3859
03:02:58,550 --> 03:03:00,020
That's just nothing wrong with what he 
said,

3860
03:03:00,710 --> 03:03:05,030
but if you say anything about sexism 
other than what they want you to say,

3861
03:03:05,060 --> 03:03:05,900
well that's the thing.

3862
03:03:05,900 --> 03:03:07,160
What's the problem?
What upsets,

3863
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:09,890
what?
What I worry about is that people are no

3864
03:03:09,891 --> 03:03:10,724
longer being punished for using bad 
woods or slurs or attacking people or 

3865
03:03:16,820 --> 03:03:17,653
expressing flagrantly bigoted opinions 
or saying that one race or one sex is 

3866
03:03:21,561 --> 03:03:24,920
better or worse than another.
I'm kind of cool with taking people down

3867
03:03:24,980 --> 03:03:27,260
for,
for doing that shit right there.

3868
03:03:27,261 --> 03:03:31,880
Now being punished for simply expressing
opinions that feel old fashioned.

3869
03:03:32,180 --> 03:03:33,013
Exactly,
and so you have to subscribe to sort of 

3870
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:36,930
the ideological thought police.
Yes,

3871
03:03:37,290 --> 03:03:38,760
that's,
that's a real worry.

3872
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:41,420
Even if I disagree with all of those 
opinions,

3873
03:03:41,570 --> 03:03:42,403
I want to live in a society that is 
boisterous and diverse with lots of 

3874
03:03:45,981 --> 03:03:47,380
different argumentative,
you know,

3875
03:03:47,640 --> 03:03:48,473
arguments coming from lots of different 
positions and a lot of my white liberal 

3876
03:03:51,201 --> 03:03:54,230
friends disagree with this.
They say that having loose,

3877
03:03:55,910 --> 03:03:57,140
these are smart,
successful,

3878
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,533
can lose anyway.
What they say is that having someone 

3879
03:04:00,981 --> 03:04:04,010
like him expressive,
a view like that actually silences other

3880
03:04:04,011 --> 03:04:07,310
people because it deprives it.
It probably,

3881
03:04:08,350 --> 03:04:11,660
it probably inhibits the women in his 
company from feeling like they can speak

3882
03:04:11,661 --> 03:04:12,494
openly about their ambitions because 
they think that there's a misogynistic 

3883
03:04:15,201 --> 03:04:18,900
chauvinistic old dinosaur in charge of 
the company will biases.

3884
03:04:20,060 --> 03:04:20,893
I can't really comment on this unless I 
see his exact quote because we're 

3885
03:04:22,970 --> 03:04:24,710
paraphrasing here.
I'm here.

3886
03:04:24,711 --> 03:04:26,000
So what is it?
His exact quote.

3887
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:28,010
You caN't find the story

3888
03:04:28,070 --> 03:04:29,950
I was looking at when you started.
Well,

3889
03:04:29,970 --> 03:04:31,110
tell me,
what is his name?

3890
03:04:31,290 --> 03:04:33,590
What is the name of the place?
Saatchi and saatchi and saatchi.

3891
03:04:33,610 --> 03:04:37,560
Let me just see that.
S a,

3892
03:04:37,561 --> 03:04:42,561
t c h I o jamie can't spell saatchi.
bus feminism.

3893
03:04:46,010 --> 03:04:47,760
Saatchi,
fos feminism.

3894
03:04:47,761 --> 03:04:50,870
Feminism,
brouhaha for paul,

3895
03:04:51,030 --> 03:04:54,480
fau x space p a s.
Okay.

3896
03:04:54,870 --> 03:04:55,600
If we

3897
03:04:55,600 --> 03:04:58,480
scroll up please.
If women want to equal men,

3898
03:04:58,481 --> 03:05:00,550
they must change their notion of 
happiness.

3899
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:01,593
Hmm.
Women not men propelled the cult of 

3900
03:05:04,511 --> 03:05:05,344
motherhood and spread the frightening 
notion that life will never be truly 

3901
03:05:09,671 --> 03:05:14,500
complete without a baby and that no 
career plotted can compare.

3902
03:05:14,501 --> 03:05:15,334
Is that what he said?

3903
03:05:15,360 --> 03:05:16,350
No,
it's not what he said.

3904
03:05:16,351 --> 03:05:17,184
That's an opinion.
Pace by someone in the independent who 

3905
03:05:19,201 --> 03:05:20,790
is twisting his words.
Well,

3906
03:05:20,791 --> 03:05:22,720
what the fuck is his words?
Let's find out.

3907
03:05:22,750 --> 03:05:25,210
The margin might be quoted in this.
Fine.

3908
03:05:25,270 --> 03:05:25,670
His words,

3909
03:05:25,670 --> 03:05:27,520
please.
Yeah,

3910
03:05:27,521 --> 03:05:29,900
it was because of what that is is 
ridiculous.

3911
03:05:29,930 --> 03:05:32,300
Would that whatever the fuck that person
just said,

3912
03:05:32,301 --> 03:05:33,320
yeah,
you can get upset at the guy.

3913
03:05:33,321 --> 03:05:36,980
If he says that their ambition is not a 
vertical ambition,

3914
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:40,400
it is intrinsic circular ambition to be 
happy.

3915
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:42,770
Huh?
They are going,

3916
03:05:42,860 --> 03:05:44,780
actually guys,
you're missing the point.

3917
03:05:44,781 --> 03:05:47,060
You don't understand.
I'm way happier than you.

3918
03:05:47,061 --> 03:05:49,820
He explained their ambitious,
not a vertical ambition.

3919
03:05:50,060 --> 03:05:53,060
It is this intrinsic circular ambition 
to be happy.

3920
03:05:53,090 --> 03:05:54,830
What?
This is weird.

3921
03:05:55,130 --> 03:05:56,580
Tim hunt,
abandoned,

3922
03:05:56,581 --> 03:06:00,080
need career here territory.
By saying that saatchi and saatchi,

3923
03:06:00,380 --> 03:06:01,213
he'd met a number of talented women who 
reach a certain point in their careers 

3924
03:06:04,370 --> 03:06:07,730
and rejected the chance to become 
creative directors.

3925
03:06:08,150 --> 03:06:09,290
They're going,
actually guys,

3926
03:06:09,291 --> 03:06:11,720
you're missing the point,
so I'll repeat it again.

3927
03:06:11,960 --> 03:06:15,530
He saying that these women are saying,
guys,

3928
03:06:15,531 --> 03:06:17,270
you're missing the point.
You don't understand.

3929
03:06:17,271 --> 03:06:18,104
I'm way happier than you.
He explained their ambition is not a 

3930
03:06:19,851 --> 03:06:20,684
vertical ambition.
It's as intrinsic circular ambition to 

3931
03:06:22,911 --> 03:06:23,721
be happy.
Well,

3932
03:06:23,721 --> 03:06:24,554
you'd have to debate that idea because I
don't know if that's not necessarily 

3933
03:06:28,401 --> 03:06:29,234
true for a lot of women who decided to 
have children and then realized they 

3934
03:06:31,251 --> 03:06:32,084
would rather raise these children than 
climb is stupid fucking corporate 

3935
03:06:34,971 --> 03:06:35,804
ladder.
I don't think there's anything Wrong 

3936
03:06:37,371 --> 03:06:38,204
with what he said.

3937
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:40,020
Yeah.
He also says,

3938
03:06:40,230 --> 03:06:42,080
here's the original article.
He says,

3939
03:06:42,081 --> 03:06:44,690
if you think about those darwinian urges
of wealth,

3940
03:06:44,691 --> 03:06:45,710
power,
and fame,

3941
03:06:46,130 --> 03:06:46,963
they're not terribly effective in 
today's world for a millennial because 

3942
03:06:49,251 --> 03:06:51,260
they want connectivity and 
collaboration.

3943
03:06:51,650 --> 03:06:54,020
They feel like they can get that without
managing and leading,

3944
03:06:54,021 --> 03:06:55,830
so maybe we've got the definition wrong.

3945
03:06:56,310 --> 03:06:59,490
We're trying to impose our antiquated 
shit on them and they're going,

3946
03:06:59,491 --> 03:06:59,971
actually,
guys,

3947
03:06:59,971 --> 03:07:01,140
you're missing the point.
You don't understand.

3948
03:07:01,141 --> 03:07:03,750
I'm way happier than you.
Their ambition,

3949
03:07:03,751 --> 03:07:05,670
meaning women's ambition is not a 
vertical ambition.

3950
03:07:05,671 --> 03:07:07,830
It's this intrinsic circular ambition to
be happy here.

3951
03:07:07,831 --> 03:07:08,664
You just read that.
So I say we're not judging ourselves by 

3952
03:07:10,141 --> 03:07:13,410
those standards that you idiotic 
dinosaur like men judge yourself by.

3953
03:07:13,770 --> 03:07:14,603
He says,
I don't think the lack of women in 

3954
03:07:15,301 --> 03:07:16,134
leadership roles is a problem.
I'm just not worried about it because 

3955
03:07:17,761 --> 03:07:18,594
they're very happy.
They're very successful and doing great 

3956
03:07:19,771 --> 03:07:21,960
work.
I can't talk about sexual discrimination

3957
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:24,000
because we've never had that problem.
Thank goodness.

3958
03:07:25,850 --> 03:07:28,730
That last part slightly problematic.
I mean,

3959
03:07:28,731 --> 03:07:29,564
I think that what he's doing is 
expressing a very self deprecating 

3960
03:07:32,451 --> 03:07:35,480
opinion and this is talking about 
himself being like an old fart.

3961
03:07:35,620 --> 03:07:39,010
And then the following weekend they 
announced that he'd been placed on leave

3962
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:42,310
and this,
they released a statement saying,

3963
03:07:42,420 --> 03:07:44,980
um,
because of his comments,

3964
03:07:45,570 --> 03:07:46,403
it is for the gravity of these 
statements that Kevin Roberts has been 

3965
03:07:48,551 --> 03:07:51,160
asked to take a leave of absence 
effective immediately.

3966
03:07:51,370 --> 03:07:53,200
Oh my god,
everyone can suck my dick.

3967
03:07:53,650 --> 03:07:54,483
Everyone line up promoting gender 
equality starts at the top and we will 

3968
03:07:58,061 --> 03:07:58,894
not tolerate anyone speaking for our 
organization who does not value the 

3969
03:08:01,211 --> 03:08:04,360
importance of inclusion.
I don't think that's what he worked very

3970
03:08:04,361 --> 03:08:05,194
hard to champion diversity and will 
continue to insist that each agency's 

3971
03:08:07,721 --> 03:08:10,450
leadership be champions of both 
diversity and inclusion.

3972
03:08:10,510 --> 03:08:12,790
They should boycott that agency.
They're a bunch of twat.

3973
03:08:14,380 --> 03:08:15,213
I can't believe I've spent so many,
so many man hours arguing this on 

3974
03:08:17,741 --> 03:08:19,000
facebook.
This is the other thing,

3975
03:08:19,001 --> 03:08:19,834
like when you were talking about using 
cell phones and like facebook and like 

3976
03:08:23,230 --> 03:08:24,063
not using twitter so much and how kind 
of corrosive that can be to your lived 

3977
03:08:27,371 --> 03:08:28,204
experience.
Constantly dipping into that well of 

3978
03:08:29,561 --> 03:08:32,620
insanity.
It's just a fucking waste of time.

3979
03:08:32,621 --> 03:08:34,780
It's a drag on my time these days,
joe.

3980
03:08:34,781 --> 03:08:36,970
I spend like I posted it.
So what,

3981
03:08:37,500 --> 03:08:41,680
how this blew up in my face was I posted
on facebook this article,

3982
03:08:41,710 --> 03:08:45,340
an article about this and all my comment
was was um,

3983
03:08:45,790 --> 03:08:48,180
descends shall not be tolerated.
Okay.

3984
03:08:48,280 --> 03:08:49,390
That was what I wrote.
Right?

3985
03:08:49,391 --> 03:08:50,180
Well,
tHat's a joke,

3986
03:08:50,180 --> 03:08:51,030
right?
You know,

3987
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:52,470
we're not gonna tolerate and people will
send to.

3988
03:08:52,490 --> 03:08:53,323
You

3989
03:08:53,380 --> 03:08:57,570
ended up being like pages and pages and 
pages and pages.

3990
03:08:57,571 --> 03:09:01,770
We had to migrate it into medicine job.
I had to go into private messages.

3991
03:09:01,890 --> 03:09:04,790
It's just reams and reams of back and 
forth with friends in europe,

3992
03:09:04,791 --> 03:09:07,280
friends all over the world trying to 
convince me that I'm a,

3993
03:09:07,450 --> 03:09:08,283
you know,
a chauvinist for support on suck my 

3994
03:09:10,021 --> 03:09:12,120
dick.
All those friends follow them.

3995
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:14,700
People stop.
They told me,

3996
03:09:14,740 --> 03:09:16,680
they said to me,
here's the problem.

3997
03:09:16,860 --> 03:09:19,950
This is not a prepared statement.
Not speaking off the cuff.

3998
03:09:20,010 --> 03:09:20,843
Another point that I was making,
like people don't understand what he's 

3999
03:09:22,621 --> 03:09:26,340
just having a coffee with a reporter.
I mean what he Said was not that bad.

4000
03:09:26,341 --> 03:09:27,300
He's riffing.
Yeah,

4001
03:09:27,301 --> 03:09:28,134
and,
and he's trying to speak positively 

4002
03:09:29,461 --> 03:09:31,740
about the company.
They don't have an issue with sexism.

4003
03:09:31,860 --> 03:09:32,610
Look,
he's.

4004
03:09:32,610 --> 03:09:35,040
I disagree with what he's saying.
I think it's naive.

4005
03:09:35,041 --> 03:09:37,140
I think it's kind of ham fiSted.
It's not.

4006
03:09:37,141 --> 03:09:37,831
Yeah,
exactly.

4007
03:09:37,831 --> 03:09:38,664
It's not the smartest thing to say.
It's not offensive and something that 

4008
03:09:41,220 --> 03:09:44,640
usually it's something that certainly 
opens up the possibility of debate.

4009
03:09:44,670 --> 03:09:45,660
Like you could say,
well,

4010
03:09:45,800 --> 03:09:47,310
if there's a lot of women that don't 
feel like that,

4011
03:09:47,390 --> 03:09:48,223
I feel like the door or the glaSs 
ceiling is there for them to achieve 

4012
03:09:50,881 --> 03:09:52,050
management.
Exactly.

4013
03:09:52,051 --> 03:09:53,980
And the missions and the best

4014
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:54,813
response to an idea that you disagree 
with is to respond with more ideas and 

4015
03:09:57,401 --> 03:09:58,234
to take that idea down,
not to fire the person who who had that 

4016
03:10:00,731 --> 03:10:02,080
idea,
I'm so weary,

4017
03:10:02,140 --> 03:10:03,490
I can't do this anymore.
May two.

4018
03:10:03,491 --> 03:10:05,590
And these are smart,
very smart,

4019
03:10:05,591 --> 03:10:06,424
successful people.
One of them told me that I sounded like 

4020
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:11,170
he.
He basically said that I'm the same.

4021
03:10:11,171 --> 03:10:12,004
He was remembering back to an occasion 
in the 19 eighties were an english 

4022
03:10:15,401 --> 03:10:18,490
broadcast and english sports broadcaster
cold.

4023
03:10:18,491 --> 03:10:20,140
One of the,
one of the players,

4024
03:10:20,141 --> 03:10:20,974
a nigga I really liked,
but with a whole bunch of adjectives 

4025
03:10:22,750 --> 03:10:24,480
before,
like a lazy,

4026
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:25,930
a lazy.
He's just a lazy,

4027
03:10:25,931 --> 03:10:26,890
nasty old nigga.

4028
03:10:28,140 --> 03:10:30,840
that person got fired and he said that 
I,

4029
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:34,130
I am the type of shit.
I'm just like the type of person who was

4030
03:10:34,370 --> 03:10:35,203
who was opposed to the firing of that 
person because he was at every point in 

4031
03:10:38,481 --> 03:10:39,314
time our standards evolve and you are 
just one of those white chauvinistic 

4032
03:10:43,341 --> 03:10:45,820
dinosaurs who's defending the old,
yoU Know,

4033
03:10:46,310 --> 03:10:47,143
the old guard.
And in 50 years I'll be regarded as 

4034
03:10:49,071 --> 03:10:50,240
being,
as I was like.

4035
03:10:50,290 --> 03:10:53,830
And that guy got away from his computer 
and his wife put her strap on on and peg

4036
03:10:55,130 --> 03:10:55,963
and they cried and then she took his 
credit card and she shit in his mouth 

4037
03:10:58,391 --> 03:11:00,130
and she left her house and she fucked 
her.

4038
03:11:00,430 --> 03:11:01,263
Her personal trainer,
who's a giant african american man with 

4039
03:11:03,701 --> 03:11:05,470
a dick,
like a police flashlight.

4040
03:11:05,920 --> 03:11:08,080
Fuck him.
Fuck them all.

4041
03:11:08,170 --> 03:11:10,060
I'm tired of it.
Tired of it.

4042
03:11:10,061 --> 03:11:12,040
And I.
And it makes me question myself.

4043
03:11:12,400 --> 03:11:14,340
was this neighbor,
oh neighbor,

4044
03:11:14,650 --> 03:11:17,710
someone's breaking into the neighbor's 
alarm.

4045
03:11:17,711 --> 03:11:20,020
Shouldn't be going off to sleep past 
business hours.

4046
03:11:20,410 --> 03:11:21,570
Uh,
I gotta get outta here,

4047
03:11:21,571 --> 03:11:21,881
dude.
yeah,

4048
03:11:21,881 --> 03:11:23,190
let's go.
I do this anymore.

4049
03:11:23,570 --> 03:11:26,650
I really can't do this anymore in terms 
of like subject matter.

4050
03:11:26,651 --> 03:11:30,490
I'm so tired of like validating these 
dummies opinions and arguing about it.

4051
03:11:30,530 --> 03:11:31,363
No,
I mean I'm glad that we didn't really 

4052
03:11:31,881 --> 03:11:33,650
talk about it much today.
I'm over it as well.

4053
03:11:33,660 --> 03:11:36,620
I try to stay away from it as much as 
possible and I try to let it

4054
03:11:36,800 --> 03:11:41,540
peter out the massacre conversation is 
much more complex and you know,

4055
03:11:41,541 --> 03:11:42,021
and the,
the,

4056
03:11:42,021 --> 03:11:45,950
the subject of mean you're talking about
like a real crime rape,

4057
03:11:46,100 --> 03:11:47,270
right?
Did it happen?

4058
03:11:47,300 --> 03:11:49,820
We don't know.
It was a real issue just to.

4059
03:11:49,850 --> 03:11:52,160
Women are accusing a guy,
have a real crime.

4060
03:11:52,161 --> 03:11:52,994
It's,
there's a thing happening there with 

4061
03:11:54,651 --> 03:11:55,484
this other guy.
This is not a conversation that guy's 

4062
03:11:57,711 --> 03:12:00,290
having about sexism at a company that he
worked.

4063
03:12:00,510 --> 03:12:02,790
But the thing is,
I take your point,

4064
03:12:02,820 --> 03:12:03,653
but the midst good thing is similar to 
maybe not insofar as it relates to 

4065
03:12:05,851 --> 03:12:07,590
write,
but insofar as it relates to what should

4066
03:12:07,591 --> 03:12:10,420
the penalty be against cut for 
expressing an unpopular opinion?

4067
03:12:10,421 --> 03:12:11,610
Yes.
In an unpopular way.

4068
03:12:11,620 --> 03:12:12,310
No,
you're right.

4069
03:12:12,310 --> 03:12:13,143
You're right.
He should fucking quit that stupid show 

4070
03:12:15,790 --> 03:12:16,623
and uh,
get a podcast because we always got 

4071
03:12:18,250 --> 03:12:20,680
enough skanks go listen to his gut race 
wars as well.

4072
03:12:20,681 --> 03:12:23,410
I've been on that show with everybody 
else.

4073
03:12:23,411 --> 03:12:27,310
Go fuck yourself with the people.
He doesn't support josh steps.

4074
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:29,140
Fuck off.
Exactly.

4075
03:12:29,141 --> 03:12:29,974
And if you want to hear sam harris and 
hannibal buress going to be released 

4076
03:12:35,380 --> 03:12:38,720
within the next few weeks.
Few weeks.

4077
03:12:38,830 --> 03:12:40,360
Fucking put it out,
man.

4078
03:12:40,361 --> 03:12:42,610
What are you doing?
Why are you clinging to it?

4079
03:12:42,890 --> 03:12:44,440
Trying to build up attention.
No,

4080
03:12:44,441 --> 03:12:45,274
it wasn't.
It was just a regionally planned for 

4081
03:12:46,031 --> 03:12:46,930
them.
So if I want,

4082
03:12:46,931 --> 03:12:47,764
if I was going to release it now because
that was what just when sam was fitted 

4083
03:12:50,021 --> 03:12:51,830
into the schedule,
I just throw it out there.

4084
03:12:51,831 --> 03:12:53,750
It's already done,
but it's so wild.

4085
03:12:53,840 --> 03:12:56,910
But why you,
why you call my producer?

4086
03:12:56,911 --> 03:12:57,770
I don't want to hear it.
Yeah,

4087
03:12:57,771 --> 03:13:02,771
but why are you hanging out?
Would really sit before we do that.

4088
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:03,793
Really?
If you don't release it in a couple of 

4089
03:13:04,401 --> 03:13:05,390
days,
we have a copy of that.

4090
03:13:05,420 --> 03:13:06,710
We're just going to fuck it.
Send it out there.

4091
03:13:07,010 --> 03:13:08,640
Just kidding.
Thank you josh.

4092
03:13:08,641 --> 03:13:09,474
So people live.
Everybody lives forward on all of your 

4093
03:13:10,941 --> 03:13:12,050
pod platforms.
Joe.

4094
03:13:12,051 --> 03:13:13,460
It's always wonderful.
Always a pleasure.

4095
03:13:13,461 --> 03:13:15,430
I really appreciate it.
We've got to do this more often.

4096
03:13:15,431 --> 03:13:16,460
Absolutely.
Every tear,

4097
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:18,350
open invitation,
you know that.

4098
03:13:18,680 --> 03:13:22,160
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
See as soon you fuckers.
