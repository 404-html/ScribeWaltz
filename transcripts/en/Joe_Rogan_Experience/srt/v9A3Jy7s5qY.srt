1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,760
Bom Bom four,
three,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,960
two,
one.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,980
Ben Greenfield eats ants.
Just want everybody to know,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,250
hey,
if I was going to go to Disney as much 

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:13,440
as you go to Disney,
I'd eat a lot more black ants.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,620
Why are you eating it?
Supposedly I actually don't know that 

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:18,620
much about dance.
I'm just,

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,550
I'm just eating it because it supposedly
gives you energy.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,730
I need to pick me up this morning.
We lifted the waste this morning and I 

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,181
needed a second boost of energy.
But apparently these ants live in 

11
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:32,721
Ginseng roots and they have something 
that grows in their heads that acts as 

12
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:37,551
like a nootropic.
It's like some kind of a chemical 

13
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:39,651
nootropic and it also supposedly is one 
of these Chinese energy tonics.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,180
It's like the whole,
you know,

15
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:43,500
the doctrine of signatures,
you know,

16
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:48,501
the doctrine of signatures.
Now it's the idea that that things in 

17
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,830
nature give you clues,
right?

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,110
So,
so like when you slice open a tomato,

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,630
you've got the four chambers of the 
heart and tomato,

20
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:58,470
supposedly good for the hearts or 
pomegranate is good for your blood.

21
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:01,590
And the little pomegranate seeds look 
like red blood cells.

22
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:04,470
You slice open a carrot that looks like 
an eye or you,

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,450
you crack open an egg,
it looks like an eye.

24
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,100
Those are,
those are good for your vision.

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,960
Um,
sweet potatoes,

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,820
which everybody thinks is like at like a
sweet,

27
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,821
sugary food,
those are actually shaped like a 

28
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:16,940
pancreas and they can actually help to 
normalize your,

29
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,290
your Beta cells,
like your,

30
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,460
your insulin producing Beta cells in 
your pancreas.

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,760
So you're looking at walnuts for your 
brain and people talk about a Aba 

32
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:26,880
Cahtos,
right?

33
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:31,881
Supposedly they look a little bit like 
an ovary and they're good for female 

34
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,210
reproductive function.
So you can,

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,240
you can carry that over from the plant 
kingdom into the animal kingdom and say 

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,591
that if you eat ants because they're 
such energetic endurance driven 

37
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:43,080
creatures that it supposedly will make 
you stronger.

38
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,400
Boys,
that's a stretch.

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh wait til this stuff hits me in the 
arm.

40
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,530
Wrestle.
Find that.

41
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,100
Have you been doing it for awhile?
How long have you been taking this 

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,100
stuff?
That was the third time I've,

43
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,660
I've actually used it.
You just send dissolve.

44
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,670
I mean,
I use it for workout a couple of times.

45
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:58,410
So this is your concoction,
right?

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,070
You took ground but ants.
I didn't grind up the answer myself.

47
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,460
That would have been exhausting to catch
you by the up.

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,720
I bought ground up black ant powder and 
just pulled up some Ginseng.

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,910
Yes,
I don't think they're called.

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,380
That's actually,
that's where I bought them.

51
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,290
So that's where I bought them.
Last part,

52
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,240
Paulie.
Righteous ants.

53
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,580
A Qi tonic of Chinese herbalism.
But you know what?

54
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:23,220
The Chinese people are also into the 
Rhino Horn.

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,040
It's not just a pre workout or according
to the website.

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,580
It's a pre workout.
Super Herbs,

57
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,710
a super supposedly far more 
scientifically super regular food.

58
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,450
Right.
It's like a super food.

59
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,450
Exactly.
I'm a little annoyed with that word.

60
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:37,300
Super.
I,

61
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,350
I like that idea though,
of the doctrine of signatures.

62
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,230
Rarer like certain things that I see in 
nature being good for you.

63
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:44,580
There's,
there's one called,

64
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,140
um,
I forget the,

65
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,230
uh,
the name of this plant,

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,260
but it's called the insulin of the heart
and it's amazing for decreasing 

67
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,241
sympathetic nervous system activation 
and causing you to relax and it has 

68
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:02,871
these beneficial cardiovascular 
properties and people who are just so 

69
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:03,730
driven that they tend to have,
for example,

70
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,990
you know,
a heart attack or an emi and it's uh,

71
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,710
it's not split.
Lance thies,

72
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160
I forget the name of this but it,
but it looks like a heart and it has all

73
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:14,800
these red vessels that kind of come off 
it.

74
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,290
It's called the insulin of the heart.
Um,

75
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,990
there's,
there's an APP that my kids and I used 

76
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,160
to identify a lot of these.
It's called flower checker.

77
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,580
So you read about this and stuff online 
and then you started taking it and then 

78
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,780
you mix it in some sort of a tincture 
here.

79
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,450
Just vodka.
Yeah.

80
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,670
Yeah.
Urbane that stuff nature.

81
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,350
But forgotten remedy for heart disease 
bay.

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,450
And I interviewed a physician on my 
show,

83
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:45,451
Dr Thomas Cowan,
and he wrote a book about how the heart 

84
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:48,700
is not a pump and he talks about the 
true reason for heart disease,

85
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,730
being sympathetic nervous system 
overdrive,

86
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,920
what?
What does he mean by the hardest,

87
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,950
not a pump mineral depletion and 
dehydration and what he means by the 

88
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,580
heart is not a pump.
It's a fascinating book.

89
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,610
The shape of the chest is a,
I believe it's called like a tetrahedron

90
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:10,891
or some something like that,
but basically as fluid moves through the

91
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:15,931
heart,
the action of the fluid actually moving 

92
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,841
through the heart allows it to pass 
through the heart and not have to be 

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
pumped through the body,
but rather the shape of the heart is 

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
almost like causing the fluid to move in
a vortex.

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,300
And so most certainly out of the oh the 
heart,

96
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,680
the heart contracts,
but,

97
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,700
but it's less of a pumping action and 
more of like a,

98
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,740
like a vortex flow that it creates.
A book's called why your heart is not a 

99
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,280
pump.
It's very interesting.

100
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,670
Is it why well received amongst 
scientists.

101
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,740
It kind of flies under the radar a 
little bit.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,810
Yeah.
Yeah,

103
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,350
but it's.
It's an interesting book.

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Short book.
It's like maybe pages loan universally 

105
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,440
regarded as a pump.
Yeah.

106
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,780
I don't know if,
if you would necessarily classify it as 

107
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,850
a pump as much as a contracting muscle 
that boom,

108
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,180
boom,
boom,

109
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,590
but when you die and then they bring you
back to life,

110
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,210
they push your heart to make it pump.
Pump,

111
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,920
pump,
pump,

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,860
pump,
pump seems good.

113
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,280
Yeah.
So I don't know.

114
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:14,830
Shit and read the book.
It's interesting.

115
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,300
It's interesting,
but this,

116
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:16,900
this,
uh,

117
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,960
this flower checker app is flower 
checker APP.

118
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,640
It's really cool.
You,

119
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,730
you take a picture of a plant and then 
there's a team of live botanists on the 

120
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,621
other end and within 24 hours they 
identify the plant for you and you can 

121
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,300
learn it's edible properties.
It's medicinal property.

122
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:37,420
So my kids and I can walk around and 
take pictures of different plants,

123
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,370
different flowers,
different things on our land,

124
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,910
and it develops this online or Barium 
that then allows you to keep track of 

125
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,710
all the different plants and what you've
learned about them and what they're good

126
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:52,711
for.
So we use that whenever we're 

127
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:55,021
identifying plants.
There was one time when we were fishing 

128
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,021
off the,
off the,

129
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,690
uh,
the north fork of the clearwater.

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,990
So we went on this fly trip and we're 
starting

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,860
this water,
the clearwater up in Idaho.

132
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,040
So we were near a Grangeville.
Most people fly into Grangeville,

133
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,780
Idaho.
It's a great fly fishing,

134
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,000
huge steelhead.
And uh,

135
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,730
the,
the hike that we went on,

136
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:13,020
we didn't have our phones or anything 
with us to take pictures of,

137
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,210
of what we were finding.
And we found this,

138
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:17,630
this enormous,
uh,

139
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,630
almost like a,
like a field of wild asparagus,

140
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,180
which,
and my buddy who was with us,

141
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,960
he had bear broth that he was,
that he was,

142
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:29,320
it was like a bare bone broth that he 
had in this vat back at the cabin.

143
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:34,321
So we harvested all this asparagus and 
this was before it went out fishing and 

144
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,140
I put all the asparagus into the bone 
broth and then just left for the day.

145
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,660
And then we came back and we had,
we had fish,

146
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:43,661
we had bone broth,
we had asparagus and we all ate this 

147
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,830
bone broth and it turns out that this 
stuff was not asparagus.

148
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,280
So my kids in our heads were spinning 
all night.

149
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,530
The guy that owned the cabin,
apparently he didn't sleep,

150
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:56,531
he was just like hunched over the toilet
the whole evening and it turns out this 

151
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:57,830
stuff is cold.
I think it was Brassica,

152
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,890
it looks like Asparagus,
but apparently it has very high levels 

153
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,311
of nicotine.
So we were all career dosed on nicotine 

154
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,870
for the next two days on this fishing 
trip to be really careful.

155
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,090
That's the only time I haven't used that
APP to actually go,

156
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,030
go plant food chain.
Who thought it was asparagus?

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,070
We all thought it was asparagus,
you know,

158
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,530
it was me,
one of the chefs who is out of the cabin

159
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:22,780
with us,
uh,

160
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,090
my kids and,
and twin nine year old boys know a lot 

161
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,150
about plants,
so we always trumps the wild asparagus.

162
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:30,480
But I was convinced it was asparagus.

163
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,590
I mean I,
I kind of tasted it out there where we 

164
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,511
were.
We were out in the field and it tasted 

165
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:37,511
like asparagus,
but no,

166
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,650
it's not asparagus.
It's Brassica Jesus Christ.

167
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,470
That sounds horrible.
Yeah.

168
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,690
But there's another app called plantsnap
and apparently uses artificial 

169
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:46,760
intelligence,
you know,

170
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:49,280
like a reverse google image search to 
identify a plant.

171
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,770
I've used that and it's,
it's useless.

172
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,950
Anything you take a picture of it,
it doesn't seem to be able to identify 

173
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,801
anything but this flower Checker,
it's just live people on the other end 

174
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:03,340
does google,
there's a google image search is like 

175
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,340
some,
some,

176
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,060
there's an application that use cameras 
and if you take a photo of something can

177
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:13,061
identify exactly.
I think that's called like a reverse 

178
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:13,490
google image search or something like 
that.

179
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,550
But,
but the ai doesn't seem to work as well 

180
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,680
for plant identification and I would 
imagine it's looking at the leaves,

181
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,060
the shape of the leaves,
how it comes up,

182
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,890
plan,
you know,

183
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,900
the veins,
the opposite versus symmetrical and 

184
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,480
everything that goes into a plant 
identification.

185
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,060
But now when you,
you still rather go with a real person.

186
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,050
Still had.
Yeah.

187
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,510
You got to go with a real person.
You got to go with an actual botanist.

188
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,190
Steelhead are a ocean bound,
a rainbow trout,

189
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,380
right.
They come forth.

190
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,210
Yeah.
Um,

191
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,020
do you guys do catch and release or do 
you eat them?

192
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,110
This was all catch and release though.
There is a common thing with those.

193
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,000
There's a certain kind that you can 
catch.

194
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,800
And I,
I'm not a fly fishing expert.

195
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:53,801
This is like a fun trip with my kids to 
learn how to fly fish and we didn't 

196
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:54,440
catch any of that.
We could actually keep.

197
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,100
Yeah.
I don't understand that kind

198
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,090
of fishing.
It's weird,

199
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,650
you know that take a long trip,
go out into the wilderness,

200
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,430
go to the river,
catch fish,

201
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,370
let it go.
Yeah.

202
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,610
Seems it's,
it's the thrill of the chase.

203
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,350
I get it.
It feels great for kids.

204
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,230
Yeah.
I've done it with kids,

205
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,480
bass fishing before,
but it's just a can't do that.

206
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:13,920
When you bow hunt?
Nope.

207
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,650
Nope,
no catch and release.

208
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Weird thing.
You're sticking a hook and a fish's 

209
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:20,700
mouth and then letting it go.
Yeah,

210
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,020
got them.
Let's let them go.

211
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,480
They're hard to reel and less like a 10 
minute fight.

212
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,350
Efficient and they're big.
Yeah.

213
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:29,730
There's powerful fish to the ocean 
currents.

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ocean fish are almost always more strong
when you pull them in a freshwater fish,

215
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,960
other.
They're very strong.

216
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,880
They're stronger than ants,
I would imagine.

217
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,230
Yeah.
Spiel back to the animals.

218
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,720
Go back to this amp thing and,
and tell me what has been the reaction,

219
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,600
like when you take it,
how you feel.

220
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,550
It's more just like a cup of coffee.
You really did feel like you do.

221
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:53,690
You do feel more energy.
Do you think it's because of the Ginseng

222
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,700
or is it possible to see both fact and 
they just live within the gen sing and 

223
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,820
that makes the story sexier for the 
website that sells.

224
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,460
So you think just eating the ants 
themselves,

225
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,920
give you an entry.
I would imagine that you'd have to catch

226
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:09,921
a lot of ants to get what you'd get out 
of like all the powdered extract that 

227
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:09,921
they sell you.
Right.

228
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:13,200
But I mean eating the powdered extract 
then just that somehow or another.

229
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,210
What's the mechanism for giving you 
energy?

230
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,770
Uh,
there's some chemical that's in the ants

231
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,920
hot.
I don't know the mechanism of action 

232
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:23,920
again,
I like,

233
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,301
hi,
I really don't claim to be an expert in 

234
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:26,301
index extract,
but yet you got a bottle of tribe.

235
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,510
I have a bottle of.
It was,

236
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,720
it was in with all my other supplements 
and uh,

237
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:34,721
and uh,
I was packing up this morning and 

238
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,771
thought it would be an interesting one.
It is interesting to show to you just a 

239
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:37,650
giant bottle that says aunt on it.
What is the,

240
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,280
what's the standard way that people take
it to the cloud or as a tincture?

241
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,690
Yeah,
I would imagine you could probably put 

242
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:48,690
it in a smoothie,
you know,

243
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,620
with your,
with your bee pollen and other insect 

244
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:51,620
derivatives.
Yeah,

245
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:51,720
yeah,
yeah.

246
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,670
But yeah,
what a weird one,

247
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:54,410
Huh?
Yeah.

248
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,900
Anyways.
Oh,

249
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,610
you should've come out and done the 
spartan.

250
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,240
I knew you were Disney.
Yeah,

251
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,160
I told you I couldn't go.
So I said I should cook Spartan.

252
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:10,161
Spartan's a sport.
Ends a little bit more interested in 

253
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:10,410
business in my opinion.
I didn't go to Disney for myself.

254
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,330
Yeah,
yeah they have.

255
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:17,331
They have kids you'd like to,
but you were doing commentary or 

256
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:17,331
something?
Is that what you're doing?

257
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:17,331
I was doing the uh,
they,

258
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:18,990
they have commentary all day long with 
these spartan race.

259
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:21,390
So I was doing the commentary and then I
raced the next day.

260
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,570
Oh,
so you did it one day competition one 

261
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:26,570
day.
So it was a two day race thing.

262
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:26,570
It would,
they do the way they do it,

263
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,210
they get like tens probably I would say 
some of these races,

264
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,770
eight to 12,000
athletes that in that approximate range.

265
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,300
So they break it up,
they go out,

266
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:38,010
they break it up,
there's long races,

267
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:41,130
they're short races.
So the long race was 13,

268
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,010
about 13 miles,
which on the road half marathon,

269
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,500
that'd be like a 105 that an athlete 
would do on a,

270
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,590
on a race like that.
And so with the obstacles and the hills 

271
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,890
and it's not a big bear,
which is a ski,

272
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,440
which I just found out from my wife 
apparently used fake snow.

273
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
There's like a pond at the top of the,
at the top of the resort that they make 

274
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,820
all the snow with apparently snow,
but it's artificially created.

275
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:08,821
Right.
It's like you make with the snow 

276
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,911
machines artificially created real snow 
made from water at the top of the 

277
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,490
mountain in the snow machine.
It's not.

278
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:12,890
Yeah,
it's,

279
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,050
it's not.
It's not foam.

280
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,930
I wonder if anybody's trying to do that 
to make foam snow.

281
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,070
Yeah.
And it makes some snow.

282
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,010
Asked him at the mall in Dubai.
They've got some,

283
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,800
they've got something over there.
I don't know if that's a snow machine.

284
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:28,801
Right.
It probably is actual Snow Dragon Mall 

285
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:29,080
in Dubai.
They have like a crazy hill.

286
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,670
Right.
And it gets,

287
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,510
you know,
they have an actual indoor skew.

288
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,130
They've penguins and indoor ski resort,
everything.

289
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,460
Yeah.
So this race though,

290
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:41,461
for those same 13 miles,
it's like two hours and I think the 

291
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:41,950
winter did a to 16 to 17,
something like that.

292
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,150
So it's.
So you have to jump over a lot slower.

293
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,190
You gotta carry,
carry sandbags and carry big gravel 

294
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,861
buckets.
It's like doing yard chores and then 

295
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:54,760
running to the next chore,
Barbwire Crawling and Hoisting ropes.

296
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:00,030
But it's good for full body fitness 
because I used to do triathlon when I 

297
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,030
did triathlon it was weak,
right?

298
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,120
Because you swim,
you bike,

299
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:06,121
you run.
And I had an engine that could go for 

300
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:06,121
days,
but I did my first spartan race.

301
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,560
I couldn't climb a rope and I couldn't 
carry sandbag up a hill.

302
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,080
So I think it's good for functional 
fitness.

303
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,070
Here it is right here at.
Tammy's.

304
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,560
Got a video out there that's a,
that's a stadium.

305
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,250
That's actually a good way to start 
inside of the stadium.

306
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,240
Dodger's stadium a couple of years and.
And you know,

307
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,250
you don't have to get muddy and there's 
no fake snow and the stadium races can 

308
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,250
selfies.

309
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,610
I don't know how it can be kind of a 
joke because some people will go out and

310
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,990
uniforms with big cowboy hats on and you
know,

311
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,020
dressed up as spiderman in their Lycra 
and then some people they have these 

312
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:43,660
elite waves where it's actual,
you know,

313
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,900
legit athletes doing this kind of 
interesting though.

314
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,780
But it is,
you know,

315
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,480
you can see you move your body in a lot 
of different ways on these courses.

316
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:53,220
So it's fun.
You know,

317
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,260
it's fun to train for it because you got
to train all your different body parts 

318
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,480
and you train for power and strength and
there's endurance.

319
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:03,481
So it's a good mix of everything.
I didn't know they're doing them in 

320
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:04,000
stadiums.
That's kind of cool.

321
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,210
The stadium races are cool because you 
show up at a t and t stadium,

322
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:12,211
we're running a race and you go up and 
down and they will turn a stadium into 

323
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,660
like a three to four mile event.

324
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,610
I mean,
that's how many times you go up and down

325
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:20,611
the stairs and they have an event for 
the kids where the kids will go up and 

326
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,510
down the stairs and the kids have 
miniature sandbags and miniature spears.

327
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,500
So it actually is kind of a cool then 
that's pretty bad ass that looked family

328
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,570
except for his fucking selfie stick.
Like everything must be documented.

329
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,780
You cannot live in this life without 
people knowing exactly what you're doing

330
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:37,570
at all times.
Running a selfie stick.

331
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm taking my kids to one of those,
uh,

332
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,170
those trained hunt competitions this 
weekend.

333
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,610
Oh yeah,
in bonners ferry.

334
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,640
So they're going to do their first 
actual kids and same thing,

335
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,440
it's the kids' events where the kid 
shoot,

336
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:52,441
they've got 15 to 20 yard shots and then
they have like a sandbag lift and a run 

337
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:56,440
and then they've got another shot and 
then they've got burpees up and over 

338
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,440
cooler and another shot.

339
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,180
And there's a,
there's a grownup event and a kid's 

340
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,180
event.
Those things are fun too.

341
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,980
And that's,
those are really interesting.

342
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:05,630
The idea behind them is kind of cool too
because it lets people know what like if

343
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:10,631
you're,
if you're involved in one of those back 

344
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:10,631
country backpack hunts,
it's,

345
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:15,240
it's very much a physical event,
like pretty much you're carrying most 

346
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,760
likely at least 35 to 45 pounds on your 
back,

347
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,240
especially if you're carrying your camp 
on your back and then you're hiking,

348
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,950
you know,
thousands of feet of elevation.

349
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:25,700
You're up and down,
climbing over logs and shit.

350
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:30,701
You're carrying your bow.
There's a lot of physical exertion 

351
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:30,860
involve like there will.
There's a lot of crawling,

352
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,450
a lot of crawling.
Yeah.

353
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,770
Yeah.
I mean you did that.

354
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,970
Hawaii hunt hunt,
Lanai Lanaya.

355
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,370
I hunted Kona,
uh,

356
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,470
I guess it was like five weeks ago.
And on the sheep hunt because the sheep 

357
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,801
stale and the in the open plains you'll 
crawl sometimes for an hour and a half 

358
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:49,100
to two to get close enough for a shot.

359
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,920
Yeah.
The final day when I killed,

360
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,940
I killed two axis buck out there and the
final day we crawled for at least an 

361
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,450
hour,
at least an hour,

362
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,510
like super fucking slow.
Those things are switched on.

363
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,910
It's frustrating to with with an enema 
or sheep.

364
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,600
Sheep are not stupid.
They're smart.

365
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,600
No,
they're not as fast as an access,

366
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,930
but that's the most frustrating part is,
is you'll put on a crawl,

367
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,790
right?
Maybe you're 200 yards out and you spend

368
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,920
an hour getting 60 and then the wind 
swirls.

369
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Yeah.
They pick you up and they're off and 

370
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,100
that has to stand up and brush yourself 
off and you got to go crawl again.

371
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,880
Yeah.
But you know,

372
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,420
if it was easy wouldn't hunting.
Yeah,

373
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,460
just be killing.
I got one of those jungle scrub cows.

374
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,200
I told you how you were telling me about
that.

375
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:34,510
So these to explain to people what a 
scrub bull is because apparently they're

376
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:34,710
just.

377
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,730
There's feral cows and bulls and cows.
I shot a cow and I thought at first that

378
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:44,330
it was going to be kind of a stupid 
hunch and the cow because it,

379
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,820
you know,
the,

380
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,860
the pigs are pigs that they eat really 
well because they feed on macadamia 

381
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,501
nuts.
They're a lot better than the pigs in 

382
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:53,501
Texas and they taste amazing.
Now you're Damien.

383
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:53,770
We did it,
we did it,

384
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:55,390
yeah.
Was very fatty and it's like,

385
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,870
like a nutty meat.
So we did a Cinco de Mayo cookoff,

386
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,610
me and my kids and we took the ribs 
from,

387
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,060
from this pig.
Then I shipped back so you know,

388
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,660
it costs 150 bucks to ship 250 pounds of
meat back from Kona.

389
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,840
So had sheep,
pig and cow and shipped it all back,

390
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:15,530
which is not that expensive.
And the pig was,

391
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:15,940
I mean,
it,

392
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,890
it ain't better than any pork I've ever 
had in my life.

393
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,250
These ribs.
And we blended them up and my kids made 

394
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,250
it,
made an adobo sauce with the peppers and

395
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,960
they have a little food podcast.
So we,

396
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,450
we did all this for their food podcast.
But oh my goodness.

397
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:32,240
It's like the fattiest but,
but like a nutty,

398
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,810
flavorful fat [inaudible] because they 
feed on these macadamia nuts,

399
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,220
you know,
there's no grain,

400
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,580
there's no corn and they're just wild 
and running around out there.

401
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,300
So the pig was really good,
but the cow was tough.

402
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,300
It was,
it was a,

403
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,320
it was a tough cow.
I went on the first day we were out 

404
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,320
there,
I took the back strap and I soak that in

405
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,950
lemon juice all day and in that kind of 
broke it down a little bit and it wasn't

406
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,951
that bad.
But what I do when I got home was I've 

407
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,580
got a refrigerator in my garage and I 
hooked up a temperature controller to it

408
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,230
and get this temperature controller.

409
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,840
It's called a four one nine,
you know,

410
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:06,810
keep the temperature of the refrigerator
about 34 to 38 degrees.

411
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,190
So rather than plugging the 
refrigerator,

412
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,200
the wall,
you plugged into this,

413
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:13,290
this temp control unit and then you put 
a humidifier in and a fan like on the,

414
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,950
on the bottom of the fridge and then you
take all your meat and you lay it out on

415
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:21,951
grates in the refrigerator.
And I left it in there for about three 

416
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:25,221
weeks to scrub cow and it develops this 
hard gristly coating on the outside of,

417
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,660
of the,
of the meat.

418
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,060
And then I took it out and just sliced 
all of this hard gristly part off of the

419
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:38,061
outside.
And the inside of that meat was like 

420
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:38,061
butter to dry aging and essentially 
that's it.

421
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:40,500
That's exactly what it is.
It's a dry age and refrigerator,

422
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,600
but you control the,
the temperature,

423
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:47,601
you want about 34 to 38 degrees and then
the humidity can vary a lot more than 

424
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:47,760
that.

425
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,430
But I kept the humidity at about 60 to 
70 degrees.

426
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,910
And then basically you just slice off 
all that hard gristly external coding 

427
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,680
and you've got this amazing super soft 
super tender.

428
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,110
And then I just have this,
uh,

429
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,090
this vacuum packer and it's a cool 
little unit.

430
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,190
You can just cut a bag any size you 
want,

431
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:06,990
right?
For a neck or a shoulder,

432
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:11,460
like a smaller bag for a backstrap or a 
tenderloin and a bagged it up.

433
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,150
Yeah.
I have one of those vacuum sealer.

434
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,340
So those things are awesome.
Yeah.

435
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,070
So the dry aging was key.
Yeah.

436
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,710
I have friends that have one of those 
walk in coolers and they could set it to

437
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:22,530
a certain temperature and they hang the 
meat and dry aged out there.

438
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,560
But I don't know what walk in cooler 
they have because I looked into the dry 

439
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,820
aging refrigerators and those are like 
$5,000.

440
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,550
But you can get a refrigerator off 
Craig's list that a four.

441
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:38,551
One thing I bought that was like 50 
bucks I'll think is it on the 

442
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:39,510
refrigerator?
Just a normal size refrigerator.

443
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,220
And so and so the food is on grates 
inside the refrigerator.

444
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,000
So it took all the shelving out of the 
refrigerator and I just put some plywood

445
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,920
on,
on either side of the refrigerator and I

446
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:50,990
put these metal.
Great.

447
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So,
so you constructed your own sort of 

448
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,880
exact and then just laid the meat down 
on the grates and put the fan on the 

449
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,101
bottom of the refrigerator.
So it's constantly circulating air 

450
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:04,700
inside the refrigerator.
And then the temperature controller has 

451
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:04,700
this,
uh,

452
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,420
uh,
it'll display.

453
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:07,860
So in my kitchen,
in my house,

454
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,810
it'll display the temperature and the 
humidity.

455
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:14,811
So I know if something goes wrong.
So not all that meat spoils inside the 

456
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:14,811
refrigerator.

457
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,800
Cause I'll see when I'm inside my 
kitchen it'll read that,

458
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,120
that the temperature is getting too 
high.

459
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:23,121
And the refrigerator,
maybe somebody unplug the fridge or the 

460
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:23,121
controller,
you know,

461
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:23,850
needed to be reset,
which happened a couple of times,

462
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:26,010
but if you want to keep an eye on it,
yeah,

463
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,040
that's a great way though to take meat 
and make it far more flavorful.

464
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,380
More tender.
Well,

465
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,280
especially that kind of meat.
I mean,

466
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
that's tough anyways.
It's tough.

467
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,060
Gamey.
Yeah.

468
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,280
These,
um,

469
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,190
water buffaloes,
like you see the one behind me,

470
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,250
a buddy of mine shot one of those in 
Australia and he said that he had a 

471
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,000
campaigns.
He had a piece of it in his mouth and 

472
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,000
who's chewing one piece for a half an 
hour.

473
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,760
That's how tough it is.
And this was the backstrap,

474
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,540
which was one of the more tender parts 
of the body.

475
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,800
There's this idea of animals that's good
for.

476
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,920
It's good for your jaw.
It's good for your teeth structure.

477
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,870
Like there was this guy,
I think it's maximum mew.

478
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,740
My brother sent me this,
this youtube video of this guy,

479
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:09,070
but his,
his whole idea is that that humans,

480
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:14,071
jaw structure,
our bone density or teeth or trigeminal 

481
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:17,431
nerves,
all of that don't work as well as they 

482
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:18,250
should because we grow up on soft food.
We don't have to chew food.

483
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:23,270
It makes sense.
A lot of boxers to like big chunks of 

484
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,270
Bazooka,
bubblegum.

485
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,210
It gets kind of hard after awhile.
Exactly.

486
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,060
Dig into it and develops muscular 
endurance or your jaw Mazda.

487
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,160
Um,
uh,

488
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,570
I've seen machines rather where you take
like a leather strap in your mouth and 

489
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,560
you're hanging a piece of weight from it
and you're,

490
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,740
you're doing this.
I,

491
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
yeah.
People were selling those for awhile as 

492
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,060
a way to decrease rating of perceived 
exertion during exercise,

493
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,770
exercise mouthpieces and that.

494
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,770
The advertising on them was that the 
vikings used to chew on leather before 

495
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,230
they go into battle to reduce pain and 
increase their time to exhaustion.

496
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,290
And so they actually sell these 
mouthpieces that you bite down on when 

497
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,650
you're exercising,
but they were designed to strengthen the

498
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:07,651
jaw as much as to reduce how hard you 
felt like you were working during 

499
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,591
exercise.
And some people swear by these 

500
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:10,591
exercises,
mouthpieces.

501
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:13,620
Well,
I know that the mouthpieces supposedly 

502
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,130
can maximize the amount of effort that 
you can put forth.

503
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:18,700
Like there's a difference in the amount 
of strength you tightened down.

504
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,460
It's almost like when you shake 
somebody's hand and make a fist with one

505
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:22,810
hand than you shake their hand,
you're,

506
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,890
you're stronger.
You know?

507
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:25,540
And that's,
that's something that puzzles that.

508
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,820
Celine talks about his books.
You know,

509
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,750
about how to generate as much force as 
possible for as low as one fist.

510
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,020
You know,
even if you're going to do like a 

511
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,020
bottoms up kettle bell press,
right,

512
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,481
you can do it with one hand open and 
press and you close your hand and 

513
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:40,390
contract this fist and it's,
it's far easier.

514
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,780
So what is the idea behind that?
At some highlights energizes your entire

515
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:44,890
body.
It's Fascia,

516
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:45,690
you know,
the,

517
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,330
the,
your,

518
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,000
your,
your Fascia covers,

519
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,310
your entire body should be tightened up,
one part of it.

520
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,360
It causes you to be able to produce more
for.

521
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:58,361
So let me try some time with a 
Kettlebell or water bottle or a coffee 

522
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:01,621
cup.
I flex my hand outward when I'm doing 

523
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,280
like bottoms up kettle bell.
You Flex your hand?

524
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,720
Yeah,
I definitely flex my hand.

525
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,600
I'd never just like let it sit.
You know,

526
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,120
there's always,
there's always some tension.

527
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:09,550
It's,
it's,

528
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,440
it's,
it's full body tension,

529
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:16,441
you know,
so it's the same reason that you'll see 

530
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:18,121
a lot of tennis players or I think 
boxers do this to a Valsalva maneuver 

531
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:18,121
when you strike.

532
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,360
So you hold your breath and go right.
Understand that same thing.

533
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,850
It tightens up everything and allows you
to produce more force.

534
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,490
Um,
the uh,

535
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,380
the other gum,
you mentioned the bazooka,

536
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:32,470
there's a gum called mastic gum and I 
interviewed this guy,

537
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:34,000
Dean Karnazes,
who run the.

538
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,450
He did the 50 marathons in 50 days and 
he,

539
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:39,160
he ran the,
the traditional marathon in Greece,

540
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,350
which is apparently not 26 point two 
miles.

541
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:45,950
It's like 100 and some miles that he ran
and he would chew this mastic gum,

542
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,250
which they do use for jaw strengthen,
but it makes you produce more saliva to 

543
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,250
so.
So when you're running,

544
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,010
you know,
you can get dry mouth when you're 

545
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,010
running and in a lot of times you get,
you know,

546
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,650
be thinking about food you want to eat.
This mastic gum apparently keeps your 

547
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,800
appetite satiated and allows you to 
produce saliva.

548
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,860
And I bought some and it's to that shit.
It's A.

549
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,860
I think I got it on mastic gum.
Amazon of mastic gum.

550
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,910
Yeah,
that's what it looks like.

551
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,410
Little rocks in.
The interesting thing is,

552
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,460
is you can take it out after you're done
chewing it and then just like the next 

553
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,600
day,
put it back in your mouth and keep 

554
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:22,600
going.
You can chew that stuff for days.

555
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,331
It's like a,
like an everlasting gobstopper tastes 

556
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,450
like it tastes like ass.
It's not that it's not that good,

557
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,950
but if you have this,
uh,

558
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:31,520
there's this h pylori issue.
It's supposedly very good for that.

559
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:32,650
Yeah.
Look that one they added,

560
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,140
they added licorice,
annecy and the fennel.

561
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,890
So it tastes even shittier.
Yeah,

562
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:39,860
but,
but it's supposedly,

563
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:40,900
you know,
this idea that we,

564
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,300
we grow up on soft food and babies eat,
eat soft food.

565
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:49,301
Yeah.
You wouldn't want the capsule that 

566
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:49,301
would.

567
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:49,301
I mean the capsule would be good for 
your.

568
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:53,260
That's where you got to be careful.
There's a lot of companies sell it as a 

569
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,260
capsule.
Right.

570
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,500
Is mastic gum as a capsule but gum that 
you chew on,

571
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:58,250
that's the exact one I have that kronos 
said there's nasty trumped.

572
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

573
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:05,081
And that's,
that's the stuff that you actually 

574
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:06,710
choose to make your jaw stronger and to 
produce extra saliva.

575
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,820
Huh.
And do you use this stuff when you work 

576
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:12,820
out or you just occasionally chewing?
No,

577
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,441
I don't like to have gum in my mouth.
So many different things going on in so 

578
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:18,140
many different modalities of you're 
experimenting with.

579
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:23,141
There's no way you can do is I try stuff
and I write about it.

580
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,280
It's not like,
it's not like I'm doing mastic,

581
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:30,281
gum and black powder and injections all 
day long and it works.

582
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,560
I would think you would keep doing it 
all the time,

583
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:35,930
but it's just like you forget about a 
lot of stuff though.

584
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,730
You try out so many things.
You forget about it.

585
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,150
Like,
Oh yeah,

586
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,010
I tried that out a while ago.
It was pretty good.

587
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,600
I need to order some more of that.
So yeah,

588
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,180
you start to lose track of all the.
All the stuff I try,

589
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't have it all systematized.
Some big excel spreadsheet.

590
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:52,060
What are you doing with the exomes?
Explain that because I just got some 

591
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,300
shot into some tears that I have on my 
shoulders.

592
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,590
You got it.
It's,

593
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,590
it's exosomes.
Exosomes.

594
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,120
They're signaling molecules so your body
actually has them.

595
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:07,121
Your,
your cells have exosomes and they're 

596
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:08,860
used as cell to cell communicators.
So they interact with cell surface 

597
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,971
receptors and they'll actually carry a 
message from one cell to another such 

598
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:12,971
as,
you know,

599
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,350
uh,
you know,

600
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,130
you need to,
you need to absorb this into the cell.

601
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:21,131
You need to carry this to a joint or 
whatever you'd want to use an exome for 

602
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:21,440
to carry messages throughout the body.

603
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,730
It's part of your belief.
It's referred to as the Para System,

604
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,900
right?
You're your body's internal cellular 

605
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,691
communication system.
So the idea is that if you combined the 

606
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:36,971
exosomes with other therapies,
let like a platelet rich plasma 

607
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:41,651
injections,
which you'd do for it to increase the 

608
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:41,651
amount of growth fast.
What they did to a specific joint.

609
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:44,330
Did exosomes plus prp you,
which I,

610
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,330
I,
I can,

611
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,400
I can tell you the full procedure that I
did,

612
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:52,401
but I just got that all over my face.
My face five days ago was red and 

613
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:55,230
swollen because it was covered with 
exosomes prp injections.

614
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,410
So it's a beauty procedure.
Beautiful as you are.

615
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,510
Thank you.
Thank you.

616
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,540
You don't need change.
But now I'm a beautiful 13 year old and 

617
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,910
a 37 year old.
So the uh,

618
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,970
the exosomes can be combined with other 
things like prp and also with stem cells

619
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,440
or with bone marrow.

620
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,560
And that's what I did.
And the interesting thing is that you 

621
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,440
can get something like a placental cell.
Right?

622
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,620
And in my case,
they actually took placental cells from 

623
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,860
this lab called Kymera labs.
I had this procedure done in Park City,

624
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:29,790
Utah.
Going to him,

625
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Dr Harry Adelson and he,
he had these placental cells from our 

626
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,620
labs.
They destroy the placental cell so that 

627
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,821
there's no actual DNA from some other 
person that you're putting into your 

628
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:44,070
body.
Right,

629
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,330
which is,
which is the.

630
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,300
That's considered to be part of the risk
of stem cells.

631
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:52,260
Even umbilical or amniotic,
you're still getting somebody else's DNA

632
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:54,000
into your body,
not your own DNA.

633
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,210
So the idea is that you would take 
exosomes that you've isolated from 

634
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,351
something like a placental tissue and 
then you would mix those with your own 

635
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,310
stem cells.
In this case,

636
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:10,311
what I used was a bone marrow aspirate 
they went into to both of my iliac 

637
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:10,311
crest.

638
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,500
They took out the bone marrow.
They mix it with the exosomes and and 

639
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:15,500
these,
these videos.

640
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,610
I published both of the videos on 
youtube and it's like a.

641
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,190
it's like a huge syringe full drawing it
out.

642
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,690
I'm going to see the drawing on my hip.
How much bone marrow.

643
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,120
They're taken out of your head a lot.
I was while I was out,

644
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:32,121
you know,
I was heavily sedated during the entire 

645
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:32,121
procedure.
Will not heavily.

646
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:35,840
I was under general anesthesia,
it's called full body sedation to 

647
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:39,090
general anesthesia with few of the 
risks,

648
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,090
the actual anesthesia.
I was not conscious.

649
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,840
Not though.
I mean,

650
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:47,841
all I remember is they said count from 
100 down to zero and I got to like 93 

651
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:48,780
and then I woke up.
Yeah,

652
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:53,781
exactly.
So they took the bone marrow from the 

653
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:54,230
ILIAC crest.
Right.

654
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,130
Which is just like bone broth for your 
whole body's got collagen.

655
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Peptides got stem cells,
they mix it with the exosomes which act 

656
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,790
as communicators from those placental 
cells.

657
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,800
This place called [inaudible] labs,
which my opinion is just a great sexy 

658
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,870
name for some kind of a mysterious lab 
company where you buy placentas.

659
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,150
So basically they,
uh,

660
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,390
they mixed the exosomes with the bone 
marrow and then what they do.

661
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,370
Oh yeah.
See that's what,

662
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,230
let's let your ass that.
Yeah,

663
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,260
that's one of the early at crest.
You asked me how much they took,

664
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,440
how much they're pulling out of you.
Holy Shit.

665
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Bone marrow.
He did that like four times because he 

666
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,600
did it twice to.
Are you fucking shitting me?

667
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:38,601
This was five days ago.
He told me I was supposed to not do 

668
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:39,000
anything for two weeks,
but I did the Spartan race.

669
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:41,680
I armored myself up.
Why didn't you listen to them?

670
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,300
Well,
I,

671
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,380
uh,
I was signed up for the race and I had 

672
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,971
sponsor obligations to actually not do 
sponsors to suck my Dick [inaudible].

673
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,540
That looks like a fat Dick there.
I use like four rolls of rocktape.

674
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,050
My entire body was just taped up because
I didn't want to ruin anything that he'd

675
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,700
done.
So anyways.

676
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,770
How could he.
He did.

677
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,790
What do you mean by rocktape?
What is rock tape?

678
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,680
Kinesio tape.
You've seen this stuff before.

679
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,720
It's like what you see crossfitters were
tendinitis supports.

680
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,670
It supports the joints.
Oh Jesus.

681
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:15,880
They're going in for another tube.
Four of those,

682
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,070
four of those big tubes,
Jamie,

683
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,380
to think you have in your body.
You think you have four tubes of marrow 

684
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:23,380
floating around so I could pull out 
here.

685
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,810
Oh yeah.
Well,

686
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,180
the tubes also,
you know this,

687
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,620
when you give blood you can give like 19
tubes of blood,

688
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:34,621
but it's not as much blood as it 
actually looks like because it's inside 

689
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:34,621
of that little skinny tube.
Right?

690
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:34,990
No,
I get that.

691
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,180
So he and his partner,
it was like quite a lot.

692
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,210
What they did was he went with that bone
marrow to mixed with the exosomes.

693
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:47,911
They mix it with ozone,
which apparently using an [inaudible] 

694
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:48,880
which apparently increases the efficacy 
of the bone marrow.

695
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,730
And you're doing this for no specific 
injury,

696
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,830
no specific injury?
No.

697
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,220
This is all just for for two reasons.
Number One,

698
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,450
anti aging.
Number two,

699
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,770
just immersive journalism just to write 
about.

700
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,400
I think this stuff's fun to write about 
and look into and study.

701
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,760
So and,
and apparently the stem cell state of 

702
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:08,760
Elvis,
so this,

703
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,671
this is an over exaggeration,
but it's almost like you'd be like 

704
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,911
wolverine or like you recover faster 
when you get hurt for the rest of your 

705
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:17,530
life.
So here he goes out round two for people

706
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:20,110
who are listening to the audio,
not watching the video.

707
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,350
It's like a horse pulling a horse 
second,

708
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,560
so it's a lot of blood.

709
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,250
And uh,
then he injected my entire 

710
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,460
musculoskeletal system.
He did my cerebral spinal fluid.

711
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,530
He did all up and down the discs in my 
back.

712
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,340
Oh Daddy,
you conscious here?

713
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,960
I've got needles.
No,

714
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:38,980
dude,
I'm totally out.

715
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,260
I would not want to be conscious.
I was just box breathing.

716
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:42,340
Yeah,
I was meditating.

717
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,940
I'm totally out for this.
[inaudible] done.

718
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,050
You can see there.
I have,

719
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,630
I have the ironman corporate logo on my 
back,

720
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,330
so I didn't.
Yeah,

721
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,260
I'm technically that's trademark 
infringement.

722
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:58,380
The iron man logo I had,
I'm retaking done in my spine like that.

723
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,990
Bulging discs is awake.
It's just so weird.

724
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:04,500
They just just done a lot of this stuff 
before.

725
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:05,280
I mean,
I had my,

726
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,090
I told you this last time.
I had my stem cells taken out of the fat

727
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:11,290
and my back down in Florida and then,
uh,

728
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,430
I re injected them intravenously and 
then I tested my telomere length.

729
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,490
Look at this,
look at this.

730
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,170
They just,
Oh,

731
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:23,250
this goes on for our students.
And like I was there for three or four 

732
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,311
hours,
so they just screw it in and pop those 

733
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,580
in and find a new hole.
You're totally alcohol.

734
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,740
But I'm totally a cold.
My wife's in there freaking out.

735
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,570
She can see her somewhere in there 
holding the camera.

736
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,310
Hey,
she was,

737
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,900
she was doing a facebook live and 
answering questions as we went.

738
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,290
So get this.
His partner comes in,

739
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,750
she takes those exosomes after he does 
ankles,

740
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,920
knees,
hips,

741
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,510
elbows,
wrists,

742
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,120
back.
Every part of my mother,

743
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,460
they flipped me over by ice cold.
Yeah.

744
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,490
My wife said that was the weirdest part 
was they flipped me over and I'm losing 

745
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:54,490
limp.
Like a noodle.

746
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,300
I think she's moving my hand.
See that.

747
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,850
So,
uh,

748
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,870
then his partner came in and she's like 
a sexual performance and beauty 

749
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,011
specialist and I don't want this to turn
into another podcast about just 

750
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:06,350
injecting things into your deck.

751
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,110
But she did a hip,
but she did,

752
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,130
uh,
she,

753
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:15,131
she injected the Corpus Cavernosum,
which is the shaft of your unit.

754
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,470
And then she did the head of the penis 
and then she did my face over and over 

755
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,510
and over again,
everywhere.

756
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:31,511
Exosomes all over my face.
And I've seen some 50 and 60 year old 

757
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:37,211
women who have done this and it actually
does seem to have a pretty significant 

758
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:37,211
effect.
I don't,

759
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,720
I don't know how much of an effect it 
had on me,

760
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:40,220
but I said if they were going to put me 
under just,

761
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,470
he called it a full body stem cell make 
over.

762
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:45,110
Apparently nobody's ever in the history 
of the world,

763
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:47,260
done this before.
So if I,

764
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,270
if I die,
that's the one thing I can brag about 

765
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,270
you.
This is what I don't understand.

766
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,140
You don't need this shit.
No.

767
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,480
A lot of the,
like I said,

768
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:57,140
a lot of a lot of this stuff is uh,
it's,

769
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:02,250
it's interesting to write stories about 
and to talk about and tell people what 

770
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:02,250
it's like.

771
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,600
And then they did a,
yeah,

772
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,560
they did that on the face.
What,

773
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,390
where they do on your face here.
And uh,

774
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:13,470
that's the exosomes and mixed with PRP.
What does that inject into the face?

775
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,170
Doing it with,
what is that thing?

776
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,680
I don't remember because I wasn't awake,
but it looks like it's got little 

777
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,611
needles all over.
I think it might be like some kind of 

778
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:24,611
like dermabrasion type of thing.
I'm not sure.

779
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:25,480
Can your face up,
man,

780
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,830
I mean this was a few days ago and how 
many feel like a heel five days ago?

781
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,750
Yeah.
So I healed up pretty quickly from CSI 

782
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,070
because five was when I was doing my 
head to where I'm a great minds think 

783
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:41,500
alike.
Dude.

784
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,750
That is crazy.
That's actually what day is it too bad?

785
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,040
No,
it's Tuesday.

786
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,540
So this was actually this.
No,

787
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,250
seven,
seven days ago.

788
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,170
Seven days ago.
Mine was Wednesday.

789
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,180
Um.
Anyways though.

790
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,720
Their fucking face.
Absolutely.

791
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,330
Yeah.
And I had,

792
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,420
I actually had just gotten a concussion 
because I got in a bike accident when I 

793
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,510
was down in Austin,
Texas a couple of weeks ago.

794
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:08,170
And so the other thing that,
this is interesting because for a Tbi 

795
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:08,750
there's all sorts of things that you can
do right?

796
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:13,751
Like ketones,
exogenous ketones work really well for 

797
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:15,440
that and that's a lot of dominic 
d'agostino is research on concussions.

798
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,880
A Dha is another good one.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy chambers with 

799
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:26,050
the high oxygen plus the high pressure 
that's really efficacious for 

800
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,140
concussions.
But the other thing is stem cells.

801
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,470
And so what I did was I ordered the stem
cells that they harvested from my body 

802
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:37,301
and Florida because I think I told you 
about that the last time when I was on 

803
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,070
the show that they store.
I have like 30

804
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,720
injections of my own stem cells stored 
down in Florida that I can use for,

805
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,260
for joints,
for anti aging.

806
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,530
And I also,
one of the reasons that I did that was 

807
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:48,530
if I'm ever in a car accident,
if forever get some,

808
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,470
some traumatic injury,
I can,

809
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,110
I can heal myself faster with these stem
cells.

810
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,870
And in that happened,
I got a concussion.

811
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:58,620
I was riding my bike and Austin on,
on first street and in rush hour traffic

812
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:02,270
in a car clipped me on the side and I 
made love to the pavement.

813
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,480
My entire face got torn open.
And uh,

814
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,830
and I got a concussion,
so I did all these things,

815
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,210
have ketones,
Dha,

816
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,330
hyperbaric.
I'm a PMF.

817
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,340
That's also really,
really good for concussions.

818
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,380
Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy.
Uh,

819
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,030
it's,
it's,

820
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,940
uh,
it,

821
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,710
it,
it's a used for anti-inflammatory,

822
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,700
uh,
for,

823
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:24,290
uh,
it's,

824
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,740
it's used for sleep,
you know,

825
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:27,210
it's kind of like grounding and 
earthing.

826
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,750
There's a lot of interesting studies on 
PMF also for concussion.

827
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,450
It enhances your own stem cell 
production.

828
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:36,240
It shuts down neuroinflammation.
So I did that,

829
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:39,630
but then also a stem cells won't cross 
your blood brain barrier.

830
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,600
So I ordered up this stuff called 
Mannitol,

831
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,000
and if you inject mannitol into your 
bloodstream,

832
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,760
it increases your blood brain barrier 
permeability.

833
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,190
So this is what you do in a fight or a 
football player.

834
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:53,400
Somebody gets a concussion,
you inject with mannitol first,

835
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,710
and then you follow that up with a stem 
cell injection.

836
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,690
If the Mannitol is already in the 
bloodstream,

837
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:03,020
the stem cells cross the blood brain 
barrier and they go into he'll neural 

838
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,861
tissue with the exosomes,
cross the blood brain barrier because 

839
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:06,861
they're smaller,
very small.

840
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:11,570
They're very small.
I think they're like 100 to 200 

841
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,480
nanometers,
which is pretty small and I would not be

842
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,640
surprised if they cross the blood brain 
barrier as well.

843
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:19,910
One of the things that they were saying 
about stem cells versus exosomes that 

844
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,660
stem cells tend to get pulled up in the 
lungs.

845
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,500
They don't pass the lungs and they get 
absorbed there and they believe that the

846
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:30,501
exosomes being released by these stem 
cells are the reason why you generate 

847
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:35,691
regenerate tissue.
They think that going straight to 

848
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,580
exosomes is going to be more efficacious
than just going with stem cells.

849
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,650
So I think that some pharmaceutical 
company or some supplement company is 

850
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,180
going to make a lot of money in the next
10 years by figuring out a way to,

851
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,470
to make exosomes or figure out some way 
to do it in a way that is more available

852
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:52,940
to the general population.
Then,

853
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,250
you know,
harvesting it from placentas and you 

854
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:58,250
know,
some crazy lab.

855
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,050
So you weren't supposed to do anything 
for two weeks now for two weeks.

856
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,540
But I asked the doctor and I told them I
was going to do a spartan race.

857
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,190
He just said,
proceed at your own risk,

858
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:09,780
and in my plan,
apparently few jar the joints a lot when

859
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:11,550
they're already kinda weak from the 
surgery,

860
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:14,340
you can risk tearing a ligament 
spraining straining,

861
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,000
doing damage to a muscle that that's 
kind of weakened lax from the surgery,

862
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:23,030
from the surgery,
but is it a really a surgery because 

863
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,101
they're not cutting the the injection 
and I sprained my ankle within a few 

864
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:26,820
hours after,
after waking up from the surgery,

865
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,840
like I just kind of stumbled and it was 
extremely lax and almost like a,

866
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,530
like a pregnant woman creates this 
hormone called relaxin right?

867
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,070
And they get more flexible and they're 
able to give birth more quickly.

868
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,070
It's kind of that

869
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:39,450
same idea is the joints,
the joints and the ligaments become more

870
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:44,451
lax.
So my whole body felt a little bit more 

871
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:44,451
like,
like Gumby.

872
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:44,451
That's what that was.
Why I taped up everything.

873
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:46,270
You know,
I had knee braces on an elbow braces and

874
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:51,271
wrist braces and I felt fine during the 
race and this whole procedure was how 

875
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:52,750
many hours?
It was about four hours.

876
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,170
Four hours out.
Cold Shit Up.

877
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,120
What does it feel like when you wake up?
Oh,

878
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,210
there's a pretty funny video I posted.
I thought it was funny.

879
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,610
I was trying to speak French,
so my wife,

880
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,410
I'm like,
I have a confession to make.

881
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,900
And the doctor's like,
Oh,

882
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,240
here we go.
I'm like,

883
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,460
speak French.
And then she.

884
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,220
And then she asked me if I speak French.
Nice.

885
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,920
I didn't actually speak French and then 
you could see me trying to laugh,

886
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,000
like it made a joke.

887
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,850
But you.
Have you ever been sedated?

888
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,620
Yes.
Yeah,

889
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,250
yeah.
Yeah.

890
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,560
You're kind of loopy make up.
Yeah.

891
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,320
So I don't remember that much.
But uh,

892
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,150
and,
and I still,

893
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
I mean,
I'll be honest with you,

894
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,360
I don't notice much of a difference from
any of this stuff.

895
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,470
What's six weeks?
Yeah,

896
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,520
it's supposed to take a really long time
before it really kicks in and it flares 

897
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,251
up.
Old injuries were like kind of strained 

898
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:41,350
my upper hamstring when I played tennis 
and that's flared up.

899
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,210
Uh,
my left knee is flared up.

900
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,720
Like I'm feeling old injuries that are 
most interesting.

901
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,050
They almost like brought back,
not flared up like it's red and inflamed

902
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:51,250
and swollen,
but I feel it.

903
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:54,460
I feel my right ankle,
which I strained a lot when I was,

904
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,280
when I was playing tennis.
That one feels,

905
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:57,960
you know,
it feels like I mentioned it's weak,

906
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:58,360
it's paid.

907
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,840
It's going to be something they said 
that it could flare up old injuries that

908
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,930
you'd feel worse before you feel better.
Huh?

909
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,730
That's interesting.
I didn't hear that at all,

910
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,630
but I did hear that six weeks,
six weeks is the benchmark.

911
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,240
It's a little bit of time before they 
actually feel better.

912
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:13,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

913
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,150
The other interesting one,
uh,

914
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,180
for not only enhancing your own 
endogenous stem cell production because 

915
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,530
it actually would know a lot of this 
stuff.

916
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:24,910
It's fringe.
It's expensive.

917
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:25,480
I mean,
you know,

918
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:27,640
that procedure,
I think he's like a $30,000

919
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:32,641
procedure.
Not Everybody's going to go out and do 

920
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:32,641
that and this is another fringe one,
but I want to.

921
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,540
I mean there are ways that you can 
endogenously increase your own stem cell

922
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,440
production.
I mean,

923
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,480
in your own stem cell viability and 
health,

924
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:40,180
without actually doing stem cell 
injections,

925
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:45,270
I'm fasting is probably the the one 
that's the most efficacious in a lot of 

926
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:50,551
these things that are kind of 
uncomfortable for you seem to increase 

927
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:51,340
your body's ability to be able to heal 
or produce its own stem cells.

928
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,080
So fasting for long periods of time.
I'm not necessarily fasting with,

929
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:01,140
with caloric restriction.
I think that's the mistake a lot of 

930
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,861
people make.
They try to fast and they feel like 

931
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:04,861
crap.
But the idea is the benefits of fast and

932
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:06,550
don't come from nodding a lot of 
calories,

933
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,070
not even a lot of calories.
Isn't that great for your thyroid is not

934
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:14,071
great for your metabolism.
You want to live till you're 120 and be 

935
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,870
cold and thin and hungry the whole time 
because it'd be a horrible way to live a

936
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:19,120
long time.
So the idea with,

937
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,050
you know,
things like,

938
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:20,550
uh,
you know,

939
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,200
valter Longo is research or a lot of 
these,

940
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,890
these,
uh,

941
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,280
intermittent fasting type of diets.
As you fast and you increase cellular 

942
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,211
autophagy and stem cell production,
your own stem cell production by going 

943
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:34,220
for long periods of time without eating

944
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,980
and the magic seems to kick in and about
the 16 hour mark.

945
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:42,220
So I do 12 to 16 hours every day and 
then you get even more benefit once you 

946
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,241
get up to about 24 hours.
So I try to do a 24 hour fast from 

947
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:49,631
Saturday dinner to Sunday dinner,
but I'm still eating the same number of 

948
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:51,470
calories.
It's just a compressed feeding window.

949
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,730
Right?
So,

950
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,380
so it's not like you're starving 
yourself,

951
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:56,120
you're getting all the benefits of 
fasting,

952
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,820
but you're still maintaining some amount
of anabolic them,

953
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,660
right?
Because you're,

954
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:01,390
you're still eating as many calories,
but you're,

955
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:06,570
you're almost giving your body,
your gut in your metabolism a break in 

956
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,020
between a lot of these meals.
And that's where the benefit comes from.

957
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:11,390
That's where the Bennett,
the benefits are not from,

958
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:13,370
you know,
not eating so much damn food.

959
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,180
The benefits are going for a long time 
in between your feedings.

960
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,440
Right?
So,

961
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,980
so the idea is,
you know,

962
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:24,981
you,
you'd wake up and in the population for 

963
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:25,280
which this seems to be the most 
deleterious,

964
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:30,281
our lean active females,
they do not respond well to these long 

965
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:34,331
fasts,
are a lot of time spent doing 

966
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:35,891
intermittent fasting.
It's like the cons outweigh the pro for 

967
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:35,891
that population.
But for,

968
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:38,960
for most everybody else,
these 12 to 16 hour fast,

969
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:43,961
preferably up to 16 hours going without 
eating and then eating as many calories 

970
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,500
as you'd normally eight with the 
exception rest the,

971
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,950
the amount of calories and compressed 
feeding window.

972
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:49,610
Right.
So,

973
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,050
um,
you know,

974
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:56,051
what,
the guy whose house I was staying with 

975
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:56,051
her when I was doing the stem cell 
procedure,

976
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:56,280
Dan pump,
he's very into this stuff and,

977
00:42:56,281 --> 00:43:01,040
and he's,
he's a doctor down in a park city and he

978
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:06,041
just,
he goes all day and then he has a huge 

979
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:06,041
dinner at the end of the day,
right?

980
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:06,041
Like uh,
an enormous lovely dinner,

981
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:10,961
you know,
a couple of glasses of wine and you 

982
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:10,961
know,
stay thousands,

983
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:12,800
3000 calories for dinner.
And I'm more of like a two meal,

984
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,730
a light breakfast or light lunch.
And then just two males,

985
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,760
I've been doing the 12 to 14 hour thing 
and sometimes I have ramped it up to 16 

986
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,890
hours and I do feel better when I do 
that and I,

987
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:27,020
I definitely become more accustomed to 
not eating for long stretches.

988
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,690
And sometimes when I wake up in the 
morning I almost think,

989
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,730
should I just eat?
But then I'll stop and go,

990
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:32,990
well,
I'm not really hungry.

991
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,480
I mean it's really just a matter of 
habit,

992
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,550
force of habit that I'm even considering
eating right now.

993
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

994
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:43,241
But.
But fasting is probably one of the 

995
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:44,090
better ways to increase your own 
endogenous stem cell production.

996
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:48,140
Provided you're going for about 16 hours
and provided you're still eating as many

997
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:49,430
calories as you would normally eat.

998
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,880
The only kind of caveat to that would be
protein cycling.

999
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,940
And this is why I'm not a huge fan of 
the reverse diet.

1000
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:57,890
Were eating four to six pounds of meat a
day.

1001
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,730
Yeah,
you were.

1002
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:03,731
I'm trying that for awhile.
You're putting that on your social 

1003
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:03,731
media.
I sort of.

1004
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:07,721
But yet I was eating one of those big 
stakes every single night for dinner,

1005
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,730
just like a bunch of steak every single 
night for dinner,

1006
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,890
for how long?
And this was like 10 days.

1007
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,360
Not that long.
How'd you feel doing that?

1008
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,300
I felt pretty good.
But uh,

1009
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:21,110
but I love steak.
I was eating these bone in a bone in rib

1010
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:24,560
eyes.
I ordered them up from a Missouri,

1011
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,840
I think is where their farms are,
but they make these,

1012
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:31,841
a French cut grass fed grass finished 
bone in Ribeye steaks in there saying 

1013
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,150
that I've got.
I've remind me,

1014
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:37,260
I'll tell you how I cook them.

1015
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,030
They will tell you how I cook them 
afterwards after we finished the silence

1016
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,850
because,
because I didn't want to get because 

1017
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,771
I'll,
I'll just forget everything if I start 

1018
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:47,771
talking about cooking because I love to 
prepare me.

1019
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:48,050
So,
so real quick.

1020
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,950
Quite a few people that are doing this 
now.

1021
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:55,250
So real quick and then we'll talk about 
how to make these steaks tastes really 

1022
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:55,250
good.
Um,

1023
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,820
the,
the idea is that protein cycling,

1024
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,880
right?
Having a meatless Monday or having as a 

1025
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,671
lot of religions would do like the 
eastern Orthodoxy Church or the 

1026
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:07,941
Mediterranean Diet,
they have certain periods of time where 

1027
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:10,731
there's complete meet restriction or 
your protein intake is restricted to 

1028
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:14,700
fish and eggs for example,
and the idea is that you would strike a 

1029
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,441
sweet spot between not being in a 
constantly anabolic state.

1030
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,130
Right?
And and not having,

1031
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:24,090
having this mammalian target of 
rapamycin and constantly activated,

1032
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:26,720
which would theoretically accelerate 
aging or,

1033
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,640
or in,
in a lot of rodent models.

1034
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,640
We see that on restricted protein 
feeding actually causes aging to 

1035
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,930
accelerate.
So the idea is on your lower activity 

1036
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:39,030
days,
especially for an athlete,

1037
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:44,150
you could still intermittent fast and 
get all the benefits of that and you 

1038
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,051
could still eat as many calories as you 
would need to sustain a normal healthy 

1039
00:45:48,051 --> 00:45:48,051
metabolism.
Right?

1040
00:45:48,051 --> 00:45:49,680
So,
so you're not starving yourself,

1041
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,980
but on the less active days you would 
shift to a lower protein intake.

1042
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:58,190
Right?
So you're talking about like zero point 

1043
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:58,440
five grams per pound of body weight 
rather than what a typical athlete would

1044
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:00,360
need,
which would be depending on.

1045
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:05,361
You asked.
It was zero point seven to zero point 

1046
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:05,361
eight,
five grams per pound of body weight,

1047
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:05,361
right?
So,

1048
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:06,810
so there's some days where you're high 
protein,

1049
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,110
some days where you're low protein,
some periods of the week such as a 

1050
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,350
meatless Monday or some periods of the 
year,

1051
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:18,351
you know,
such as every quarter for a week where 

1052
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:18,420
you're eating a plant based diet or 
you're restricting me,

1053
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:23,450
you're basically giving your body a 
break from being in that constant 

1054
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:23,450
anabolic state.

1055
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,980
And I think that the,
the carnivore diet causes a lot of 

1056
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,370
people to miss out on some of those 
elements.

1057
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,360
And then if you look at the blood work,
have a um,

1058
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,960
a doctor who does die,
he published his blood work online and I

1059
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,550
don't know what else is going on with 
them from a health standpoint but,

1060
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:44,580
but you know,
he had really high blood glucose and 

1061
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,601
really low testosterone and some things 
that suggest that it might not be 

1062
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:51,651
healthy to just meet you know.
And did you have really low 

1063
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:51,840
testosterone?
That's interesting.

1064
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:54,070
It was like 200 to $300.
It's really low.

1065
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:59,110
It's really low.
Diagnosable hypogonadism combined with 

1066
00:46:59,110 --> 00:46:59,280
a,
uh,

1067
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,680
you know,
almost like borderline diabetes did.

1068
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,730
Is it possible to do it after a workout?
A,

1069
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,580
he does a lot of rowing for real high 
pressure testosterone.

1070
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:13,581
That's significantly.
It would increase your HSC RP and your 

1071
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:13,581
inflammatory markers.
Right?

1072
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:17,511
Which is why you never want to.
You never want to go to a doctor for a 

1073
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:20,361
heart checkup after you've done a 
workout because they're going to tell 

1074
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:20,361
you you're gonna have a heart attack 
based on the levels of HSC or p,

1075
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:26,150
but you know,
that blood work is just one example and 

1076
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,721
I don't want to pretend like that.
One example is going to paint with a 

1077
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,130
broad brush the entitlement carnivore

1078
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,200
diet phenomenon,
but I just,

1079
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,390
I think that unrestricted protein 
intake,

1080
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:39,391
an unrestricted meat intake probably has
an accelerated aging effect on the body 

1081
00:47:39,391 --> 00:47:43,561
and well,
here's the different Dr Ron Rosedale is 

1082
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:43,561
a doc with some good information on 
that.

1083
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,820
He's got a good video online.
What's going on with this carnivore diet

1084
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:50,821
is there's no science behind it.
There's a lot of people that are giving 

1085
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:51,070
it a shot,
a lot of people finding good results,

1086
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:54,520
but I find that people,
when they just change things,

1087
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,550
there's a period of time with a say they
feel great and that is absolutely 100 

1088
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:04,351
percent of placebo effect.
It's the same thing as like a Vegan 

1089
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,870
Diet.
You feel fantastic and named me,

1090
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,700
well,
name me one population,

1091
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:11,701
one blue zone that eats meat and nothing
else and there's.

1092
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:17,371
There's actually very few centenarians 
who are purely Vegan for their entire 

1093
00:48:17,371 --> 00:48:19,450
life because you can,
if you don't do it the right way,

1094
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:22,570
build up fatty acid deficits,
amino acid deficits.

1095
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,120
Korea team is when you don't get vitamin
B,

1096
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:28,620
12 a Dha,
but at least it's been studied.

1097
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,540
Corrine on Vegans,
right?

1098
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,580
I been a lot of studies on vegans and we
know that if you eat a like e three 

1099
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,500
live,
you know you.

1100
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,990
Oh you can.
You can supplement it.

1101
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:40,570
There's a lot of really smart vegans.
I mean those guys like rich roll,

1102
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,640
like they do things the right way,
right?

1103
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:47,950
It's a lot easier to see the piece of 
meat to get some of the [inaudible] and 

1104
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,531
some of the other amino acid you're 
trying to free up by soaking and 

1105
00:48:52,531 --> 00:48:53,950
sprouting and fermenting,
which my wife does a lot of it,

1106
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:58,980
but I watch her like she.
She's in the kitchen like three hours a 

1107
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,401
day making vegetables bioavailable 
because you have to take her hours to 

1108
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:02,700
make sourdough bread.
Do you know,

1109
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,860
to actually make a bread where the 
gluten is pre digested and it's actually

1110
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:07,490
healthy in the glycaemic index is lower.

1111
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:12,510
She's not Vegan.
She's just a rancher girl and she likes 

1112
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,581
to leave.
We have goats and chickens and we eat 

1113
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:18,721
meat but she.
She's very into like an ancestral 

1114
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:20,400
preparation of vegetables.
You deactivating a lot of these,

1115
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:25,630
these stress or is that Dr Steven gundry
talks about and you know before we part 

1116
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,670
because we're talking about Tom Brady 
and how he does like a no night shade,

1117
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:29,920
no tomato,
no potato,

1118
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:35,330
and I'd rather eat those things,
but actually figuring out a way to 

1119
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:36,850
render them more digestible and 
friendlier to the human body.

1120
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,320
Yeah.
That's the other thing too,

1121
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:41,470
when people talk about food that has 
protein in it,

1122
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,360
um,
you know,

1123
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,770
like Broccoli has so much protein,
true,

1124
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,650
not really bioavailable to shit,
ton of Broccoli.

1125
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,680
It's just not the same.
Your body doesn't absorb it the same way

1126
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:52,360
it does it.
Grass Fed rib eye steak.

1127
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:57,361
Yeah.
Body absorbs that protein instantly 

1128
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:57,361
knows exactly what he does.

1129
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:57,760
Yeah.
By the way,

1130
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,820
there,
there was a study that just came out 

1131
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:02,820
about stem cells.
They found that carnosine,

1132
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:07,260
which you find in copious amounts in 
grass fed rib eye steak with blueberry 

1133
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,440
extract,
enhanced your stem cell production,

1134
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:14,441
and it was a hugely significant number.
I don't remember the exact percentage 

1135
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:17,880
but,
but this combination of polyphenols and 

1136
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,480
flavanols with meat is a good combo.
That's why when I did the carnivore diet

1137
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:21,460
or not,
the carnivore diet,

1138
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,840
that's when I was.
When I was eating meat,

1139
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,300
I was doing lots of salads.
I was doing lots of.

1140
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:30,050
I had like wild blueberry powder.
I had these vegetable powders,

1141
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:35,051
you know,
I was doing a lot of big salads for 

1142
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:35,051
lunch,
flavanols,

1143
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:38,680
polyphenols,
any of that same thing with the high 

1144
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,740
saturated fat diet,
a high saturated fat diet,

1145
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:44,741
like the whole coconut oil thing is 
highly inflammatory in the absence of 

1146
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:49,511
plant polyphenols and flavonols,
which is why if you're doing a high fat 

1147
00:50:49,511 --> 00:50:50,810
ketonic diet,
it needs to be a plant rich,

1148
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,040
high fat ketotic Diet.

1149
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,930
Otherwise things on those lines.
You can get a lot of your friends.

1150
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,930
I mean Avocados,
yes,

1151
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:59,930
but I'm talking about more like you're 
doing coconut oil,

1152
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,550
butter and you know,
avocado,

1153
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:03,360
chocolate pudding and all these thing.
You know,

1154
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,440
your Keto genic fat bombs and all these 
recipes that are out there,

1155
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,110
but he got.
He had a lot of plants.

1156
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,440
Even in the animal kingdom,
you see animals and they rip up another 

1157
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,440
animal,
like a carnivorous animal.

1158
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,860
They're in the intestines and the 
reading.

1159
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:19,670
A lot of the organs that are chock full 
of what grass plants or herbs,

1160
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:24,671
whatever.
That omnivorous animal that the 

1161
00:51:24,671 --> 00:51:25,370
carnivorous animal is eating predicted.
Exactly,

1162
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:30,790
exactly.
When you're talking about carnivorous 

1163
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,861
diets,
the real issue that I have with it is 

1164
00:51:32,861 --> 00:51:35,501
there's almost no research other than Dr
Baker doing those tests on himself,

1165
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:36,100
which,
uh,

1166
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,480
according to you are not very promising.

1167
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,490
I didn't.
I have some friends that are trying it.

1168
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,560
My friend Jordan Peterson,
his daughter had some serious anti,

1169
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:51,070
some serious immune system issues,
autoimmune disorders,

1170
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,530
and like to the point where she's had a,
she's,

1171
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,070
I believe she's like 30,
31 set of hip replaced.

1172
00:51:57,071 --> 00:51:59,570
She's about to get one of her ankles 
replaced,

1173
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,820
like serious arthritis.
Real problems.

1174
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:03,820
The only thing that's been able to clear
that up as meat,

1175
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,430
just a pure meat diet.
So with some people,

1176
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:12,431
but she might have some,
I wouldn't say the only pages allergic 

1177
00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:13,070
reaction to plants.
I mean there might be something.

1178
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,150
The meat wasn't the medicine.
Probably the elimination of whatever she

1179
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:19,720
was saying.
She might have some sort of a,

1180
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,160
a,
a real serious problem,

1181
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,400
some sort of allergic reaction to some 
plants or to gluten and maybe a bunch of

1182
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:29,930
different ways.
A lot of these diets are right.

1183
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:30,620
Yeah.
It's,

1184
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,350
it's the elimination,
not the magic of just eating me mean,

1185
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,950
but Sean Baker keeps going on and on 
about how meat,

1186
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:40,220
heels and meet this and meet that all 
carnivorous diet and you know,

1187
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:45,221
all these people trying it like man,
it's got a lot of good stuff going for 

1188
00:52:45,221 --> 00:52:45,260
it.
But,

1189
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,350
but restriction of plant matter,
in my opinion,

1190
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:53,351
long term is not a good idea and eating 
meat all the time long term is not 

1191
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:58,421
necessarily a good idea.
And eating only plants with the absence 

1192
00:52:58,421 --> 00:52:59,030
of some meat based protein is for a lot 
of populations.

1193
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,740
Not that great of an idea.
Yeah.

1194
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:05,741
Well that's the point is that for most 
people you're going to have to 

1195
00:53:05,741 --> 00:53:07,400
experiment a little bit to figure out 
what works best for you.

1196
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:12,401
And there are people that,
especially if you use e three live and 

1197
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:15,080
algae and get your [inaudible] vitamins 
and your fat soluble vitamins,

1198
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:16,490
you can live off of Vegan Diet.

1199
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:21,490
It can be done,
but you really have to be careful about 

1200
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:21,490
it.
But then there's other people where they

1201
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:25,361
can't and and,
and you really have to figure out what 

1202
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:27,911
the fuck is going on with the carnivore 
thing to me is kinda tweaking me out 

1203
00:53:27,911 --> 00:53:32,331
because I just don't.
It's like they start talking about the 

1204
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:38,180
poisons and Fido toxins and all these 
things that are in plants that are bad 

1205
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,400
for it.
I'm like,

1206
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:43,610
okay,
but the issue with Dennis mild hormetic 

1207
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,670
exercise is bad for you.
Sunlight's bad for all that stuff 

1208
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,180
because it's going to say for a medic 
stressor is that your body responds to 

1209
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:50,810
that in a positive way.
Even show that some of the,

1210
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,780
some of the rodents outside of Chernobyl
are living longer from the radiation.

1211
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:59,810
And I'm not saying like go,
go move your cabinet next to a nuclear 

1212
00:53:59,810 --> 00:53:59,810
disaster website.

1213
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,380
But the idea is that's a hormetic 
stressor.

1214
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,050
Mild amounts of UVA and UVB.
Yes.

1215
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,050
Every day I actually,
every single day I do cold.

1216
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,930
Every single day I do hot.
If I'm not in the sauna that I'm wearing

1217
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:12,570
more clothes than I would normally wear 
when I go to the gym to get my,

1218
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:17,630
get my heart rate up and actually get 
myself into the discomfort of hot for 

1219
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,170
the heat shock protein and the nitric 
oxide.

1220
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:24,171
Everything else,
so that does for you in the discomfort 

1221
00:54:24,171 --> 00:54:26,211
of cold because it's a hormetic stress 
or they're doing tests right now at 

1222
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:29,991
Harvard,
so it's fast yoga and trying to figure 

1223
00:54:29,991 --> 00:54:32,901
out if hot yoga has the same hermetic 
stress response as I'm sauna because 

1224
00:54:32,901 --> 00:54:35,020
they know there's been quite a bit of 
work done on.

1225
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,120
It's very equivalent physiologically.
Yeah.

1226
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,880
I mean I don't do the full choreographed
90 minute Bikram Yoga,

1227
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,540
but I have one of these big Saunas.

1228
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,350
It's like it's a four person sauna and 
if I go in there by myself,

1229
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:53,100
I can do in down dog and pushups and I'd
take these,

1230
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:58,101
uh,
these cats who blood flow restriction 

1231
00:54:58,101 --> 00:54:58,101
devices in there and do pushups and 
squats.

1232
00:54:58,101 --> 00:55:00,600
And those are the research behind those 
for muscle maintenance.

1233
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:03,120
With bodyweight training,
it's very intriguing.

1234
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,840
I travel with them everywhere.
These,

1235
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:09,850
these cats who training devices and I 
just tie them like tourniquets on my 

1236
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:13,401
arms around my legs and they do a lot of
studies and seniors for muscle 

1237
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:14,940
maintenance without the need for as much
joint impact,

1238
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,880
but what happens is you get micro damage
to the capillaries,

1239
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,940
you get a big release of lactic acid 
which causes you to produce more growth 

1240
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,910
hormone after the workout.
I mean in my opinion,

1241
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:27,270
for bodyweight training,
like at this point,

1242
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,870
Katsu training like doubles.
Yeah,

1243
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,260
I've heard that before.

1244
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:36,260
I haven't really gotten into it,
but I'm very big on the sauna to the 

1245
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,470
point where obviously we have one here 
at the studio that he used all the time.

1246
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,720
I just think it's,
you know,

1247
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:45,260
those stressors that they're talking 
about as being a negative thing with 

1248
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,380
eating vegetables.
I just don't buy it.

1249
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:51,470
I just don't buy it.
People have been eating vegetables 

1250
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:53,361
forever.
I don't think they're bad access or in 

1251
00:55:53,361 --> 00:55:55,640
people like your friend with the immune 
system issue or people with leaky gut or

1252
00:55:55,771 --> 00:56:00,771
damage.
There might be a period of time where 

1253
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:01,800
you actually have to be careful and 
really careful with gluten,

1254
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,470
which is a digestive stress or uh,
and again,

1255
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:06,750
even that in small amounts,
it's probably good for you.

1256
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:11,751
They've been shown that kids who get 
gluten restricted when their kids wind 

1257
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:15,531
up having more issues with gluten later 
on in life because their guts might be 

1258
00:56:15,531 --> 00:56:15,531
weaker.

1259
00:56:15,531 --> 00:56:15,531
Right?
But,

1260
00:56:15,531 --> 00:56:19,850
but yeah,
lectins and plant phytochemicals and a 

1261
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:20,760
lot of things that plants use to poison 
mammals are two,

1262
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:25,510
cause they're their seeds to be digested
and pass out through the digestive tract

1263
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,730
and the stool of the mammals.
They can grow elsewhere.

1264
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,850
A lot of that stuff really is,
you know,

1265
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:30,310
it,
it,

1266
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,630
it,
it makes you stronger.

1267
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:36,690
You ever had that coffee?
Kopi Luwak you ever had that stuff is 

1268
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:36,870
the stuff.
Yeah,

1269
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:37,690
the,
the cat,

1270
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:42,490
the Lemur coffee and shits it out and 
then they take the coffee and sell it at

1271
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,030
this outrageous rate.
It's actually delicious.

1272
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:48,730
Ferments coffee man,
that's very nice.

1273
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:52,270
But your elephants do to black,
black,

1274
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:53,560
ivory caught your eye.
That shit.

1275
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,160
I don't want to like support the ELA.
I don't give a fuck about lemurs.

1276
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,410
I don't.
It's a Lima.

1277
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:04,411
I think it's harvesting coffee beans 
from elephant poop sounds far more 

1278
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:04,411
laborious than than harvesting.

1279
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,900
Shuttles are lemurs.
Just hose it down.

1280
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,170
Get better.
Bang for your book is titled One little.

1281
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,730
It's like a needle in a haystack,
right?

1282
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:15,910
If it's just a few coffee beans and the 
trial elephant shit,

1283
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,500
get jacked up.
Coffee.

1284
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:21,730
The elephant elephants chasing you.
You're digging through their shit,

1285
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:24,510
chasing you through the field.
Plus they probably shit like crazy.

1286
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,770
Just like a person doesn't eat coffee.
I give them some,

1287
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:28,230
uh,
lte and there it is.

1288
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,020
What it is.
Those are coffee tourists.

1289
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:36,180
That's almost like a bunch of coffee 
beans with a few pieces of Turd thrown 

1290
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,180
it.
Yeah.

1291
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,250
Look at that.
Bam.

1292
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:41,290
Son was almost looot coffee,
so they just feed them nothing but 

1293
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,260
coffee and they shared it out sort of 
like we should out corn and can't really

1294
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:49,261
digest it properly.
There's a fermentation process that 

1295
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:50,800
makes the bean tastes better.
My problem with the carnivore diet is my

1296
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,990
same problem that I have with the Vegan 
Diet.

1297
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:58,050
Is it?
I don't think they're being scientific 

1298
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,421
or objective about it.
I being dogmatic it's becomes an 

1299
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:03,391
ideology and the ideology is the meat 
heels and meets this and meet that and 

1300
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:08,380
meet is the thing and like no meat is 
one part of a good diet,

1301
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,490
one part of a healthy diet and again,
for some people there's some people that

1302
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:17,491
have.
I'm sure you aware of the lone star 

1303
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:17,491
tick,
you know about that.

1304
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:17,491
Right?
What about it?

1305
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:18,850
Do you know about me down?
Allergies?

1306
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:23,940
No.
Lone Star tick is a tick that bites 

1307
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,100
people and gives them an allergy to red 
meat.

1308
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,010
It's horrible for Texas.
Yes,

1309
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,430
yes,
but it's spreading.

1310
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:31,640
It's spreading across the country.
See,

1311
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:36,650
all we have up in my land is a ticks 
that as long as you get them off within 

1312
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,991
24 hours,
that doesn't allow them to produce the 

1313
00:58:39,991 --> 00:58:43,711
saliva that would make them release 
their hold on your skin and it's that 

1314
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:47,080
that produces yellow fever,
not the actual tick bite itself.

1315
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,700
So you don't get a lot of lime up where 
I'm at,

1316
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,670
but I've never heard of this loan.
Slime as much more prevalent on the east

1317
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:54,100
coast,
it's starting to make its way out here.

1318
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:56,380
There have been some lyme cases out here
in California,

1319
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,990
but this lone star tick is,
um,

1320
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,840
it's a real problem and it's giving 
people.

1321
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:06,550
It's something called Alpha Gal Alpha 
Alpha,

1322
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,720
short for Alpha,
Gao Alpha,

1323
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,730
less shadows that sugar.
So here it is,

1324
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:17,620
it makes you allergic to hot dogs.
Alpha Alpha one,

1325
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:18,460
three.
Galactose.

1326
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:21,160
Alpha Gals,
the most mammalian cell membranes.

1327
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,810
The allergy doesn't extend to non 
mammalian meat.

1328
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,560
Poultry and seafood are all fine,
which is really interesting.

1329
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,680
So you,
you can't,

1330
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:33,440
once you get this shit,
you're just,

1331
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,560
you're allergic to this Alpha galactose.
But you could eat eight and human meat 

1332
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,140
according to the article.
So you're not allergic to those pig.

1333
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,640
I wonder if pork.
Welcome a million doubt it.

1334
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:51,030
So could he ate meat?
So if you want to go to the jungle and 

1335
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,740
have what they call a bushmeat credit.
Okay.

1336
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:53,330
Speaking of me.
Ribeye steaks.

1337
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,630
Yes.
This is how to make these Ribeye steaks 

1338
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,461
taste really good.
So what I do on on the rub is like a 

1339
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:02,450
really core salt,
use a salt called Colima salt,

1340
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,360
super high in minerals,
really kosher salt course.

1341
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:10,361
Now it's different.
They harvested from the Mexican coast 

1342
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:10,361
and it tastes fabulous.
It's really good.

1343
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:14,500
What's a girl?
Only salts I travel with and Boz is 

1344
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,120
Kalema salt and then this stuff.
I am a c o,

1345
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:22,010
l I m a and Black Kona salt black Kona 
salt from.

1346
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:23,570
From China.
From Hawaii.

1347
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:28,930
Yeah.
I use that when I cook some of the meat 

1348
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:28,930
from Hawaii just because it seems right.
It does.

1349
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:28,930
He use salt from.
From,

1350
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,650
from the,
from the volcanoes in Hawaii.

1351
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:35,950
So.
And I rub a Cayenne black pepper salt 

1352
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:40,660
and then to reduce the carcinogens that 
conform when you cook me either time or 

1353
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,840
rosemary or both or just rubbed thyme or
Rosemary Reduces carcinogens there.

1354
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,500
And Dennis.
Yeah,

1355
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,690
they reduced.
They reduced the formation of a,

1356
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,140
I think they call them polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons.

1357
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:51,590
These,
these,

1358
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:56,660
you know,
things that form on the meat when you 

1359
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:56,660
black in the meat because you want to 
get a good crisp sphere on the inside of

1360
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,040
the meat,
so it's nice and crunchy on the outside.

1361
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:03,370
She was strict.
A lot of the unhealthy effects of doing 

1362
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:03,370
that.
When you get some kind of an urban there

1363
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,130
like that,
so you take out the.

1364
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,260
You get to room temperature,
you put this rubbing,

1365
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,500
you take a cast iron skillet,
so I'll do it on the grill at all.

1366
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,890
It's a cast iron skillet.
You heat up the cast iron skillet in the

1367
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:16,190
oven and then you take it out of the 
oven and you put it on the stove top.

1368
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:20,720
You put the stove top on medium high and
either use an extra virgin olive oil.

1369
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,710
A have used lard before.
Why do you use,

1370
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,250
although what has a low flashpoint gives
me a good put no extra virgin.

1371
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,110
Olive oil has a bunch of antioxidants in
it,

1372
01:01:30,111 --> 01:01:32,780
so it's actually guernseys as higher 
resistance to that.

1373
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,090
He never burnt.
Never an issue.

1374
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:37,070
It doesn't burn,
doesn't smoke,

1375
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:42,100
but when they see or things,
that's one thing they tell you is never 

1376
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,100
use olive oil.
Well,

1377
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,110
I use extroversion all.
I'm part of an olive oil clubs,

1378
01:01:44,111 --> 01:01:46,100
so maybe it's because I have really good
olive oil.

1379
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:51,460
They shipped me three bottles of olive 
oil every quarter from a different pool 

1380
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,710
that or find that out because I've 
really read don't cook things at high 

1381
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:56,570
heat with olive oil.

1382
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,420
Look it up,
even extra virgin olive oil.

1383
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:01,880
At this point,
all I can tell you is the shots,

1384
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:04,580
how you're speaking.
You're saying hi.

1385
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:07,090
He said medium heat and this says medium
heat too,

1386
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,350
so maybe that's the difference is the 
high heat maybe,

1387
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,330
but when you're searing I would assume 
that it is kind of.

1388
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,620
It's not on there for very long.
Anyways,

1389
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,680
extra virgin olive oil into the pan.
Heat up the olive oil and you put it on 

1390
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:24,030
for maybe two minutes Max on the cast 
iron skillet.

1391
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:29,031
You heat up the olive oil,
then you put the steak on and you do 

1392
01:02:29,031 --> 01:02:30,390
exactly for a perfect medium rare three 
and a half minutes.

1393
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:32,250
One side,
three and a half minutes.

1394
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:37,251
The other side.
Then you take it out on this is where 

1395
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:37,251
you get there.
Probably about that thick.

1396
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,210
What is that?
Oh yeah,

1397
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:39,900
we're on audio.

1398
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,690
It's about an inch and a half.
So anyways,

1399
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:47,750
the um,
it's like when you asked me in the last 

1400
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:48,690
podcast how big my dick got after I 
inject it with about that big,

1401
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:50,850
not that big.
So anyways,

1402
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,780
the uh,
then then you put it in to the oven,

1403
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:59,781
you take that entire cast iron skillet,
you put the oven on Broil and you broil 

1404
01:02:59,781 --> 01:03:04,041
it for one minute on one side and then 
you turn it over and you do one minute 

1405
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:08,300
on the other side and then you take it 
out of the oven and you finish it with 

1406
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:13,251
butter.
Meaning when you take it out of the 

1407
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:14,901
oven,
you just take the steak off the cast 

1408
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:14,901
iron skillets,
shove it aside,

1409
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:14,901
just put on a plate,
whatever.

1410
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:16,860
And you take a pad of butter and you can
infuse the butter,

1411
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,610
right?
You can,

1412
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,640
you can use like garlic infused butter 
would just use a plain old grassfed 

1413
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:22,640
butter.

1414
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,170
You put a pat of butter on the skill 
that you let the butter just get to the 

1415
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:26,430
point where it's melted a little bit and
it's not Super Brown.

1416
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,680
You put the stake back on top of the 
butter,

1417
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,730
put the burner back on,
and you finish it one minute each side.

1418
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,140
Let it off.
Let it rest.

1419
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:37,830
Three or four minutes.
That technique is the best technique for

1420
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:41,350
the most perfect steak you'll ever have.
It sounds very good.

1421
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,630
Is really good.
That sounds very good.

1422
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,640
It's really good.
Mostly what I do is the reverse sear 

1423
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,630
method with a pellet grill.
I keep it at about 250 degrees.

1424
01:03:48,631 --> 01:03:50,390
You ever used a pellet grill?
Well,

1425
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:55,391
like about pellet grills is you're 
getting an appellate socially a similar 

1426
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,830
horrible.
You're,

1427
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:58,740
you're essentially getting hardwood 
that's compressed.

1428
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,830
So what,
when they cut hardwood,

1429
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,840
like for um,
let's table it would take the oak and 

1430
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,801
the saw dust,
they would compress into these small 

1431
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:10,290
pellets and there's a bunch of different
companies,

1432
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:11,460
uh,
triggers a,

1433
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,090
a good one.

1434
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:12,720
They,
they,

1435
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,670
they make one for the good girls.
Yeah.

1436
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:17,190
They have good grills and they also make
one that you could use with an APP.

1437
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:22,220
What I like about it is you can control 
the temperature completely with your 

1438
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,371
phone.
There's a thing called a timberline is 

1439
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:25,371
one of their new ones.
Um,

1440
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:28,640
so anyway,
you get these compressed pellets and 

1441
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:28,640
they go into a hopper and then there it 
is right there.

1442
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,920
That's a.
What is that one of the woodwind?

1443
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:34,500
That's where a pellet stove look like 
when I was growing up.

1444
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,850
So the pellets go into the hopper and 
then at the bottom there's a gear,

1445
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:43,700
like a worm drive that feeds the pellets
into that fire at the bottom,

1446
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,740
comes from an element,
so the element and then there's a fan.

1447
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:51,741
So once it's lit,
the element shuts off and then the fire 

1448
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:53,580
is stoked by this fan and it's all 
temperature controlled.

1449
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,050
Like very,
very precisely.

1450
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,630
One of the good things,
what I like about this trigger that I've

1451
01:04:57,631 --> 01:05:00,710
seen is that it seals up like a,
um,

1452
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:04,050
like a yeti cooler.
Like it's very insulated and fixed.

1453
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:06,210
So it's really good at retaining the 
perfect temperature.

1454
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,510
And again you can do it on your phone.
So I get it to 250 degrees.

1455
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,690
Then mostly what I'm cooking is wild 
game,

1456
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,720
low fat content.
And so you don't want to make sure you 

1457
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:17,890
don't dry it out.
So I took it at a low temperature.

1458
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:22,891
I'm cooking a 250 degrees.
I get it to an internal temperature of 

1459
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:25,180
120 the once it hits 120,
I pull it out.

1460
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,800
And you've got to open up the grill,
the test,

1461
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:31,420
your internal temp wire.
Now I have a wireless wire wire,

1462
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,500
wireless thermometer that's connected to
it and it's outside the circle.

1463
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:38,050
We see it and that's like what my dry 
aging has and it's also,

1464
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:41,160
it lets me know,
it gives you a beep when it hits 1:20.

1465
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,080
So I know I go and get it.
So I pull it out technical.

1466
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:47,590
Then I pull it out of there and I use 
this cast iron skillet as well.

1467
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:51,070
But I cook with grass fed butter.
So I take the cast iron skillet,

1468
01:05:51,071 --> 01:05:52,870
I put it probably same temperature,
medium,

1469
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:54,130
high heat.
And again,

1470
01:05:54,131 --> 01:05:57,490
when I'm got the steak on the,
on the grill itself,

1471
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,600
I'm using sea salt and crushed black 
pepper and garlic powder.

1472
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:03,820
That's what I usually use.
No black end extra.

1473
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,630
No,
no.

1474
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:05,890
I'm going to try now.
I'm.

1475
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:11,010
So then I take it off of there and then 
I use grass fed butter in a cast iron 

1476
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:15,421
skillet once it's heated up.
I sear it on both sides for about a 

1477
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,570
minute and a half and then I let it rest
depending if I'm an ambitious,

1478
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:24,630
sometimes I'll let it rest a,
cover it with aluminum foil and put it 

1479
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,361
in a Yeti cooler and I'll let it sit in 
that Yeti cooler for about 10 minutes 

1480
01:06:27,361 --> 01:06:28,900
and I pull it out and it is just too 
cold.

1481
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,650
After 10 minutes,
the Yeti cooler now to the Yeti Cooler,

1482
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,510
the Yeti cooler maintains the 
temperature.

1483
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:39,530
The stakes we should have.
My wife just texted shopping stakes 

1484
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,190
yoder,
yoder pellet grill in the band,

1485
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,960
a cast iron pan.
I mean that's the reverse sear method.

1486
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:48,961
The idea is that I'm cooking it to a 
perfect internal temperature of 120 

1487
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:49,510
degrees,
which will raise both in the Yeti,

1488
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,840
the Yeti Cooler,
and also from the Siri on the outside,

1489
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,130
so once I get the cast iron pan heated 
up to a medium high heat,

1490
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:02,310
I throw that butter in there and I see 
her the shit out of the outside for 

1491
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:02,310
again,
about a minute and a half.

1492
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:06,871
Both sides wrap it in foil,
put it in the Yeti Cooler for 10 

1493
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:10,741
minutes.
It maintains its temperature and it 

1494
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:12,721
continues slowly cooking so that it gets
it somewhere around 1:35

1495
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:14,620
ish,
which is what I like.

1496
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,030
I take that back very precise.

1497
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:22,290
This is even more precise.
This is like the sound effects is like 

1498
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:22,290
beep,
beep,

1499
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:23,140
beep.
I was cooking steak.

1500
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:28,350
Well,
I'm a big fan of these pellet grills 

1501
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,130
because you get this real smoky flavor 
to your food that comes from hardwood,

1502
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:35,370
but there's no chemicals.
They compressed the hardwood sawdust 

1503
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:39,241
just with natural sugars.
The natural sugars in the sawdust and 

1504
01:07:39,241 --> 01:07:39,760
you know,
there's a bunch of different companies.

1505
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:41,890
There's a green mountain grill.
Makes a good grill.

1506
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,660
I got to yoga at home.
I really like.

1507
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,550
Again,
trager is really good.

1508
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:50,890
Most of my friends are using triggers 
because they this temperature control 

1509
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:52,090
thing and the apps are so good to be 
able to use it on your phone.

1510
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:52,950
I'm a big fan.
Yeah.

1511
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:54,370
Wow.
That's amazing.

1512
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,410
Yeah.
I liked the fact that you can use good.

1513
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,560
You said it and you could just walk the 
fuck away from it too and it's going to 

1514
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,970
smoke your meat at 250 degrees and it 
has a good rich,

1515
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:06,700
that smoky flavor,
whether it's Hickory or cherry,

1516
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:07,630
you know,
whenever you choose.

1517
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:12,750
The only thing that I have to do,
I don't know why I'm like this with a 

1518
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,050
steak because I still need to dip it in 
something in the same way that you dip a

1519
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:16,340
prime rib and horseradish.
You stone mustard.

1520
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:21,690
I did my statement.
You know like the stone mustard with a 

1521
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:21,690
little little texture to it.
That's perfect.

1522
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:26,950
That's perfect.
I know it's fricking the middle of the 

1523
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,780
day on a Tuesday and I'm hungry to 
[inaudible] last night and had steak.

1524
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,490
That's a good spot.
Was it was good.

1525
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,520
I had a fascinating,
fascinating discussion about artificial 

1526
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,480
sweeteners there with uh,
one of the guys who runs quest nutrition

1527
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:42,020
and was talking about Tom said no,
it wasn't Tom,

1528
01:08:42,021 --> 01:08:47,021
it was Ron Ron Pena and,
and he was drinking diet coke and we 

1529
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:51,491
were talking about some of the studies 
out there on assets will family 

1530
01:08:51,491 --> 01:08:54,911
potassium and the potential for 
neurotoxicity or sucralose to cause 

1531
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,160
things like,
uh,

1532
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:56,810
you know,
microbiome issues,

1533
01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:01,850
the death of bacteria in the gut.
And he was explaining how the amount of 

1534
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,741
artificial sweeteners using that study 
was just like way far in excess of what 

1535
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:10,391
you get from a diet soda and that what 
they call the increase in response like,

1536
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:16,390
like that,
that spiking of the appetite that is 

1537
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,781
attributed sometimes to the consumption 
of artificial sweeteners only occurs in 

1538
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,430
people who aren't used to artificial 
sweetener consumption.

1539
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,620
And once they've kind of gotten into 
like a,

1540
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:28,970
like a diet coke habit that now this is 
all Brendan is like 12 hours ago.

1541
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:31,520
Right?
So I started drinking diet coke and I do

1542
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:35,360
know they use artificial sweeteners,
so bars.

1543
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:37,420
And so yeah,
some of that planet as well,

1544
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:42,790
but he said you could take a shower in 
diet coke and you wouldn't get sticky 

1545
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:45,840
because there's that.
That's such a small amount of artifice.

1546
01:09:45,841 --> 01:09:47,810
It's like a dusting of artificial 
sweeteners.

1547
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:49,850
So actually it's,
it's,

1548
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,430
it's making.
I haven't delved into the research yet,

1549
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:57,431
but it's at least made me think last 
night about reconsidering my stance 

1550
01:09:57,431 --> 01:10:00,380
because what I usually do is I just use 
Stevia and like Pellegrino,

1551
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:02,520
like my refrigerator.
Just full of Pellegrino.

1552
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,010
You ever try z?
Because I do a lot.

1553
01:10:04,011 --> 01:10:06,200
I love to love that shit.
I love it.

1554
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:11,260
Yeah.
I drink the shit out of trouble the 

1555
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:11,260
other day because I'm so busy.

1556
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,340
I was doing that spartan life feed 
announcing and they're sponsored by a,

1557
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,880
a fit aid.
Right.

1558
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,950
And then they cut to camera and I had a 
big oldZ via.

1559
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,470
There were supposed to be pretending 
we're drinking that night or whatever.

1560
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,920
They'd take the TVA down.
Fitted.

1561
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,060
I don't know.
It's a,

1562
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:28,120
it's A.
I think it's a God proteolytic enzymes 

1563
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,240
in it.
I think that's the main thing.

1564
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,410
I could be confusing that with kill 
cliff.

1565
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:36,560
That's the other kind of flies off.
We've got a bunch of those proteins 

1566
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,370
which are great.
They break down fibrinogen.

1567
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,200
They're wonderful for recovery.
These enzymes,

1568
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,960
and I don't know how many of them they 
have just like that.

1569
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:46,961
A blood orange kill cliff [inaudible].
Use it as a marinade for wild pork.

1570
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,980
Holy Baby Jesus.
That's like beer can chicken.

1571
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:57,040
Well,
that's one of the things I wonder if 

1572
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:57,040
that's.
Well,

1573
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:57,040
proteolytic enzymes.

1574
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,020
One of the reasons they work as they 
break down fibrinogen and they're almost

1575
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:01,280
like an enzyme,
right?

1576
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:06,281
That same thing.
If you have no marinade and nothing and 

1577
01:11:06,281 --> 01:11:07,280
all the tenderize me,
you get your digestive enzymes,

1578
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:08,690
your,
you're on it.

1579
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:13,750
Gut Pack or whatever you have around and
you break open the capsules and you 

1580
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:13,750
sprinkle that on top.
The meat.

1581
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:14,010
It's like,
uh,

1582
01:11:14,011 --> 01:11:14,660
it's like,
uh,

1583
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,410
you know,
free suggests j almost,

1584
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:18,360
right?
With lemon and lime fish.

1585
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:21,930
It's a phenomenal marinade for meat.
That's cliff orange.

1586
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,930
I'm guessing.
Kill cliff is good too.

1587
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,250
Yeah.
It's just so,

1588
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:28,830
so delicious.
And you're getting very little sugar.

1589
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,480
Yeah.
No,

1590
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,440
it's just,
it's just deliciousness.

1591
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,850
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1592
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:38,430
but I go with Pellgrino.
Pellgrino is less acidic and perrier and

1593
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:41,200
it has a lot of sodium bicarbonate in.
It doesn't,

1594
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:46,210
I don't know if you looked into these 
studies on baking soda for Athletic 

1595
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,130
Performance and its ability to be able 
to buffer lactic acid.

1596
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,620
It's a,
it's a potent ergogenic aid,

1597
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:54,621
but the problem is that it causes gut 
distress when you take as much as they 

1598
01:11:54,621 --> 01:11:55,650
use in a lot of these studies and so 
more,

1599
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,270
more and more what the studies are 
doing,

1600
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:02,271
your dosing right with,
with small amounts of baking soda for 

1601
01:12:02,271 --> 01:12:02,790
two to three hours leading into your 
workout.

1602
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:08,210
So my philosophy is this,
if Pellegrino has pretty high levels of 

1603
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:08,940
sodium bicarbonate in it,
which it does,

1604
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,910
it's got more sodium bicarbonate in it 
and any of the other bottled waters like

1605
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,100
twice as much as Gerald Steiner and you 
know,

1606
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:19,101
any of these other waters out there.
I'm kind of dosing with a little bit of 

1607
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,581
a lactic acid buffer all day long.
So anytime I want to jump into a 

1608
01:12:22,581 --> 01:12:25,941
workout,
I'm able to push myself a little bit 

1609
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:25,941
harder.
Do you notice a difference?

1610
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:27,030
Yeah,
I know zero Pellegrino studies on this,

1611
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,940
but do you notice a difference 
physically between not feel amazing when

1612
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:30,880
I drink that stuff all day?

1613
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:33,720
I drink that and I drink this.
Uh,

1614
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:34,780
uh,
it's,

1615
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:39,330
it's hydrogen enriched water,
a molecular hydrogen.

1616
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:44,550
This,
this foundation called the molecular 

1617
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,971
hydrogen foundation.
They do studies on the antiinflammatory 

1618
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:50,010
and antioxidant potential of water that 
has a lot of hydrogen ions in it.

1619
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,330
It's called hydrogen rich water.
And the cool part about that is that,

1620
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:59,380
and I,
the only other thing I know of that can 

1621
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,581
do this or green tea,
polyphenols is they act as an anti 

1622
01:13:01,581 --> 01:13:06,110
inflammatory post-exercise without 
blunting the hormetic response,

1623
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:09,180
that positive beneficial stressful 
response where you're talking about with

1624
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:12,180
exercise and so you can have your cake 
and eat it too,

1625
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:13,380
right?
You get your antioxidants,

1626
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:15,720
you shut down inflammation and it 
doesn't blunt.

1627
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:20,750
In this case,
the hormetic response to exercise would 

1628
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,960
be the proliferation of satellite cells 
and the production of new Mitochondria,

1629
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:26,990
which why you shouldn't take a bunch of 
vitamin C and Vitamin E and some of 

1630
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:27,510
these high antioxidant compounds.

1631
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:28,980
Post workout,
same reason.

1632
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:33,981
You shouldn't do a cold bath postworkout
and the idea is that hydrogen rich water

1633
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,540
allows you to shut down inflammation 
with once again,

1634
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:41,880
why shouldn't you take a cold bath pulse
workout and is there a certain period of

1635
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:43,950
time where they think you should,
you could,

1636
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,160
but it's the period of time to adjust 
for me.

1637
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:53,890
I go two or three hours for it.
And as far as some people say don't,

1638
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:58,740
don't jump into the cold bath 15 minutes
after an hour cryo chamber.

1639
01:13:58,741 --> 01:14:01,970
According to Rhonda,
I wait two or three hours and I don't.

1640
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:07,070
I don't know if,
if Rhonda is basing that on research or 

1641
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:10,761
if it's an extrapolation or or what,
but I wait a couple hours now that the 

1642
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:15,840
exception to that rule is that if you 
exercise any closer than three hours to 

1643
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:22,261
bedtime,
it elevates body temperature to the 

1644
01:14:22,261 --> 01:14:22,261
point where it affects your deep sleep 
cycles.

1645
01:14:22,261 --> 01:14:22,360
Right?
So,

1646
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,230
and one reason for that is because your 
core temperature is elevated.

1647
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,290
So for me,
if I do an evening workout and I do,

1648
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,000
you know,
hard later afternoon,

1649
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:36,001
early evening workouts,
quite often I will still take a cold 

1650
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:36,001
shower.
I actually have a giant claw.

1651
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:37,540
I bought one of those endless pools,
you know,

1652
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:42,541
like those fitness pools that you swim 
in and I keep it out in the forest 

1653
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:43,480
behind my house and it's just chock full
of cold water.

1654
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:45,060
We talked about that.
Jump in there.

1655
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:50,130
I love that idea,
but it decreases your core temperature 

1656
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:53,170
and allows you to sleep better later on 
if you do that after an evening workout.

1657
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:57,040
So even though it probably restricts the
efficacy of the workout a little bit,

1658
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,300
that's my.
Yeah.

1659
01:14:58,301 --> 01:15:03,190
My reasoning is that I'm going to sleep 
way better and the benefits I get from a

1660
01:15:03,191 --> 01:15:07,690
good solid nights sleep outweigh any 
loss of benefit from decreasing a little

1661
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:11,290
bit of that mitochondrial density and in
satellite cell proliferation.

1662
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:14,410
So when you're doing this late night 
workout out how far,

1663
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,280
like how long before you sleep you're 
doing.

1664
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:22,290
What research has shown is that it's 
ideal to finish a hard workout within 

1665
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,380
three hours before bedtime.
If you don't want to,

1666
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:26,920
if you don't want to mess up your sleep 
exactly,

1667
01:15:26,921 --> 01:15:31,921
but with your cold bath you could 
probably mitigate some of you and I go 

1668
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:36,121
to bed pretty early.
I usually go to bed about but usually 

1669
01:15:36,121 --> 01:15:36,121
9:30
9:45

1670
01:15:36,121 --> 01:15:37,570
AM in bed reading and I'm asleep around 
10,

1671
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:38,200
10,
30.

1672
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,660
So if I'm not finishing up a workout 
until like 7:30,

1673
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,520
which is the case sometimes you not 
finish work.

1674
01:15:42,521 --> 01:15:45,130
I'm not getting into the workout until 
like 6:45,

1675
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:47,290
seven.
Like sometimes I'm working out closer to

1676
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:49,900
bedtime three hours.
So in that case I'll do the cold shower,

1677
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,930
did a podcast recently with Dr Matthew 
Walker about sleep and it's kind of 

1678
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,790
changed the way I feel about sleep and 
the importance of it and how much,

1679
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,050
how much you need.

1680
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:02,650
I think you can just power through and 
get through with like three,

1681
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:04,150
four hours at night.
You'd be fine.

1682
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,560
You can,
yeah.

1683
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,190
But it fucks you up.
Well there's,

1684
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:08,630
there's exceptions to that.
I mean,

1685
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,180
some people have,
this I think is the d,

1686
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:14,710
c to gene that allows you to actually 
get by on a lot less sleep.

1687
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,840
Some members of the population has that 
gene.

1688
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:18,690
It's a very small member of the 
population.

1689
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:23,700
Small moment.
But furthermore there's this guy named 

1690
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,670
Dr Luke Huddle.
Nick little hills is his name.

1691
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,620
I could have really messed up.
They didn't know Dick Middle Hails.

1692
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,270
Anyways,
he's um,

1693
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,950
he,
he's got this concept.

1694
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:37,270
He works with a lot of these European 
soccer teams and what he looks at is not

1695
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:42,271
the seven to nine hours of sleep,
not how many hours of sleep per night 

1696
01:16:42,271 --> 01:16:44,791
you get,
but the number of sleep cycles right 

1697
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,831
from stage one to stage five sleep that 
you get throughout the course of the 

1698
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:47,740
week.

1699
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,800
Meaning you're supposed to get 31 to 35 
sleep cycles over seven days.

1700
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,960
And so you might get three sleep cycles 
one night and five sleep cycles and 

1701
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,200
other night.
And he also,

1702
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:04,260
I haven't seen research to back this up,
but this is what he does with his 

1703
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:04,260
athletes.
His,

1704
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,030
he counts a 20 to 30 minute power nap as
a sleep cycle,

1705
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:12,210
so technically you could sleep four 
hours night and then you could do a 

1706
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:15,470
eight hour sleep night on a Saturday and
a 20 minute nap on a Sunday and then you

1707
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:19,590
add up all your sleep cycles and you can
use any self quantification device to if

1708
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:21,330
you want to actually measure how many 
times you're.

1709
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:25,460
You're cycling during the during a night
of sleep and you look at that instead of

1710
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:28,430
am I getting a consistent seven to nine 
hours of sleep a night?

1711
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:29,860
Look at the total sleep.
I,

1712
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,440
I literally just wrote an article about 
this this morning on my website.

1713
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:38,590
You should listen to the podcast with 
Matthew Walker because he's pretty in 

1714
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:41,471
depth about what is,
what's recommended and why and the risk 

1715
01:17:41,471 --> 01:17:45,341
of Alzheimer's for people to get less 
than five hours sleep a night and I'm 

1716
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:48,320
asleep.
But are you getting every night?

1717
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:52,760
I am for 24 hour cycles,
getting about eight hours,

1718
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:57,850
which means like if I sleep seven hours,
I take a 20 to 45 minute nap and that 

1719
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:03,341
sounds perfect.
I'm a big napper and my naps are very 

1720
01:18:03,341 --> 01:18:03,341
elaborate.
Well,

1721
01:18:03,341 --> 01:18:05,000
you're also.
You work extremely hard.

1722
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:06,550
Yeah,
I mean I'm not,

1723
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:11,580
I'm,
I'm not working out as hard as some of 

1724
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:11,580
these pro athletes who are like 10 hours
of sleep per night Friday,

1725
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,950
but for the average person,
oh,

1726
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,260
these normatec boots that I lay in 
these,

1727
01:18:15,261 --> 01:18:20,261
these great aided compression boots that
kind of move the compression from the 

1728
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:24,340
ankle all the way up to the hips and I 
lay on this bio mat which is like laying

1729
01:18:24,891 --> 01:18:25,880
on a warm teddy bear.

1730
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,460
It's like this map that makes infrared 
rays,

1731
01:18:28,461 --> 01:18:30,200
so it's just like an infrared radiation 
matt,

1732
01:18:30,201 --> 01:18:32,690
almost like a sauna.
And then I've got these,

1733
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,950
these binaural binaural beat.
It's,

1734
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:40,020
it's an artificial intelligence based 
audio that confuses your brain and lulls

1735
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:44,480
you into this.
This total state of relaxation.

1736
01:18:44,481 --> 01:18:49,481
It's called Brain FM.
So I lay on my back and I've got the 

1737
01:18:49,481 --> 01:18:52,100
boots on and I have the mat on and I 
notice every.

1738
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:54,560
Now I'm sounding like a,
like a princess now,

1739
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:59,740
but I have.
I have an assistant who lives at my 

1740
01:18:59,740 --> 01:18:59,740
house and she really helps out with a 
lot of stuff.

1741
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:04,121
She does the banking and she helps out 
with bringing stuff to the post office 

1742
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:04,760
and you know,
she's just,

1743
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:07,710
she's just there whenever I need her to 
do stuff and you know,

1744
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,890
she helps.
She's back home with the kids right now,

1745
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:14,891
so she just kind of like a live in 
assistant and everyday about 1230 or 

1746
01:19:14,891 --> 01:19:17,600
one,
she goes up to my bed,

1747
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:22,660
she lays out the biomass,
she plugs it in and she pushed it on my 

1748
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:22,660
temperature.

1749
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:25,630
She lays out the NORMATEC boots.
She pushed the pillow out with a sleep 

1750
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:28,871
mask and the headphones and then I just 
go up there after lunch and I lay down 

1751
01:19:28,871 --> 01:19:29,540
for about 45 minutes and I'm just dead 
to the world.

1752
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,710
That's a pretty sweet setup.
It's,

1753
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,640
it's a good setup.
That's fine.

1754
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:38,820
Live.
It's a good person like that that you 

1755
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:38,820
trust.
Yeah,

1756
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:38,820
exactly.
It's crazy.

1757
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,850
So the idea was sleep though is yeah,
if you,

1758
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:45,910
if you nap and if you pay closer 
attention to the number of sleep cycles 

1759
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:49,630
that you get each week,
I think that's more important than 

1760
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:49,630
getting like seven to nine hours a 
night.

1761
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,810
How would you know how many sleep 
cycles?

1762
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:55,811
Unless you're monitoring it,
you usually have or is that what you're 

1763
01:19:55,811 --> 01:19:55,811
monitoring with?
Yeah,

1764
01:19:55,811 --> 01:19:57,350
he use when he's in the ring is pretty 
accurate.

1765
01:19:57,351 --> 01:20:02,351
I mean it's a,
it's not as accurate as a sleep lab 

1766
01:20:02,351 --> 01:20:02,351
study,
but it's,

1767
01:20:02,351 --> 01:20:05,800
it's accurate.
Kevin rose tried to get me to wear one 

1768
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:05,800
of those things.
Yeah,

1769
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,500
big.
They've got another one that's smaller,

1770
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:07,950
but

1771
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,940
it seems very start the sentence like,
yeah,

1772
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:16,941
exactly.
I need a lot of necklaces and Blaine to 

1773
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:16,941
go along with it.
But it works.

1774
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:21,291
I found it in Finland like four years 
ago and I bought it and I really have 

1775
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:23,620
been using it ever since.
It does like my sleep temperature.

1776
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:25,410
Oh that's.
Yeah,

1777
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:26,760
that's,
that's the littler one.

1778
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:29,430
Smarter,
get more restorative whatever.

1779
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,620
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1780
01:20:31,621 --> 01:20:32,900
The Mora.
Ooh.

1781
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:37,910
I wish I'd have invested in the company 
because they seem to be everywhere now 

1782
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:39,180
and and help.
They were there.

1783
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,600
I was at a Finland of biohacking 
conference and there was this tiny 

1784
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,541
little table with one guy at salon,
this little ring and all of a sudden 

1785
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:47,541
it's just like kind of diamond.
Are those diamonds?

1786
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,230
I don't quit.
Is that light?

1787
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,300
I don't know if they're real.
What's that?

1788
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,200
Are they trying to say it's bling bling,
blitz diamond,

1789
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,820
linking it up,
let them bitches know,

1790
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,250
but it's kind of cool because you can 
pull up your body temperature during the

1791
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:04,890
night so a woman could use this to 
tracker cycles.

1792
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,650
It will tell you your heart rate 
variability,

1793
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,020
which I used to measure every morning 
when I wake up,

1794
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:15,021
I look at my parasympathetic and 
sympathetic nervous system score and 

1795
01:21:15,021 --> 01:21:18,070
then I'd be able to tell if I should do 
a hard workout that day or each day.

1796
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,980
Well now the range is.
It measures it all during the night like

1797
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:26,020
it does with the five minute 
measurements throughout the night while 

1798
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,101
I'm asleep so I wake up,
I can get a running average of my 

1799
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:28,101
guitars on your smartphone or.
And then it,

1800
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:33,010
it pairs that with like how hard I 
worked out the day before and my heart 

1801
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:33,010
rate,
my body temperature,

1802
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,070
and then it tells me here's your 
readiness score.

1803
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,410
So if my readiness score is at like 60 
percent,

1804
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:39,120
then I'm going to go in the sauna and do
yoga.

1805
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,070
Right.
And if my writing or scores had 90,

1806
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:41,400
I'll do.

1807
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,570
I'll go out and do the obstacle course 
at my house and swinging bells and,

1808
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,880
and beat up the body a little bit more.
So it's pretty useful because it ever 

1809
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:49,880
had 100.
I've never seen it.

1810
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,150
100.
What would that mean?

1811
01:21:51,151 --> 01:21:56,151
Like why?
Why wouldn't it be better if I took a 

1812
01:21:56,151 --> 01:21:56,280
two hour nap on the mat with the boots 
and probably get to 100.

1813
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:58,380
Those normatec boots,
they send them to me.

1814
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:02,640
I sent it to my friend Cam Cameron 
Hanes,

1815
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:04,800
but he,
he runs a lot of you.

1816
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:09,060
Have you seen for arm they haven't for 
the arms and the hips to be like a giant

1817
01:22:09,061 --> 01:22:10,650
marshmallow man,
what does it do?

1818
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:14,070
I would imagine if if you do a lot of 
upper body activity,

1819
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:17,520
like maybe you're a pitcher,
maybe a swimmer.

1820
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:22,540
Yeah,
box or someone who's doing a lot of 

1821
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:22,540
upper body activity that the arms would 
be efficacious.

1822
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:22,540
Curtis,
yeah.

1823
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:26,220
They look kind of silly and they're kind
of hard to get on by herself,

1824
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:30,090
so I would be one more thing for my 
assistant to have to help me with.

1825
01:22:30,091 --> 01:22:31,070
What is it doing?
Again,

1826
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:36,380
it's graded compression,
so it's apparently a form of compression

1827
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:41,481
that they've patented.
Unlike a lot of the other boots out 

1828
01:22:41,481 --> 01:22:42,540
there to where it the first time it 
inflates.

1829
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:47,541
It measures the diameter of your limbs 
and then bases every subsequent 

1830
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:52,371
compression to be customized to the 
diameter or the girth of your limbs and 

1831
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,650
pump the blood.
In this case,

1832
01:22:55,651 --> 01:23:00,270
if you're wearing the feet or the 
leggings from your ankles all the way up

1833
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,100
to your hips,
you got a picture with him.

1834
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:04,860
It was that Loma Chenko and those one of
those earlier pictures.

1835
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:07,390
No,
it was another one earlier than that.

1836
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:13,690
It works.
I mean your legs feel light as a 

1837
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:13,690
feather.

1838
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:13,690
FGL used them.
Yeah.

1839
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:16,220
And so this compression,
like as it's doing the compressing it,

1840
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:19,000
what is it doing to the legs by just 
compressed?

1841
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:21,800
Just pumping.
It's pumping blood like up,

1842
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:24,030
up and away from all the extremities 
and,

1843
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:26,800
and just moving it around.
Veterans at the idea?

1844
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:28,660
No,
it's moving it back up to your heart.

1845
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,790
Just circulating blood throughout your 
body.

1846
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:34,900
So it's almost like an additional heart.
It's like a massage,

1847
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:40,050
like a massage,
but we'll know if it seems more hard is 

1848
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:40,050
not a pump then.
It's not like an additional.

1849
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:41,660
The horseshoe.
Yeah.

1850
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:44,140
Anyways though.
So it's,

1851
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:49,170
they,
they work though and they're incredibly 

1852
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:49,170
relaxing.
It's,

1853
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,010
it's almost like someone's massaging you
to do watch TV with.

1854
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,990
Well you can kill two birds with one 
stone.

1855
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,570
Ooh.
Oh Wow.

1856
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:57,340
He's got the full meal deal.
This guy has,

1857
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,500
he's got legs on now.
This is a little bit it,

1858
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:07,530
it could,
it could get expensive to do that 

1859
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:09,601
because now you've got to have to 
inflation units rather than just one 

1860
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:09,601
because you can't plug them all in at 
once.

1861
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:14,790
So that's a spendy setup.
But that's the UFC featherweight 

1862
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:14,790
champion later.
Well,

1863
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:16,270
if he's the UFC featherweight champ,
he can,

1864
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,600
he can afford the Cadillac of 
marshmallow man suits.

1865
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,520
Well,
he's at Honolulu.

1866
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:26,521
Cryotherapy getting his freak on.
That's what a lot of these crowd 

1867
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:26,521
therapy,
uh,

1868
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:28,680
centers have noticed.
They've got the walking cryotherapy,

1869
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,840
they've got the NORMATEC boots,
they've got the vibration platform so 

1870
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,471
you can lose weight while you're 
standing there in the vibration 

1871
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:37,471
platform.
Yeah.

1872
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:38,530
Learned a lot of fat.
What do you think about those things?

1873
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:40,960
So it was um,
ultrasonic things,

1874
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,060
you know,
I'm talking about what are those called?

1875
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:48,890
Turbo Sonics.
You ever seen those verified vibration 

1876
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:48,890
platform that they go through like a 
whole cycle?

1877
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:52,840
Like they'll do it.
When I was in park city,

1878
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,550
I did one of those.
Yeah.

1879
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,220
Great Dude.
I had to go take a shit right after.

1880
01:24:58,570 --> 01:24:59,690
Seriously?
No,

1881
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:04,740
I'm serious.
I was on that thing for like eight 

1882
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:04,740
minutes and I said,
excuse me,

1883
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,320
and I had a glorious dump afterwards,
so I have,

1884
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:07,880
I have,
uh,

1885
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:12,940
a mini trampoline at my house and I jump
up and down on that thing in the 

1886
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:13,460
mornings and it gets everything moving.
Yeah.

1887
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:18,480
That's like my one two combo for having 
a really good dump in the mornings is 

1888
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,961
there's this herbal blend called try 
Phala t r I p h a l a and I put about a 

1889
01:25:24,281 --> 01:25:27,610
half teaspoon of that into a competent 
super bitter.

1890
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:32,850
So I put some Stevia in there or 
something to sweeten it up a little bit 

1891
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:36,210
and I pour the hot water over that.
And you have that at night right before 

1892
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:39,371
I go to bed.
And you wake up in the morning and you 

1893
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:39,460
could use the vibration platform.
You could do the,

1894
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:41,230
uh,
the Tai Chee bouncing.

1895
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:42,550
That's another thing some people will 
do.

1896
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:46,000
We just kind of bounce up and down like 
this script programming or you can,

1897
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:48,220
you can jump on a trampoline,
probably skip rope too.

1898
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:53,670
And that one,
two combo just gets things moving 

1899
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:53,670
amazingly.
Yeah.

1900
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:56,240
I have a couple double espressos before 
that too.

1901
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,570
Yeah,
and I do.

1902
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,590
I did a hot cup of coffee in the 
morning.

1903
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,600
I don't put anything in my coffee black,
but my.

1904
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:03,980
My Protocol

1905
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:09,010
for staying lean your rod is because I 
used to be 215 pounds and I had to shut 

1906
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:13,091
a lot of weight to get into iron man 
triathlon so that an iron man triathlon 

1907
01:26:13,091 --> 01:26:14,570
for about eight years and the way that I
stayed lien for races.

1908
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:19,650
You get up in the morning and have a cup
of coffee or green tea because both of 

1909
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:22,910
those can help to mobilize fatty acids 
from adipose tissue and you do this when

1910
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,070
you're in that fasted state that I was 
talking about.

1911
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:30,071
Right?
So you wake up after a 12 to 16 hour 

1912
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:30,380
fast and you take the cup of coffee or 
the green tea.

1913
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:35,690
Then you go exercise or move a 
robotically for whatever time you have 

1914
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,271
available at 20 to 45 minutes.
Doesn't have to be that long and the 

1915
01:26:40,271 --> 01:26:41,870
reason that you do at aerobically is 
because when you wake up in the morning,

1916
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:43,700
you already have a lot of cortisol in 
your system,

1917
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:44,320
right?

1918
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:49,330
There's,
there's no need to just stress yourself 

1919
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:49,330
out even more by doing a very hard 
workout.

1920
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:53,561
I like to ease my way into the day.
I like a non stressful morning unless 

1921
01:26:53,561 --> 01:26:57,311
I've got a very busy day and I know that
I'm not going to get hard work at any 

1922
01:26:57,311 --> 01:27:00,731
other time.
I say my hard workout for the later 

1923
01:27:00,731 --> 01:27:03,581
afternoon or early evening.
When your body temp peaks and your grip 

1924
01:27:03,581 --> 01:27:07,331
strength peaks and your postworkout 
reaction time or your post workout 

1925
01:27:07,331 --> 01:27:08,600
protein synthesis peaks your,
uh,

1926
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:13,930
your reaction time peaks like,
like your body is very equipped to do a 

1927
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:16,010
hard workout in the afternoon and the 
evening more than it is in the morning.

1928
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:18,560
Well,
the way you can really tell his Jujitsu,

1929
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:22,220
my Jujitsu training in the morning,
I'm way weaker.

1930
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,350
Just don't feel the same in the 
afternoon.

1931
01:27:24,351 --> 01:27:25,670
You have much more energy.
Yeah,

1932
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:26,360
exactly.

1933
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,800
So the,
uh,

1934
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:30,860
the idea is also when you do a hard 
workout in the morning,

1935
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:35,890
you get a lot of times postworkout 
caloric compensation men and you just 

1936
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:38,750
want to eat everything in sight until 
fricking lunch.

1937
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:39,920
You're just,
you're just hungry.

1938
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:45,160
And part of this probably physical 
because you empty your glycogen stores 

1939
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:45,160
more quickly and part of it probably is 
mental,

1940
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,490
right?
Like I fucking punished it this morning.

1941
01:27:46,491 --> 01:27:47,350
I just,
uh,

1942
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,890
deserve to,
you know,

1943
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:53,920
have,
have a few extra slices of bread for 

1944
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:53,920
lunch.
So the,

1945
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:53,920
uh,
the idea is I get up,

1946
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,751
I do the coffee and then I'll do the 20 
to 45 minutes of easy movement and that 

1947
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:01,610
might be the yoga in the sauna.
It'll be a walk in the sunshine.

1948
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,080
So I'm getting my vitamin D and I'll do 
like breath work,

1949
01:28:04,081 --> 01:28:09,081
you know,
where I'll breathe in through my nose 

1950
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:09,081
and do breath hold.

1951
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:09,110
So I'm still kind of making my body 
better,

1952
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:12,500
but I'm not stressing it out with a lot 
of east centric muscle tissue damage.

1953
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:16,520
And then I finish up that whole session 
with a cold shower.

1954
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:21,850
So I'm getting a lot of those benefits 
of white adipose tissue to Brown fat 

1955
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:23,120
conversion in the absence of any 
inflammation,

1956
01:28:23,121 --> 01:28:26,060
right?
Inflammation and calories keep the white

1957
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:28,070
fat from getting converted into Brown 
fat,

1958
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:30,330
which is what you want when you're doing
a cold shower,

1959
01:28:30,331 --> 01:28:34,790
a cold soak or some kind of cold 
thermogenesis and I'm able to stay super

1960
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:38,460
lean with that protocol.
You get up caffeine aerobics exercise in

1961
01:28:38,461 --> 01:28:43,461
a fasted state,
you finish up with a cold and I mean 

1962
01:28:43,461 --> 01:28:46,541
even if you weren't working out,
you can stay pretty lean with that type 

1963
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:48,230
of protocol and this is what you did 
specifically to try to lose weight to go

1964
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:52,250
from when you were buying originally to 
just shed muscle.

1965
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:57,250
And then I would do really long 
catabolic chronic cardio endurance 

1966
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:57,250
workouts,
which are not that great for you.

1967
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:58,380
Right.
But I was just let you know,

1968
01:28:58,390 --> 01:28:59,790
I would go,
let's try a low rise.

1969
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:00,750
Yeah,
yeah,

1970
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,990
exactly.
Yeah.

1971
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,230
So when you were doing this,
we,

1972
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:07,360
you calorie restricting as well,
like take these.

1973
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:12,420
Oh it's calorie restricting or you'd go 
to bed at night and he'd be staring at 

1974
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:12,420
the ceiling hungry.
I guess it's,

1975
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,130
yeah,
you're trying to lose weight,

1976
01:29:14,131 --> 01:29:15,700
right?
So your body start to weight ratio.

1977
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,330
Your body starts eating yourself.
Now for these,

1978
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:24,260
for these fasts and workouts,
if you are going to have facet hard 

1979
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:24,270
workout in the morning,
you can stay.

1980
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:28,590
You can stay anabolic,
but relatively non insulinogenic without

1981
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:32,220
spiking your blood glucose too heavily 
with something like amino acids,

1982
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:37,680
right?
So it's like a lot of people will do a 

1983
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:37,680
branch chain amino acid or an essential 
amino acid.

1984
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,670
You elevate your blood levels of amino 
acids,

1985
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:43,710
keeps you anabolic,
it allows you to stave off central 

1986
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:46,551
nervous system fatigue,
keeps you from shedding too much muscle 

1987
01:29:46,551 --> 01:29:49,610
and you just spike your blood levels of 
amino acids and then go into your 

1988
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:50,400
workout and you could even throw 
something like ketones into the mix too.

1989
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:55,260
So that's like a very hypo caloric way 
to get a pre workout in without actually

1990
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,240
getting a lot of calories.
And at the same time,

1991
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:02,460
and we were talking before the podcast 
about we were talking about different 

1992
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,500
athletes and diets and things on those 
lines and you were saying that you don't

1993
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:08,160
think it's good idea for a pro athlete,
particularly like a basketball player to

1994
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:10,550
be on a Ketogenic ketogenic diet.
Yeah,

1995
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:15,890
I,
I don't think that a strict ketogenic 

1996
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:18,441
diet is a good strategy.
I think that is cyclic ketogenic diet 

1997
01:30:18,441 --> 01:30:18,510
would be the way to go for something 
like that.

1998
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,130
Yeah.
Zack bitter.

1999
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:25,180
And that's exactly what I do is I'll eat
almost zero carbohydrates the entire 

2000
01:30:25,651 --> 01:30:26,940
day.
Plants,

2001
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:31,970
starches and fats.
I think I told you about my morning 

2002
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:32,490
smoothie you the last time I was on and 
it's just,

2003
01:30:32,491 --> 01:30:37,491
you know,
like coconut milk and bone broth and 

2004
01:30:37,491 --> 01:30:37,840
these precursors to nad,
which is another very,

2005
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:42,850
very.
That probably next to stem cells is one 

2006
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:42,850
of the most potent anti aging protocols 
that you can engage in.

2007
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:47,990
Nad stands for.
I'll nicotinamide Adenine dinucleotide 

2008
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:52,220
is what that is.
And I can tell you about that in a 

2009
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:52,220
second after I.
I'll,

2010
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:53,310
I'll just briefly tell you about the 
cyclical ketogenic diet.

2011
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:54,690
Basically,
it's all plants,

2012
01:30:54,691 --> 01:30:59,691
all fats,
no carbs or very low carbs the entire 

2013
01:30:59,691 --> 01:30:59,691
day,
and then in the evening,

2014
01:30:59,691 --> 01:31:04,610
and this is where the beauty of that 
scenario I talked about earlier fits in 

2015
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:06,030
because you've done your your hard 
afternoon or early evening workout,

2016
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,120
so your glute four transporters are very
upregulated.

2017
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:14,300
You're very insulin sensitive in any 
carbohydrates that you do eat are far 

2018
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:18,231
more likely to be shuttled into muscle 
or liver glycogen rather than hanging 

2019
01:31:18,231 --> 01:31:19,110
around the bloodstream causing 
inflammation,

2020
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:23,160
or rather than being shuttled to the 
liver and converted into triglycerides,

2021
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:27,630
you're basically using the carbohydrates
that you do eat at the end of the day to

2022
01:31:27,631 --> 01:31:30,030
sock away energy for the next day.
It's hard.

2023
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,430
Glycolytic demanding workout,
right?

2024
01:31:32,431 --> 01:31:37,431
And so basically you're,
you're teaching your body how to be a 

2025
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:40,251
fat burning machine all day long.
You're restricting any amount of 

2026
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:43,491
glycemic variability all day long,
assuming you're not doing the 

2027
01:31:43,491 --> 01:31:43,560
carnivorous diet because high amounts of
meat,

2028
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,890
it's gluconeogenic.
It can spike blood glucose,

2029
01:31:46,891 --> 01:31:48,870
but you're essentially doing lots of 
plants,

2030
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:53,130
modern amount of fats and some amount of
protein but,

2031
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,110
but not a crazy amount of protein all 
day long.

2032
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:56,580
And then with dinner,
you know,

2033
01:31:56,581 --> 01:32:00,070
we'll do just to make sourdough bread 
and while the sweet potato fries and my,

2034
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,660
you know,
my kids will make rice cakes,

2035
01:32:01,661 --> 01:32:03,390
you know,
we're dark chocolate,

2036
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:08,670
red wine,
any of that stuff is all in the 

2037
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:08,670
evenings,
so that refills your glycogen stores for

2038
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:11,200
anything explosive and demanding and 
then you just rinse,

2039
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:15,640
wash and repeat the next day.
So that's a cyclic ketogenic diet.

2040
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,180
Now this is cyclic one individual 24 
hour session,

2041
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:22,580
but are you experiencing states of 
Ketosis during the day?

2042
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,250
Yeah,
absolutely.

2043
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:24,350
Absolutely.
I,

2044
01:32:24,351 --> 01:32:26,620
so I have a device called a level in my 
office,

2045
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:29,260
L E v e l and it's a breath ketone 
device.

2046
01:32:29,261 --> 01:32:31,660
It's just quicker and more convenient 
than a blood stick.

2047
01:32:31,661 --> 01:32:34,040
It's also long term it,
it,

2048
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,640
it's a good proxy.
It's a good approximation.

2049
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:41,730
Lev,
Lev l there's another one called the 

2050
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:42,650
ketone x and you can get just like a,
you know,

2051
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,790
a ketone monitor,
a blood ketone monitor.

2052
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:51,210
Uh,
but if people don't want to do a blood 

2053
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:51,210
prick everyday,
I type,

2054
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:55,231
I don't have the band aids on the 
fingers when I'm trying to write things 

2055
01:32:55,231 --> 01:32:55,231
on my lap.

2056
01:32:55,231 --> 01:32:58,680
It's just,
it's easier for me to just breathe into 

2057
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,571
a tube when I walk into my office.
I'm easily that's exact track and 

2058
01:33:00,571 --> 01:33:04,771
adjust.
So weird how this has become such a 

2059
01:33:04,771 --> 01:33:08,230
massive part of culture these days is 
measuring your ketones.

2060
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:13,570
Just constantly hear people talking 
about and it's so fatty fad now,

2061
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,320
you know?
Yeah,

2062
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:16,090
I get it.
It was funny that he,

2063
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:17,110
uh,
anyway,

2064
01:33:17,111 --> 01:33:19,300
I mean it,
I just said it and I had to explain what

2065
01:33:19,301 --> 01:33:22,600
I was saying because it sounded weird to
me anyways though.

2066
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,620
The,
uh,

2067
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,800
the cyclic ketogenic diet allows you to 
be back in the state of Ketosis by that 

2068
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,601
morning easily.
And then you just basically maintained 

2069
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:34,540
that all day long.
Then you refuel and carbohydrates at the

2070
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:35,570
end of the day.
Uh,

2071
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:40,860
and then there was another question that
you asked about nad that's something 

2072
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:45,061
completely different but that,
but that's the cyclical ketogenic diet 

2073
01:33:45,061 --> 01:33:45,061
works.

2074
01:33:45,061 --> 01:33:49,150
So your body having those carbohydrates 
at night knocks you out of Ketosis,

2075
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:54,420
right when you're,
when you're eating the bread and your 

2076
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:57,841
blood glucose will rise,
you're not going to be shuttling a lot 

2077
01:33:57,841 --> 01:34:00,641
of Acetol Coa,
which is the precursor to ketones and 

2078
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:01,670
ketone generation and then you're going 
through a 16 hour fasting,

2079
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:03,380
but then you have a 12 to 16 hour fast 
and he said,

2080
01:34:03,381 --> 01:34:08,381
I couldn't get up.
You do the fasted morning aerobic 

2081
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:08,381
workout,
a cold shower,

2082
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:10,060
a little bit of coffee or green tea and 
it's a perfect scenario.

2083
01:34:10,090 --> 01:34:11,820
PTOSIS works perfectly.
I'm telling you,

2084
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,840
you,
you start your day off like that and 

2085
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,931
then you end your day with the 
carbohydrates as a hard afternoon 

2086
01:34:18,931 --> 01:34:21,721
workout.
That easy morning workout and it like 

2087
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:21,721
for,
for metabolism,

2088
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:22,660
for body composition,
uh,

2089
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:24,430
for,
for maintaining fitness,

2090
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:28,840
for teaching yourself how to be a fat 
burning machine will still refilling the

2091
01:34:28,841 --> 01:34:31,480
body of carbohydrates stores.
It's a beautiful scenario.

2092
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,940
Also.
I just think there's some,

2093
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:38,860
there's some benefit in enjoying what 
you eat to not constantly worrying about

2094
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,460
your glucose levels and ketones and all 
that stuff.

2095
01:34:42,461 --> 01:34:42,810
I mean,
I,

2096
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:45,880
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with having a little bread or a pasta or

2097
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:48,630
something like this.
There's nothing wrong with it and that,

2098
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,290
I mean,
it's also my beef with,

2099
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:52,780
uh,
with the carnivore diet is,

2100
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,840
you know,
I like sweet potato fries and I like,

2101
01:34:55,841 --> 01:34:58,190
you know,
I like cauliflower

2102
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:00,000
rice and I like,
you know,

2103
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:01,760
all sorts of different plants and 
vegetables.

2104
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:02,960
Now this,
um,

2105
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:08,140
this nad you can get these injections or
ivs now and it is something that 

2106
01:35:09,531 --> 01:35:11,630
enhances your own stem cell 
proliferation,

2107
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:16,690
but it is one of the most potent anti 
aging molecules you can put into your 

2108
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:19,970
body in terms of decreasing the rate at 
which your telomeres shorten.

2109
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,120
So you've probably heard a lot of these,
sir,

2110
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:27,130
two enriched foods like blueberries and 
Cacao and chocolate and resveratrol and 

2111
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,690
a lot of them work.
But the most powerful of any of these as

2112
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:34,691
nad nad to Nadh ratio is highly 
reflective of your telomere health.

2113
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:41,680
And these are the most horribly painful 
and uncomfortable injections or ivs you 

2114
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:44,420
would ever get in your life.
You can,

2115
01:35:44,421 --> 01:35:46,140
you can do it orally.
There's a,

2116
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:48,190
there's a capsule,
there's companies like elise,

2117
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,960
a nitrogen that sell nr.

2118
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:52,750
Take that stuff.
Nicotinamide,

2119
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,450
nicotinamide riboside.
It's a precursor to Nad,

2120
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:00,230
but it doesn't hold a candle to just 
mainlining it into your bloodstream.

2121
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,060
And how do you get it?
We're going to do.

2122
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,520
So one way to do it is in a medical 
clinic,

2123
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:07,940
you can get a six to eight hour ivy 
bringing a laptop and you work away.

2124
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:09,410
And some people do this on a monthly 
basis,

2125
01:36:09,411 --> 01:36:12,910
just six to eight hours of.
It's a long drip.

2126
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:14,230
Um,
you know,

2127
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:17,660
they have some of the guys down at on 
it,

2128
01:36:17,661 --> 01:36:22,661
do it,
and they'll have a nurse come in and 

2129
01:36:22,661 --> 01:36:22,661
push a little bit more quickly.
That's like an hour long.

2130
01:36:22,661 --> 01:36:22,850
Uh,
Ivy has it.

2131
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:27,530
Just do it short like that.
It's way more uncomfortable.

2132
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:32,550
The shore you get,
the more uncomfortable it gets because 

2133
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,550
you're pushing this stuff into your 
bloodstream more quickly.

2134
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:34,280
And it feels like your whole body is on 
fire.

2135
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:39,310
I mean,
you have to box breath and close your 

2136
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:39,310
eyes and meditate.
Painful.

2137
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:43,130
It's,
it's like if you ever done dmt DMT,

2138
01:36:43,221 --> 01:36:47,450
but you're on fire and getting punched 
in the gut at the same time and you feel

2139
01:36:47,451 --> 01:36:52,451
like your heart's going to explode and 
then you finish and you feel like 

2140
01:36:52,451 --> 01:36:55,841
superman.
You feel like you have more energy on 

2141
01:36:55,841 --> 01:36:55,841
less sleep.
Your workouts are better.

2142
01:36:55,841 --> 01:36:56,570
I mean,
it's one of the,

2143
01:36:56,590 --> 01:36:59,480
it's like fish oil where when you take a
bunch of fish oil,

2144
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:01,880
you just kind of keep your fingers 
crossed that it's working.

2145
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,170
It's not like you can feel fish oil and 
you want to go destroy the world.

2146
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:09,860
Um,
it's even better than black ant extract.

2147
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:13,910
So there's,
you can get it to you.

2148
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:17,030
So I get it shipped to my house and I do
a self administered push ivy.

2149
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:18,600
I do the same thing with Myers 
cocktails.

2150
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:23,600
So I just shove a butterfly needle into 
my vein and then I push this nad and 

2151
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,800
very,
very slowly.

2152
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:29,801
And you can even chase it with a myers 
cocktail which enhances the 

2153
01:37:29,801 --> 01:37:29,801
effectiveness of it.
Meaning you can do like a,

2154
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,790
an Nid.
And this is a common protocol and lot of

2155
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,590
anti aging clinics are a lot of,
you know,

2156
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:38,591
like a alternative health clinics as you
do the Nad injection and you follow it 

2157
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:40,610
up with a myers cocktail and you feel 
like superman admires,

2158
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:44,490
that's just vitamins,
vitamin infusion,

2159
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:47,870
it's ivy infusion of vitamin B and 
sometimes they'll nootropics and they're

2160
01:37:47,871 --> 01:37:50,300
like lithium and stuff like that.
It's too much to remember,

2161
01:37:50,301 --> 01:37:51,030
man.
Oh.

2162
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:53,660
But it's.
So you had a.

2163
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:57,390
I'm a complete idiot about anything 
except health and nutrition and fitness.

2164
01:37:57,391 --> 01:37:58,740
That's how like,
I don't know,

2165
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,030
I don't watch TV and,
and uh,

2166
01:38:01,031 --> 01:38:02,910
I don't follow politics or anything like
that.

2167
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:05,160
I just studied.
Keep the poison out.

2168
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:06,120
Yes,
exactly.

2169
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:11,121
It's like Sherlock Holmes and Watson 
tells us him him his name and he says 

2170
01:38:11,121 --> 01:38:15,471
I'm going to work hard to forget that 
because he doesn't want anything 

2171
01:38:15,471 --> 01:38:15,471
cluttering up his head at all.
Right.

2172
01:38:15,471 --> 01:38:18,891
Aside from his sleuthing.
So is there an nad place in la where I 

2173
01:38:18,891 --> 01:38:20,130
could go and do this?
Yes,

2174
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:25,160
there I was speaking with somebody 
yesterday about this and he asked me if 

2175
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:29,400
I could find a clinic and I found one in
Beverly Hills and uh,

2176
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:34,490
it's probably an one of the long ivy,
so you'll want to wait till we have some

2177
01:38:34,651 --> 01:38:39,651
computer work to do and you can sit on 
your laptop and just kind of get stuff 

2178
01:38:39,651 --> 01:38:40,810
done six to eight hours or you can just 
listen to Paul,

2179
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:45,920
you can,
you can push it in and about 15 to 20 

2180
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,530
minutes and you can have a nurse 
practitioner do this.

2181
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:47,630
And then there are some clinics that 
will do,

2182
01:38:47,631 --> 01:38:51,420
it's called a push ivy and nad push ivy.
So beneficial.

2183
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:56,421
Just more painful.
I'm doing this once a week now and it's 

2184
01:38:56,421 --> 01:38:57,240
painful 10 to 20 minutes of my entire 
week,

2185
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,850
but you feel amazing.
And I'm,

2186
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:04,070
I'm testing my telomere length with this
company called Tello years.

2187
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:09,370
They say there's another one,
I forget the name of the other company 

2188
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:10,020
that tests your telomere length.
There's only a couple out there.

2189
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,380
So it tests the rate at which your 
telomeres are shortening.

2190
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:18,860
And the two things that have had the 
most profound effect on my results from 

2191
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:22,221
that test have been the stem cell 
injections intravenously and the Nad 

2192
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:25,350
injections,
my biological age right now,

2193
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:30,560
which started off at an age of 37 when I
was 34 and then decreased to 35 when I 

2194
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:37,971
tested again at 36 years old.
I just tested it 37 years old and my 

2195
01:39:37,971 --> 01:39:42,441
biological age is 20 in terms of the 
rate at which my telomeres are 

2196
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:42,441
shortening.

2197
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:46,550
And the only two things that have 
changed have been the stem cell 

2198
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:48,060
injections and the Nad injections.
So me and biological age,

2199
01:39:48,061 --> 01:39:53,061
you can reverse your biological age.
Now there is some side effects.

2200
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:55,110
No,
like,

2201
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:59,730
so the telomere test is a test of your 
white blood cell telomere length,

2202
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,980
which is not reflective of every cell in
your body.

2203
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:03,080
Right?
So,

2204
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:04,850
so technically,
uh,

2205
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:06,510
it's,
it's not like a,

2206
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:09,630
it's not an ironclad test with a ton of 
research behind it,

2207
01:40:09,631 --> 01:40:12,990
but it's an approximate corollary to 
your biological age.

2208
01:40:12,991 --> 01:40:15,600
It's the best we have right now to be 
able to test telomere length.

2209
01:40:15,601 --> 01:40:16,860
But I'm not going to pretend like it's 
a,

2210
01:40:16,861 --> 01:40:21,861
it's a,
it's a gold standard test and I'm not 

2211
01:40:21,861 --> 01:40:21,861
aware of a gold standard test for 
telomere length,

2212
01:40:21,861 --> 01:40:26,480
but I can tell you that I feel amazing 
and that telomere length is shortening.

2213
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:29,280
And those Nad injections just make you 
feel like superman.

2214
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:33,180
So do you think it's a combination of 
the things or do we,

2215
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:36,240
would you attribute it more to the Nad 
is the problem with this shit?

2216
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:36,930
I do,
Dude.

2217
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:38,740
He's just so many different things.
Yeah.

2218
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:44,010
And there's.
And there's stuff you can do to enhance 

2219
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:44,010
your own endogenous stem cell 
production.

2220
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:45,570
We were talking about meat and I told 
you about that study with the.

2221
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:48,300
We were talking about the carnosine and 
the blueberry extract.

2222
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:52,980
That's one of chlorella is another 
colostrum is fantastic for that,

2223
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:56,620
for endogenous stem cell health.
Coffee Berry fruit extract.

2224
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:01,770
That's another really fascinating one.
And you can buy that on Amazon as a 

2225
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:04,621
powder.
And I put a lot of this stuff in my 

2226
01:41:04,621 --> 01:41:04,621
morning smoothie now.
So when I wake up,

2227
01:41:04,621 --> 01:41:04,621
you know,
I've got Chlorella,

2228
01:41:04,621 --> 01:41:06,280
I've got Dha,
I've got this,

2229
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:09,190
uh,
this stuff called Howdy Arco Bark Tea,

2230
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:12,430
which also enhances your own nad 
production,

2231
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,190
a colostrum,
bone broth,

2232
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,920
vitamin C to enhance the bone broth 
uptake.

2233
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,540
So you can kind of make yourself a 
little,

2234
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:24,570
a little cocktail of ingredients that 
you just take in the morning without 

2235
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:24,570
necessarily spending,
you know,

2236
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:29,580
8,000
bucks on a stem cell and extraction and 

2237
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:32,281
injections.
Have you thought about like having some 

2238
01:41:32,281 --> 01:41:34,591
sort of an online thing where people 
could subscribe to a protocol and you 

2239
01:41:34,591 --> 01:41:34,760
would,
you know,

2240
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,570
what I thought about doing was just 
making like a,

2241
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,600
like a,
a supplement or something like that 

2242
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,480
where you can take all this stuff and 
just combine it into a shake or into 

2243
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,641
some kind of a supplement.
So I'm just going to buy out or 

2244
01:41:47,641 --> 01:41:47,680
something.
And I mean some,

2245
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:50,850
some people who don't understand the 
supplement industry or formulation to,

2246
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:52,410
well,
why don't you just put all this stuff in

2247
01:41:52,411 --> 01:41:53,220
a capsule,
but I mean,

2248
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:58,290
you,
one compound can decrease the 

2249
01:41:58,290 --> 01:41:58,470
absorbability of the other compound or 
you know,

2250
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:03,480
one compound will create an aesthetic or
an alkaline scenario in which the other 

2251
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:03,700
one doesn't work well.

2252
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:07,150
So it would require a lot of testing.
But ultimately,

2253
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:12,180
you know,
at this point I just blend it all in a 

2254
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:13,621
blender and kind of keep my fingers 
crossed and dump it all into my big 

2255
01:42:13,621 --> 01:42:13,621
biggest mug.
And it seems like,

2256
01:42:13,621 --> 01:42:15,910
you know,
someone like you who knows so much about

2257
01:42:15,911 --> 01:42:20,911
this stuff,
it would be a great resource if people 

2258
01:42:20,911 --> 01:42:23,521
could subscribe to something and you 
guys could put together some sort of a 

2259
01:42:23,521 --> 01:42:28,381
protocol for people that would fall.
They could follow it on a daily basis 

2260
01:42:28,381 --> 01:42:28,960
and you know,
you're creating more work for me.

2261
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:32,600
Uh,
yeah,

2262
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:33,880
but,
but it would,

2263
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,630
the problem is genetic variability,
right?

2264
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:39,010
Like this whole high fat diet.
And,

2265
01:42:39,011 --> 01:42:39,650
uh,
you know,

2266
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:43,210
I saw yesterday that you tweeted out a,
uh,

2267
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,860
you know,
my friend Nina Teicholz is,

2268
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:45,580
you know,
data,

2269
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:50,590
you know,
encouraging the high saturated fat 

2270
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:53,860
intake and I love her and I love her 
approach and I love the idea that she is

2271
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:55,700
getting a lot of people,
you know,

2272
01:42:55,750 --> 01:43:00,700
via the lobbying to focus less on grains
and high carb diet,

2273
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:02,440
which I think is helpful for a lot of 
people.

2274
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:05,920
But at the same time there are,
there are genes are like the PPA,

2275
01:43:05,921 --> 01:43:10,921
our one alpha gene,
which would cause a little bit of an 

2276
01:43:10,921 --> 01:43:14,761
inflammatory response to high intake of 
fats or to a lot of saturated fats 

2277
01:43:15,551 --> 01:43:19,060
without a lot of poly or mono 
unsaturated fats there.

2278
01:43:19,061 --> 01:43:24,061
I think the last time that we talk,
we talked about familial 

2279
01:43:24,061 --> 01:43:24,061
hypercholesterolemia,
right?

2280
01:43:24,061 --> 01:43:29,010
Where some people,
if they shift to a Kenogenic or a high 

2281
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:31,711
fat diet,
it screws them from a metabolic 

2282
01:43:31,711 --> 01:43:32,350
standpoint because they get not only 
high cholesterol but you know,

2283
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:36,400
high particle count and,
and oxidation of that cholesterol.

2284
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:38,230
Um,
there's,

2285
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:39,510
there's,
uh,

2286
01:43:39,730 --> 01:43:41,290
there's ways around that,
you know,

2287
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:46,291
for example,
like a catava and diet would be what 

2288
01:43:46,291 --> 01:43:48,841
you'd consume if you were,
if you were eating or if you had this 

2289
01:43:48,841 --> 01:43:51,890
familial hypercholesterolemia where he'd
eat a lot of tubers and fish and coconut

2290
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:56,920
meat and wild plants and that's 
technically like a 70 to 80 percent 

2291
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,910
carbohydrate based diet.
Now with a lot of grains,

2292
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:00,560
you know,
now with a lot of junk food.

2293
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:04,670
But that would be a diet more 
appropriate for someone with that issue.

2294
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,960
Um,
someone with a PPA,

2295
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:10,961
our Jane issue,
they'd want to eat less of the coconut 

2296
01:44:10,961 --> 01:44:14,021
oil and the butter and the cheeses and 
more of like the Avocados and the extra 

2297
01:44:14,021 --> 01:44:15,950
virgin olive oil and more of the 
Mediterranean diet approach.

2298
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:18,100
You know,
I mentioned earlier that the,

2299
01:44:18,101 --> 01:44:21,980
the fact that coconut oil and a lot of 
these saturated fats and a lot of people

2300
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:24,230
are inflammatory,
so they would want to eat a lot of,

2301
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:27,890
a lot of antioxidants and flavonols and 
polyphenol rich,

2302
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:33,110
small,
non sugary berries and dark leafy 

2303
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:33,890
Greens.
And so again,

2304
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,920
you could have a subscription based 
service that teaches people a lot of 

2305
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:38,920
these things,
but then once again,

2306
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:43,660
you got to have either artificial 
intelligence that screening each person 

2307
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:46,100
to look at what they actually need or 
you've got a real person talking to each

2308
01:44:46,101 --> 01:44:47,780
person looking at their labs and saying,
okay,

2309
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,670
this is the one that would work well for
you.

2310
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:51,560
Rather than just saying,
okay,

2311
01:44:51,561 --> 01:44:52,810
this,
this has been smoothie,

2312
01:44:52,811 --> 01:44:54,500
everybody should be drinking this.
Right?

2313
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,900
Yeah.
I went to this one thing once where they

2314
01:44:56,930 --> 01:45:01,930
monitored my blood and I abandoned it 
immediately because they told me I 

2315
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:01,930
shouldn't have avocados.

2316
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:02,420
I'm like,
what are you talking about?

2317
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:08,650
Igg Food Allergy tests.
And the problem is that you produce a 

2318
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:09,950
lot of these immunoglobulins to foods 
that you eat a lot,

2319
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:15,280
so people will be of eggs and they do 
this test and they walk out depressed 

2320
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:19,751
with their tail between their legs 
because they can't have avocados and 

2321
01:45:19,751 --> 01:45:19,751
eggs anymore.
And it's because they were eating a shit

2322
01:45:19,751 --> 01:45:21,640
ton of Avocados and eggs.
The DM,

2323
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:22,100
right?
Yeah.

2324
01:45:22,101 --> 01:45:24,200
There's one called the Cyrex food 
allergy panel.

2325
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:29,230
It's a little more.
You don't get this huge laundry list of 

2326
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:30,630
foods that give you false positives.
It's a pretty accurate test that I use.

2327
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,120
Knew it was nonsense.
It was like,

2328
01:45:32,121 --> 01:45:33,950
I feel great.
I eat Avocados all the time.

2329
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:35,630
This can be anything other than 
nonsense.

2330
01:45:35,710 --> 01:45:36,980
Yeah,
well,

2331
01:45:36,981 --> 01:45:41,981
it's not nonsense.
I mean they should immunoglobulin 

2332
01:45:41,981 --> 01:45:44,510
reaction to Avocados and there's no 
bodies in the streets.

2333
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,820
No evidence that that's going to 
actually are you.

2334
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:53,320
That's the problem.
It's just you would have to go on some 

2335
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,590
sort of a very neutral diet for a long 
period of time.

2336
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:59,090
Get your body's baseline established 
exactly at your blood work,

2337
01:45:59,091 --> 01:46:04,091
done whatever rice for a month and then 
get it taken proteins at all and even 

2338
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:06,350
then,
what would that do?

2339
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:09,690
Probably do like a wash out like a five 
day fast and that's that.

2340
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:12,800
That new valter,
Longo longevity diet is you do,

2341
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:16,370
I think it's five over the know once a 
quarter,

2342
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:18,230
five day fast,
right?

2343
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:23,231
To clean you out to get all the benefits
of cellular autophagy and with that 

2344
01:46:23,231 --> 01:46:25,550
particular diet.
I was talking before about how long term

2345
01:46:25,551 --> 01:46:27,740
calorie restriction is bad for you,
you know,

2346
01:46:27,741 --> 01:46:30,950
and this whole idea of intermittent 
fasting with caloric restriction creates

2347
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:35,330
hormone deficits and associated with 
gallstones and all sorts of nasty things

2348
01:46:35,331 --> 01:46:37,670
happen to your body when you don't give 
it enough calories.

2349
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:42,880
What about long term?
Like you know when people go into those 

2350
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:43,190
five day fast like Dom D'agostino,
valter,

2351
01:46:43,191 --> 01:46:48,191
Longo,
his approach is you do a five day fast 

2352
01:46:48,191 --> 01:46:48,670
just a few times a year and I think in 
in active individuals,

2353
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:53,840
athletes,
he only recommends like two or three 

2354
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:54,510
times a year Max that you do this five 
day fast and you put it in an off season

2355
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:59,511
or recovery phase or some period of time
where you're not training heavily and 

2356
01:46:59,511 --> 01:47:03,231
that scenario would allow you to get a 
lot of the cellular autophagy and the 

2357
01:47:03,231 --> 01:47:03,810
cleanup benefits and theoretically you 
could do that,

2358
01:47:03,811 --> 01:47:08,811
right?
And then go get your food allergy tests 

2359
01:47:08,811 --> 01:47:10,790
and see what kind of proteins are 
floating around your brain and you're 

2360
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,790
doing a 24 hour fast.
How often?

2361
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:13,680
What works for me because I don't do 
well,

2362
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:15,720
not even for five days,
I'm too active.

2363
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:17,220
Like I just have too much shit going on.

2364
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:22,240
Oh,
like there aren't many times during the 

2365
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,740
year when I could point out a five day 
slot in my schedule where I'm not 

2366
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:27,870
hunting or competing or working out or 
doing something that requires me to need

2367
01:47:27,871 --> 01:47:29,220
calories or outside.
I'm just going to.

2368
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:34,280
I'm already skinny,
like I can't go for a long time without 

2369
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:36,861
eating and my metabolism is sky high.
So what I do is a 12 to 16 hour fast 

2370
01:47:38,101 --> 01:47:40,980
every day.
Not a calorically restricted fast,

2371
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:44,520
but just 12 to 16 hours without eating 
every single day.

2372
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:48,330
On the lower activity days I'd taken 
less protein and restricted meat.

2373
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:53,730
That's one of the days where I'm not 
beating up my body too much and like a 

2374
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:53,820
Wednesday and a Sunday,
which are more recovery days.

2375
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:55,510
Those were the days when I do,
you know,

2376
01:47:55,560 --> 01:48:00,560
fricken.
I close myself love days or like I do 

2377
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,610
clay masks and coffee enemas and 
infrared therapy like.

2378
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:04,920
So I'm still.
So for,

2379
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:07,050
for,
for upregulating,

2380
01:48:07,051 --> 01:48:09,400
your own glutathione production,
your biopsy,

2381
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:14,220
you feel clean as a whistle plus it's 
the best way to get coffee up your,

2382
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:19,240
but there's no other way that you do.
You do get a lot of caffeine absorption 

2383
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:19,240
to know.
But I'm,

2384
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:21,300
I'm seriously,
if you've never done something like that

2385
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:24,060
and experienced what it feels like to 
just be completely cleaned out,

2386
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:28,980
it's a pretty good feeling towards the 
duty of the coffee enema not only cleans

2387
01:48:28,981 --> 01:48:33,981
out your colon,
but it causes your liver and your 

2388
01:48:33,981 --> 01:48:36,831
gallbladder,
gallbladder specifically to increase 

2389
01:48:36,831 --> 01:48:38,871
bile production.
It upregulate your glutathione 

2390
01:48:38,871 --> 01:48:38,871
production,
your indulgence,

2391
01:48:38,871 --> 01:48:39,570
Buddha,
fire and production.

2392
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:42,480
And so you're increasing your production
of antioxidants.

2393
01:48:42,481 --> 01:48:45,750
And it also causes Paris dialysis while 
she just moved stuff through.

2394
01:48:45,751 --> 01:48:47,550
That's kind of moving slowly.
So once a week,

2395
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:49,670
Wednesday mornings I get up,
uh,

2396
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:54,850
my,
my wife makes coffee every morning and 

2397
01:48:54,850 --> 01:48:54,870
have her make an extra pot as leave that
out on the counter until it gets to room

2398
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:55,500
temperature.

2399
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,300
And normally when I'm drinking my 
coffee,

2400
01:48:57,301 --> 01:49:02,301
I'm going through all my morning 
research and articles and everything 

2401
01:49:02,301 --> 01:49:02,301
down in my.
I have a standing desk in the basement,

2402
01:49:02,301 --> 01:49:03,420
but instead I go in,
I,

2403
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:08,540
I lay on my right side,
on the bathroom floor and I keep 

2404
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:12,021
coughing in there for about 20 minutes 
while I'm working and then I get up and 

2405
01:49:12,021 --> 01:49:15,240
you just let it all out and you lay on 
your coffee and your.

2406
01:49:15,241 --> 01:49:17,640
But I get a stainless steel animal 
bucket,

2407
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:22,530
so plastics,
so you're not injecting classics up your

2408
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:27,270
butt and then you had.
It's about a quarter,

2409
01:49:27,271 --> 01:49:29,980
so have coffee in the back side with 
this tube.

2410
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:31,410
It's a lot of coffee,
Jesus.

2411
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,440
And then you lay on your right side for 
20 minutes and then you get up and you 

2412
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:40,260
let it all out and,
and of course I have the squatty potty 

2413
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:40,260
so it comes up more easily.

2414
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,810
Of course,
you know of that kink in your photos and

2415
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:46,350
everything comes out and you just,
you walk away just like whistling with a

2416
01:49:46,351 --> 01:49:48,770
big smile on your face.
That's squatty potty is legit.

2417
01:49:48,771 --> 01:49:49,620
I feel wonderful.
It's,

2418
01:49:49,690 --> 01:49:52,660
it probably works really should be 
getting into a hole in the ground when I

2419
01:49:52,661 --> 01:49:55,020
don't have one.
I perch my best dumps.

2420
01:49:55,021 --> 01:49:57,600
So when I'm hunting or camping or on the
toilet,

2421
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:01,150
you hold onto a tree and you kinda do it
like a dog person and it's perfect.

2422
01:50:01,151 --> 01:50:06,151
So.
So on those days that I'm doing coffee 

2423
01:50:06,151 --> 01:50:08,800
enemas or sauna or any weird woo woo,
things that don't involve workouts,

2424
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:12,460
I do protein restriction because I'm not
beating up my body that much.

2425
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:17,700
Coffee Enema doesn't cause a lot of east
centric muscle tissue damage unless 

2426
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:20,671
you've done something horribly wrong.
So I basically have those days as my 

2427
01:50:20,671 --> 01:50:23,230
lower protein days and then once a week,
and this would be,

2428
01:50:23,231 --> 01:50:25,180
unless I'm traveling because it's harder
to doing travel.

2429
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,840
I do a 24 hour fast Saturday at dinner,
you stop eating,

2430
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:34,110
sleep all night.
All he gotta do is skip breakfast on 

2431
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:36,511
Sunday and skip lunch on Sunday and then
have dinner on Sunday night and that's 

2432
01:50:36,511 --> 01:50:40,411
pretty easy to do.
And so I get the benefits of the longer 

2433
01:50:40,411 --> 01:50:40,411
fast.
Right?

2434
01:50:40,411 --> 01:50:44,191
Because a lot of those cellular 
autophagy and endogenous stem cell 

2435
01:50:44,191 --> 01:50:45,040
production benefits don't kick in until 
you're about 16 hours in.

2436
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:50,390
Right?
So I get that benefit once a week even 

2437
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:51,070
though for me really it comes out to 
about twice a month that I'm actually at

2438
01:50:51,071 --> 01:50:56,071
home because I travel so much,
doing that full 24 hour fast and I do a 

2439
01:50:56,071 --> 01:50:56,980
lot of work that day.
I play with my kids,

2440
01:50:56,981 --> 01:51:00,730
I just feel things in throughout that 
day to keep my appetite satiated.

2441
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:05,500
And sometimes they'll do some of those 
new ketone esters and sometimes we'll do

2442
01:51:05,501 --> 01:51:10,501
some amino acids or you know,
a cup of bone broth doesn't count as 

2443
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:11,110
breaking your fast kind of sword of 
cheating.

2444
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,150
But it's,
it's,

2445
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,590
it's like it's a speed bump for a 
skinny,

2446
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,660
you know,
high metabolism guy like me to have like

2447
01:51:16,661 --> 01:51:19,390
a cup of 40 calorie bone broth in the 
middle of the day.

2448
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:23,560
The bone broth fast.
The ketone esters also break your fast.

2449
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,950
They're a caloric.
Yeah.

2450
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:27,910
I'm technically,
you know,

2451
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:29,140
from,
from just a pure,

2452
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:31,000
you know,
very simple physiology standpoint.

2453
01:51:31,001 --> 01:51:35,590
Your body would need to utilize those 
ketones for energy before it would,

2454
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:38,200
you know,
turn some of your own Acetol Coa,

2455
01:51:38,201 --> 01:51:40,540
a derived from your fat into extra 
ketones.

2456
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:44,290
But I just liked the way I feel on 
fasting using these,

2457
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:49,291
these especially like the newer ketone 
esters in the case on why aren't you 

2458
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:51,370
supposed to take them with glucose?
No,

2459
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:52,420
no,
no.

2460
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:57,720
You are going to get a huge performance 
advantage by taking them with glucose,

2461
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,740
but that's also,
uh,

2462
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:01,750
it,
it's,

2463
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:06,810
it's an ancestrally inappropriate state 
for the human body to have 

2464
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:11,280
simultaneously elevated levels of blood 
glucose and elevated levels of blood 

2465
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:15,661
ketones because traditionally we'd have 
elevated our blood ketones through 

2466
01:52:15,661 --> 01:52:19,710
fasting and while I'm okay with 
elevating blood key tones via a non 

2467
01:52:19,751 --> 01:52:24,751
ancestral roots,
such as the consumption of these ketone 

2468
01:52:24,751 --> 01:52:26,260
esters designed by the US Department of 
Defense for soldiers in battle,

2469
01:52:26,261 --> 01:52:31,261
they have to go two or three days 
without eating or for Tour de France 

2470
01:52:31,261 --> 01:52:31,261
riders have been using them for awhile.

2471
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:36,570
The idea of consuming glucose along with
those ketones and spiking blood glucose,

2472
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:40,090
which can have a little bit of an 
inflammatory oxidative effect,

2473
01:52:40,330 --> 01:52:45,330
is not something I would do unless I 
were like in a race or in a really hard 

2474
01:52:45,330 --> 01:52:50,261
demanding workout.
That's where something like that you 

2475
01:52:50,261 --> 01:52:52,751
can,
you can use like rocket fuel and that's 

2476
01:52:52,751 --> 01:52:53,240
actually a very good mix,
some kind of like a fruit dose,

2477
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:58,241
Maltodextrin blend,
which the gatorade sports science 

2478
01:52:58,241 --> 01:53:01,091
institute has shown allows you to get a 
really high absorption of carbohydrates 

2479
01:53:01,091 --> 01:53:01,580
rather than,
you know,

2480
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:04,250
just Maltodextrin or just glucose or 
just fruit dose.

2481
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:08,480
Then you add in Ketone esters on top of 
that and then to stave off what's called

2482
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:13,481
central nervous system fatigue,
the crossing of trip to fan into the 

2483
01:53:13,481 --> 01:53:13,481
brain,
which kind of makes you feel,

2484
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:14,330
you know,
Turkey dinner,

2485
01:53:14,331 --> 01:53:19,331
sleepy effect during exercise.
You throw essential amino acids into 

2486
01:53:19,331 --> 01:53:19,760
that,
so you've got amino acids,

2487
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:24,590
ketones and glucose,
and that mix is just pure rocket fuel.

2488
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,180
Yeah.
You talked about that last time you said

2489
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:31,181
it was like being on steroids that 
having glucose in your system with 

2490
01:53:31,181 --> 01:53:31,181
ketones.
It's just fucking crazy.

2491
01:53:31,181 --> 01:53:31,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

2492
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:32,520
It's,
it's,

2493
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:37,100
it's pretty amazing.
Now when you go on these fast,

2494
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:42,130
if you drink coffee,
does coffee break your fast coffee or 

2495
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:45,500
the consumption of anything from a 
circadian biology,

2496
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:47,360
right?
Twenty four hour circadian rhythm.

2497
01:53:47,361 --> 01:53:50,330
You've,
you've got multiple Circadian Rhythm Qs,

2498
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:55,660
one is movement,
so when you travel and you're jet 

2499
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,481
lagged,
movement helps you normalize your 

2500
01:53:58,481 --> 01:53:58,481
biological clock.
Another is light,

2501
01:53:58,481 --> 01:54:03,220
right,
so exposure to high amounts of morning 

2502
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:03,710
sunlight or using one of these new 
fangled hacking devices like the,

2503
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:08,740
like the light or the in Ir Light,
that's another circadian q eating or 

2504
01:54:08,931 --> 01:54:11,510
really the consumption of anything.
Supplements,

2505
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:12,500
coffee,
tea,

2506
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,930
etc.
That's also a circadian q.

2507
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:20,410
There's a researcher dr satchin panda,
who's got some really good research on 

2508
01:54:20,410 --> 01:54:24,911
circadian rhythmicity and what he says 
is that the consumption of anything can 

2509
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:28,040
disrupt circadian biology.

2510
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:32,420
If you're fasting for the purposes of 
regulating your circadian rhythms,

2511
01:54:32,421 --> 01:54:35,000
maybe you've got insomnia,
poor sleep patterns,

2512
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:40,240
inflammation due to lack of sleep or 
lack of the glymphatic drainage and 

2513
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:42,620
consolidation of memory and everything 
that occurs during deep sleep.

2514
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,630
Your sleep is more or less fucked up,
right?

2515
01:54:44,631 --> 01:54:49,631
Like that would be a situation in which 
you just wouldn't want to eat anything 

2516
01:54:49,631 --> 01:54:53,950
during a fast.
But if you're fastest for the purposes 

2517
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:56,561
of,
let's say like fat loss or even some of 

2518
01:54:56,561 --> 01:54:56,570
you know,
like the endogenous stem cell production

2519
01:54:56,571 --> 01:55:01,571
benefits of fasting and a caloric cup of
coffee is not going to cause any issues.

2520
01:55:02,001 --> 01:55:07,001
And furthermore,
if you're concerned about like the 

2521
01:55:07,001 --> 01:55:08,921
cholesterol is in the coffee,
use the paper filter because you're 

2522
01:55:08,921 --> 01:55:09,710
going to filter out most of the 
cholesterol as well versus like a french

2523
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:12,080
press or you know,
or steel filter.

2524
01:55:12,081 --> 01:55:13,520
Yeah.
What about water?

2525
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:19,510
Water I think is completely allowed.
Now there are some people who do dry 

2526
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:23,801
fasting,
a that will be popular for people who 

2527
01:55:23,801 --> 01:55:26,981
have like candida or yeast or fungi.
They would claim that a moist 

2528
01:55:26,981 --> 01:55:27,410
environment would allow the bacteria to 
flourish.

2529
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:30,110
And so some of those people will do dry 
fasting.

2530
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:35,350
I know a guy who does dry fasting with 
autologous urine therapy where he does 

2531
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:37,760
dry fast in the morning,
he drinks his urine and.

2532
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:41,960
And that's some old ayurvedic cleanse 
techniQue that I,

2533
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:43,710
I don't personally,
we were trying.

2534
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:44,070
I did

2535
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,840
Try it.
It,

2536
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:45,890
I try to do it.
Yeah.

2537
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:48,690
It doesn't make sense.
It's not sort of the best.

2538
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:53,750
Yeah,
actually the temperature got to me more 

2539
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:54,180
than the taste,
just like the warm hotness,

2540
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:57,960
just it felt from the tactile to alive.
Yeah,

2541
01:55:57,961 --> 01:55:59,460
it was just,
it was.

2542
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:05,350
So ultimately the coffee is not an issue
unless you're putting a bunch of stuff 

2543
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:05,350
in it.
Right.

2544
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:10,190
and then even though it is admittedly 
noninsulin agentic and it's actually 

2545
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:11,520
quite a kick in the pants,
as you know,

2546
01:56:11,521 --> 01:56:13,050
you know when you blend fats with 
coffee,

2547
01:56:13,051 --> 01:56:14,800
you get the cough,
a stall on the hallway,

2548
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:18,090
all they cross the blood brain barrier,
they amp you up psychologically.

2549
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:23,510
You're also getting.
Your body has to burn those calories 

2550
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:23,510
before it burns a lot of its own 
calories.

2551
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:26,080
So that's not something you would do.
You would do well on a facet.

2552
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:28,470
Stayed bent.
I to wrap this up,

2553
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:29,500
you,
uh,

2554
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,810
you're always a minD.
Fuck dude.

2555
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:35,870
Every time you come in here I have to 
pauSe after the podcast and try to like 

2556
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:38,790
capture little bits of information.
Now.

2557
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:42,030
That's pretty much my main takeaway from
the Past couple of hours as I want.

2558
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:47,120
I want to freaking steak,
tell people how they can get to your 

2559
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:50,361
website.
Tell people how they can watch your 

2560
01:56:50,361 --> 01:56:50,361
videos.
Go read this article.

2561
01:56:50,361 --> 01:56:50,361
I just.
It's.

2562
01:56:50,361 --> 01:56:52,020
It's good.
Ben greenfield fitness.com,

2563
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:57,230
or just google.
Ben greenfield and social media has ben 

2564
01:56:57,230 --> 01:56:58,650
greenfield.
You just look,

2565
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:03,680
there's not a lot of us.
Benjamin greenfields out there and find 

2566

the benjamin greenfield.
You're bad,

2567
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:04,710
motherfucker.
Appreciate man.
