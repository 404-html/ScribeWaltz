1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,360
Fuck is going on.
Everybody.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,290
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by audible.com

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,740
audible.com who has been one of the
longest running podcast sponsors is uh,

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,400
the best resource for
audio entertainment online.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,050
It's a fantastic website and they have
over a hundred thousand different titles

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,700
and it's audio books, it's podcasts, it's,

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,890
they have comedy,

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,920
it's just hundreds of thousands of
different titles and it's all just

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,180
entertainment that you can listen to while
you're in traffic while you're on the

10
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,440
subway,
while you're on a plane all the times.

11
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:48,120
That would generally just be a big fat,
stupid waste of time.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,600
You can actually enjoy the shit out of
him with audible.com and if you go to

13
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,360
audible.com forward slash Joe,

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,640
you can get one free audio book and
30 free days of audible service.

15
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,740
As you can see, there are
pals, opie and Anthony,

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,690
they have their episodes available on
audible.com they've got old lectures,

17
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:11,550
they've got like really interesting,
cool shit, comedy specials, you know,

18
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:15,720
a audible also has that whisper sync
application that I've talked about before.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,650
But quite honestly, I've never
used it. I just heard it's awesome.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,850
I have a regular one I can't have,
I'm too fucking add.

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,440
When I put my shit on an audio, like if,
uh, if I, uh, if I'm actually reading,

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,680
I have to have it on something
that I can only read a book on.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,830
And those kindle fire,
HDX, those are pretty dope.

24
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,740
They do a lot of different shit
that you can watch movies on them,

25
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,290
you can get online with them.
It's like an iPad essentially.

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,710
And I cannot be having one of those.
I'm just, I just fucking, I'll just,

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,660
I'll screw off.
So I've never tried it.

28
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,670
But if you are a person who
has more control than I do,

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,090
the kindle fire HD has a
thing called whisper sync.

30
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:54,000
And what it is is you read the book at
night or whenever you want to and then

31
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,080
when you get in your car,

32
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,710
it will literally pick up the audio
book right where you left off the book.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,130
It's incredible.
Like it,

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,950
it knows where you're reading ends and
that's where the actor will pick up and

35
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,870
reading the book.
It's really fucking cool.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,790
audible.com forward slash Joe and
get yourself a free audio book.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,810
We're also brought to you by on
[inaudible] dot com that's o,

38
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:20,760
n n I t if you have never heard of on it
on it is essentially what I would call

39
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:23,700
a human optimization website.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,010
We sell you cool shit that's good for you.

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,510
Cool Shit like kettle
bells and battle ropes and,

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,590
and even ones that are artistic.

43
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,920
We have kettle bells like the primal
bells that are designed in the form of

44
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:39,600
different apes and the new Zombie
bells that y'all self explanatory.

45
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,220
They're all zombies.
Uh,

46
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,780
the idea being that we
are all children and uh,

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,180
we have never grown up and it's not
happening now. Bitches too late.

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,060
Missed the boat, missed the boat
on growing up. I liked zombies.

49
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:55,610
I don't give a fuck if
I'm almost 50. I care. No,

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,010
I like what I like enlarge handles
for grip and these kettlebells,

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,090
they're also balanced 3d balance.
We had it,

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,870
we made sure that there were functional,
not just cool looking,

53
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,400
but they are definitely that
we sell basically functional
strength equipment and

54
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:13,180
a lot of really cool supplements.
The supplements all, um,

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,220
they're all the very best as far as
ingredients, as far as the dosages,

56
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,320
as far as the purity of the
best stuff that we can find.

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,340
And we tried to sell it to you as
ethically as possible. In fact,

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,640
when you buy supplements from on it
and like Alpha brain or shroom tech,

59
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,000
there is a 30 pill,
90 day money back guarantee.

60
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,720
You don't even have to return the product.
It just, it just say this stuff sucks.

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,200
You get your money back.
We are banking on the fact that a,

62
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:42,640
it's the best stuff that does work and
there's science behind it and all of its

63
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,700
explained that on at.com if you
go peering around, but that we,

64
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,930
we want you to give you stuff that
you're actually going to enjoy,

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,140
so you're going to want to buy it again.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,050
No one wants bad relationships with
people that feel like they got ripped off.

67
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,884
So we're trying,

68
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,010
we're trying to eradicate that as much
as possible by just selling you the best

69
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,890
shit we can find and if we don't think
it's good, we don't sell it. If we,

70
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,610
and if we try it and like, you know what,
this isn't working for me or is this,

71
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,940
this isn't getting good feedback
from people, we would get rid of it.

72
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:10,150
We would never put anything up there
that we haven't already been using

73
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,510
ourselves.
That's the whole idea behind it.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,630
Room checks for sport has changed my
life and the gym. It's fantastic stuff.

75
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,610
Tremendous. And I was
scared at first. I was like,

76
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,080
am I getting a fucking audit tac?

77
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,580
And then I found that it just pumped
blood red blood cells and t it just helps

78
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,610
the blood optimization.
Fucking great oxygen.

79
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,260
I'm 300 pounds and I bounce and I
go to kickboxing so it works well.

80
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:36,100
It gives you a little extra pump is what
us a little extra pick me up. It's a,

81
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:40,230
it's got cordyceps mushroom and vitamin B,
12 in it and a quarter step.

82
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:43,880
Some mushroom is a mushroom
that the Chinese Olympic
team first started using to,

83
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,070
uh,
kick people's asses.

84
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:49,660
They found the supplement that a mushroom
that gives you more endurance and it's

85
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:53,410
noticeable. It's a real feeling.
And I also think it's very legal.

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,340
There's vitamin B 12 in it as well.
Um, you can see there the ingredients.

87
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:59,380
If you're watching this episode,
which most people don't,

88
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,150
there's a lot of antioxidants as well,

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,840
and two different types of cordyceps
mushrooms. And that is the, uh,

90
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:09,100
the magic mushroom that is, uh,
very bioavailable. We find the, the,

91
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,780
the best form of it. We actually
get it from caterpillars. They,

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,290
they grow it on Caterpillar somehow
or another. I don't understand it.

93
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:20,890
That's cool. It's beyond my stupid
brain. But it's good for you on a.com.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,780
O.
N N I t use the code name,

95
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,680
Rogan save 10% off any
and all supplements jihad.

96
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:29,680
My Friends Joey Diaz
is here praise owed and

97
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,260
the Joe Rogan experience.

98
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,960
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

99
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,410
Good googly Mooglie. Joey Diaz. What's
up? Beautiful. Good googly Moodley.

100
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,900
We, uh, we did find the origin of
great googly Mooglie w what was it?

101
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,030
It was like from 19, it was
the great, it was great.

102
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:59,150
Googly [inaudible] was the first
one and it was from like the 1970s.

103
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,770
Do you remember where you heard it?
I heard it from a kid from North Carolina.

104
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,090
Where's all the marine station in North
Carolina? Uh, love of based. That was,

105
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:11,120
that's what he was from.
He grew up there like he was a,

106
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,050
and he used to always know that I bring
up a big rocket Cokie go good googly

107
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,910
Mowgli. He was with, with a North
Carolina accents. Zappa, isn't it? Yes,

108
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,990
it's from Frank Zappa. It's great. Googly
Mooglie. It's from the Frank Zappa song.

109
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,490
Nannuki rubs it.

110
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,380
1974 74.
Huh?

111
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,780
Have you ever put Frank Zappa?
Huh?

112
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,560
With that fucking band like Frank's
garage and that's really good man.

113
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,650
They were weird. Fucking crazy.
Like after a while you're like,

114
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,450
I can't do this no more.

115
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,380
But one of the best drummers that we
have today originated from that band.

116
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:48,400
He created missing persons,
him and his wife daily.

117
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,130
Terry Bozzio who was in
playboy. Wow. Who gives a fuck.

118
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,980
I found out about Frank
Zappa from my friend Tom.

119
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,690
I was probably like 10 or 11 years
old and uh, I had this one friend,

120
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,400
he's a weird kid and his dad was weird
as fuck. His Dad was a super hippie man.

121
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,600
He drove a sob.

122
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,530
I'll never forget that his dad had this
like really weird car where the fucking

123
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:14,420
key was on the floor.
You ever see a sob police cars in Aspen,

124
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:18,560
Colorado? Are they really?
That's what they drive. And
Aspen south. It makes sense.

125
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:21,610
I bet. I bet those things drive
really fuck goodness. No, they're,

126
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,150
they're made by an aviation company. Like
was initially an ADHD still out there.

127
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,950
I think
they have a weird body style.

128
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,480
They're very weird. But you know
by the a insignia, Saab has a very,

129
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,640
can you pull it up Brian?

130
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,920
There's someone who's trying
not to look flashy on purpose.

131
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,670
It's like a car that you can get when you
know it's a really well engineered car

132
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,460
but it's,
that's a non flashy car.

133
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:51,461
Like a Saab is like an under the radar
sorta like really nice high end car stops

134
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:56,510
actually closed down. There were
one of the dealers done. Oh No,

135
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,090
they went under when uh,

136
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,910
nobody was buying them it Tufts sell well,

137
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,440
they have that reputation of being ugly,
fucking ugly.

138
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,250
They're these ugly understating
really well engineered by Cadillac.

139
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,460
He wanted to like recently
the worst way way.

140
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,170
When you're Cuban, that's
success. Why don't you buy it?

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,050
Because when I mentioned
it on the podcast,

142
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,270
fucking service writers that work at
Cadillac places where secretly emailing me

143
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,990
going don't, oh no. It to paint this bad.

144
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,020
No problem with this. I mean so many.
This, how long ago was this really mean?

145
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:38,000
Should go, yeah, the
CTSV just one car. The,

146
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,090
I don't know but took a cow like
people hit me up going to dog.

147
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,040
Just move on because maybe the, I live
in service, maybe you know that now.

148
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,430
That's the heavy duty one, which I didn't
care cause I would lease them. She,

149
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,880
I like leasing cars cause you get much
more of a car for your money if you don't

150
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:55,620
have money. That's what you do. Your
lease up fucking car. Especially.

151
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,670
The reality is cars are good
for a few years. Then we

152
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,830
get rid of him before anything goes wrong.

153
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,450
I wish got so I was leaning towards the
Cadillac. I drove it. I fucking love that.

154
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:10,370
Just can't get it that minute.
You want to cry like you pick a scar face.

155
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,420
Then when they showed up with
the Cadillac, what did he
say to her? Cadillac? Yeah,

156
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,480
the Cuban. No Real Cuban
man. When I saw that I go,

157
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,510
they had a really good consultant.
Listen, you need a Cadillac in your life.

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,080
You understand what he's telling me?
This makes me think you need to get,

159
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,320
I was so sad when the service
writers talked me out of it.

160
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,210
I want to buy American.
Fuck those.

161
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,780
I want to do all this shit and
then I went on the Subaru thing.

162
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,030
I've had three supers. I go,
it's time to get something else,

163
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,110
but Subaru sold me with the fucking
free service, I think. Got You.

164
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:43,920
Were free service. Customer
satisfaction. That's customers.

165
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,080
I always say in the next couple of years,

166
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:49,050
everybody's going to have a good product.
It's going to be so competitive,

167
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:52,350
so how people are going to beat
you out is by customer service.

168
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,850
You know you go to a four seasons hotel
in Denver and the one in Chicago is two

169
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,684
big differences.

170
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,200
Then you go to that Harley Davidson hotel
that you took me to them. No walkie.

171
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,420
That's one of the best hotels around.

172
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,720
You can't stay still in that hotel
without somebody coming up to you going,

173
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,260
can I get your water? Can I get your
menu? You need a ride and you're like,

174
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:14,070
what the fuck? It's all cut salt.
When I found out that about Subaru,

175
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,430
that's what made me go back to the
Subaru. I see. Because it's free.

176
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,880
It's free service now.
I still got to pay for brakes and tires,

177
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:25,410
but all I got to do is bring it in for
the 1500 we're going to for 3,500 right.

178
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:30,100
I see what you're saying, man. I don't
know Joey. I still really please.

179
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,470
I was getting goddamn kind of a white
one. No, you haven't gotten it yet? No,

180
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:37,920
I got the Subaru, the new Subaru
last week. You did. So you're done.

181
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,360
I want them done it. Uh, okay. So we, we,
there's no sense in talking about this.

182
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:46,230
Good luck with the Subaru. Oh, I love it.
You don't meet them. At least it's up.

183
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,490
Dude.
If you decided to go second car Super Bar,

184
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,730
If you do that one day, which I can
see in the Joey Diaz future for sure.

185
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,480
Second car Superbowl, you're getting to
Goddamn Cadillac. Okay. Got It. Got It.

186
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,390
Sits is passion. If you enjoy it. Look,

187
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,240
I had a Mustang gt 500 and
it was a piece of shit.

188
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,010
I'm going to be honest with you. It's like
a new one. Yeah. This is a problem. Yeah,

189
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,780
it's, it's got, I had a 2010 and um,
there was a lot of issues with the car.

190
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,830
Like as far as like the way it would
drive, it's because of the rear axle.

191
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,780
They've got a what's
called a library or axle.

192
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,310
It's like a big fat log on the end that
connects to two tires. It's just not the,

193
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:25,590
uh, the, the optimum setup. And
like when you drive it around in it,

194
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:28,770
there's a lot of body flax cause it was
a convertible better than the previous

195
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,850
years, but still you could, it felt like
uneasy when you're driving it. That said,

196
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,620
I had more fun in that car.
Then I think any car I've had,

197
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,000
like I've ever owned ever,

198
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,470
because it was so stupid because it was
so loud and it was so fun and I was like,

199
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:47,310
Holy Shit, I'm driving around in a
fucking Mustang. You know, it was fun.

200
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,450
It was like there's something to that,
like maybe the bill quality's not as nice,

201
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,020
but what's the philosophy?
The car and we'll the,

202
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,330
the Shelby,
the philosophy was,

203
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,610
let's take something that
doesn't make any fucking sense.

204
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:01,600
Let's take way more power than anybody
needs. Slapping it in his fucking car,

205
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:06,310
put a crazy exhaust on it, make it
such as it burns rubber and every gear,

206
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:11,110
anytime you want. It's a retarded car.
And when you have something like that,

207
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,920
it's you know,
it's all for fun when you're driving.

208
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,110
If you're trying to fucking
Cadillac CTSV these goddamn things.

209
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,670
Beat Ferrari's and drag
races, horsepower, ridiculous.

210
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,870
It's in the 500 Oh, it's ridiculous.
I'll tell. I'll tell you exactly.

211
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,520
It's a ridiculously fast car.
They're,

212
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:31,600
they're one of the most powerful
a sedans that you can buy today.

213
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,190
Do they go zero to 60

214
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,640
I drove and I drove the one under that.

215
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,350
I'm not going to lie that and
drive the CV XD with all of them.

216
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,430
Jesus Christ, less than four seconds.
They go zero to 60 in 3.9 seconds.

217
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:47,640
556 horsepower. That's insane. How bad.

218
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,370
There's life in the service department.

219
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,620
Seriously.
How bad is it?

220
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,390
How bad is on when they can't fix your
fucking car and you only had one car and

221
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,830
I were just going through it.
I'm looking at,

222
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,980
yeah. Yeah. The good thing
is is that that some dealers,

223
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,890
depending on how old or new your cars,
they'll just give you a rental car.

224
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:07,740
Like they gave me this loaner car,
which is fine, that Volkswagen,

225
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,520
when you drive driving a
fucking fat silver cts V and
you just enjoying the shit

226
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:17,860
out of it so it breaks every
now and again. You bring it in,

227
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,160
they fix it up. When you're driving
it, you're going to enjoy it.

228
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,650
This is going to be a feeling that you
don't get when you were in that fucking

229
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:27,360
Subaru. The Subaru was reliable.
It'll get you where you want to go,

230
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,360
but it pours the piss out of you. It's
a different experience. This is Iceland.

231
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,940
It's nice,
but it's not like this crazy thing.

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,480
I grew up in Jersey and I grew up in
the metropolitan area and as you know,

233
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,120
you just grew up around people.
I went to boulder,

234
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:43,750
I went to Colorado and then really
went to Bolton when I lived in boulder.

235
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,990
I enjoy living there because
I always felt stupid.

236
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,970
I felt him securely because he's hasn't
got a big universal mark people there.

237
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,740
A lot of smart people there and I'll
tell you all those smart people,

238
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,210
I couldn't argue them out of the
Subaru. They would come like, Oh,

239
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,790
if I gave you this car, the voice, you
know, and I'd say, what about Toyota?

240
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,270
And they would say, look, a guy
in boulder, this Subaru people,

241
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,390
and it was Toyota people.
That's Toyota.

242
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,150
People that have one of those jeeps
that they don't even make. No.

243
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,430
What do they, what do they call?
They paid top dollar like people,

244
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:17,470
if you sell one with 300,000 miles,

245
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,690
some genius white dude will come to
your house and there's snow. Good.

246
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:26,170
I'm going to call looking at it and make
you a cash offer or pay you a thousand

247
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:30,810
over book. And then you're like, what
plan do you have with this? I'm sorry man,

248
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,430
I'm going rip this engine. Engina and
you're like, what do you do for a living?

249
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm an electronic engineer. I run
via electronic, whatever runners.

250
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,370
That's what they are.
No, no. The other one,

251
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,200
the one before I even make them no
more than those little ones. Yeah,

252
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,820
the old nothing.

253
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,380
Let them clinics out of anchorage because
the Land Cruiser is a land rover over

254
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,060
right.
Rover and Land Rover

255
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,940
you, it is a land cruiser. It doesn't
Land Cruiser. His Land Rover. Right.

256
00:14:55,941 --> 00:15:00,650
But the Land Rover, Land Rover, I got
confused belongs to Toyota and embolden,

257
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,720
you can't buy a new land cruiser.

258
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,900
People won't buy the new ones because
the power going to bleed hill.

259
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,980
So people are going for the old ones and
then like putting super engines in them

260
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,290
instead you fucking took them to,

261
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,100
you know they have a specialty like even
bolder had Birch Subaru is the biggest

262
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:19,340
dealer in the world.
Then number like eight is Subaru.

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,610
But they had so many
Subarus and bold with it.

264
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:26,540
You couldn't take it to the
service department or at Denver.

265
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,780
So what happened was this guy left the
Subaru Organization and opened it by Lee

266
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,870
Hill. Super Repair. That was
navy. All they did with Subarus.

267
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,440
And I used to talk to that guy
and he would talk my ear off,

268
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,860
but that dude knew about cars and
he sold me. Like he was like, look,

269
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,650
if I had $1 million, I still have
a Subaru. My parking lot wise,

270
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,550
I know I could depend.

271
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,580
He would talk to me about it like he had
been a Subaru since 1968 there's a lot

272
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:56,090
of who that is really dedicated
to those old Toyota said,

273
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,700
oh in Colorado because
they know what it is.

274
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,760
You know what it was when you went down
that hill that night with your wife.

275
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,594
You know what it's like.

276
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,310
What does those Subarus have like the
most sophisticated four wheel drive system

277
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,061
for those kinds of cars.

278
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:10,700
Like when you look at like the top
10 cars to driving in the snow,

279
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,200
at least two at a 10 where Subarus
when they had this most reason,

280
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,530
top 10 lists, they have good ground
clearance. You know, they just,

281
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,510
they just figured out
how to make a car that,

282
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,170
I mean the success is so
undeniable in Colorado.

283
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,880
You look around and you see Subarus.
Colorado is number one. I think Montana,

284
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:32,870
Wyoming, they just, people learn. They
make a living. Just on those three states,

285
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,380
Subaru makes a fortune just on three real
American states that people who moved

286
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:41,930
to New Mexico have them. The Mexico is
very sophisticated by where they ski,

287
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,570
not where they shot the longest
yard or Albuquerque. No, up more.

288
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,480
It's fucking gorgeous.

289
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,760
Like Santa Fe is that when a Santa Fe
is gorgeous but up more? Just one town.

290
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,360
Las Cruces. Las Cruces. Yeah. I
don't know that town very well.

291
00:16:56,361 --> 00:17:00,920
You were in the mountains. It's
no big. It's really beautiful.

292
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:04,040
It's a green chili on everything.
We should do a Gig in New Mexico.

293
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,200
I've never done anything in your mouth.
It's just so tough.

294
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,710
They closed the comedy club down.
I spoke to clay Weda.

295
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,590
Clay has a friend that has
a rock club in New Mexico.

296
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:17,060
We contacted them two or three times a
guys like not sold on it. He doesn't know.

297
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,420
Come on, let's do it. You and me show
there. Well, let's go do it. Let's do it.

298
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,420
We'll get the agents to
do it. Yeah, let's do it.

299
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,700
So I have to switch around to find a
place. Yeah. Whatever's the best pot.

300
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,610
Santa fe or Albuquerque has more people.
Yeah.

301
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:31,330
Albuquerque and we grind the
experts. I can trust me. And then I,

302
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:34,230
I've done research on New Mexico,
said Tate's from there instead of that.

303
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,390
You don't really want to go outside of
Albuquerque. I heard. Really? No, no.

304
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,930
Santa Fe.
Santa Fe is cream of the crop.

305
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,630
Albuquerque is bad boys,
bad boys,

306
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,310
bad boys crack. He is the
real deal though. Yeah,

307
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,910
there's a lot of that.
Diego Sanchez ain't fucking around.

308
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,660
He's down there and running shit. They
fucking drove down now. They really do.

309
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,360
They really throw down
down there. So, but uh,

310
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,680
it can be interesting just to go
down and do a fucking Nice, yeah,

311
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,030
I've never been,
I need to go.

312
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,450
There's a lot of this parts of this
country that I've never been like you ever

313
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,830
been to the Dakotas, north or South? Yes.
Did you go and see the Mount Rushmore?

314
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,880
Yes.
Really?

315
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,720
I did comedy and not
Snake River to the south,

316
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,490
which they used to have a weekend gig
there and I was Jonesing for blow and I

317
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,324
couldn't find any.

318
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,170
And I looked into the kitchen and there's
one Mexican in the fucking kitchen and

319
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:32,040
he popped out and that was the end
of that phone. Wow. That is so crazy.

320
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,340
Tribble used to have rooms. Uh,
him and his partner had rooms.

321
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,050
When I first started in north and South
Dakota and South Dakota was a little

322
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,810
dirty or I could be dirty.
It was a Friday, Saturday.

323
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:47,760
So I would drive from Colorado to snake
river, green river, something river.

324
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,860
You know what I did all through Idaho?

325
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,910
I did go one in Idaho would evil Knievel
jumped that rib snake river river.

326
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,560
You do twin falls, snake river, Boise,

327
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:02,460
American American or whatever
with an eight air force bases.

328
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,540
You do all that shit on those j Co the
potato run one and potato run to wow.

329
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,770
And you'd do everything American. What
the fuck is the Air Force Base in Idaho?

330
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,150
American home,

331
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,470
American something fucking you do
everything up there at twin falls.

332
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:22,320
I fingered a fucking Indian chick.
I told you the other day,

333
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:25,950
Yoga came out of the fucking
monkey at twin falls.

334
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,290
Fucking amazing. And she was a
real Indian, not like a, you know,

335
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,660
like not from India.
Isn't that hilarious?

336
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,250
You're saying a real Indian mean native
American. Not like a person from India,

337
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,210
which is actually an Indian.
She took,

338
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,560
you got to confuse me for one. I'm
confused too man. We're both confused.

339
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,020
Yeah. This one is a bunch of spots
and I've never been to man. Uh,

340
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,280
I don't think I've ever been in Wyoming.
Great Place. Yeah, it looks cool. Very,

341
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,290
very frigid.

342
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,000
It looks very cowboy to very
cowboyish feelings like state cowboy.

343
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,010
They keep rocking it.
You have Cheyenne.

344
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,810
I'm going to tell you something and
you're not going to believe this.

345
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,850
And you know me.
Cheyenne,

346
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:12,450
Wyoming at some of the best Chinese
food I have rated my fucking life in the

347
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,280
states. Well, I believe you, man.

348
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,320
I used to drive from boulder on
Fridays to Cheyenne, Wyoming.

349
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:21,840
It was a 45 minute drive and I get shrimp
and lobster sauce and I'd get there

350
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:25,020
and I'd see 20 other New
Yorkers standing out there.

351
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,250
I don't know what this guy did.

352
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,050
Every New Yorker in Wyoming would
drive to this place on Fridays.

353
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:32,550
He's guy with cooked shrimp,
a lot of stuff. Uh, pork,

354
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,800
fried rice and an that
grow and it was delicious.

355
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,650
Did you ever see that episode
of Anthony Bourdain's show? Uh,

356
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,580
no reservations when he went to
Wyoming? Oh No, it wasn't Wyoming.

357
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,770
I'm confusing with Montana.
Montana is great too. Dog,
but that's fucking weather.

358
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,763
Yeah.
Oh Dude.

359
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,380
I camped there in October, in late
October. And how was it was terrible.

360
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,310
It was freezing.
It was fun though.

361
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,340
It was fun because it was something
new and something different. You know,

362
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,210
it's relatively safe as far as like
mountain lions go, there's no bears.

363
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:04,240
You don't have to worry about that.
So it was killed cold as fuck.

364
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:09,010
But relatively safe.
Montana is like,

365
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,350
it's still cowboy country. I mean it's,
it's really fascinating to speed limits.

366
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,230
Still crazy up there. Well, they didn't
have any speed limit for the longest time,

367
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,450
but the federal government
was like, listen, fuck off.

368
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,600
If you want any money at all from us,

369
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,640
you're going to put up
a fucking speed limit.

370
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:29,200
I remember there was those buoys to do
like 99 I had a buddy, Steve Graham,

371
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:33,990
Dr Steve, Dr Steve Lived in Montana. I
was 75 against fucking pedal it, but wow.

372
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,900
I used to fucking pedal up there,
fucking crank it to the,

373
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,970
it's basically the Autobahn billings.

374
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:44,350
Montana used to have like thinking about
holiday. Yeah. Once you pulled off,

375
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:46,150
it was right in the middle of town.
The Circle.

376
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,930
They still do call me their seats
200 it's a bar that stays in a hotel,

377
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:54,490
but I did that for triple
thousands of times. Oh,

378
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,590
I had the billings has a good vibe.

379
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,550
Collin and I landed and billings and we
had dinner in billings there the final

380
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,900
night and it seems like real nice,
real nice.

381
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,220
That's a place where you go where you
just don't want to move into Montana.

382
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:11,410
I'm gonna raise my kids.
What man? There's a,

383
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,060
there's a something about the people
that live that close to nature saying,

384
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:18,490
I felt the same way about anchorage.
You been in Alaska,

385
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,370
Goddamn anchorage is one of the
coolest places in the world.

386
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,480
There's something about being that close
to nature. It's like the people or more,

387
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,200
I want to say humble.
I want to say they're more grounded.

388
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,220
They're more grounded by whether they're
more grounded by just the intense

389
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:37,540
connection they have to nature. I mean
fucking eagles are everywhere up there.

390
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,490
I mean they see eagles all the time.

391
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,300
I saw like three or four eagles
while I was there. Like you,

392
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,910
you know what it's like to go 45 years
of your life. Never seen a fucking eagle,

393
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,610
and then all of a sudden you see a gang
of them. You're like, there's an eagle.

394
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,700
That's another eagle. One would fly
overhead. You're like, Holy Shit.

395
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:54,880
Look at the size of that fucking thing.
You see Moose up there.

396
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,050
We saw five Moose in two days.
Ari Shaffir and I did five Moose.

397
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,220
We caught these giant salmon that had come
out of the ocean and you know they're,

398
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:08,170
they're, they're, they're fucking swimming
up river to hatch and shit. We caught,

399
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,770
it was like we were just in
a real piece of wilderness.

400
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:16,000
We had to look out for bears. You have
to keep an eye out for fucking bears.

401
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,330
Joey Diaz.
It's the weirdest place ever.

402
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,910
But the Papel uh, we were not, no, we
didn't have anything other fish drink one.

403
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:28,720
Did you cook it right up? We
did one good. Oh, delicious man.

404
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,820
Delicious. We, most of
what we, uh, we caught,

405
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,790
we had to release that day because
of, uh, the numbers of the salmon.

406
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,270
We're it all depending on how many,
how many fish come through.

407
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,030
Like if they only have like
20 fish come through in a day,

408
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,930
they shut down the ability to
catch the fish and uh, keep them.

409
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,130
You have to catch and release.

410
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:53,840
But we caught one that was a rainbow
trout and a rainbow trout was,

411
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,620
oh my God, it was delicious. It was
so, because it's so fresh. I mean,

412
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:01,580
you're getting it like right from
this river. Oh, it's just the, this,

413
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:05,990
the majesty of that place, man. It's
incredible. It's, it's so, it's so weird.

414
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,860
It's so weird being up there because you
realize that this is how these people

415
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:13,580
live and it's so far removed from
anything you would experience in La.

416
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,930
Except I got to tell you some shit that
went down last night, man, listen to this.

417
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,400
You know I have chickens,
right?

418
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,570
So I go outside to shut the light out in
the chicken coop and the chickens, uh,

419
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,980
we keep the light on during the winter
months inside for a couple extra hours is

420
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:31,670
that they lay more eggs, they lay less
eggs when it starts getting darker.

421
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,600
And we were like, fuck you bitch, go
back to work, make some eggs. So anyway,

422
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:40,601
I go out to shut the light off and I
hear fucking running like a big heavy

423
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:45,800
animal running and it's,
I don't know what it is,

424
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,850
but I know it's big and I hear
but bone but up, up alone,

425
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,810
but a problem running through the grass.

426
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,690
And then I hear another one
chasing it and it's dark out,

427
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,780
but I'm near the hill and on the sea I
can see the silhouettes on the top of the

428
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:01,460
hill.
So as these things are running by,

429
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:04,430
I'm seeing them running by and I
don't know what the fuck it was.

430
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:06,740
I'm assuming that it was a deer.

431
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,830
This being chased by either
a coyote or a mountain lion.

432
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,860
If I was going to be my
on the fantastic side,

433
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:16,460
I'd lean towards the mountain line cause
I heard more than one heavy animal and

434
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:20,240
he could be that. There was just two
deer that were running away from some,

435
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,950
some coyotes we showing us here I, this
is fox in the chicken coop at night. Uh,

436
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,440
well they weren't trying to get in the
chicken coop. That's not what I'm saying.

437
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,710
They were, there's something was
chasing after this deer. It was,

438
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,420
these deer were running man.

439
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,250
They were running up hill full clip
and you could hear the trampling on the

440
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:38,930
ground and fucking leaves.

441
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:41,390
We're kicking up and it was no
more than a hundred feet from me.

442
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,440
So it was like some real live national
geographic shit cause whatever the fuck

443
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:49,490
that animal was was, it was running.
That's a least a 70 80 pound animal.

444
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,690
It was a big deer. It was a regular
size deer. It wasn't like a baby.

445
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,720
Whatever it is.
It was right.

446
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,920
I mean I'm saying I'm being real
conservative by saying seven.

447
00:25:56,921 --> 00:26:00,280
It was probably a hundred pound deer.
So as it's running, but I'll put it on,

448
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,310
put it on pro. Did you hear this
other footsteps? And I'm looking at,

449
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,580
they all just ran by me, ran
by me, ran by me. And then um,

450
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,710
I did see a coyote,
a silhouette of a coyote on the horizon.

451
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,430
So it could have been the coyotes that
we're changing and the big animals could

452
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:19,850
have all just been deer.
Hard to tell because it was so dark out.

453
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:21,800
And I think what I saw was a coyote.

454
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,520
It was so hard to tell because
it was really dark and you know,

455
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,840
there was a little bit of moonlight
out in a little bit of lights from some

456
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,010
street lights and shit.

457
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,330
But it was just so freaky to see some
life and death shit taking place a hundred

458
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,530
feet from you. Just randomly. Like I
just randomly walked into a fucking gang,

459
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,270
hit an animal gang,

460
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:41,680
hit these fucking gangs at coyotes
or whatever the fuck it was.

461
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,350
One mountain line or the coyotes were
trying to kill someone that lives in the

462
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:49,360
neighborhood and eat them.
You need to get some night vision son,

463
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,480
get like a Sony camcorder
by the back door.

464
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,880
What I need to do is
get some game cameras.

465
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,110
They have game cameras that will go off
when they detect motion, you know, and uh,

466
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,670
we actually use them when we're
hunting big foot unsuccessfully.

467
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,480
But we did get a picture of an elk,
but that's what they're for. You know,

468
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,220
I would love to have seen
what the fuck it was.

469
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:12,210
Could you imagine if I had a cool video
of a mountain lion chasing down a deer

470
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,380
or even a pack of coyotes chasing
down a deer? Somebody's byline,

471
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,520
but obviously it'd be cooler,

472
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,720
but somebody was chasing a deer and I
was watching it all happen. It was nuts.

473
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,440
It was really freaky. Like, cause
it was a hundred feet from me.

474
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,600
[inaudible] problems, just fucking things
running behind like, Whoa, this is,

475
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,230
you know,

476
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,870
this is not what you expect to go out
to check and see if the chickens light's

477
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:37,980
still on. Yeah, it's
intense. It's pretty intense.

478
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,930
All that shit. I love it. I would shit
my fucking, I don't mind seeing that.

479
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,740
We were talking about that show the
at night for the most part it's you're

480
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:47,400
pretty safe.

481
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,400
It's just interesting as fuck that we
were discussing like Jira was that's found

482
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:57,470
the Moose and skin that took the liver
cause she was anemic and then they showed

483
00:27:57,471 --> 00:28:01,590
the other guy walking from his house
until the wilderness eating fucking weeds

484
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,810
were a little bit of a food.

485
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,690
I mean they had like four
different stories going at once.

486
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:10,260
That was the most interesting shit I've
seen as a reality show in 20 fucking

487
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:12,990
years. It's a very interesting
show because it's not fake either.

488
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,540
They're not faking anything like,
oh no,

489
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,520
I lost my light or how I'm
going to say no, they're not.

490
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,510
They're not doing any of that.

491
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,420
The actual life itself that these people
living up there is so intense that it's,

492
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:27,180
it's worth just paying them to show
life below zero. Absolutely. Yeah.

493
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,810
To me it's one of the best of those
reality shows. I like the Alaska,

494
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,470
the last frontier.
That's another really good

495
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,500
families that are the
homesteading up there. And, uh,

496
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,680
that's a really fascinating show
because they seem like really,

497
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:41,940
really nice people.

498
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,320
Really cool like salt of the earth people
that are lit up there in Alaska and

499
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,690
like,
no one's a shithead Alaska.

500
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:52,590
The last frontier is the only show I've
ever seen on reality TV where there's no

501
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:56,370
enemy. Every person on
that show is a good person.

502
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,770
They're all very nice and very friendly.

503
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,350
They all seem to have a good sense of
humor. They seem to get along great.

504
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:05,040
They seem to be good natured. They seem
to all be hardworking. No one's lazy.

505
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,060
Everyone does their part,

506
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,680
but all they're doing their whole life
is stockpiling food and getting ready for

507
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:15,630
the big freeze. And it
fucking catches them for eight
months. So for eight months,

508
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,000
you can barely get around.
You could barely do anything.

509
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:22,710
It's fucking freezing for eight months.
So the four months outside of that,

510
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,300
it's all about gathering food.

511
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,420
So the whole show is about these people
catching fish or shooting a moose and

512
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,830
cutting it up or shooting a bear.

513
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,860
They're getting their food
entirely from the land.

514
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,670
I watched the episode with the White
Dude with the Indian wife and she's got

515
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:43,750
like dude with an Indian
wife and she's got what he,

516
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,730
she's got like three or four
kids. Oh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll,

517
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,940
I'll girls and a couple of boys and
they show them getting out of the boat.

518
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,660
She's an Eskimo, right?
She's said that's a good one.

519
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,050
Where they showed him setting up the
net so when the salmon come through that

520
00:29:58,051 --> 00:30:00,510
could get them.
That was as interesting as I ever saw.

521
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,590
What was the most interesting?
So I mean,

522
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:05,560
not setting up the nuts was that they
involve the whole fucking family.

523
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,860
Everybody had where everybody was working,
everybody was wet,

524
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:13,600
fucking cut knives and trees and sweeping.
So that really fucking was like,

525
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:18,060
wow, that little kids had big ass
fucking kitchen. Don't have a job. Fish.

526
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,790
They have a job. Oh yeah,
like nothing. I'd be puking
at that fucker. It's intense.

527
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,480
It's intense. Yeah. And you know, I
thought that, ask him, I was a bad word.

528
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,280
I thought they decided that.
Ask Him I was bad.

529
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:30,390
And you're supposed to say [inaudible],
but she calls herself an Eskimo.

530
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,790
So I dunno. I Dunno. What's
the politically correct.

531
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,440
I'm fucked up Indian ESKIMO. Well,
it's not that far removed. You know,

532
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:40,090
that was a funny thing that came out of a,

533
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:43,090
there was a guy who was a rich dude
who was a Mormon who was absolutely

534
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:47,500
convinced that the Mormon doctrine was
true and that Joseph Campbell really was

535
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:51,010
correct, that the American Indians were
actually the lost tribes of Israel.

536
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,560
He's fucking, the dude just made shit up,
right? Joseph, that guy, Joseph Smith,

537
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,590
who created Mormonism is one of
the most hilarious characters.

538
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,220
And in all of recorded history when it
comes to like a guy who influenced the

539
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,810
large group of people to believe him,

540
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,110
because the stuff that he thought
was so wacky, it was so much of,

541
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:12,460
it was just so ridiculous.

542
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,540
But this was a big one that
the lost tribes of Israel
were the American Indians.

543
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,460
So this fucking guys,

544
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,460
I am going to prove that this is a true
story and the Mormon God is the only

545
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:23,450
guy,
whatever.

546
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,710
So this fucking guy spends a ton of
money to get the American Indian native

547
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:31,060
American, uh, genome identified.
It turns out they're from Siberia.

548
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,350
They all came down from the Bering strait.
Like all the native Americans, they,

549
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:40,510
they, they're very, very
similar genetically to
people that lived in Siberia.

550
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,740
It's pretty intense. We stop and
think about that, you know, I mean,

551
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,760
it's funny because there's this dummy
actually believed they were from Israel,

552
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,830
but, but it's, but it is fascinating
scientifically to think that they're all,

553
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,310
they were,

554
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,270
I love when scientists get it right
when they figured out that people walked

555
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:01,540
across the Bering strait and they made
it to North America, they're like,

556
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,760
they mapped it out there,
right? Like, yeah, look these,

557
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:06,460
you see these native Americans
there from Siberia to same folk,

558
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,870
same folk who came down that I like it
when they were right. It's fascinating.

559
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,330
It's fascinating to think that
they figured that out. You know,

560
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,170
they figured out how people got here
and who got here first is always under

561
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:20,920
debate. They're always finding some new
shit. They just found some shit in Zuni,

562
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,611
New Zealand.

563
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:26,611
They found a boat that was a a a
hundred years older than Captain Cook's.

564
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,610
So they're trying to figure out who
the fuck landed in New Zealand first.

565
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:35,410
Now imagine if he had to live back then.
Joey. Dan's traveling around by boat.

566
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,740
I could leave the fucking, have you
ever done a cruise? Do you work crews?

567
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,790
No.
Fuck working crews

568
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,780
thought about doing it back in the
day. Fuck No. In the hard times,

569
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:54,110
you wouldn't to take a good gig on a
cruise. Fuck me. Shoot me and shit.

570
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,350
I got to be in a boat talking to people.
You know what I do a show. They go,

571
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,080
I my home, I love boat. Nobody goes home.

572
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,820
Fucking cycles bumping into these
fucking knuckle heads wrapped the whole

573
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:06,320
fucking day. Hey, how you doing?

574
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,870
You're the one that insulted the
Christian God doing the afternoon.

575
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,830
I'm trying to get a son.

576
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,430
I just want to tell you that I
was offended by the captain. Yeah.

577
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:21,431
I told the captain and they should h I
was on a boat one time that big in the

578
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,150
80s. They still do. They
have a thing in New York. Uh,

579
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:28,120
the trip to nowhere and you
get on the boat six o'clock.

580
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:32,210
I know we all come to New York harbor
and they'd take you outside the city

581
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:36,260
limits and you could gam when you eat
like a big fuck the chicken the next day

582
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:38,300
he dropped you off at six in the
morning and everybody's good.

583
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,180
And I got sick for a little
while to take the pills.

584
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,800
I've been on boats like fishing boats a
lot and when I was a kid I was on every

585
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:50,420
summer and then in Miami and then I
started getting seasick when I was,

586
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:54,740
I got old. So one time I smoked
a fucking joint limitation.

587
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,640
Being seasick is bad enough.

588
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,650
Smoking weed and going on a boat on
the Jersey shore, that'll kill you.

589
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,450
What we freaking out.

590
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,920
I just went down on them but I got back
to the fucking boat and my friend kept

591
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:11,570
smoking. They joint, he's a savage, he's
out there fishing with one arm and shit,

592
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,010
smoking joints. He kept
saying to me, you're sure you
don't want to smoke anymore?

593
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,980
Cause I was out. We bought some
strong weed and Harlem. I was out.

594
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,300
It's one of the most uncomfortable things.
Yes,

595
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,830
but they'd been on a boat. Oh,
that's terrible. Something, you know,

596
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:31,370
being high and getting on
a boat or something and
something that you're not used

597
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:35,240
to. This time I got on a fucking bro.
I got an a fucking plane last week.

598
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,730
I got anxiety like a motherfucker.

599
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:40,660
When those little planes there was
a spooky spooky. Did you get out?

600
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,270
It was at a propeller one or was it
a a jet? A little jet. I didn't look,

601
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,670
I just sat there and looked straight
and sweating. Like fucking noise.

602
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,430
No, that's the one that connected fellers
Chicago to Nashville. I took it early,

603
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:58,850
early flight and I usually take
the 11 o'clock direct flight,

604
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:02,210
but I took the early flight and I want
it to Chicago and then I had a fucking

605
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:03,470
fly there and that little plane,

606
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,770
it's anxiety and they put you
in that little seat by yourself.

607
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
I was like in three Aa.
What?

608
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:14,170
It's weird that we rely on air travel to
get to do our job. But we do, you know,

609
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,480
both of us in a lot of ways.
More ways. I mean what else?

610
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,050
And people don't understand
that it's tough to travel.

611
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,950
I have just made it a simple
situation. So have you, we,

612
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,690
we've turned it into a situation that's
so not uncomfortable when you got to

613
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:32,630
make sure you don't do it too much.
That's one thing. Don't do too much.

614
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,190
You gotta know what too much is for you.

615
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,680
And if you start burning out from the
road, you got to back off. No, no, no.

616
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
I mean as far as like a planes,
like I know exactly what planes to catch.

617
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,410
Very seldom do I get delayed.
I know how to get a plane ticket now.

618
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,320
You know it first class isn't available.
I can't upgrade.

619
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:53,040
I know they get a thing for my ticket
so I could sweep to security and the

620
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:56,460
fucking whatever. Lynn, I just
put the thing in for pre Tsa.

621
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,180
Let's see if they approved me. Who the
fuck knows? It's good luck. Good luck

622
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,040
for long fucking time ago.
You know what I'm saying?

623
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,140
If you can't think of it was true,

624
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:09,570
but show the problem is people don't
look at it that way because most people

625
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,070
don't reform.
I mean,

626
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:14,340
how many people do you think that are
like hardcore criminals ever actually

627
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,520
fully reformed, kidnap and a couple
of burglaries and some drugs?

628
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,020
I ain't no terrorists.
You know what I'm saying?

629
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,570
I'm just a pimp trying to
make kids and that's it.

630
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:25,260
I ain't no fucking terrorist smell.
I see things from your perspective.

631
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,580
Clearly I love you,

632
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,970
but I also see things from the law
enforcement perspective like, hmm,

633
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,710
because this guy, I'm like,
are you fucking crazy?

634
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:35,110
He might not have ever gotten their
shit together. No, I understand.

635
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,770
But you know what I'm saying? You never
know. You never know when you have,

636
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:41,310
but I mean how many guys that we knew when
we were growing up who were criminals,

637
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,580
stayed criminals or wound
up dying. Oh No. I know.

638
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,830
Like everybody I knew
that was a crazy person.

639
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,500
Like they don't really fucking crazy.
Yeah, that was pretty fucking crazy.

640
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,220
I'm just not a criminal.
I'm still fucking up debt.

641
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,930
Do you think this because you
found an outlet in standup comedy?

642
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,130
It's just as exciting because I got
to think that a lot of the criminal

643
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:03,330
lifestyle is not just the fact
that you're trying to get by.

644
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,990
There's also a little bit of a charge
and getting away with shit. Absolutely.

645
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,760
For me, it was the charge. It was looking
at a motherfucker going to get what?

646
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,990
Not what you were talking about
all that shit. Now what? You know,

647
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:19,470
some guy run up to dog talking.
To me it was that,

648
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:24,471
but comedy outweighed the thrill of
doing that shit and more and more it just

649
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:28,170
stopped. Waited two, it became my love.
It became a passion and was like a,

650
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,840
it was like a see saw, you
know? It was like a seesaw.

651
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,050
Just kept switching and the love
kept Gretton me greater for common.

652
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:37,410
That put more emphasis on k,
you can't do comedy in jail.

653
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,200
You could do comedy here.

654
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,910
If you sit around the fucking thing
with a bunch of brothers and jump up and

655
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,470
down,
but you can't do comedy in jail.

656
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,300
Did you also start to feel like with
comedy, you know you're, you're, you're,

657
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,930
you're feeling that excitement,
but a positive result is coming out of it.

658
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:53,790
Everybody's having a good time,
you're having a good time,

659
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:56,670
they're having a good time.
No one feels bad about it after it's over.

660
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,040
Whereas when you do something criminal,

661
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,560
there's always going
to be a bit of remorse.

662
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,230
You're always gonna
think you'll justify it,

663
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,190
but there's always going to be a bit of
remorse that you've resorted to stealing

664
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:13,020
or hurting people or we all know. I think
inherently that's not the way to go. No,

665
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:13,854
but you,
you,

666
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,430
you and I are very smart in ways that
we saw something that a lot of people

667
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:21,210
didn't see. Even though we love
something you loved fighting till today,

668
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,320
you still love fighting,

669
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,850
but you thought about your life
at the age of 50 and you said,

670
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,710
I want to be able to pick up kids.

671
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:33,330
I want to be able to remember my name
and there's no, even with football now,

672
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,510
now we're seeing it more with football
with me. I know one thing for sure.

673
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,580
I know one thing for sure, and we'll sit
here too. We find me. Name me a mobster,

674
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,950
a criminal, a gangster that made
millions and then Diana can or get shot.

675
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,841
Let me tell you something.

676
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,710
There's nothing worse than living
your life like a pimp. I mean,

677
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,620
you're 51 get a knock on your
door and now when your old days,

678
00:38:56,621 --> 00:39:00,040
you've told me a thousand times
how much you fear getting older,

679
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,080
not being able to take care of yourself.

680
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,640
You think of being 50 to the feds come in,
they take everything.

681
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,110
There's nothing left after those
vultures come and they put you in a,

682
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,900
they put you in a cage and you get shitty
food and your family has to fend for

683
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,450
themselves now and they got a reputation.

684
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:17,980
Now these people can't
live in the neighborhood.

685
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,850
They can't live in a gated community.
They were married through.

686
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,170
I always knew that the end result,

687
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:26,950
I had an uncle who I loved as a kid and
I would go to Miami and my mom would

688
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:28,360
send me to Miami for a summer.

689
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,990
My mom didn't let me fucking stay
in New York those early days.

690
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:35,220
In the summer I would go to
Miami and he built the northwest.

691
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,980
He built the southwest.
He was a construction guy and he was like,

692
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:43,060
guys we grew up with, he was a heavy
guy that did the whole job himself.

693
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,960
He was the GC, he dug it, he laid the
pipe, he did the brick work, the war,

694
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,150
and he became this thing. It became a
millionaire. But you know, he used to do,

695
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:57,010
every summer he'd drive out hand and
fucking camper with his kids and stuff the

696
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:00,360
bottom with. We didn't go back to
Miami and I guess one something.

697
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,850
He shot a motherfucker and I knew
this guy. You know, when I was a kid,

698
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,170
when I was a kid at night,

699
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:09,400
he would take me and we'd go on a boat
and we'd go out to Miami and he pulled

700
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,570
him the weed and then we'd
go to a warehouse and we
dropped the weeder and we go

701
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:16,420
to the next day we'd get
back to his room of our five,

702
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,550
cause his wife and him
didn't sleep in the same bed.

703
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,000
So I would hang out with my cousins.
There were three of them,

704
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,140
and I would sleep in the room with him.
And at one after tea,

705
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,890
women in the old days, the TV shut
off at one once, mission impossible,

706
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:33,040
turning off the pledge of allegiance
came on and he would go, go, get, go,

707
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,510
get ready, and we'd get ready to go
to Lubbock. He thought like he goes,

708
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,760
those little stores in Miami that you
pull through when you buy a beer and a

709
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:42,100
thing of milk and eggs and he'd take a
beat and we drive to the boat and he'd

710
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,500
get on the boat when I
was seven and we pull out,

711
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:48,190
he pulled in the wheat and then we'd go
back and then we'd go back and the next

712
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,350
day I go play with the kids
and I couldn't say nothing.

713
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,440
And he trusted me because he knew
that I knew what my mother did.

714
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,110
But one day when I was down there,

715
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,090
one summer they knocked on his fucking
door and they arrested him and I was done

716
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,990
and I had to go home.
And then my mother told me what happened.

717
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:06,991
He shot a guy like in the sixties
and now it's the 70s and he says,

718
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,920
backing on target practicing

719
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,420
and some guy in a new development eight
miles away is walking his dog and he

720
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,160
shoots and the bullet keeps going
to hit him in the fucking leg.

721
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,880
He goes to the hospital,
they take it out, they scan.

722
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,190
It's the same bullet that shot the
guy in California 10 years earlier.

723
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,030
This motherfucking,
the height of his story with his kids,

724
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:32,860
seven to 10 has to sell everything,
move his kids to a two bedroom in Atlanta.

725
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,280
Meanwhile,
he had a house

726
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,110
like fucking, you know, 10 bedrooms.

727
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,740
He had to move his kids wetland or the
attorney had to do eight fucking years.

728
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:43,430
He came out when he was 64 and what
happens when you come out when you're 64

729
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:46,670
broke? There's nothing. He died and I,

730
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,220
last time I talked to him was
during the tornado in Miami.

731
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,140
He was living in a fucking trailer.

732
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,860
That lesson taught me right
there that that's not the way,

733
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,500
you know what I'm saying? I'd rather
have a hard life and then it gets easy.

734
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:01,610
And then when you're 60 or
70 you live like a doctor.

735
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:03,500
You want to play with your grant,
you want to look at the back.

736
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:08,330
So I saw the same future. You thought
you saw it, you saw what the ending is.

737
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:12,800
Yeah. I could end up on CBS sports,
but that's 22% of those people.

738
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,440
The other 68 whatever percentage number
is they ended up in the hospitals.

739
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,510
They can't remember that name.
You know what I'm saying? Well,

740
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,670
I was lucky that martial arts
didn't have a venue back then.

741
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,240
There wasn't a professional venue
because when I was 21 years old when I,

742
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,890
I think I had my last fight or they're
21 or 22 but I remember thinking,

743
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:31,611
where's this going?

744
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:36,611
Like they had offered me a pro kickbox
and fight for like 500 bucks or something

745
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:38,480
like that. And I was like, okay,

746
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,650
well I got to train for like six weeks
to make 500 bucks. Like that's crazy.

747
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,280
And I know that this is like,
like a first fight that it was like,

748
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:47,770
well how much the champions make.
Sorry,

749
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:51,290
I found out this kid in Rhode Island
that was the world champion and a,

750
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,430
I was asking people trains on them. I
go, is this, is this guy, is he well off?

751
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:59,600
Like how does he do? He said they got
bro, if he, he's lucky if he's lucky,

752
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:03,830
he'll make $1,000 for a fight. And I
was like, what? And they were like,

753
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,280
there's no money in this. And I was like,
okay, what am I doing? What am I doing?

754
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:10,520
I'm either going to get hit in the
head in taekwondo tournaments for free

755
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,610
because there's zero professional
outlet or I'm going to do kickboxing,

756
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,970
which I was already sort
of at a disadvantage at
because I didn't start off my

757
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,350
career kickboxing.

758
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,470
So to transition from taekwondo in the
kickboxing was going to take a little

759
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,680
while for me to really get it down. I was
getting better with my hand techniques,

760
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:29,050
but fucking headaches, man.
I would get head aches wide.

761
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:34,060
I'd lie in bed and know that my head
was throbbing because Dude's had punched

762
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,164
it.

763
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:40,790
I just had taken shots in the head and
kicks and punches and you're fucking

764
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:41,270
skulls.

765
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,540
Getting rattled around in there am
alone in my shitty apartment in Medford.

766
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,300
Lying on a mattress,
looking up at the ceiling going,

767
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:49,790
am I breaking my brain like am I,
am I,

768
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,420
am I going to irreversibly
break my brain doing this shit?

769
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,400
Training for kickboxing tournament
fighting three times in a day for nothing,

770
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,910
finding for nothing. There was no
money at all. There was no money.

771
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:04,910
I came in second place in this kickboxing
tournament, there wasn't a dime,

772
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,960
which is crazy. Violence
for free, you know,

773
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:12,530
and I thought about it and I was like,
there's only one option.

774
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:16,070
I have to get out of this for our break
myself because I can keep going and

775
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:19,010
maybe I could achieve some
goals and started school.

776
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:23,600
But I had known at that point that I
wasn't going to be a very good selective

777
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:26,390
teacher because I didn't want to
teach anybody who wasn't crazy.

778
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,310
Like if you didn't want to go to war,

779
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,960
well I'm really not
interested in teaching you.

780
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:32,790
I didn't want to do any aerobics classes.
I didn't want to.

781
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,960
I wanted to teach people who want to
learn with every ounce of their being.

782
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,960
I want to teach people who are
obsessed like I was. I'm like,

783
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:42,450
if you want to do this, you've
got to do, this is dangerous.

784
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:43,860
There's people like me out there,

785
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,910
they're going to try to kick your
fucking head off your neck for real,

786
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:50,880
and if they hit you, you're
fucked. And if you keep going,

787
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,680
you're going to wind up on the opposite
side of a ring with one of those fucking

788
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:56,514
guys,

789
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,940
and it's going to be a guy who is gonna
try to kill you and you've got to try to

790
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:01,380
kill him.
And that's the game.

791
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,690
And you want to learn that
this is what we've got to do.

792
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,220
And if you don't do it my way,

793
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,310
if you don't do it the way that I've been
taught and the way that my instructors

794
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:11,100
have been taught and the
way that everybody agrees
is the right way to do it.

795
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,980
I don't want to do it. I don't want to
hear any cramp talk. I don't want to hear,

796
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:16,440
I'm tired. I don't wanna hear
shit. I want you to keep,

797
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,100
I want you to force your body to work.
And if you can't do that, we can't talk.

798
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,370
That's terrible for business.
I didn't want to advertise.

799
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:24,510
I didn't want to put up fliers.

800
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:28,430
I only wanted to get the
hardest core dudes and women
that were willing to fight.

801
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:31,980
One of my best students was a chick
that I started out from a white belt and

802
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:36,540
broader all the way up to a really strong
blue bell about to get her red belt,

803
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:40,510
which is right before black and
talk window and she was bad ass man.

804
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:45,510
I taught her from white belt onto a
onto like the into higher ranks and she

805
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:50,070
would just dominated tournament's
man. His chick was crazy. She was,

806
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:53,070
but she absorbed it. She was
like a sponge. She would come in,

807
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:56,850
there'd be all these hardcore people
training and she just got right into the

808
00:45:56,851 --> 00:46:00,960
mindset. All these people that have
trained with me and that were ahead of me,

809
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:05,100
like my friends like Leroy Rodriguez and
Larry Jones and all these like the top

810
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:06,360
level national black belts,

811
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,080
all lived in this Boston area and they
would all train together and come down.

812
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:12,690
We would train with each other and
bring students in and the ones that were

813
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:16,860
obsessed, man, they were fun. The ones who
really wanted to get better, they just,

814
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,800
you could see them just with
every technique they through.

815
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:22,110
They got a little bit better
at it every fucking day.

816
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:25,920
That got a little bit better and you see
them stretching and working on it and

817
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,670
it's an exciting, but then if you see
someone who's like half ass in it,

818
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,500
it's brutal. It's hard. I can't
do it. I can't, I can't, you know,

819
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,590
if they're not totally into it,
I completely understand.

820
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,590
But I don't want to be teaching you.
You have to be a crazy person.

821
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,970
If you're a crazy person,
I'll teach you

822
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,080
out of the corner.
For me,

823
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:45,600
there's a show to come of school
and I go for walks at night.

824
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,050
I like going to that
Watson 13 to 15 year old,

825
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:51,960
I realized how many was
that waste doing cottage,

826
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,920
how many fucking I was that way.

827
00:46:55,921 --> 00:47:00,660
That's a big point of controversy in
the martial arts community. Cod is,

828
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,580
and you know what I got
good at when I was a kid,

829
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:05,760
I would go to those dumb tournament's
in New York and I won first place in

830
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:08,440
college. But in those days there
was no full contact. There was oh,

831
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,650
semi contact from the waist
down, you know, for the waste.

832
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,260
And I would always get
disqualified for punching.

833
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,550
Everybody does that then. Yeah, then I
go home late. Fucking cod is did we do,

834
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,190
because now if you know the Catia,
they'll promote you.

835
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,380
It's not like it was that then as well.
It's not that in Jujitsu. No, no, no.

836
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:32,910
It's uh, it's, that's how I got my
first strike when you just seven months.

837
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,760
It took me seven months dog,
but I did it and I'm just doing G.

838
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:39,100
I'm horrible at them. No. Geetha
[inaudible] hey, it's fine.

839
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,840
You just getting to enjoy the
actual numbers. I swung on people.

840
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,010
I fucking, you already have a
lot of knowledge, man. You know,

841
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,250
you have more than the average person in
the conversations you've had with Eddie

842
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:55,000
and with Michelle talks talking,
he's one of the best in the world.

843
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,160
He's one of the best
instructors in the world.

844
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:59,110
I'm just show the way
he breaks things down.

845
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,140
I'm so bad at the Noguchi
and grabbing people's neck.

846
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,820
I got bits pro and I get rid of this
time and if you lose more weight,

847
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:09,580
the more weight you lose, the
ability to get. Yeah, you just,

848
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,520
let me tell you something got melt
off being in shape and there's been in

849
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:17,200
Jujitsu shape, I can't go more
than twice a week. It destroys me.

850
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:21,760
So I tried to go on Tuesdays, on
Thursday days, the guys a, I go to v Mac,

851
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,790
but it's a John jock school.
I wanted to keep it in the family.

852
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,390
It's in north Hollywood.
It said John Jack Black Belt Marcello,

853
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:31,870
but they have a could bring your black
belt that teaches a purple about and he's

854
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:33,490
fucking tremendous. Joe Rogan, you know,

855
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:38,440
I've always been a fan of just straight
Jiu Jitsu. I liked the UFC, but for me,

856
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:40,090
I love watching these videos.

857
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,300
I've watched that Brazil video probably
easy 500 times for the last two years.

858
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:51,000
I watch all of Marcello Garcia is how
to escape from the fucking side control.

859
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,630
I love all his three escapes.

860
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,110
I love all that shit have and
I'm fans of certain people.

861
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,260
I really like Stephen Caplin.
I really like his stuff.

862
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:02,800
He's a big white guy from Canada teachers.
Some basic stuff online.

863
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:07,000
It's amazing how much you
could get online. Oh yeah,
like you could be in shape,

864
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:11,050
but then this digital shit like now I
can do HIPAA escapes just down one side.

865
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:14,770
I can't do back and forth yet, but when I
would go, those things are hard, but not,

866
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:16,810
when I go to a hotel and I do comedy,

867
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:21,340
I go to the thing I run and
I do hip escapes. I do him
in a hotel now that's it.

868
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,080
You could get a real good workout
with body weight. You the hotel. I do.

869
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:28,630
If I just want to just do
something to say I did something,

870
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:32,950
I do a hundred bodyweight squats and a
hundred Hindu pushups and that really

871
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:35,320
gets your heart going, man.
100 body weight squats.

872
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,630
When you started hitting
like 70 and 80 like, whoa,

873
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,610
this is fucking like
your legs are burning.

874
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:42,490
You have to take big deep breaths
and completed and you can do it,

875
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:45,660
but it's you feel it and
then a hundred Hindu pushups.

876
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,180
It's the same thing when you're in like
Hindu pushup number three like bitch,

877
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,440
I'll do a hundred of my sleep.

878
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,190
But then you start getting like
towards 70 and you're like Ugh,

879
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,300
you're by the time I do a hundred of
each, I've got a decent, you know,

880
00:49:58,301 --> 00:49:59,440
15 minute workout in.

881
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:02,680
It's like it's something real isn't
that gets your heart pumping. Yeah,

882
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:05,650
it's just what they bought and then
supplement that with some set ups.

883
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:10,330
Do some pushups and you could get like a
rock solid workout in a hotel room with

884
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:13,720
no room at all easily. Nice. Very nice.

885
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,440
But I like everything that everything's
a nice and easy and cheap to do.

886
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:20,620
A lot of body weight stuff these days.
A lot of body weight stuff,

887
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:22,450
a lot of body weight squats
and a lot of Chin ups.

888
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,100
I do a lot of like look all the way
down Chin ups all the way down like this

889
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,040
slow cause

890
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,450
I think that's like motion that
is replicated in Jiu Jitsu.

891
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,470
Like pulling a body synching up a choke,
like trying to pull someone in,

892
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,680
grabbing a gable grip, trying
to complete a sweep. You know,

893
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,710
that's a lot of like slow polling and
it's like a long range of motion type

894
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:46,251
thing.

895
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,430
Like sometimes you grab and people from
way out here and you're trying to suck

896
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,480
them in and out.

897
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:54,500
So I think that Chin ups and
things along those lines,

898
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,380
like things that make your
body like functionally strong.

899
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,310
I think those are really under underrated.
A lot of people want to lift weights,

900
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,550
you know, they just want to fucking
tell you. They like dude's telling me,

901
00:51:04,551 --> 00:51:08,870
I put up three 15 for
four okay, what? Whatever.

902
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,090
What can you do with that body?

903
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,730
You've got a Ferrari that you
don't know how to drive. You know,

904
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:16,580
you get this crazy race car,
you can even take a first corner,

905
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:19,190
you fall on your head. You're
not an, you're not athletic.

906
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:22,010
Like you're not even using this
like to get good at a sport.

907
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:25,700
You don't do any sports.
He just lift like a crazy meathead.

908
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,620
Like you've got to do
something with that shit.

909
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:31,870
You're not gonna know how to use it.
Three 15 three 15 dumb.

910
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,330
My goal at the end of this year,
there's three 15 for five,

911
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,700
they high five each other
and they secretly think about
cock slap acids and just

912
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,050
fucking,
maybe

913
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,820
when I first moved to Colorado, the
guys next door to me with fucking lift,

914
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,010
you know,

915
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,510
just fucking insane amounts and they
would shoot deca and just keep lifting.

916
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,080
And that's all they did. I couldn't
figure out, like I would go down, man,

917
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,760
watch this.
The form was great.

918
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:07,270
They mixed up bodybuilding with strength
techniques like dead lifts that had

919
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,120
squats and uh,
and they did bodybuilding shit.

920
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,350
Jesus Christ on a crutch. Uh, I
was just laughing at something.

921
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:19,010
What were you laughing by?
Spilled coffee on myself.

922
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:23,630
You're talking about your friend who
used to have his mom shoot him with

923
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:26,430
steroids while he was doing the
line and he was on the phone

924
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,050
fucking Costa coffee all over my
cause the podcast, every six weeks,

925
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,730
they'll bad if he's still
alive. He's still alive.
That's what I'm talking about.

926
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:41,200
And you know, the guy I kidnap probably
called the podcast, right? Told me

927
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,590
that is so ridiculous.
Six years later,

928
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:49,280
he accepted the apology and he calls me
from time to time though, says hello,

929
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:53,420
how are you? When I lived in
revere, when I was kickboxing,

930
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,270
when I was teaching that a nautilus plus
there was a kid he used to work out at

931
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:59,690
Nautilus plus I became friends with,
if he's listening to this, I forgot,

932
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,990
I forgot his name, I'm sorry. But we
were friends for like a year or so.

933
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,580
Very nice guy. But anyway, he was
fucking huge. He was like my age.

934
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:12,290
We were both like around 21 but
he wished fucking gigantic. Like,

935
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,390
I don't know how much you weighed,
but I was like,

936
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,520
I was fighting at one 60 at the time.

937
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:20,840
So I was probably about 160 plus pounds
and he was maybe 200 and we were about

938
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:24,530
the same height.
And the dude was just fucking swole,

939
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:28,490
like looked way different than me.
I got a giant ass neck and giant shoulder.

940
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:30,960
It looks different than me right now.
He was just this big bodybuilder dude.

941
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,750
And uh, I didn't know what
he did. I didn't, I didn't,

942
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,880
I was totally ignorant
to steroids back then.

943
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,850
Totally ignorant because I was
always trying to lose weight.

944
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,430
I was not thinking about lifting
weights and getting any bigger.

945
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:43,770
I was trying to like
compete at 154 pounds,

946
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:48,750
so in taekwondo and then one 16
kickboxing. But I, I asked him once,

947
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:53,460
we were driving somewhere and I go, uh,
so what do you eat? And he goes, uh,

948
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:55,560
he goes, ah, you know, I
have about a, you know,

949
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,810
80% protein breakdown and this and that
and that and this. And I said, now,

950
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,060
and what kind of supplements you
take. And so he tells me, you know,

951
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,080
I take a little bit of this,

952
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:07,110
a little bit of that this is really
good for your metabolism. And I said,

953
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,400
do you do any steroids? And
there's a pause. And he goes, dude,

954
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,220
fucking look at me.
What do you think?

955
00:54:15,221 --> 00:54:19,710
Of course they do steroids.
And I was like, oh, okay.

956
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,400
But it was like the most hilarious
conversation because he just like,

957
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,710
looks at me. He goes,
dude, fucking look at me.

958
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,100
Who's world?
What's that?

959
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:32,970
American gladiator star nitrile you just
had a heart attack and he blames it on

960
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:36,630
a roid abuse. Wow. I balked at
all. All we did for 30 years.

961
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,220
It's the blow. That's the
issue. That's Shane del Rosario,

962
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:44,770
who was a UFC fighter that died
of a heart attack recently. Uh,

963
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,560
he was a very cool guy by the way,

964
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:50,550
in a really good fighter and a very good
kickboxer before. So terrible tragedy.

965
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:52,590
This guy died of a heart attack,

966
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:56,510
but apparently they released the coroner's
results and he had opiates in his

967
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:00,210
system and cocaine. So, you know, it was,

968
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,830
who knows what caused it.

969
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:06,660
But he also had a condition
that he was born with, you know,

970
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,460
that uh,
it was some sort of a,

971
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:11,760
a heart condition that he
had that was just genetic.

972
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,880
So is that on top of the other stuff?

973
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,840
But the coke is what gives people fucking
heart attacks bad. It's just something,

974
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,530
did you ever hang with
anybody who, I mean, hey,

975
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,610
like on a daily basis that steroids was
their world. You don't have to see the,

976
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:32,100
the wrestling. No, he goes to buy the
juice and the guy says to him, right,

977
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,340
I gave you two ounces of this.
You know, whatever vials of that

978
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,920
when you were in somebody's world.
It's like, that is fucking insane.

979
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,850
It was just a different dimension.
Well, you know what, it's like man.

980
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,620
It's like anything.
It's like gun nuts.

981
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,170
You ever talked to a gun
nuts about calibers? Well,

982
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,000
like the 50 cal with a seven millimeter,

983
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:56,001
the five six 7:00 AM they start talking
to these crazy numbers is 700 wind mag

984
00:55:56,821 --> 00:56:01,170
and you don't know what the fuck they're
saying. It's you get confused. Well,

985
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:05,060
I've got a three Oh eight I got a two
seven eight 22 caliber is a part of those

986
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,710
are the bullet goes at
350 feet per second.

987
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:12,660
Like how the fuck do you know all this?
They become dorks. They become gun dorks.

988
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,550
Like my friend Justin, very cool
dude. 100% gun dork. He's a gun door.

989
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:21,330
We have conversations and I say that
with all due respect and love because I

990
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:22,390
love talking to him about God.

991
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,090
It's fascinating because I love talking
to people about anything that they're

992
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:28,420
super passionate about. And this
motherfucker is passionate about guns.

993
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:32,140
He's got a ton of guns, he does
competitions, he goes and does,

994
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:35,470
you know those room clearing competitions
where target's pop up and you shoot

995
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:40,090
out a pink pink, you know, they, they
do all these, you know, scoring events.

996
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,110
So he, he loves that Shit. So he'll,
he'll talk to me and you know,

997
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,920
if he'll get as Geeky as I let them, you
know, like if I go, we'll keep going.

998
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:49,510
Well what does that mean? You
know, he'll just keep going.

999
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:54,511
I mean he knows everything there is about
loads and balances and impact and who

1000
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,390
makes the fucking most precise rifles.
And it's like anything else,

1001
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,840
they do it about steroids. They do it
about guns, someone to do it about boats.

1002
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:05,120
They'll start telling you about the
fucking best kind of of, of, of,

1003
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,320
of a hand carved wooden
canoe you could buy.

1004
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,710
They have to buy to run it from a very
specific type of wood and it has to be

1005
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:15,460
cured in a certain way.
There's two manufacturers
still do it by hand. You know,

1006
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:18,040
there's guys that are the W
it's that way with everything.

1007
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,420
There's always some people that are
completely fucking obsessed with whatever

1008
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:26,080
the subject is. If it's
steroids, if it's MMA,

1009
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,460
how many fucking guys have you ever
talked to that are like complete total MMA

1010
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:34,540
history buffs like Joe Silva?
Let me tell you something.

1011
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,080
I know a lot about MMA.
I know a lot of fights.

1012
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:39,580
I got a lot of fights in my memory.

1013
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,430
He's probably got doubled the
amount of fights in his memory.

1014
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,700
This motherfucker will tell me
like if he and I will be talking,

1015
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:48,730
there's a new guy that's brought into
the UFC and I'll say, what's his deal?

1016
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:52,240
What does he do? Joe Silva has seen this
guy fight 20 times already probably.

1017
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:52,991
And uh,
he'll,

1018
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:56,440
he'll just rattle off with his
strengths and weaknesses are what he's

1019
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:59,830
susceptible to.
What I would do if I was fighting them.

1020
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,170
And nine times out of 10
he's on the money's on the D.

1021
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,480
I mean that guy is
obsessed with MMA obsessed.

1022
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,920
When I lived in Boulder,
I had a problem,

1023
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:13,921
my ex wife and one of the first people
I ever met in boulder at a we'd place,

1024
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:19,810
I was living on the hill. The hill is
where the University of Colorado is.

1025
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:21,070
I was living a block away,

1026
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:25,660
not even 10 12 14th street and
next to me was the wheat chick.

1027
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:30,670
She was 80 and her boyfriend was 20 they
were then asked his father really 80

1028
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:35,890
had to be 50 something ugliest woman
he'd ever seen in your fucking life.

1029
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,570
This kid was like both deadheads.
They both smoked like death. He,

1030
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,510
his father invented like the
belly button ring or something.

1031
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,710
He was a millionaire. He got money every
month. I found out they sold the weed.

1032
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:50,950
I used to go with that bye week and every
time I was over there there was this

1033
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:52,780
lanky,
skinny dude named Ed

1034
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,280
and I used to talk to Adam and
immediate at all. He was from Boston,

1035
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,460
me and that hit it off and I
didn't know where that didn't.

1036
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:04,750
Everyday I see it on the hill and I
talked to Ed. This is 1985 brother. Right.

1037
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:08,380
And I loved that. And finally I
let her know what I did. You know,

1038
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:11,230
I used to do credit cards then
and they told me, you know,

1039
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,800
we became friends and it was a
Vietnam vet, but he was alert.

1040
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,140
He was the one that went and cleaned up.
You fucked up. He went and cleaned up.

1041
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:22,430
But there was another loop.
There was a couple, it's alert.

1042
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,690
What does this term something that's bad,
like these guys are bad,

1043
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:31,250
like danger bat, a cleaner,
like a cleaner, bad, like
it's just this bad news.

1044
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,910
The guy you call when the shit
hits the fan, the cards and shit,

1045
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:38,600
they're the ones that left the cards and
Vietnam when they shot you let the ace

1046
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:42,830
of spades or some shit so alert.
He had a buddy who was named was like,

1047
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:44,900
he had like a weird name and that
guy thought he was the devil.

1048
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,840
And I had heard this from other
people that that guy and he,

1049
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:52,040
they all bought weed at this house and I
became friends with him over the years.

1050
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:55,730
I became friends with that and I knew ed
was a stone cold killer when I went to

1051
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:56,860
the vet thing with him Monday,

1052
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,360
I gave him a ride to the vet
thing and on the walls that Bro,

1053
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,400
there were pictures of him with kids and
Purple Stars and metals and I'm like,

1054
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:09,020
are you fucking serious? So I thought
that was a good heart of the American,

1055
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,640
you know, bro, ed was a great guy.
He was my brother. If he's listening,

1056
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:14,780
I haven't talked to him in 20 years.
I love him and I miss him.

1057
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,090
But it was a stone cold killer.

1058
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,680
I made the mistake of telling that I had
a problem with somebody and every time

1059
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:24,950
I'd see that we'd smoke a joint
and then the third puffy go,

1060
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,600
so what are we going to kill that guy?

1061
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,890
And he wasn't kidding.

1062
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,260
So the guy that thought
he was a devil was rock.

1063
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:38,090
That's what he used to call himself.
Rod was dying from Agent Orange.

1064
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,630
And I guess him and Ron were doing fucking
bangs on the side, like hitting me.

1065
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:46,730
I didn't know this and
I'm like [inaudible], but
every time I see Eddie go,

1066
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,220
what's up dog? And he hugged me
and I loved him. He was my brother,

1067
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,820
but I knew he was serious. He was like
wanting to be taken out, that dude.

1068
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,840
And every time I'd see
him his plan changed.

1069
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:59,030
Like he had been thinking about
this and finally he's like, listen,

1070
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:01,970
I got the cones, we're going
to let him pull out a baseline.

1071
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,840
These motherfuckers want to pull them
out of the car and baseline in boulder,

1072
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:10,400
like Willis that cones up like we're
firemen and when he comes by at nine 18

1073
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:13,670
we're going to pull him out of the car.
And that whole plan was like, I was like,

1074
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,700
what are you going to shoot him when
he goes, Bro, we don't shoot people.

1075
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,050
I told you this. He goes,
we're going to shoot me.

1076
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,730
We take them up until those hills be
titles motherfuckers out and we just

1077
01:01:22,731 --> 01:01:27,080
wrapped with peanut butter and we come
back three days later and it's Geesa.

1078
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:30,350
All they find is like a little elbow on
the floor. She's and she goes to bed.

1079
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,360
I mean these guys are fucking serious.

1080
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:37,200
The parents just eat every time I'd
see him after that dog was that scary.

1081
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,250
You don't want to do this joy, joy.
Let me take care of just for you.

1082
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:44,390
You're my friend. I love you. I mean,
that's how it got. This was like,

1083
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:48,740
I've been around some crazy people and
that's why I respect Colorado so much.

1084
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:53,300
So this day there's some fucking animals
walking around those weeds prompt in

1085
01:01:53,301 --> 01:01:55,700
boulder and I loved that.
I mean I bro,

1086
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:59,210
if I introduced you to that and you met
at Edward, drop shit on you that you go,

1087
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,930
go, your friends are fucking
genius. What the fuck's,

1088
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,320
he never talked about
weapons. Never. You know,

1089
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,070
he never told you cause a Vietnam vet.

1090
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,610
He never took them a month and a half
to tell me how to drive them to the

1091
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:14,600
fucking vet place to get
medication. The real deal. Yeah.

1092
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:15,740
There's some crazy people out there.

1093
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:19,010
That's why I love the fuck
fucking comes up to you and goes,

1094
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,030
what's this guy's number?

1095
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:23,400
Let me go down there and smack the
shit out of Pauly shore. You know what?

1096
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:27,010
I'm saying there's people that will
do it. Actually they just wait. No,

1097
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,400
don't please don't.
I just said Pauly shore.

1098
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:31,990
I don't know what you shouldn't say
Paul. I've got no problem. Sure.

1099
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,980
But it's fucking this people out there
with their fucking phone on speed dial

1100
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,260
ready to attend.

1101
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:44,190
The funny thing is I had a friend who
was the same way about steroids and he's

1102
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:45,024
dead too.

1103
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:48,540
And I hung out with him and this is a
little steroid crew and it was fucking

1104
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:52,530
amazing. The lingo, the
lingo they threw around.

1105
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:57,060
What's the way you and I discussed
sets going to Boston for the weekend,

1106
01:02:57,061 --> 01:03:00,300
doing two shows, how great it was.
This motherfuckers like, Nah dog.

1107
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,090
I get up in the morning
and do a protein shake.

1108
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:07,410
It's like blast off a little deck and
then when I come out I take 10 tablets,

1109
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:11,160
a deep ball, those tablets of five
milligrams, like people would go do one.

1110
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,030
These guys are doing tech. We had a Jean
Le Ballon podcasts, you know judo gene,

1111
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:21,420
well famous, famous for not just
as martial arts, but it stunt work,

1112
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,030
did a lot of stonework and he was telling
us there was a guy that he used to be

1113
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:28,140
friends with a died from steroids who
used to shoot up every 30 minutes and he

1114
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,870
said every 30 minutes he would disappear,
would go into his bathroom.

1115
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,750
He hit himself with something else.
It was just doing different shit all day,

1116
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,770
more than 300 pounds.
The jeep was named Jeep Swenson.

1117
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,740
Do you remember Brian?
Cheap Swenson

1118
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,730
bodies for arms.
There was like a body that was his arm,

1119
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:49,100
this thing when I hung out with them and
I miss him, but I remember how you said,

1120
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:53,370
tell me the last shot I do
is Fridays to go workout.

1121
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,780
I go down the show, I do some blow, I
drink some beers, eat some burger king.

1122
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,790
When I come back Sunday, I look in
the mirror by boom, let's back it up.

1123
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:05,250
That's the guy,
Jesus Christ.

1124
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:09,240
That's not even a person anymore.
Where's the fucking barbarian?

1125
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:11,490
But the best of the people
who denied doing steroids.

1126
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,870
You have a friend that came up to
me the shoot and he said to me,

1127
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,870
how you doing Joe Rogan ever tell
you about me? The guy is ginormous.

1128
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:23,800
A black dude box APP. I don't know what
his name, the guy from the pride? No,

1129
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,790
no, no. He's not a fighter. Okay.
He's an actor. Okay. He goes,

1130
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:30,300
I'm a friend that Joe Rogan's. Did He
tell you about me? I go, no. He goes,

1131
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:35,190
I was on fear factor. Big Black
Body, but you're very, very nice guy.

1132
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:39,090
Him and his buddy were were
both bodybuilders and they
were competing and they

1133
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:40,990
got, they got their
ass kicked. I did some,

1134
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,810
I did some movie with them and the people
like, so do you do steroids? He's like,

1135
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:50,400
I'd never done steroids in my life.
He would say the barbarian brothers again,

1136
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:54,090
we go back to the barbarian brothers
please, whether by Barry and buzz,

1137
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,440
I want to smack the shit
out of both of them.

1138
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,940
They used to say that they
never did steroids. They
just ate 36 eggs a day. Well,

1139
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:02,440
it depends on what kind of
steroids is shoot into your ass.

1140
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:09,270
I mean, I guess it's the,
what are your chickens?

1141
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:13,800
Chickens are fucking terror birds running
around your backyard. Well, you know,

1142
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,860
those guys,
like if I'm looking at that picture,

1143
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:17,980
I could believe that either one of

1144
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,000
those guys didn't take steroids.
If you had a good genetic disposition,

1145
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,020
if you have good, uh, mesomorphic
jeans and you really power lift hard,

1146
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:29,560
he can get that big. My
friend Brian Frazier, I always
tell the story because, uh,

1147
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:30,720
Brian,
uh,

1148
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,350
who is a comic and writer wrote for
a bunch of different different shows.

1149
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,280
But,
um,

1150
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,390
he was at one point in time a serious
bodybuilder and he never did a steroid in

1151
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:45,160
his life, 100%. I know for a fact
that all he did was eat good food. He,

1152
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,740
he actually would pride
himself on the fact that, uh,

1153
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:49,870
he wouldn't take supplements.

1154
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,960
He would get all this food for
vegetables and meat and stuff like that.

1155
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:56,740
But he was fucking huge and he
was a hundred percent natural.

1156
01:05:56,741 --> 01:06:01,480
He was just obsessed. That motherfucker
was at the gym every day. And he was like,

1157
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:04,510
like one time he went on stage
and after the show I go, dude,

1158
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,260
you can't wear short sleeves. You got
stop doing that. He goes, why? I go,

1159
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,950
you're too big. I go, it's too
distracting. I go, you freaked me out.

1160
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:15,460
And we're friends like, are you fucking
huge dude? You can't just, I mean his,

1161
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,160
his arms like he,

1162
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,440
everything that he would wear would be
like tight to his arms like that because

1163
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:22,930
his arms were literally double
the size of my arms. They were,

1164
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:25,500
he was a huge guy and it was all natural.

1165
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,600
I'll tell you what I'm here to tell you.
Huh?

1166
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,440
Do you say you think this right here is,
I mean that looks super steroid. Yeah,

1167
01:06:32,441 --> 01:06:36,280
that was 1982 I want to see him today,

1168
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,070
but Brian was close to that size.
No bullshit.

1169
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:43,630
But the discipline that Brian Frazier
has is like, he's a crazy person.

1170
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:47,320
He's got like a radical
amount of discipline.

1171
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:52,470
Oh. And I got a laptop. I'll argue this
point while the guys are doing with eight,

1172
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:53,580
seven,
six years,

1173
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:59,770
I was the stock clerk in the kitchen after
I almost blew it up. Don't making the,

1174
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,700
the, the fucking cinnamon
donuts, the cinnamon things.

1175
01:07:02,701 --> 01:07:04,260
I made them too big and they fired me.

1176
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,310
And part of my Gig was hiding
steroids for a lot of the inmates.

1177
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:11,070
A lot of the epics.
We get steroid in vix.

1178
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:13,150
He's one of my favorite
words that you use. Yeah.

1179
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,690
The inmates would fucking get, you know,
and they would get a nothing, I'm sorry.

1180
01:07:18,691 --> 01:07:23,280
Nothing would syringes. It was an NFR.
And uh, there was another one when stroke,

1181
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:28,110
when he fee when strove veep pills, three
milligrams of a milligram and a half.

1182
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,590
That was big in that. And what
these savages would do, you know,

1183
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:34,530
I knew who was doing steroids,
but there were some black guys,

1184
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:39,540
I've been locked up for 10 years and had
families that couldn't afford fucking

1185
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:44,610
steroids and they would,
uh, they would, uh,

1186
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:49,320
these guys were yolked show and they'd
been getting yoked. And when I say yoked,

1187
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:53,700
you know, low fat, low, low, not
a lot of fat, little rip to him.

1188
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:57,900
And they were doing this for
prison food. Terrible. No protein.

1189
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,920
I don't fucking know what happened. Well,
you could buy protein powder, right?

1190
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,670
You can order protein powder
and there was all vegetables.

1191
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,920
You get Broccoli and lettuce. It's,
it's, it's burger king letters.

1192
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:10,620
It's the same shit. They give you a
burger king in that fucking cheeseburger.

1193
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:14,610
You know, it's not, it's a Nicaraguan
shit. It's nothing to share rock. Yeah.

1194
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:16,130
It's not let us that

1195
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,600
when you bite into it,
it's fresh.

1196
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:22,280
But these guys were getting
yoked in there on protein powder,

1197
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:27,010
like Joe Wieder protein powder,
you know, when it was back then.

1198
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,930
Now there's still a huge, oh
my God, that guy's huge. Yeah.

1199
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,750
No steroids in my ass. And Yeah, there's
no question. But I'm telling you,

1200
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:40,070
my friend Brian was pretty close to that
size. We did a gig together and, um,

1201
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,790
I want to say Vermont, Vermont and
New Hampshire, one of those. And uh,

1202
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,600
he had a bit of a cold. He didn't
like, his voice is really rasping.

1203
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:53,450
And uh, after the show he had a great
set, but after the show he apologized,

1204
01:08:53,451 --> 01:08:56,420
the club owner, he was just
real conscientious about
shit like that. He goes,

1205
01:08:56,421 --> 01:08:59,960
I'm really sorry, my voice
has been bothering me all
week. And the guy was like,

1206
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:04,280
don't worry about it. Listen, you killed
it was a great show. And he goes, uh,

1207
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,640
he goes, I just, I just feel like it
wasn't my best performance on just so,

1208
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:10,070
you know, I just want to apologize.
And the guy was like, Hey,

1209
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:11,600
will you stop being a Jew about it?

1210
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,470
He didn't know that my friend was Jewish
because Brian doesn't live Jewish.

1211
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:20,030
She's blonde. He looks like, um, like a
a Midwest football guy. He looks like,

1212
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:24,380
you know, he's got blond curly hair.
He's says big fucking sick nick gorilla.

1213
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,830
And the guy calls him a Julie says it,
stop being a Jew about it.

1214
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:31,040
He just thought that he was being
cute. He's trying to be funny. He goes,

1215
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:36,080
I am fuck Jewish and you know his
face gets red and then fuck you,

1216
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:39,680
you fucking racist piece of shit.
You antisemetic Cock sucker.

1217
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:44,600
Like he'd just like totally takes it like
to like level 10 and the guy was like,

1218
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,510
hey, calm down. It was just a,
just an expression of speech.

1219
01:09:47,511 --> 01:09:48,910
Like he's leaning over this guy's death.

1220
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,830
The only thing that's saving him as
the fact there's a desk between them,

1221
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,791
you know,
otherwise Brian,

1222
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:56,420
we're probably got directly in his face
and the guy might've swung at a just

1223
01:09:56,421 --> 01:10:00,020
sheer panic or who knows what the fuck
could happen and while I'm watching this

1224
01:10:00,021 --> 01:10:03,320
I'm, I'm like, what am I going to do?
Like he's way stronger than me. I can't,

1225
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,750
I can't grab him. I'm not going
to hit him. He's my friend.

1226
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:08,360
I don't know what to do cause
it looked like he was like,

1227
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:11,330
he was a gorilla and I'm like,
I can't keep him off this guy.

1228
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:13,700
If he decides to get on this guy,
I don't know what to do here.

1229
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:18,680
And he just calmed down at the last
minute was like fuck two takes his check.

1230
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:21,200
And fucking stormed out of
there and I tell the guy, well,

1231
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,640
I don't think you're going
to say that again. Sorry.

1232
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,700
The guy didn't know what to do.
He was shitting his pants.

1233
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:33,350
He was an older guy too, you know he was,
he was, he was legitimately terrified.

1234
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,140
Brian was an enormous, I mean,
wasn't going to hurt the guy.

1235
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,330
I'd never known him to
do anything violent ever,

1236
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,660
but goddamned he scared the fucking
shit out of this dude. He just,

1237
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:44,630
you'd never expect that he was Jewish.
She didn't look Jewish at all. You know,

1238
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:47,080
you think of Jewish, you think a
dark haired people. Where is he?

1239
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,070
I don't know why he's doing,
he was out here for awhile.

1240
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,940
I ran into him once in a movie
theater a few years back now.

1241
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:56,120
I think he was just writing at the time.
It's funny dude though.

1242
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,960
You get to see anchorman two yet.
You know, I bought a joke from him.

1243
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,080
He's the only,
there's two dudes ever about a joke from,

1244
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:06,140
and he's one that I never used it,
but I've talked about it on the podcast.

1245
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,960
He was a heckler line that
he created and he goes,

1246
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,560
this is my impression of God creating you.
Okay.

1247
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:17,010
Just a of current. Oh No. The
cap came off too much content.

1248
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:22,110
I've ruined it.
And he needed money at the time.

1249
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,050
So what you, and he says like, I'll
devastate on stage. So he sold it to me.

1250
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,910
I think it was 500 bucks. Whoa. It's
worth it. That's a lot of money. Hey Dude,

1251
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,120
needed some money. I thought it was
a great line. It's worth 500 bucks.

1252
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,740
That's a great line for me. I never
even never used it on stage. I mean,

1253
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,010
maybe I used it once. I can't
remember. I going to go pee real quick,

1254
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,910
but it's one of the few
things I've ever paid for.

1255
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,870
There's a werewolf in the new anchorman.
I just wanted to let you know very well.

1256
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,380
Well, now I'm in. I was going to
be in any way. It looks hilarious.

1257
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:52,290
The fucking ads look awesome.
Yeah. It looks like the perfect,

1258
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:56,400
get baked and see a silly movie.
Definitely get really, really? Yeah. Yeah.

1259
01:11:56,401 --> 01:11:57,720
You have to get really big though.

1260
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:01,530
It's super ridiculous and if you liked
the first one, you'll love this one,

1261
01:12:01,531 --> 01:12:03,390
but there's so many good cameos in it.

1262
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:05,970
And when I saw that Werewolf
transformation, I'm just like,

1263
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,660
oh Joe's and shit is fucking, you
just ruined it for everybody, man.

1264
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:13,830
Spoiler alert you son of a bitch.
The anything will Ferrell does on man,

1265
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,390
that guy kills me man.

1266
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,030
Talladega nights is still one of
my all time favorite comedies.

1267
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,730
Just for the sheer ridiculousness
of it all. It's like,

1268
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,250
I love that kind of comedy.

1269
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,360
Like a guy who was like a complete total
buffoon who was like a goodhearted guy

1270
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,860
who fucks everything up.

1271
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,070
Last night I got to see David
Arquette do standup comedy.

1272
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:35,640
He came into the comedy store and
just like bye and he's like everyone,

1273
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,120
everyone's uh, bill was on me like he
paid for everyone's drinks last night.

1274
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,960
Like a lot of fucking people there too.
That's interesting. Why did he do that?

1275
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:46,750
I don't know. He's just holidays I think.
I think he comes in once in a while,

1276
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,950
but then he went on stage and did
like a little little set and it was

1277
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:51,900
interesting. But you know, I
didn't see the whole thing.

1278
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:56,840
But it's hard to do stand up after
you're already famous, you know? I mean,

1279
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,950
especially when you're known for
doing comedy movies and you know,

1280
01:13:00,951 --> 01:13:04,800
and then you try to create your own stuff
and go on stage with it in that form

1281
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:08,370
and it's so, that's also so raw when
you got to think of a guy like that.

1282
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:12,150
It's so insulated from regular
people in like a performance setting.

1283
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:16,080
Everything he performs gets put out
there on television or in the movies and

1284
01:13:16,081 --> 01:13:18,000
he's not there when it,
when the people are seeing it.

1285
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:22,240
David Arquette guy being an actor,
comedy actor. But I'm saying like the,

1286
01:13:22,241 --> 01:13:26,600
the transition between doing that and
doing stand up in front of a live audience

1287
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:28,620
and a small place like the comedy store,

1288
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:32,850
that's a big goddamn transition
that's hard to do. There's a lot of,

1289
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,870
it's really interested in seeing how
many like uh, actors and musicians,

1290
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,400
what just try stand up comedy.

1291
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:40,950
They just come to the comedy store one
day and next thing you know John Mayer's

1292
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:43,500
on stage. Well you know
what man, they can do it.

1293
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:46,050
It's not like we could do
a open mikes from music.

1294
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:49,590
You imagine we showed up at open much
music and just started singing fucking

1295
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,041
terrible.

1296
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:55,041
So we are the world like we are
the world like Bruce Springsteen

1297
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:01,240
be all serious about it. I think if
you do one of those open Mike Nights,

1298
01:14:01,241 --> 01:14:03,930
you probably have to do your own
music, right? You have to be original.

1299
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:04,913
I don't know.

1300
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:09,990
I would imagine that'd be ridiculous
unless it's a really old song and then

1301
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:13,480
you're doing like a bad ass cover of it
where you like wiggle it around a little

1302
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:17,080
bit, change it to little Dwight
Yoakam doing Elvis, that kind of shit.

1303
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,520
I guess you'd get away with that.

1304
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:22,660
I always thought it was really cool when
Johnny Cash did hurt by nine inch nails.

1305
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,350
Yeah, that sounds like one. He picked
a nine inch nails song, but two,

1306
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:28,280
he made it his own.
He was like,

1307
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:32,380
it seems like it was his song rusty cage
by sound garden until we did a couple

1308
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:33,820
of times. Yeah. Yeah.

1309
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,500
And hurt dude is might one of my
favorite Johnny Cash songs ever. Yeah.

1310
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:42,040
Just because he was so fucking
old when he did that, that video,

1311
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,390
that song and that video were done when
he was, he knew he was on his last days.

1312
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,810
That guy lived hard.

1313
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:54,730
That was the real crazy road life.
The Rock and roll life,

1314
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,400
those kinds of trends of stars.
Shit Dude.

1315
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:02,820
Those country stars back in the day I
cam and you know Merle haggard and all

1316
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:06,540
those motherfuckers, those
guys went hard. Dude, that's a,

1317
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:11,050
that's a whole different kind
of partying and that movie,

1318
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:13,270
that was a good God damn
moves just of the other day.

1319
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:14,660
And I watched it for walk the line.

1320
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:18,460
The hotel I did as far as movies
about like iconic figures,

1321
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:23,500
musical figures. It's one of the best.
So one of the best. I like she Phoenix,

1322
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,120
she's fantastic. She's fantastic. And
Joaquin. Phoenix is a bad motherfucker.

1323
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:32,500
It's a great fucking movie, man. Johnny
Cash. It's my dog's named Johnny Cash.

1324
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,340
I'm S.

1325
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:37,210
I've always been a huge Johnny Cash
song just because he was so legitimate,

1326
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,430
you know, like he was so legit. His
songs were, they just seem right,

1327
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,470
you know?
You know what I'm saying?

1328
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:49,420
Like there was like Folsom prison blues
is one of my favorite songs of all time.

1329
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:50,943
You know,
just that.

1330
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:55,350
The idea that this guy is sitting in
the prison looking at these guys come by

1331
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:00,010
and a train, they're probably drinking
coffee and smoking big cigars.

1332
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:05,950
Fuck. He was awesome. What does this
right here, a redemption by Johnny Cash,

1333
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,590
Sin and redemption and thank God the
redemption or I wouldn't be here,

1334
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,510
which is a title of the last song I wrote.

1335
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,560
He's also one of the highway men,

1336
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:19,620
which is one of the great
unheralded songs of our generation.

1337
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,640
Have you ever heard that song?
I was a highway man. God Damn,

1338
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:27,870
that's a fucking song. It's
Willie Nelson. Merle haggard,

1339
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:32,820
Johnny Cash altogether. I
think someone else too. Well,

1340
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:36,500
the fuck else was in there.
That's a,

1341
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,230
he's got to think. We don't love her
better. Let her know you love her.

1342
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,560
I haven't seen it. You know you
love her. I love, I love Kelly.

1343
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:49,780
Kirsten Kelly Carson.
You forgot about that.

1344
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:53,500
They just came to me Kelly cause

1345
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,120
yeah, I'm trying to find Johnny Cash.
Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson.

1346
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:04,620
That too. It was a tour that it wasn't
wise. App Dot. Wow. Johnny Cash,

1347
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:07,680
Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson.
Holy Shit.

1348
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:10,070
Kris Kristofferson is bad.

1349
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,500
Fuck Aa is all the way up to those
blade movies. He was a bad motherfucker

1350
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:20,900
is all. Dude's got bored and decided.
Tore it again. You know what?

1351
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:21,840
He was good at Bro.

1352
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:26,850
Payback play a little of that wasn't even
pay payback with James Coburn and Mel

1353
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:31,490
Gibson. Yes. Really? He's
the gangster and payback.

1354
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:36,890
Well, he's a good actor on top
of being a great musician. Yeah.

1355
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,420
I'm not being facetious about
those blade movies either. I,

1356
01:17:40,421 --> 01:17:43,760
I loved those movies man. Especially
the first one. I loved the first one.

1357
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:48,670
The first one was great. First one. I
loved Stephen Dorff, his best moves,

1358
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,380
one of his best
performances is the bad guy.

1359
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,840
You know who else is good in that Donald
Loke? Everybody's good in that. It's,

1360
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:59,480
that's a fucking great goddamn movie as
far as like vampire comic book movies go.

1361
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,830
That was a great one guy. You know,
as they progressed into two and three,

1362
01:18:03,831 --> 01:18:06,680
they kind of got even like too funky.
I liked the first one,

1363
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:09,800
but I was a huge fan of that at
that comic book when I was a kid.

1364
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:13,520
Blade was awesome. He had teak knives,
he had knives that are made out of wood.

1365
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:17,090
Teak is like a really hard wood and that's
how he cares. Kill all these vampires.

1366
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:20,420
Yeah,
we'll always teak blades.

1367
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:25,400
It's amazing that when things go
bad for an actor, they always, they,

1368
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,700
it pisses me off that they get into comedy
and that pisses me off that they try

1369
01:18:31,731 --> 01:18:31,821
it.

1370
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:35,850
Like if it's just another day at the
fucking office and if they only knew that

1371
01:18:35,851 --> 01:18:37,910
it's not a another day at the office,

1372
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:42,770
a lot of them try it for a while and they
make it on charisma and stage presence,

1373
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:48,310
dance moves and tops of girl would say
it's a 30 minute thing to be up there an

1374
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:49,521
hour.

1375
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:54,140
It really needs to perfection and the
whole thing and it's just something that

1376
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:58,280
it doesn't. Either way it micro. It just
surprises me that somebody could think.

1377
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,560
It's like if I can say,
you know what,

1378
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,350
instead of going to the show
to con white belt class,

1379
01:19:03,351 --> 01:19:06,050
I'm just going to go to the black belt
class and I'm just going to walk in there

1380
01:19:06,051 --> 01:19:08,120
because I could throw a good sidekick.

1381
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:12,040
That's what you're making me feel like
you're not respecting the people around

1382
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:14,750
you it, I don't think they have any idea
what it is. No, they don't. They don't.

1383
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:17,090
They don't. They know, but I
don't think any of us did either.

1384
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,490
I don't think we really knew what it
was until we started doing it. Yeah,

1385
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,120
but we stuck with it. That's
the difference. They could
too, right? I mean all,

1386
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:25,940
I mean it's hard to make a big
generalization, but they could.

1387
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:28,010
There's guys who have
started out as actors,

1388
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,900
got into comedy and actually fell in love
with comedy and liked it better than I

1389
01:19:30,901 --> 01:19:33,230
ever have a leak in your thing.
You always call the plumber.

1390
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:36,020
You don't have to do it. Your,
I have a love for plumbing,

1391
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:38,460
but you're not going to
fucking do it yourself or you.

1392
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,230
And that's why I don't take offense.
It's just something that really bitch,

1393
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,550
really, you're just going
to walk into the dancing.

1394
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,910
You got to take over this
motherfucker like GSP.

1395
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:50,900
Well you love comedy and you're also
very competitive and a lot of ways like

1396
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:55,220
your, your idea about a comedy like is
very competitive and the comedy is, uh,

1397
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,750
that's,
that's the,

1398
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,560
the highest heights and then these people
that want to slide over his actors and

1399
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:03,860
think they're going to disrespect
it. Yeah, no, no. I would never,

1400
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:07,680
ever disrespect somebody like
that. I can't imagine like, oh,

1401
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:11,190
that looks easy to do. I know.
Some way. That's the problem.

1402
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:14,850
It's really weird that now more than ever,
I get emails from people that yeah we,

1403
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:15,091
you know,

1404
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:19,080
death squads and inspire on to do stand
up and they get on stage and that's

1405
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:20,940
great.
But then there's that second journey,

1406
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:25,050
there's that second push that
it really comes from you. Yeah.

1407
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,380
A lot of people just don't get it just,
it's just

1408
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:32,990
longterm proposition. There's no way
around it. You can't pretend, you know,

1409
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,420
you can't do it for a couple of years
and come up with a few minutes and think

1410
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:38,880
you're a fucking national
headliner cause you're not.

1411
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,930
It's a long term proposition and
a lot of it is based on your,

1412
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,420
you're going to have a bunch
of different kinds of crowds,

1413
01:20:45,421 --> 01:20:48,120
a bunch of different kinds of scenarios
and you're going to have to find your

1414
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:50,880
voice by navigating all
those different waters.

1415
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,940
And it's tricky and it's not easy.
It's going to take a long time.

1416
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:55,320
You're going to restructure your act.

1417
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:58,590
You could have shows where bits kill and
then another show we're bit turns the

1418
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:00,960
whole audience off and you can't
figure out what the fuck went wrong.

1419
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,230
You got to figure it out. It's not
about having a couple of good shows.

1420
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:08,010
It's about massive consistency
over hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of shows

1421
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:11,940
and figuring out where your voices, that
ain't easy no matter what you're doing.

1422
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:15,510
If you were doing fucking slam poetry
contest, if you were writing books,

1423
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:19,740
if you were saying in songs like
finding your particular voices,

1424
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,990
fucking hard man to be genuine,

1425
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:27,140
to be completely unique and genuine and
[inaudible] and completely original,

1426
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:31,530
like to your own thoughts. It's
very hard. Very fucking hard.

1427
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,650
Just seems easy because he'd go
downstage and be like, what's up bitches?

1428
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:35,790
What are you doing that you know?

1429
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:38,370
And you start talking shit and people
are laughing. You're like, Cam,

1430
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:39,360
I can talk shit too.

1431
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,600
But they don't realize how much work it
took to get you to where you could just

1432
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,800
figure out what are the right words to
say, what's the right mindset to be?

1433
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:51,750
And when you're on stage,
what are the right combination?

1434
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,730
What's the right way to settle into bits?

1435
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:57,130
What's the right way to lead them
into a story? What's the right way?

1436
01:21:57,130 --> 01:22:00,570
What keeps them activated?
What backs him down would picks them up.

1437
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,030
It's like if there's a little dance
you're doing when you're up there,

1438
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:06,930
like I watch it, I know what you're doing,
I see it and I've known you forever.

1439
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,350
I knew you back when you were having
a real hard time with stand up.

1440
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,850
Which to me is fascinating because you're
the only guy that I've ever met that

1441
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:19,340
was having a really hard time with
stand up and then add a nowhere.

1442
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:20,760
Like you hit a switch.

1443
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:25,860
You went from having a hard time with
stand up to being a fucking murderer.

1444
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,023
We would,

1445
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,780
it was almost like you like you fucking
pass through a doorway or something.

1446
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:35,640
Like within two years of you working
at the store, you just figured it out.

1447
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:39,190
He's figured it out one night and
we were up on stage and we're,

1448
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:42,420
we're in the back rather. And you were
up on stage. We were watching you like,

1449
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:46,440
Damn Joey Diaz just turn a fucking corner.
You just figured out how to be funny.

1450
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,420
You figured out who you were up there.

1451
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:54,030
It's really weird when you, uh, you get
into anything. There's always that Jesus,

1452
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:55,440
I'm not improving.
Yeah.

1453
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:00,470
Of calming him showing up and this is
just isn't working and then one day out of

1454
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:05,360
the fucking blue pop pow, it just
starts working and it's really weird.

1455
01:23:05,361 --> 01:23:07,690
It was stand up.
You don't want to go to sleep,

1456
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:10,830
you want to go home and
keep writing and writing.

1457
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:15,850
And then I became infatuated from 95 to
like 98 but I had so many other things

1458
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:20,050
going on.
You know what I'm saying?

1459
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:23,440
I had so many fucking things going
on that I couldn't really focus,

1460
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:27,880
focus and then I moved to La and
I had all these distractions.

1461
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:31,780
You have all these stupid distractions
when you first moved to La and you're a

1462
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:36,640
karmic agencies, this, that, this,
that, and then one day you just,

1463
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,520
something hits you and it goes,
these mother fuckers don't matter.

1464
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:41,350
Nothing really matters.

1465
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:45,310
I've got to go up there and speak what's
in my heart and you just start going

1466
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,920
and little by little, once you find your
voice, you become a savage. That's it.

1467
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:53,260
It's like a, it's like a shark tasting
blood. It's like anything else.

1468
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:56,500
When you get that taste and
you just go after it and,

1469
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:59,170
and you know the comedy store
is the fucking comedy store man.

1470
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:04,110
Once you get in the car mystery. To
me that's like, you know John Job,

1471
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:08,230
that's the comedy store.
That's it's as John Jacques Machado,

1472
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,820
it throws up a high level that that's it.
It's a high level,

1473
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,570
especially in the two thousands when
we were down there and there was,

1474
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:19,150
there was some intense comedy,

1475
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:22,450
there was growing something
for your countenance already
coming up there and you

1476
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:23,284
coming up there.

1477
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,070
It was a really intense time and you
go onstage and you get this weird

1478
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:30,580
confidence and it's this fucking thing.

1479
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:34,620
You just get stronger and stronger in the
more people you go up in front of cars.

1480
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,870
Then in the beginning they make it
go up in front of people. You know,

1481
01:24:37,871 --> 01:24:41,950
going up in front of Mitzi shore is nerve
wracking and going on after they put

1482
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:45,040
you on after a lot of guys that were
really fun and you're going up in front of

1483
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:48,400
Mitzi shore,
you have no idea what that does to you.

1484
01:24:48,401 --> 01:24:51,550
At the six year mark going up.
I cannot describe it.

1485
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:55,540
I've thought about it and I've written
about that experience thousands of times

1486
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:59,170
and nothing was more like I blacked out.

1487
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:04,410
I had a blackout to go in front of Mitzi
shore because I knew it was it for a

1488
01:25:04,451 --> 01:25:08,410
guy like me, Mitzi shore
turned me down. You know what?

1489
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,140
I was going to go back to boulder,

1490
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:14,800
probably stabbed one of
those motherfuckers without
come out. I would just,

1491
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:17,110
when getting out now I would
have been institutionalized.

1492
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,800
There's no turning back from that.
It would have crushed my ego. Her,

1493
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,180
her taking me gave me another
five year reprieve in my life.

1494
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,990
I knew I got something to do for five
more years before I go to jail for killing

1495
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:30,520
somebody.
Like that's how I felt.

1496
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,040
Did you really feel like
you're going to do that?

1497
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:34,200
Cause when I met you I never
got that from, yeah. Yeah.

1498
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:37,990
I was part of the part of the,
the the,

1499
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:41,950
the jumping my comedy was the day
I wrote her the letter and I said,

1500
01:25:41,951 --> 01:25:44,680
you can't scan me no more. You want to
take the kid, take the fuck you can't,

1501
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:48,160
what am I going to fucking dirt road
were talking about you called her up one

1502
01:25:48,161 --> 01:25:50,080
day and told him I didn't know
who you're talking about. Yeah.

1503
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:51,060
I told her that I didn't,

1504
01:25:51,061 --> 01:25:54,310
you know that at the end of the
day and I was being this, you know,

1505
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:57,130
some people really cannot handle the
truth and sometimes you have to tell him

1506
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:01,960
and I had a talk to her and then talk to
her again in 99 when I took that change,

1507
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:06,080
it was around 2000 met me in 97
it took me about three years,

1508
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:08,900
but one day in [inaudible]
99 before I went to bed,

1509
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:11,390
I was clean for a couple of days,
maybe three days,

1510
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,150
and I went to bed early and I had my,
which to me and I said,

1511
01:26:14,151 --> 01:26:15,800
I'm not going to fuck with this no more.

1512
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:19,130
It was one of these things that I
was going into the lion's mouth.

1513
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:24,670
I had a walk on a fine line
with her because I wanted
to be a part of that kid's

1514
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:25,131
life,

1515
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:28,820
but it wasn't looking that way and I was
going to take her shit no more than one

1516
01:26:28,821 --> 01:26:32,170
morning I got up room and I went and got
a calling card and I call that mother

1517
01:26:32,171 --> 01:26:35,990
fucker and I just laid it out to her
and I told her the opening line was,

1518
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:40,700
I'll never forget this, that listen
between you and I and she knew me. I said,

1519
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:43,570
you know, if you want to
find I would not pass on you.

1520
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:47,570
We contact I'm having with
you is because of this child.

1521
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:51,530
So I pay for a separate phone in her
room and I don't have to talk to you no

1522
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:52,364
more.

1523
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:55,430
Cause she wanted what was killing me at
that time when she wanted to take and

1524
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:59,270
change the child's name.
And my position was when my father died,

1525
01:26:59,271 --> 01:27:03,320
my mom remarried, my poor dad that
died, I had to keep his fucking name.

1526
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:04,670
That was just something in my heart.

1527
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,260
So I always felt that that's let her
become 18 I'd have to decide what the fuck

1528
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:12,860
she wants to write. That was eating
away whammy when they add no value.

1529
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:16,940
A name didn't have a value to me and this
whole situation didn't have a valid to

1530
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:21,560
me. Once I analyzed it and said, fuck
this bitch and what she stands for,

1531
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:25,310
I turned that corner because
I dropped luggage off.

1532
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,800
There's nothing sometimes in comedy,

1533
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:30,180
sometimes in life you're just
carrying around some luggage, man,

1534
01:27:30,181 --> 01:27:34,490
that doesn't let you move. The box is
five feet, but the door is only three.

1535
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,960
Sorry motherfucker.

1536
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:39,710
And you've got to drop that shit
until you dropped that fucking box.

1537
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:41,450
You ain't going to go
through that door too.

1538
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:45,600
People get locked into
those relationships,
whether they're friendships,

1539
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,980
friendships with former ex,
you know, ex wife and husband,

1540
01:27:49,981 --> 01:27:52,020
whatever you want to call
that relationship, exes.

1541
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,410
But they're like two deer with their
fucking horns locked together and they

1542
01:27:55,411 --> 01:27:58,530
can't separate and they fucking,
every day is a push poll.

1543
01:27:58,531 --> 01:28:01,050
They fuck with each other
on purpose. You know, I've,

1544
01:28:01,051 --> 01:28:04,090
I've known people that went through
horrible divorces where, you know,

1545
01:28:04,091 --> 01:28:06,330
you could tell that like they would,

1546
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,780
they would like be setting up each
other like, you know, fuck him,

1547
01:28:09,781 --> 01:28:12,180
make him pay more, you know, uh, let's,

1548
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,500
let's agree to one thing and
then change the terms. Just keep,

1549
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:17,850
keep the bills coming in and like,
I've heard people talk like that.

1550
01:28:17,851 --> 01:28:19,860
So it's a horror show.
It's crazy and it's scary.

1551
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,190
And this is, this was
the bad end of it, Joe,

1552
01:28:22,191 --> 01:28:26,840
that this is the already at the job
in boulder that paid the most educated

1553
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:27,674
schmuck like me.

1554
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,940
I was working for a sports adviser and
that you can make anywhere from 20 to

1555
01:28:31,941 --> 01:28:34,310
60,000 to football seasons,
six months.

1556
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,350
You can make some calves
and that's insane.

1557
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,240
There was some guys that make
a hundred grand. There was,

1558
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:41,930
I had a month in December, I made
25 grand work in the fucking phones.

1559
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:46,520
You just got to get some fish. Tibetans
send you money, believe that your is,

1560
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:49,700
you're going to take them through
the fucking bowl season. Listen Bro,

1561
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:54,380
you want to make 50 it's going to cost
you 20 go to Western Union seminar 20,000

1562
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:58,040
and we'll talk about sending them.
Basically buying your knowledge,

1563
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:01,860
your knowledge, but you're buying your
bullshit. It's bad Karma also. Really,

1564
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,600
this is what I was doing, so I knew this.
I knew this. All right. I come to La,

1565
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:09,180
Mitzi shore it on past me.
Maybe the Improv pass has been,

1566
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:11,370
but my dream was Mitzi shore.
Who the fuck are you kidding?

1567
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:16,200
My whole thing was the store from day
one people told me to go to the fucking

1568
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:19,740
store. That's your house. That was
my fate. If she turned me down,

1569
01:29:19,741 --> 01:29:22,550
I would have probably gone
back to Colorado. Probably
gotten to work over there.

1570
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:26,040
You were there. You'd done sets
in Seattle. You were doing,

1571
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,810
when I couldn't go back to go to Seattle,

1572
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:31,920
I would've gone back to Colorado and tried
to be a dad and one day ago I know me

1573
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,540
one fucking day. The car breaks
down, there's snow and out.

1574
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:40,080
You get one of those bills and
overdue bill and that's it.

1575
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,350
You bump into this fucking book and it
gives you that attitude with his flip

1576
01:29:43,351 --> 01:29:45,840
flops on. I was going to
run over this motherfucking,

1577
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,070
I was gonna do 50 fucking years.
So you know what, as much as I,

1578
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:54,840
the comedy store has that much power in
my life. Came along at the right time,

1579
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:57,550
came along at the right time.
Do you think that people create that?

1580
01:29:57,551 --> 01:30:00,820
I mean that's like the big,
uh, the big hippy, new age, uh,

1581
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:04,620
argument about lives that you create
these possibilities in life, that you're,

1582
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,600
you're responsible for all these
different events that are happening too.

1583
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:08,730
They're not random events.

1584
01:30:08,731 --> 01:30:13,470
These are events that are sort of
created by your own intentions. Yes.

1585
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,210
Do you feel that sometimes,
absolutely.

1586
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:19,170
One thing I learned was that
until you take responsibility,

1587
01:30:19,171 --> 01:30:23,110
you ain't gonna move forward. Cause
motherfuckers that get off the stage, Bro,

1588
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:25,740
the audio sucks the sound.

1589
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,590
I watched a guy eat the pipe

1590
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,460
quite fucking bombed. Yeah. And
that's it. And then everything else.

1591
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:38,700
And until you come through that,
you can't really,

1592
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,780
and that was big for me that I believe
that they listened. I go to bed now,

1593
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,410
I go home, I put my feet up, I watch
the news and I go to bed like nothing.

1594
01:30:46,411 --> 01:30:48,450
You know, 20 years ago I
didn't go to bed like nothing.

1595
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:52,620
I had to shut my window a certain
way and close my door, shut away,

1596
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:56,190
and I couldn't leave the light on at night
because I owed money to a drug dealer

1597
01:30:56,191 --> 01:30:59,730
like rob somebody. I created
all those scenarios. I didn't,

1598
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:03,000
I didn't make that kidnapping up.
I went there with a gun.

1599
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:03,840
I knew what I was doing,

1600
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,910
but it's funny how quick the turnaround
was between like 99 you know,

1601
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,190
like it's,
it all just sort of stopped.

1602
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:15,520
It all stopped loving and they kept
stopping. You know, it kept stopping.

1603
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,130
What you're telling me is that I
never did blog at after 2006 that's,

1604
01:31:20,131 --> 01:31:23,630
you're trying to tell me who me.
That's you're trying to tell me why.

1605
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,150
I wouldn't say that.
I'm just saying

1606
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:32,370
that's the weirdest way to phrase that
sentence. I haven't done Boston one day.

1607
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:37,140
One day, one day I went home with
a check. So one day I went home.

1608
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:39,960
I just stopped doing book. That's what
you're trying to never done that again,

1609
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:42,810
number one. So what I'm saying? I'm saying
about being a criminal. No, no, no, no.

1610
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:47,190
I'm busting your balls. I can't
believe what I'm fucking telling you.

1611
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,660
That's night. 2006 one
day I went home. Brian,

1612
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:56,340
one day I went home and just stopped
doing cocaine though. Rehab, no hug.

1613
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:59,070
I didn't call nobody.
I didn't piss my ear.

1614
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:03,880
I didn't give my life to Allah was no all
big game. There was none of that shit.

1615
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:08,630
Okay. Whatever the fuck that shit is,
he never go with nothing. Uber Game.

1616
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:13,150
So my point is that what
happened was I dropped,

1617
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:17,500
I kept dropping the pain that I had at
that luggage that I had. I forced it out.

1618
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:20,140
I just didn't fucking stop doing drugs.

1619
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:23,500
I overcame whatever was making
me do those fucking drugs.

1620
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:27,220
Society wasn't making me do drugs.
Obamacare. How funny is that?

1621
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:30,690
They found heroin in the Bronx
with Obamacare envelope. Austin,

1622
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:34,930
Boston man hysteric instead Obamacare on,
it was on heroin,

1623
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:41,680
Obamacare,
everything.

1624
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:45,450
In a lot of ways it's random
things that happen as well, right?

1625
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,070
Because I broke this sometimes.
Yeah.

1626
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:49,270
People wake up on the wrong
side of the fucking bed.

1627
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:52,310
They come at you and you understand
your fucking ground and you got to stay.

1628
01:32:52,311 --> 01:32:55,970
No Bitch. And people get their
feelings hurt. Yes. But no,

1629
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:59,420
I created a lot of shit that happened
in my life. There's no fucking way.

1630
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:04,400
You also have to stop silliness or it'll
invade your life and ruin your quality

1631
01:33:04,401 --> 01:33:06,260
of life.
Like if you don't get upset at people,

1632
01:33:06,261 --> 01:33:10,160
sometimes there's times where people are
infringing on your happiness with your

1633
01:33:10,161 --> 01:33:12,680
bullshit bullshit. And
you're like, listen man,

1634
01:33:12,681 --> 01:33:15,050
you need to learn your
own for your own good.

1635
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:18,080
You need to learn that what you're doing,
it's like socially unacceptable. You're,

1636
01:33:18,081 --> 01:33:19,880
you're passing it off on other people.

1637
01:33:19,881 --> 01:33:24,210
You're passing off this shitty reality
that you're trying to promote something

1638
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,350
you, you can get locked in a person
like that, as we were saying before,

1639
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:29,210
with like bad relationships.
And then all of a sudden,

1640
01:33:29,211 --> 01:33:34,211
like every day you're dealing with this
person's nonsense distortions and lies

1641
01:33:34,491 --> 01:33:38,210
and it can never trust. Like who was it
your fault. No, it's never your fault.

1642
01:33:38,211 --> 01:33:40,250
Right. And it's never your fault.
It's always somebody else's fault.

1643
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,430
And when you deal with people like that
on a regular basis and you communicate

1644
01:33:43,431 --> 01:33:44,264
with people like that,

1645
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:48,560
it makes it incredibly difficult for
you to live your life because you're

1646
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:49,394
constantly,

1647
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:53,630
you're constantly like debating
or dismissing bullshit.

1648
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:55,700
Like is this bullshit?
It might people shit.

1649
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,520
And then somewhere along the line
you realize, well, fuck this man,

1650
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:02,360
I got to stop hanging out
with this person. This
person's an asshole. You know,

1651
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:05,600
that person doesn't give a fuck about the
truth. They don't give a fuck about me.

1652
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,380
They just,

1653
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:09,920
and I've had a few of those in my life
and you just cut them loose and when you

1654
01:34:09,921 --> 01:34:12,590
cut them loose, like you're a
way better person, you're like,

1655
01:34:12,591 --> 01:34:15,020
your life is free and
easy. And I'm like, oh,

1656
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:18,530
it's not that I'm like
constantly engaged in conflict.

1657
01:34:18,531 --> 01:34:21,890
It's that if you surround yourself
with the wrong kind of people,

1658
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,860
you will be constantly
engaged in conflict.

1659
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:27,590
Whether you want it or whether you
have that intention or not. Like,

1660
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:29,780
it's not just about having
the right intentions,

1661
01:34:29,781 --> 01:34:32,420
you gotta make the right choices
as to who you put in your world.

1662
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:35,780
Because if you put a bunch of shitheads
that don't care about evolving,

1663
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:38,060
they don't care about getting it together
and all they're trying to do is pass

1664
01:34:38,061 --> 01:34:42,290
off a nonsense on you.
Oh you gotta fucking,

1665
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:44,720
you got a Shitty road.
You've got a shitty road ahead of you.

1666
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:49,400
You know I used to love guns.
I wasn't a gun up like your buddy,

1667
01:34:49,401 --> 01:34:52,130
but I loved guns. I love
having them. I loved them.

1668
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:56,930
And the same thing one day I was like,
every time I carry a gun that's a,

1669
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,010
let's put that out there almost right?

1670
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:04,670
It's like a magnet for other guns and
you're not the only one that says that.

1671
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,770
It's like a magnet. I'm telling
you, when I carried a gun,

1672
01:35:06,771 --> 01:35:09,860
I carry the Gulf for a very short
time because I didn't like it.

1673
01:35:09,861 --> 01:35:11,120
I didn't see the purpose for it.

1674
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:14,330
It's a nice thing to use
to try to be a tough guy,

1675
01:35:14,331 --> 01:35:17,060
but all it's going to do is
get you in fucking trouble.

1676
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:20,430
Cause you pull that motherfucker out
wanting motherfuckers going to pull that

1677
01:35:20,431 --> 01:35:24,710
money. You got real tough guys. And I
knew that going in. I fucking knew it.

1678
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:28,190
I wanted to fire it at somebody.
But I tell you what man,

1679
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:30,050
it was amazing how he used
to go home at night and go,

1680
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:31,850
what the fuck just happened tonight?

1681
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,530
Why did I have to go from my
reach from like Gunther it,

1682
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:40,990
why would it six other people in the
room and a coke party with guns because

1683
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:43,940
guns attract.
They're like fucking magnets.

1684
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,280
And one day I got rid of all those guns.

1685
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:51,080
It was like I lost 18 fucking pounds
of drama. The same thing 10 years ago,

1686
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,700
this phone would be ringing with people
that were asking me questions about,

1687
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:59,000
you know, how do you
get roadwork? You know,

1688
01:35:59,001 --> 01:36:00,740
why don't you take me on the fucking road.

1689
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:05,210
You know you can all these fucking people
calling you with these questions and

1690
01:36:05,211 --> 01:36:09,380
then at the same time they have low
concern for you. They really don't.

1691
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:11,800
They're just trying to pull you down.
Especially in this fucking town.

1692
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:14,900
If you let people pull you down,
but I don't know what you're doing.

1693
01:36:14,901 --> 01:36:17,180
It's not happening for me. What do
you want? What do you want me to do?

1694
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:20,900
You got like right and get on stage every
fucking night. What'd you do? Ask me. Oh,

1695
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:22,970
I went to my sister's wedding.
Well go fuck your mother.

1696
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:24,440
Then go to the fucking wedding.

1697
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,660
You were one of the last guys
that picking that out too.

1698
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:32,360
It Burns my fucking core that people
come up to you and put their lack of

1699
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:34,910
Vietnam.
I saw somebody,

1700
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:38,990
but I started calling me with
at the store 13 years ago.

1701
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,980
I was going to screen some stupid
movie that my buddy was in.

1702
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:44,270
My wife was sleeping.

1703
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:47,920
So let me go down there and as I
was walking around the corner, her,

1704
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:51,140
Joey and I went up and I go,
I didn't even know who was.

1705
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:55,550
And he was telling me what he was doing
in front of their house. He was working,

1706
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:59,630
you hear about this?
And he was telling me,

1707
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:01,400
you know what he was doing
there and what he was,

1708
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:06,380
he was working and I drove back to
fucking studio city with like tears in my

1709
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:10,160
eyes because he had every
opportunity that I had.

1710
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:13,910
He was a good look and knew when they
moved to this fucking town. But to him,

1711
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:18,890
he used to go to the store and drink
and everything was how e and now I'm

1712
01:37:18,891 --> 01:37:22,970
supposed to feel guilty on the fucking
one-on-one cause this fucking schmucks

1713
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:27,230
got a job working until fucking two in
the morning parking cars or something,

1714
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:30,620
you know? I mean, we all had
the same opportunities here.

1715
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,170
Well there's people that feel like those
people in your life to teach you that

1716
01:37:33,171 --> 01:37:33,591
lesson.

1717
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:37,790
To see people fail and have regrets and
see people not give 100% or not give it

1718
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:40,970
all their focus or give it all
their honesty, you know, give it,

1719
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:42,560
give it who the fuck you really are.

1720
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:47,450
We see those people and that regret is
almost there to let us know like don't

1721
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:49,730
ever let that happen again.
As I was getting in my car,

1722
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:54,020
he made a comment and he was one of
those guys always had to have that one

1723
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:57,870
comment that the store,
they may like a fucking comment.

1724
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:00,810
I just want to say
something about something.

1725
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:04,860
It must've been nice doing blow all
those years, like something just,

1726
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:08,080
you know what I'm saying? Like he's one
of those guys that he's put you down,

1727
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,800
right. He had a, and I just got
in the car, like I said, you know,

1728
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:14,760
this is why that guy's
parking cars and you know,

1729
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,760
I'm on the fucking road work and
at least try to make things happen.

1730
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:19,490
This is why this guy is barking.
Fucking,

1731
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,330
there was a guy that I want
to mention his name but you a,

1732
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:24,150
you'd warned me about him a long time ago,

1733
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,820
long before it ever went real bad form.

1734
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:28,560
And then one time I was back in the east
coast and the guy hadn't done comedy

1735
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:32,370
and he fucking a couple of years and he's
like trying to get ahold of me to open

1736
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:33,930
up for me. Like what? You just,

1737
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,990
you just got to get back on stage after
a couple of years and open up at the big

1738
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:40,500
show. Like really? That's
where you're going to do? Oh,
you had your fucking mind.

1739
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:43,920
Like what kind of weird request is that
you haven't done comedy in two years.

1740
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,520
You, you want to go up and a in front
of a sold out club. Like that's,

1741
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,570
that's ridiculous.

1742
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,970
Like why would you think that you
could just do that like you get,

1743
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:51,953
but that's what they,

1744
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:54,900
there's a lot of guys that didn't make
any comedy that felt like they didn't

1745
01:38:54,901 --> 01:38:56,010
make it because nobody helped him.

1746
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:01,100
And I've heard that so many times I've
heard that stupid argument like I wasn't

1747
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:03,870
in with the right group or if
you're not in with the right group,

1748
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:06,090
it's very hard to get roadwork
like what are you talking about?

1749
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:08,880
What do you all you have to do is be
funny. If you're funny, people find you.

1750
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:14,070
It's one of the easiest businesses of all
time. You get proven onstage for sure.

1751
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:17,340
Easiest to understand. This is how
easy it works. You go on stage,

1752
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:20,790
you get the people to laugh,
people notice. Then they
started offering your work.

1753
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,833
It's that simple.

1754
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:26,070
When you prove that you have a certain
amount of time and you prove that you can

1755
01:39:26,071 --> 01:39:27,570
consistently perform really well.

1756
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,880
People want to give you some
mark that give you a little here.

1757
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:33,240
They give you a little there. You make
some connections, you start networking.

1758
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,540
The next thing you know you started,
you know moving in your area a little bit,

1759
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:39,930
getting a few gigs here and there and
it takes fucking years and you've got to

1760
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:42,390
keep doing it. If you don't keep doing
it, then you really didn't want to do it.

1761
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:43,680
But if you do keep doing it,

1762
01:39:43,681 --> 01:39:46,500
you get to a point where you're Joey
Diaz and if you're one of those guys that

1763
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:50,250
didn't really want to do it and one day
you see Joey Diaz and he said it moves

1764
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:53,570
been good foot. Duke cuckold
Hoosiers. Hmm, you're there.

1765
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:56,010
You're like a living lesson.
Like that guy's like a little,

1766
01:39:56,011 --> 01:39:57,690
a little stop on your journey.

1767
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:01,480
Well, it's a book. I broke my on
the drive home. I was like, wow.

1768
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:05,440
And when I had the same opportunities,
we both walked into that store.

1769
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:10,700
He used to get spots. He was
good. He was decent. Yeah,

1770
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:13,450
showed potential whatever,
nine o'clock spots,

1771
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:18,370
couple belly room spots and now you're
out here with fucking the 11 o'clock at

1772
01:40:18,371 --> 01:40:19,890
night and you know like wow,
that's,

1773
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:23,850
that's with everything Joey. That's
with music. That's with writing.

1774
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:27,810
That's with anything where it's up to
you to create what you put out there.

1775
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:29,290
It's a lot of people fucking false.

1776
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,240
What's Bill Hicks? His friends not
think of the guy from Portland,

1777
01:40:32,241 --> 01:40:36,720
Oregon that he was started at Houston
width and they both will pour on them.

1778
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:42,560
Let me talking about comic. Yeah, he
was important. He's from Houston, Texas.

1779
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:46,040
Also guy with all the tattoos all
over her. I don't know. He uh,

1780
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:50,640
they did comedy at some place in Houston.
Not Jimmy Pineapple. No, no, no, no, no.

1781
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:53,740
To kind of, what was a funny
Tennyson, this kid is, is still alive

1782
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,730
and he's still on the road. Yeah.
Yeah. Jimmy Pineapple still. He didn't,

1783
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:58,420
this guy is in Portland,
Oregon.

1784
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:04,270
I'm not sure. I didn't hear
anything. Dale Dame. Uh,

1785
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:08,440
I think he's even managed by somebody in
La cause he was doing some gigs at the

1786
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:08,981
Improv.

1787
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:13,981
I saw he wrote something 25 years
ago about his after bill died,

1788
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:17,830
about his relationship with bill,

1789
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:21,790
how bill moved to La and he got
married and build it the tonight show.

1790
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:26,290
I had a kid and bill did HBO.

1791
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,820
I had another kid and bill was on tour
and while we still remained friends,

1792
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:33,520
it was a beautiful and he goes,
I never had jealousy for him.

1793
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:36,460
All I wanted was the best because I knew
that he used the one that they used to

1794
01:41:36,461 --> 01:41:39,130
do comedy at the pizza
place with in Houston,

1795
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,070
Texas early on pizza place.
They should do.

1796
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:45,820
Yeah, I know who you're talking about,
but I don't know who you're talking about.

1797
01:41:45,821 --> 01:41:50,570
Mac, Lindsey. There was a no, no, no.
There was a bunch of those guys from that.

1798
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:52,400
Why would you even say Mac Lindsey?
Because I thought that,

1799
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:53,900
I mean he used to hang out with that.

1800
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:56,840
Lindsay was so much
younger than those guys.

1801
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:00,020
More than 15 years younger
than those guys. Easily.

1802
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:04,370
Maybe even 20 white slate slate. That's
it. To white slave boy. It's lit.

1803
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:08,350
Also went up to Portland.
Uh,

1804
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,140
yeah, those guys, those comedy outlaws.

1805
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:15,730
What's fascinating about all those guys
was how much they were so obviously

1806
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,000
influenced by Kennison.
Those guys got in a world,

1807
01:42:20,001 --> 01:42:23,170
I mean they were very talented guys.
I worked at Jimmy, Jimmy Pineapple,

1808
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:25,510
one of the first times they ever
came to Houston at the last stop.

1809
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:29,020
Very funny guy. But they were
all real good, real solid comics.

1810
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:34,410
But they were so obviously caught up in
the the wave of this one wild fucking

1811
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:37,240
maniac.
Even when I first saw Hicks,

1812
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:40,510
Hicks had like all these
Kinison mannerisms,

1813
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:42,070
like he probably didn't even realize it.

1814
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:46,960
He was like so used to being around
Kennison and Kennison just being the man

1815
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:52,230
like 86 86 Kennison was like
for people today cannot explode.

1816
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:57,100
They can't really understand what kind
of an impact that guy had on the world of

1817
01:42:57,101 --> 01:43:00,540
standup comedy. He threw the whole
fucking bored in the air. The whole,

1818
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,670
the whole thing was changed by one guy,

1819
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:08,530
this big fat guy screaming about pain.
Nobody had ever done that before.

1820
01:43:08,531 --> 01:43:13,300
It was a completely new thing and the
jokes were crisp and they were solid and

1821
01:43:13,301 --> 01:43:16,360
he got to the end. They had really good
points like about the kid in Africa,

1822
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:18,640
you know about being married.
I wasn't making,

1823
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:21,250
you know like about going to hell
like hell would be like club med.

1824
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:25,840
Get Devil goes well he'd been married.
Wow, this is fucking old hat for you.

1825
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:29,770
Come on, I'll show you around. This is
where we tortured souls when he would,

1826
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,580
when he would talk about like
his life and his payment,

1827
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:35,440
it gets fucking red in
the face and scream out.

1828
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:40,360
There was nothing like that, nothing
like that at the time. And so these guys,

1829
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,570
they're all the, all these
outlaws, the comedy outlaws,

1830
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:46,870
they all got swept up in
the wake of this mad genius,

1831
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:52,310
a mad genius with a head injury.
You know, his story is fucking book.

1832
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:55,910
His book is Great. His brother wrote a
book called, uh, my brother Sam. Sam.

1833
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:00,960
It's a great fucking book. If you're a
standup comic, you, I'll give it to you.

1834
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:04,580
I find that I get it for you on Amazon.
See if we can find it on Amazon.

1835
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,680
I'm sure there's probably some
used copies that are available.

1836
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:10,430
It's a great fucking book.
I read that and Seattle in 95,

1837
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:13,790
one of the most important
parts of stories. How can,
it seems like a regular kid,

1838
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:18,050
normal, shy and regular kid
gets hit by a fucking car.

1839
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,260
He get hurt, like really
bad, like bad head injury.

1840
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:24,860
And then he comes out of that
just a wild motherfucker,

1841
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:28,940
which is wild and reckless
and confident and crazy.

1842
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:33,560
Like literally he got head injuries into
being the greatest comic of all time

1843
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:38,440
because he went from there like right
into like he was doing all that invent

1844
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:43,400
gelical preaching and he took that
energy and wrote it right in to stand up.

1845
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:46,850
And a lot of it came about. Most
likely if you listened to his brother,

1846
01:44:46,851 --> 01:44:48,050
who knows better than anybody.

1847
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:50,870
It's the personality changes
because of a head injury

1848
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:56,120
that's fucking crazy. His brother was
crazy effort. They were all crazy.

1849
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:59,450
Just brothers. Carla bowl was
crazy. All those dudes were crazy.

1850
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:03,350
Call the Bose still out there banging
and banging it, hitting the clubs.

1851
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:07,010
The clubs still loves it. You
know? Look, even, you know,

1852
01:45:07,011 --> 01:45:10,340
somebody tried to explain this to me
once a long time ago about standup comedy

1853
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,840
and he was like,
look man,

1854
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,250
even if you just earn
enough to make a living,

1855
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:20,810
he earned the live in talent jokes,
jokes. Oh, it's like everywhere you go,

1856
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:23,570
you're making people laugh.
You're having a good time.

1857
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:27,470
They're enjoying themselves and you feed
yourself that way. That's fantastic.

1858
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:29,630
He goes,
if you can do that to the day you die,

1859
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:32,820
do it because it's the best way to live.
And I was,

1860
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:35,180
I remember like that totally makes sense.

1861
01:45:35,181 --> 01:45:39,860
Like even if you're just a guy who
never really makes it but can kind of

1862
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:43,810
headline enough to bring a good
crowd, you know, and half, you know,

1863
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:46,930
half filled clubs all across the
country, you're going to get by. Well you

1864
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:50,850
made it, especially now with see these
and tee shirts and hats and Yoyos.

1865
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:56,290
You don't have the opportunity
now, Twitter and Twitter, youtube,

1866
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:59,290
even a low income, it
could make, you know,

1867
01:45:59,291 --> 01:46:02,170
so it guy that's not working
the Improv per se. Okay.

1868
01:46:02,171 --> 01:46:04,670
Let's say a guy that doesn't work
the Improv's with a funny bones.

1869
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:08,610
There's a thousand clubs,
there's still a lot of cloud of clothes,

1870
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,780
a lot of clubs at Ohio U,
you know,

1871
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:14,230
Husky and then there's like
the Austin Room and all those.

1872
01:46:14,231 --> 01:46:15,880
But then there's an underbelly to that.

1873
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:22,360
They're going to open up another
room in Tempe but listen to them.

1874
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:26,470
Yeah. And the spring. So that's who's
going to open it. The people who won't,

1875
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:30,950
Rick Bronson's Comedy Club in
Minneapolis in the old east orange. Wow.

1876
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:36,160
Uh, Easter. Other for that one at
Tempe. So you have stand up live,

1877
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,420
you have the Tempe Improv,

1878
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:40,840
you have standup Scottsdale and you
have the other one in Scottsdale.

1879
01:46:40,841 --> 01:46:44,410
That's for holy shovel one night.
And you have this place coming in.

1880
01:46:44,411 --> 01:46:47,250
[inaudible] six rooms in
the Arizona area outlined,

1881
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:50,430
well it's always been like a very comedy

1882
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:51,241
town.
You know,

1883
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:55,020
people that like to have fun and there's
not a lot of options in the Tempe

1884
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:57,480
Improv is one of the best options
in the area for the longest time.

1885
01:46:57,690 --> 01:47:02,160
So you've got like a whole community
that's been sort of raised on really good

1886
01:47:02,161 --> 01:47:05,250
combat. Like that's always been
an option. If you live in Tempe,

1887
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:09,210
that Improv is a big stop for a
lot of guys. So like every week,

1888
01:47:09,211 --> 01:47:13,030
you know you're going to get this guy
who's a national headlight or Brian cow

1889
01:47:13,031 --> 01:47:16,770
and Joey d if you're going to get that
kind of comedy like almost every weekend.

1890
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:18,100
So they they,

1891
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,970
they really built up a big audience
that I bet they can't even satisfy

1892
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:25,320
Tempe
called Dick Suckers are us.

1893
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,840
They got some Dick Sucking motherfucker.

1894
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:33,350
It's though they'll suck your dick wet
or dry coked up just with a shot at

1895
01:47:33,701 --> 01:47:35,830
Aspen.
They will suck that pipe anywhere.

1896
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:40,190
There are some nasty cocksuckers down
there. There's an organism I think pissed.

1897
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:43,050
Tell. Tell Brian about,
take your time. Hurry up.

1898
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:48,051
It's amazing how down there is where the
fucking women who love sucking cock for

1899
01:47:48,131 --> 01:47:51,810
like one day they'd go, fuck it.
Let's move to Arizona then this,

1900
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:56,910
everybody that result is hot and they
suck Dick. Fuck it. And they really do.

1901
01:47:56,911 --> 01:48:00,030
It's really a weird place. I
cannot believe it anymore, but

1902
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,280
what are you going to do?
You know what I'm saying?

1903
01:48:02,281 --> 01:48:04,630
What the fuck am I talking about?
I have no idea.

1904
01:48:04,631 --> 01:48:09,120
Is Anybody fucking though your movie
comes out this week because this week and

1905

you got to actually go to New York
and watch it. Did you enjoy it?

1906
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:16,370
Was it fun because this is your first
time seeing it, edit it. I guess too.

1907
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:20,790
I taught two times last week. Yeah, but
you liked it that much though. I saw it.

1908
01:48:20,791 --> 01:48:22,320
I had no choice.
You know what I'm saying?

1909
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:27,120
I it go with my wife and I went one
night in New York. He likes seeing,

1910
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:31,290

1911
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:35,820

you ever since I've known you,

1912
01:48:35,821 --> 01:48:37,270
you get confused with this guy,

1913
01:48:37,271 --> 01:48:39,840
you know and you eat and you usually
don't even tell people. You're like,

And they're like, I love you.
You know? I was like, yeah,

whatever. Get out of here. You know?

1916
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:47,010
I tried to tell him like sometimes
I ask people and they're like,

1917
01:48:47,011 --> 01:48:49,020
they'll stop me in the
UFC of those though.

1918
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:53,300
Why are you the best? Was The lady
who was asking me who I was like, oh,

1919
01:48:53,301 --> 01:48:57,000
so you stopped me to take a picture.
You don't know who the fuck I am.

1920
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,020
Fucking barrel cooler.
Cocksuckers

1921
01:48:59,110 --> 01:49:04,010
okay. And you said that he also
gets confused with you sometimes.

1922
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:07,770
At least that that day he did it.
It was nice.

1923
01:49:07,771 --> 01:49:11,990
It was really nice to finally meet him.
He gave me a big hug and oh

1924
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:20,150
his stat. Where did you do that? At the
premiere of the movie. So we being art,

1925
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,830
we were walking. He kind of, he looks at
me and he comes right over and he's like,

1926
01:49:22,831 --> 01:49:26,220
man, what the fuck? He goes,
I was just the bathroom.

1927
01:49:26,221 --> 01:49:29,060
People asking me how much fun
was it shoot with the there.

1928
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:33,000
And I kept telling him it wasn't made
and here you are. So he was very nice.

1929
01:49:33,001 --> 01:49:33,970
He was very nice to talk to.

1930
01:49:33,971 --> 01:49:37,720
You know they're using you in the clip
of you seen the trailer for smaller tray.

1931
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:40,320
All of them. They're using that
one line. It's like bad Baywatch.

1932
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:41,980
The power of the Internet though.

1933
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:45,540
That's the strength of the Joe Rogan
experience and the power of the motherfuck

1934
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:48,190
tell that story because that
story is fucking hilarious story.

1935
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,860
It's a crazy story.
Like they had no idea who you were.

1936
01:49:50,861 --> 01:49:52,420
They booked you because
they thought you were funny.

1937
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:57,100
You go to the premiere and when your
face is on the premiere. No, no, no, no.

1938
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:00,820
They shot the movie cause it
director referred me, right. He goes,

1939
01:50:00,821 --> 01:50:05,460
Joe was a hard shot. So they put me in
the movie, but then they take the movie,

1940
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:09,750
they show it in the Midwest and all these
places to see how it scores and where

1941
01:50:09,751 --> 01:50:12,850
they showed it. They don't show
no titles, no names, no nothing.

1942
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:16,310
And they give you a questionnaire
and one of the guys.

1943
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,790
So when I was shooting a movie,
everybody was very nice,

1944
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:19,990
but nobody really talked to me.

1945
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:23,590
Everybody had their Starbucks cup and
nobody asked me if I wanted Starbucks.

1946
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:26,260
You know what I'm saying though,
nobody asked me if I wanted to Starbucks,

1947
01:50:26,261 --> 01:50:28,990
which I wouldn't have drank coffee,
but Jesus Christ asked me.

1948
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:31,750
But I was just a fucking regular guy.
When they screened the films,

1949
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:36,500
I guess people started yelling, no
blue cheese, go fuck your mother. I go,

1950
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:41,170
what the fuck is going on? And all of
these reports came back. So they got it.

1951
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:46,480
So when I went to do the Adr, they will
all, they're like, come in, you know,

1952
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:50,120
every hill comes out of jail.
You broke it.

1953
01:50:50,121 --> 01:50:53,180
Cherry weird.
They didn't know who you were.

1954
01:50:54,990 --> 01:50:58,100
They didn't know that, you know,
this is big what we do here.

1955
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:00,410
That's why it's a fucking movement.
They didn't know that.

1956
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:04,070
So once they find out they started liking
my cigarettes and shit and rubbing my

1957
01:51:04,071 --> 01:51:07,690
shoulders. Well if you think about
what a a television show get,

1958
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,750
like the amount of people
that watch a television show,

1959
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:12,260
like have a television shows on
every week. How many people watch it?

1960
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:17,270
What's a big one? A big ones.
Like you know, like, like
what does duck dynasty get?

1961
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,790
It's the height. The
biggest ratings ever. Yeah.

1962
01:51:19,791 --> 01:51:22,330
They crushed us when we were
up against them on Scifi.

1963
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:23,960
It's like 14 million cable.

1964
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,080
It's not like the highest rate Keto
that you will get more hits than fucking

1965
01:51:27,081 --> 01:51:31,880
come out that show on Fx. I know
that you guys were killing that show.

1966
01:51:31,881 --> 01:51:35,190
We did very well on [inaudible].
Didn't have to come come up.

1967
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:40,130
The Joe Rogan podcast was getting more
downloads than that come l bell on Fx.

1968
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:42,660
Did you know that you
will get more downloads?

1969
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:46,820
There's people watching that shit that
spike put on with Randy and everybody.

1970
01:51:46,821 --> 01:51:47,810
No disrespect.
You know,

1971
01:51:47,811 --> 01:51:50,780
I love them in May that that
show they had on for a while.

1972
01:51:50,781 --> 01:51:53,630
You're talking about downloads, you're
talking about ratings, downloads,

1973
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:55,160
podcast viewers.

1974
01:51:55,161 --> 01:51:58,700
How many people would download and
watching this or listening to a show,

1975
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:03,080
the show that fucking come out had on Fx,
but you're not,

1976
01:52:03,081 --> 01:52:04,950
you're not talking about the Scifi show.
You're talking about pod.

1977
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,890
Got The side of the fight strong.

1978
01:52:06,090 --> 01:52:10,700
I'm talking about that more people watch
this to not show more people watch this

1979
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,590
then that fucking series they had before.
Glory on spike. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1980
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:19,400
You follow what I'm saying? More
people. It's amazing how many viewers,

1981
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:20,620
how many people watch.

1982
01:52:20,670 --> 01:52:24,710
It's amazing how many places I go now
that people hear the voice of God and show

1983
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,750
it is. I just heard you on the podcast
the other day, man. It's amazing.

1984
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:32,510
And the people that will say that.
Do you realize it or does it,

1985
01:52:32,511 --> 01:52:33,310
is it one thing is it,

1986
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:36,890
did it creep up on you and it like takes
you time to go holy shit. Like this is,

1987
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:39,820
this is actually getting kind of nutty.
Like when did you realize it?

1988
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:43,760
When did you, when did you realize
like the impact of doing stuff online?

1989
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,950
Year and a half ago,
I really felt the Urbino

1990
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:50,180
security people talking to me and they
say people, Tsa people talking to me.

1991
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:53,560
You know, Tsa people talk to
me now. Amen. How you doing?

1992
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:57,560
That was funny last time and you're right,
what you said about the Mars program,

1993
01:52:57,561 --> 01:53:01,340
whatever, how many people
will say shit to me? You know,

1994
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,300
this is huge.
This little movement is fucking huge.

1995
01:53:05,301 --> 01:53:08,780
Where we're closing in on 8 million
downloads a month and that doesn't include

1996
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:11,750
stitcher and that doesn't
show you to reuse stream.

1997
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:15,530
Such a million crazy show close to.
It's seven 50 and then whatever it is,

1998
01:53:15,531 --> 01:53:19,490
it's a lot. It's a lot of individuals.
That is, I don't know. That's a lot.

1999
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:22,340
That's a fucking lot. It's
definitely not 8 million. I mean,

2000
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:23,720
I don't know how many admit it is.

2001
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,340
There's a lot of different
people downloading it.

2002
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,770
Definitely killing half
the TV shows on television.

2003
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:32,510
If they go by anybody's killing anything,
you know, it's just a different thing.

2004
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:36,110
It's just they didn't have it before.
Before people were stuck,

2005
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:38,460
they were stuck with radio
or they'd have to, you know,

2006
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:41,570
bring a cassette or you know, they
listen to books on tape. That was like,

2007
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:44,870
you're only good option, but now they
can do whatever the fuck they want.

2008
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:47,600
There's so much shit you get download,
you listen to your podcast.

2009
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:48,500
This isn't a Dunkin's.

2010
01:53:48,501 --> 01:53:52,250
You could download a a Dan Carlin
podcasts and learn about some history.

2011
01:53:52,251 --> 01:53:55,790
You could download us, you know,
science podcasts he get, I mean,

2012
01:53:55,850 --> 01:54:00,770
there's the numbers of podcasts now or
just fucking staggering the options that

2013
01:54:00,771 --> 01:54:05,540
a person has. That's why I keep telling
people, you can't charge money for this.

2014
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:07,490
Like if you think you're going
to get away with charging money,

2015
01:54:07,491 --> 01:54:09,600
you're going to make a little bit
money from the people you charge,

2016
01:54:09,601 --> 01:54:12,290
but you're ultimately going to fuck
yourself because it's going to slow your

2017
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:14,050
growth down.
Your,

2018
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:18,110
your growth is best achieved if you
follow the spirit of the Internet.

2019
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:21,950
Spirit of the Internet is give people
freak shit, give people free shit.

2020
01:54:21,951 --> 01:54:24,830
That's good. And that way when you
develop a relationship with them,

2021
01:54:24,831 --> 01:54:27,830
you develop a relationship where you've
already given them something like,

2022
01:54:27,831 --> 01:54:31,040
you know, like you're not just constantly
asking them to buy your tickets,

2023
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,900
constantly asking them to do this.

2024
01:54:32,901 --> 01:54:37,901
It's a like a really easy free thing and
you're happy that they enjoy it and you

2025
01:54:38,751 --> 01:54:40,190
do it in a spirit of that.

2026
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:42,470
Not even in the spirit of
trying to make money off of it.

2027
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:45,470
And then it's all sorts
of falls into place.

2028
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:49,160
And that's what's happened with
all of us up at four 45 of them.

2029
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:52,320
You're ridiculous. You do it in the
weirdest way. I fucking love it.

2030
01:54:52,330 --> 01:54:55,540
You just hurt Brian's feelings.
I usually watch the first half.

2031
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:00,290
I had a Texas motherfucker twice at noon.
Tell him that the podcast is it too,

2032
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:01,553
like,
oh,

2033
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:07,090
I could wake up with a pair of underwear
across his face trying to find this

2034
01:55:08,131 --> 01:55:11,870
mother fucker. Molly Dodd who said
every night, yeah, he's going to die.

2035
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:14,360
I'm not going to make it.
When I get up, listen to this.

2036
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:17,780
Some nights I go to bed or they like,
when I come back on a Sunday,

2037
01:55:17,781 --> 01:55:21,550
I'm dead five shows all weekend,
you know, five hours a night.

2038
01:55:21,710 --> 01:55:26,180
I fucking go to bed at fucking six this
sudden nights I get up at three and I'm

2039
01:55:26,181 --> 01:55:29,030
looking at your Instagram,
so you're going to fucking pink dot.

2040
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:32,240
You're going to the other place.
You'd take pictures of pancakes.

2041
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:34,070
You're living like we were living.

2042
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:37,520
You were living like essentially like we
were living in the 90s yeah, it's, it's,

2043
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:40,460
it's a life of a comic. It's
the life of a comic. You know,

2044
01:55:40,461 --> 01:55:45,330
you're going to bed as I'm getting up,
you and Ari. Ari is fucking up all hours.

2045
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:49,670
He's a full savage.
I looked at his Instagram the other day.

2046
01:55:49,671 --> 01:55:51,660
I have photos of all the
spots he's doing in town.

2047
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:52,950
This is mother fuckers don't like five,

2048
01:55:52,951 --> 01:55:56,330
six bucks at night going all
around New York from like eight,

2049
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:59,010
8:00 PM on, you know, he's got spots.

2050
01:55:59,011 --> 01:56:03,870
All he's at 1:00 AM spots at Caroline's
and shit. He just going up. But he's,

2051
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,230
he's getting excited by it.
Speaking of exciting this weekend,

2052
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:08,970
ladies and gentlemen at the Mirage,

2053
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:12,450
the greatest line up ever been
to put together ever. Joey Diaz,

2054
01:56:12,451 --> 01:56:16,170
Brian Cowen and Ari Shaffir,
God damn.

2055
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:20,310
And me and uh, at the Mirage. Yeah. I
mean, yeah. I don't even need to be there.

2056
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:21,870
So this show that's so fucking good.

2057
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:25,950
I can just just bring everybody up and
say goodnight. It'd be fucking beautiful.

2058
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:29,130
Yeah. My, I might just take the, no,
I'm going to tell some jokes, but look,

2059
01:56:29,131 --> 01:56:33,030
you can't, can't get a better lamp. No,
we've never done a crazier show them that.

2060
01:56:33,031 --> 01:56:35,640
That's the craziest show I've
ever done for headliners.

2061
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:38,880
Everybody having a good time. It'll be
sold out. It's almost sold out already.

2062
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:43,310
And it's at the Mirage at
the Terry Fator. Uh, he,

2063
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,600
I guess he has his own theater there.
I've never seen it before,

2064
01:56:45,601 --> 01:56:48,690
but it's supposed to be a
sweet, sweet room. We're gonna
have a good fucking time.

2065
01:56:48,691 --> 01:56:51,630
Joe. Just a room was in the fucking head.
What's going on with the fight? This,

2066
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:56,100
I want you to go there man, but you're not
going to be there. I know. No one knows.

2067
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:59,910
You know. Look, it's this, it's a
crazy fight. Anderson Silva all time,

2068
01:56:59,911 --> 01:57:02,040
greatest mixed martial artists
that's ever lived. I mean,

2069
01:57:02,041 --> 01:57:07,041
he's got stellar his entire career
dominating champions strangling Dan

2070
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,950
Henderson, knocking out veto over
the fucking front kick to the face,

2071
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:13,650
the greatest martial artists that's
ever walked the face here is a guy lives

2072
01:57:13,651 --> 01:57:17,160
like he's in a fucking movie
and he gets clipped. Boom,

2073
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:21,060
he gets hurt and a dude plays basketball
with his head. Boom, boom, boom.

2074
01:57:21,061 --> 01:57:23,790
And he's out and he, and he, you
know, referee has to rescue him.

2075
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:28,750
And it all came about in large
part due to him clowning. Well,

2076
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:33,790
what people don't realize is there was a
moment in that first round where he had

2077
01:57:34,081 --> 01:57:38,130
Anderson Silva really hurt and it was
not when he was going for the heel hook,

2078
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,180
it was um,

2079
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:44,180
he was ground and pounding Anderson and
he blasted him on the Chin and you see

2080
01:57:44,911 --> 01:57:47,820
Anderson's head bounce off the
ground. He realized like, Whoa,

2081
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:52,230
that is a fucking hard shot. And
he got clipped with, he got hurt,

2082
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:56,100
his eyes roll up and roll back.
He got really rocked.

2083
01:57:56,370 --> 01:58:01,370
And I think that severely influenced
his decision to try to up the antics and

2084
01:58:02,071 --> 01:58:05,100
really drag Weidman into a standup banner,

2085
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:06,480
which he thought he
would have the advantage.

2086
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:10,350
But I think one of the reasons why he
got clipped with that left hook and all

2087
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:13,260
that clown and around was because
he got fucking hurt on the ground.

2088
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:16,710
And I think he really didn't want to go
there. He almost got his leg ripped off.

2089
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:19,560
He got out of the leg lock and
who knows if his knee popped,

2090
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:21,930
he could have easily popped his
knee in that exchange was quite a,

2091
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:26,070
a deep leg lock.
And then he goes from there and you know,

2092
01:58:26,071 --> 01:58:30,000
he's trying to go to into a
standup war and he's like,
come on, stand up, stand up.

2093
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:30,391
You know?

2094
01:58:30,391 --> 01:58:33,230
And then he's kicking him and taunting
him and pretending that he's hurt and

2095
01:58:33,231 --> 01:58:36,150
drunk.
But Weidman is just a motherfucker dude.

2096
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,500
And he clips him and knocks him out.

2097
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:41,190
So the question comes when you're
coming into this fight, it's like, wow.

2098
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:45,370
Much different would the result have
been if Anderson just treated it like a

2099
01:58:45,371 --> 01:58:46,510
fucking Samurai,

2100
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:51,750
if he went in there with no antics and
just laser beam precision striking chops,

2101
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:56,410
those legs up eventually lands a big head
kick or something, you know, who knows?

2102
01:58:56,470 --> 01:59:00,250
Who knows what would happen? We'll
see this weekend while we won't even,

2103
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:04,810
because he didn't do it then.
So who is he now and who is Weidman now?

2104
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:08,410
You know, the first fight is going to be
one of the most mysterious fights ever.

2105
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:11,450
It's going to be one of the most hotly
debated fights ever because everyone's

2106
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:14,980
always going to say, what
would have happened if
Anderson wasn't fucking around?

2107
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:19,570
What would have happened if Anderson
took that dude super serious and just

2108
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:22,570
stayed super disciplined in the feet
and was able to just like in the sun and

2109
01:59:22,571 --> 01:59:24,400
fight to get taken down the first round,

2110
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:26,890
but then keep the fight standing for
the rest of the fight and then put them

2111
01:59:26,891 --> 01:59:30,160
away. Who knows? We won't
know. We don't know anymore,

2112
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:35,020
but we do know is that Chris Weidman
knocked Anderson silver the fuck out and

2113
01:59:35,021 --> 01:59:35,920
that's shocking.

2114
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:40,180
He's the greatest fighter of all time
and Weidman clipped him with a fucking

2115
01:59:40,181 --> 01:59:45,181
long left hook but bank right on the chin
dropped him and then finished him off

2116
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,100
and he's going to be so
confident coming into this fight.

2117
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:51,490
It was just going to be a
really interesting fight
because I think Anderson is

2118
01:59:51,491 --> 01:59:55,300
going to be real confident cause Anderson
knows that if he minds his p's and q's

2119
01:59:55,301 --> 01:59:56,290
and keeps the fight standing,

2120
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:59,140
he should have a pretty distinct advantage
as long as he doesn't do anything

2121
01:59:59,141 --> 02:00:04,030
silly like the last time and then
to Weidman is already beat him.

2122
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:06,730
Weidman's already knocked him out.
Weidman's gotten better.

2123
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,900
Weidman still young Weidman just had
that Regena keen shit done on his knees.

2124
02:00:10,901 --> 02:00:14,520
He went to Germany for a week to get
his knees treated and apparently he's,

2125
02:00:14,570 --> 02:00:18,580
he's got his whole workout.
Like everything he does,
you could do it online.

2126
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:22,210
Everything he does, he like, he, he, he,
he puts it online so people can watch,

2127
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:25,930
puts up his diet, puts up his workout
schedule, tells Anderson when it's,

2128
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:28,460
his strategy is, it
doesn't give a fuck. Sadly,

2129
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,610
it's not gonna it's not gonna matter.
I'm going to get them.

2130
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:34,180
It's a fascinating fight.
It's fucking fascinating.

2131
02:00:34,181 --> 02:00:35,710
I don't know what's going to happen,
man.

2132
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:39,640
I have no idea if Anderson went out
and knocked him out. I mean, yeah,

2133
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:42,130
that's a possibility. If Weidman
took them down and submitted them,

2134
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:45,370
that's a possibility. Weidman knocked
him out. That's a possibility.

2135
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:49,900
What of Anderson Takes Weidman's back
and submits him? Who the fuck knows? Man?

2136
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:54,340
That'd be a good, that's a wild fight.
And it's for legacy too. For Anderson.

2137
02:00:54,341 --> 02:00:56,170
This is for legacy.
You know,

2138
02:00:56,171 --> 02:01:01,171
Anderson suffered like that's
a humiliating defeat and
especially when he knows

2139
02:01:01,871 --> 02:01:04,630
that there's a lot of people that
blame it on his clowning, you know,

2140
02:01:04,631 --> 02:01:06,970
that's like an for Brazil like Brazil got.

2141
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:10,030
There was a lot of times where
he went to Brazil where you know,

2142
02:01:10,031 --> 02:01:14,770
people were like disappointed he was
their champion, not just the champion,

2143
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:17,770
but the greatest champion and he came
from their country. There's a lot of,

2144
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:21,720
and he feels that disappointment and he
wants to make them happy and this fight,

2145
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:26,400
I think this is going to be very
intense. I'm fucking pumped. God. Yes.

2146
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:30,850
I wish you would give them the card Josh.
Josh Barnett against.

2147
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:35,200
That's a good fight though,
against Travis Travis Hoppa Brown.

2148
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:38,380
Lots of very good Rhonda and
Rhonda Rousey. Miesha Tate,

2149
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:41,960
Josh Barnett and Travis
Browne is a dangerous fight.

2150
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:43,840
That's a tricky fight for both guys.

2151
02:01:43,841 --> 02:01:48,320
King Kong that Travis Brown might be one
of the toughest motherfuckers thought

2152
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:53,420
he's a big boy. He's six,
seven. Travis Brown. I would
say he's, if I had to guess,

2153
02:01:53,421 --> 02:01:57,500
I would say he's at least six, five, six,
six, six, five, somewhere around there.

2154
02:01:57,501 --> 02:02:02,300
He's a big boy, but he's also, he moves
good man. He moves light on its feet,

2155
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:07,540
striking Mr motherfucking Overeem's
front kick to the face dude.

2156
02:02:08,211 --> 02:02:12,470
And that was after taking a far
road eating in that first round,

2157
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:17,830
he took a beating that would have stopped
99.999% of the people on the planet if

2158
02:02:18,951 --> 02:02:20,930
they were in that position
taking those kinds of shots.

2159
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:25,940
Alastar was murdering him with knees
and there's nobody throws needs like

2160
02:02:25,941 --> 02:02:28,580
Alister have you never seen
Alistair Overeem fight?

2161
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:32,840
Alistair Overeem was the k one Grand
Prix champion and he's a super high level

2162
02:02:32,841 --> 02:02:33,980
kickboxer for MMA.

2163
02:02:33,981 --> 02:02:37,400
Like one of the most high level guys
to ever fight in MMA in the heavyweight

2164
02:02:37,401 --> 02:02:37,701
division,

2165
02:02:37,701 --> 02:02:41,930
especially in that mother fucker delivers
knees and a totally different way.

2166
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:46,280
It's all just hip and technique
and torque and a lump.

2167
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:49,370
I mean those fucking knees
go deep into your soul.

2168
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:53,360
They pass through your skin and push your
fucking belly right into your backbone.

2169
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:57,770
Like they make your body go numb because
he's literally smashing his knee all

2170
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:59,390
the way into your nerves.
I mean,

2171
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:02,510
they're ruthless knees and
his whole body gives out.

2172
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:07,070
He goes down and he's just getting
fucking pound it and you thinking they're

2173
02:03:07,071 --> 02:03:11,130
going to stop this fight any second now.
And he figures out a way to get up and,

2174
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:15,920
and, and then Allister gets tired and
then he gets up and Alistair is clearly

2175
02:03:15,921 --> 02:03:19,190
exhausted because he's triangle
head kicks. Right. He kept
throwing. Uh Huh. Right.

2176
02:03:19,290 --> 02:03:23,240
I been that truck and he landed that
one straight up the middle right to the

2177
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:26,600
chin and Alistair's legs give
out and Travis finishes him off.

2178
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:30,630
It's one of the greatest comebacks. Was
I to fight? It was supposed to be, uh,

2179
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:37,350
I don't know, but via got hurt. I
don't know if he scheduled. Who's, uh,

2180
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:42,210
let me find out right now. Mia
got hurt. Somebody got hurt.

2181
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:47,970
Yeah. I wonder. I wonder
who he is supposed to be
fighting next. I don't know.

2182
02:03:48,450 --> 02:03:52,800
I don't know. Let me find that out.
I'll find that out. Next fight.

2183
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:58,230
He's a guy that, uh, a lot of
people thought he was going to,

2184
02:03:58,231 --> 02:03:59,820
especially after the Brock Lesnar fight,

2185
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:03,420
a lot of people thought that he was
going to be the fucking man. Oh,

2186
02:04:03,421 --> 02:04:08,310
he's fighting Frank Mir. He's
supposed to hard cheeses. UFC One 69,

2187
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:13,110
which is the super bowl. Yeah, that's
right. Wow, that's crazy fight man.

2188
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:17,790
Both guys got a lot to lose. Was on the
super bowl card. It's a good question.

2189
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,420
I think it's Hanan Barao and
Dominick Cruz is the main event

2190
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:26,040
that's a, that's a, that's going to
be a big fight for the east coast.

2191
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,810
And still to this day,

2192
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:32,550
it can't be legal in New York.
It's fucking crazy.

2193
02:04:32,551 --> 02:04:35,870
It's one of the, the
weirdest as far as like, uh,

2194
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:40,940
examples of how corruption shapes what
people are allowed to enjoy and not a

2195
02:04:41,701 --> 02:04:44,250
joy.
It's a,

2196
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:47,340
they figured out a way to
keep the UFC Adam, New York,

2197
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:51,430
despite a giant hit to the
economy. I mean, they take money.

2198
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:54,210
They're taking money away from New York
by not letting it come to New York.

2199
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:54,860
It would,

2200
02:04:54,860 --> 02:04:57,990
it would bring hundreds of millions of
dollars in revenue to restaurants and

2201
02:04:57,991 --> 02:05:01,740
local bars. And I mean, the,
the impact would be huge.

2202
02:05:01,741 --> 02:05:05,310
The Prestige would be huge. People would
love to see it and they still, they have,

2203
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:06,630
it's not like they don't
have combat sports.

2204
02:05:06,631 --> 02:05:09,960
They have boxing regularly in New York.
They have kickboxing,

2205
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:12,570
they've had glory in New York.
They had glory high, you know,

2206
02:05:12,571 --> 02:05:15,270
high level kickboxing and Madison
Square Garden. It's amazing.

2207
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:17,010
These motherfuckers,
they're there,

2208
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:20,670
they're figuring out a way to keep
people from enjoying what they want.

2209
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:24,030
But you know what, man, there's
always going to be that.

2210
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:24,960
This is always going to be,

2211
02:05:24,961 --> 02:05:28,410
that there's always going to be people
that are trying to make money off of

2212
02:05:28,411 --> 02:05:30,690
something. If for folks who don't
even know what it's all about,

2213
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:35,340
the culinary union keeps the UFC out of
New York and they know that it's a big

2214
02:05:35,341 --> 02:05:39,030
event for New York. Um,
but they want the UFC.

2215
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:43,650
UFC is owned by Zoomba and zoo for
also own station casinos, same guys.

2216
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:47,940
And they want them to go union
to Culinary Union wants those,

2217
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:51,190
those hotels to go union. So they're
taking all their dues and they're,

2218
02:05:51,191 --> 02:05:54,740
they're battling the UFC hardcore.
They develop these like crazy websites.

2219
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:56,730
They contact gay and lesbian groups.

2220
02:05:56,731 --> 02:06:01,530
They do everything they can to try to
like make a big force against the UFC.

2221
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:05,340
The crazy thing is they contact gay and
lesbian groups, but the UFC is like they,

2222
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:08,100
they're openly in support
of gay and lesbian rights.

2223
02:06:08,130 --> 02:06:13,130
They actually donate money to the various
centers and the UFC is like totally

2224
02:06:13,201 --> 02:06:15,690
open minded firefighters. Fighters
had been reprimanded for you know,

2225
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:19,870
calling people gay slurs and things along
those lines. Then they're not, you know,

2226
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:23,530
the culinary union is just trying
to figure out a way to get the UFC.

2227
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:27,540
It's amazing because if they did it, but
if they did, if they switched over union,

2228
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:29,550
it would be worth millions
of dollars to the union.

2229
02:06:29,970 --> 02:06:32,910
It's kind of fascinating stuff because
on one hand you go, well, you know,

2230
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:33,900
unions are important.

2231
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:37,440
If a guy wants to earn a good wage and
you want to make sure that they have some

2232
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:40,290
leverage and buying power
and people should get paid.

2233
02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:44,910
But when you see shit like this, like
how could this be right? Like you, you,

2234
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:48,480
the people that worked for those casinos
voted against doing the union thing.

2235
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:52,290
The whole thing is a mess. It's just
like, it's just conti corruption.

2236
02:06:52,291 --> 02:06:55,380
And it's gotten to the point where
you're like, they can't back down.

2237
02:06:55,381 --> 02:06:58,500
Now they've been spending money trying
to keep the UFC out for so long,

2238
02:06:58,501 --> 02:07:02,520
but you just putting your finger on a dike
and there's a, there's a hole in that,

2239
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:03,090
in that,

2240
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:07,350
in that fucking dam and more holes are
going to start popping up and eventually

2241
02:07:07,351 --> 02:07:11,100
it's just going to overwhelm you. You're
still spending all these, it'd be insane.

2242
02:07:11,101 --> 02:07:12,840
It'd be the same.
They're still spending all this union.

2243
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:14,400
Dude's trying to keep it out.
You know,

2244
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,760
it's just so unfortunate were shit
like that happens with two things.

2245
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:21,240
Get entangled, you know, businesses
getting tangled. So this, uh,

2246
02:07:21,241 --> 02:07:25,770
the card in UFC in New Jersey's
is a sick fucking card.

2247
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:29,370
It's Dominick Cruz, Hanan Barao, which
is cruise had been out for two years,

2248
02:07:29,371 --> 02:07:31,170
man with two different knee surgeries.

2249
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:36,670
One Cadaver ACL graft that blew
out on him. His body rejected it,

2250
02:07:36,671 --> 02:07:38,410
and then you had to go back in again,

2251
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:42,610
another nine months of Rehab and then
three months of training so it loses on

2252
02:07:42,611 --> 02:07:45,580
ball shots. He loses a
year. Fucking incredible.

2253
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:48,940
So he's finally back fight in
the interim champion and Barao.

2254
02:07:48,941 --> 02:07:52,930
And then you've got Joe say
Aldo Fighting Ricardo Lamas.

2255
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:57,580
That's a great fucking fight then. And
then you got me. Or versus Overeem.

2256
02:07:57,850 --> 02:08:02,800
There's a lot of good fights to Linacre
versus bag routine off these two little

2257
02:08:02,801 --> 02:08:06,690
flyweight murderers. Oh,
those two killers, man.

2258
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:11,430
PAGO teen offers a Samo champion. This
Linacre is a destroyer. The calls him,

2259
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:14,920
they call him hands of stone. You can't do
that, right? It's her to the ranch. Shit,

2260
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:19,150
he can't take shit,
but the kid can't fucking bang man.

2261
02:08:19,151 --> 02:08:21,220
He's got ridiculous,
ridiculous power.

2262
02:08:22,030 --> 02:08:26,960
Bobby Greens fight enabled to Hilo.
God Damn it.

2263
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:29,290
A lot of good fights,
man. A lot of good fights.

2264
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:32,470
It's going to be crazy too
because getting a back and forth,

2265
02:08:32,471 --> 02:08:34,360
apparently you're saying it's
going to be a real issue.

2266
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:36,640
Well those guys are going to be in Jersey.
Yeah,

2267
02:08:37,330 --> 02:08:42,330
but you're saying getting back and forth
to crazy times so it's not that bad.

2268
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:46,270
Yeah. But going back and forth
that weekend is going to be nutty.

2269
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:49,480
What is it going to be like that
that weekend? What is it like?

2270
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:53,350
Okay, so you have three titles,
right? The Lincoln tunnel side.

2271
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:55,840
You have the George Washington bridge,
upper and lower,

2272
02:08:56,350 --> 02:08:59,260
and you have the Holland tunnel,
right? Plus you have the fairies.

2273
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:03,100
When you do a super bowl,
you have the soup bowl or one location.

2274
02:09:03,610 --> 02:09:08,560
So when you go to, uh, let's say they're
going to have it up and uh, the rose bowl,

2275
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:13,030
everything around the rose bowl will
be NFL related for the first two weeks.

2276
02:09:13,031 --> 02:09:15,910
The first week is press week.
The last week of the playoffs,

2277
02:09:15,970 --> 02:09:20,970
I think it's either a two week situation
to get you to spend more money or it's

2278
02:09:21,041 --> 02:09:23,680
a one week. So you go right for the
playoffs, right to the soup bowl.

2279
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:27,550
They come into town the week before
and start practicing and all that shit.

2280
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:31,450
It's not the 18,000 to 20,000
people that come to the super bowl.

2281
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:34,870
It's the hundred thousand people
like a couple of years ago.

2282
02:09:34,871 --> 02:09:39,300
Real sport time exposition on how
many hookers fly in for Superbowls.

2283
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:44,230
You'd be fucking blown away. It seems
like a good move. I was a hooker. No,

2284
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:46,170
they had a whole 20 minutes.

2285
02:09:46,171 --> 02:09:51,171
I'll have three segments dedicated to the
art of hooking all fucking super bowl,

2286
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:55,370
the HBO,
Hbo at what happened,

2287
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:58,390
what really happens to a city when
they have the soup bowl in your city?

2288
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:01,210
That was the expert say wow.
For starters,

2289
02:10:01,211 --> 02:10:05,450
20 million kilos of coke
at shot at 20 million. Oh,

2290
02:10:05,451 --> 02:10:06,950
you know they,

2291
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:11,140
people come to the zoo board apart and
so it's not the 18,000 to go to the game.

2292
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:14,860
It's the hundred thousand that come in.
So now this is,

2293
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:18,340
let's pretend you're going to have
the Superbowl in San Francisco.

2294
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:23,680
Everything around that stadium is, it's
going to be related to the super bowl.

2295
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:25,990
They're not doing that
this time that do it.

2296
02:10:25,991 --> 02:10:29,380
All the NFL experiences and shit
scattered throughout New York City.

2297
02:10:30,370 --> 02:10:32,620
So if you want to see the
NFL experience hall of fame,

2298
02:10:32,621 --> 02:10:34,430
you got to go to the
Museum of natural history.

2299
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,000
If you want to see the NFL quarterback
challenge, you've got to go downtown.

2300
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:41,020
That's going to create all
that shit that dementia.

2301
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:44,420
There's a lot of things going on.
There's a lot there. Not, as I mentioned,

2302
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:49,620
they're closing the Lincoln tunnel.
One tunnel is only for buses, social,

2303
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:53,090
it'd be one community thing. Now our
boy Alex, we'll get you back and forth.

2304
02:10:53,690 --> 02:10:58,000
The other thing I do not like it all is
it's February fucking third and fourth

2305
02:10:58,050 --> 02:11:02,030
could snow, could snow and they said it
hasn't snowed in February in 80 years.

2306
02:11:02,031 --> 02:11:06,050
You know what that means? It's going to
fucking snow in February. I said in the,

2307
02:11:06,051 --> 02:11:09,710
in the, uh, super bowl
in that area in Newark.

2308
02:11:09,711 --> 02:11:13,820
It hasn't stone in February and 80 years
old lesson. Is that true? No. Come on. No,

2309
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:15,520
that's not true. What am I? Am I quitting?

2310
02:11:15,550 --> 02:11:19,700
Birthday's February 19th and my mother
used to take pictures every year of be

2311
02:11:19,701 --> 02:11:23,510
walking into the bar on February
19th at one thing for certain.

2312
02:11:23,570 --> 02:11:26,780
There's always snow on the fucking ground.
Let me see what it,

2313
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:30,800
maybe it's that day. Let me see
where they're, what they're saying.

2314
02:11:30,801 --> 02:11:33,020
Farmer's Almanac,
a big storm.

2315
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:38,510
The farmer's Almanac is predicting
how dare they, the temperature.

2316
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:42,980
That's hilarious. Temperature reached 71
yesterday where? New York. Oh yeah. Yeah.

2317
02:11:42,981 --> 02:11:45,800
It's warm right now. Sure.
That's incredible. Yeah. Yeah.

2318
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:50,010
It was warmer than it is here. Yeah.
It doesn't even make any sense. Yeah.

2319
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:53,390
They said it's unseasonably warm.
Okay. February 2nd in New York,

2320
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:56,060
and this is true February 2nd in Newark.

2321
02:11:56,061 --> 02:12:00,830
Hasn't seen serious now in 80
years. Wow. Yeah, so it is true.

2322
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:07,040
Yeah. So it's that day. It's
that specific day. 80 years.

2323
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:10,580
They asked Roger, good, that doesn't mean
shit. Last week, and they asked Roger,

2324
02:12:10,581 --> 02:12:13,970
get down, what are you, what are you doing
for the possibilities is no. He said,

2325
02:12:13,971 --> 02:12:17,710
you know what? If it snows one to have
ourselves an old fashioned soup bowl,

2326
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:22,910
that would be awesome. I would like that.
No banging up, but you're out of that.

2327
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:24,710
By the time the super
bowl even was the kickoff,

2328
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:27,440
you're in La with your feet
getting a massage because,

2329
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:29,390
well I'm going to watch it.
I'm going to watch it this year.

2330
02:12:29,820 --> 02:12:33,700
Try to figure out what, Yay.
I'm not going there. No.

2331
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:35,210
Where else would your feet up?

2332
02:12:35,211 --> 02:12:37,880
Eating fucking a meatball sandwich
or something because if not,

2333
02:12:38,240 --> 02:12:41,240
I want to find out what the fucking
hype is all about. And I think if I,

2334
02:12:41,241 --> 02:12:43,640
if I watched them play in the snow,
I'll really enjoy it.

2335
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:47,120
Well cause this is madness. You
know, I love chaos. If you can get,

2336
02:12:47,121 --> 02:12:50,390
if they could have MMA fights in the
snow and you ever seen a wet and wild,

2337
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:52,630
you ever seen the Kandak
cage wet and wild? No.

2338
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:57,530
The king of the cage is
a smaller organization in
Hawaii, right? No, no, no, no,

2339
02:12:57,531 --> 02:12:59,600
no. California. They used to have, um,

2340
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:03,830
my friend bud used to own part of it
and uh, they used to have these Emmett,

2341
02:13:03,831 --> 02:13:08,570
where the fuck is that? Look at that
last weekend. Where are they flying?

2342
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:09,620
That's crazy.

2343
02:13:10,670 --> 02:13:14,090
That is so gangster playing a
game and the snow like that.

2344
02:13:14,091 --> 02:13:18,350
I don't give a fuck that is Uber gangster
and to see that there's 18,000 people

2345
02:13:18,351 --> 02:13:21,470
in the audience, go to that
audience shot. Look at that.

2346
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:22,640
Look at those mother fuckers.

2347
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:26,780
They're freezing their dicks
off and they're still there.
They're all there. Fuck.

2348
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:28,911
I love that.

2349
02:13:28,911 --> 02:13:32,850
I love that they're willing to play
in the snow that it stays so wicked.

2350
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,120
How the technology has changed
because now like the size of it,

2351
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:38,970
the sidelines are all heated.
The seats,

2352
02:13:38,971 --> 02:13:42,630
a heated throw blankets at either
the heated the gloves, eat it.

2353
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:47,640
It's amazing what I'm fucking cold
getting hit in the cold it. What's that?

2354
02:13:47,641 --> 02:13:52,200
American Express commercial
then a $66 a blowjob.

2355
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:53,590
Priceless.
Priceless.

2356
02:13:53,610 --> 02:13:57,130
Getting hit in the fucking snow when
it's called prices for competent,

2357
02:13:57,240 --> 02:14:02,060
like warm as you got to look in that
camera, man. Yeah, earning his money,

2358
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:06,660
man. Jesus Christ. That's
insane. Yeah. I get that.

2359
02:14:06,661 --> 02:14:09,720
East Coast man. It gets rough.
Look at that. I'll tell you what,

2360
02:14:09,721 --> 02:14:13,950
when I went deer hunting recently, we went
to Wisconsin for that show, meat eater,

2361
02:14:13,951 --> 02:14:16,590
and we sat in a blind,
a deer blind waiting,

2362
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:20,460
and you're sitting in that fucking blind
and it is zero degrees outside and the

2363
02:14:20,461 --> 02:14:25,200
wind is whipping and you are fucking cold.
You know why?

2364
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:27,870
Shit, cause you're just
sitting, you're not moving.

2365
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:30,990
It's one thing if you're moving,
like I've been in zero before,

2366
02:14:30,991 --> 02:14:33,450
but if you keep moving when
you're in zero, you're okay.

2367
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:35,700
As long as you keep moving,
you generate some body heat.

2368
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:38,760
But when you're just sitting there
waiting for a deer to shop, you can't.

2369
02:14:38,761 --> 02:14:42,420
The fucking statute, you can't move. You
just get to sit there. It's fucking rough,

2370
02:14:42,421 --> 02:14:43,254
man.

2371
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:47,580
Wisconsin in the winter up
near those fucking lakes.

2372
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:52,770
But God damn, they're deer everywhere.
They're everywhere. You know what's crazy?

2373
02:14:52,771 --> 02:14:55,440
We're not used to it. No. Were pussies.

2374
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:59,430
We're soft to east coast at night
one night and it started snowing.

2375
02:15:00,730 --> 02:15:04,890
I wasn't crying. I wasn't to the
point, but about you to it. I see.

2376
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:08,310
I didn't say nothing. I was,
you know, I was, I had shit on.

2377
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:13,700
But it's fucking cold. That's a different,
I was in Eugene, Oregon with my bedtime.

2378
02:15:13,870 --> 02:15:17,970
Sequoia was nine below zero.
Fucking rare.

2379
02:15:17,971 --> 02:15:22,050
Rare cold snap. All right. You know, and
you're like, wow, I forgot about this.

2380
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:24,240
They had some serious snow
while you guys are up there.

2381
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:28,110
This is cool to do for 10 minutes to walk
and get a Starbucks or something. Yeah,

2382
02:15:28,111 --> 02:15:31,110
we got to go to Portland again.
Let's do Portland and Portland together.

2383
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:33,150
Let's do it. Let's, okay,
we'll do Portland again.

2384
02:15:33,151 --> 02:15:36,540
Then we'll do New Mexico together. Let's
do a Portland, New Mexico this weekend.

2385
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:39,780
Dirty bitches. We're going to be there
this weekend at the Mirage though.

2386
02:15:39,781 --> 02:15:42,300
I'm going to have some fun. What are
you doing? New Years? Three years.

2387
02:15:42,301 --> 02:15:46,080
I got an early show. We're at the
early show, Jon Lovitz. Ah, okay.

2388
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:49,740
Early show up there and then I'm all for,
I dunno how late I'll be up there,

2389
02:15:49,741 --> 02:15:52,650
but it's a Paki shouldn't be weird.
Like,

2390
02:15:52,651 --> 02:15:55,920
I forget how fucking crazy the
parking is for new year's everywhere.

2391
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:59,820
If you get to the, if you get to the
Improv and time man, if you want to go up,

2392
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:01,290
you're starting at 10 though.
Yeah,

2393
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:04,110
we're starting to get out of there till
about 10 that's why I didn't know for

2394
02:16:04,111 --> 02:16:06,620
sure. Just drive over.
Just try cause it's triple.

2395
02:16:06,621 --> 02:16:10,260
He's going to go up and then Tony
Hinchcliffe can go up to be to get out of

2396
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:11,960
there. I don't know. I
never been lived before.

2397
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:15,510
New years so you know we can always ring
in the new year and then you know you

2398
02:16:15,511 --> 02:16:18,060
can go up after that too. It
doesn't matter. We'll have some fun.

2399
02:16:18,110 --> 02:16:19,200
I'll tell you something.
Joe Rogan.

2400
02:16:19,201 --> 02:16:21,810
I haven't been catching up on
sleep or last two weeks have you?

2401
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:24,120
I fucking six weeks in a row on the road.

2402
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:27,540
That's a tough morning radio as well.

2403
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:31,240
That's no grown in radio to what they do.
The death squad people.

2404
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:36,430
That's why people, they give us a little
percentage and they put it all on us.

2405
02:16:37,510 --> 02:16:39,860
They put everything on ice.
They figure Twitter.

2406
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:42,740
I see who goes in the week before
and they get three stations.

2407
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:45,790
Don't call us and say,
come in Wednesday for Thursday radio.

2408
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:50,110
I got nothing for us because they don't
even spend a dime on these fucking clubs

2409
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:51,730
when we come in and not more than a dime,

2410
02:16:51,731 --> 02:16:54,190
that guts because they put it all on us.

2411
02:16:54,191 --> 02:16:57,100
They think we're going to go in there
from the fucking podcast and impact of

2412
02:16:57,101 --> 02:16:59,230
play. Well, in a lot
of ways, like you said,

2413
02:16:59,231 --> 02:17:01,500
it is like being on TV
shows at the same time.

2414
02:17:01,501 --> 02:17:03,820
So it's the same thing and the
word gets out in a better way.

2415
02:17:04,470 --> 02:17:06,560
And we do all our promoted.
There's no radio.

2416
02:17:06,590 --> 02:17:08,520
How many radio stations you
got left in the worst? Not,

2417
02:17:08,521 --> 02:17:12,640
not for radio station that used
not to promote something happy.

2418
02:17:12,910 --> 02:17:16,540
The guy in that opie and Anthony Stern,
who else is left?

2419
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:20,020
There's some stuff on the bottom.
Tom, there's a, there's guys, uh,

2420
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:22,930
throughout the country that she could do.
If you guys in Austin,

2421
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:24,110
there's this guy's,
you know,

2422
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:29,190
Dale Dudley Day on Bob Bob's the people
in Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale. Yep.

2423
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:31,020
Dama,
wherever his buddies,

2424
02:17:31,870 --> 02:17:34,860
I had to do like radio for the movie
and I had a call a couple of places.

2425
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,850
I was surprised that,
but it's all serious.

2426
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:41,230
You know I had a called BC at all serious.
It's different affiliates.

2427
02:17:41,231 --> 02:17:43,840
It wasn't like in the old
days when we'd go to Houston,

2428
02:17:43,841 --> 02:17:48,040
you did radio Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday and Friday. The drive through.

2429
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,820
What happened to those guys?
Did Dee,

2430
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:53,440
did radio get fucked up by those jack
channels and all those like preprogram

2431
02:17:53,470 --> 02:17:57,640
channels? What's the big communism
station? Communism. Clear Channel,

2432
02:17:57,710 --> 02:18:00,880
which me just, that's
it. It was communism.

2433
02:18:01,860 --> 02:18:05,440
They were firing people for saying
they got mad at, what's his name?

2434
02:18:05,710 --> 02:18:08,790
What's the kid that had the chef
Frank Caliendo. They got mad.

2435
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:13,050
Don't even say fuck that kid that
maybe has a fucking his life, man,

2436
02:18:13,430 --> 02:18:16,390
I don't know. But years ago something
happened at some clear channel.

2437
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:18,910
He did the personalization.
They thought it was off color.

2438
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:21,400
You know those people in
self fucking easily man.

2439
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:23,980
Well, they're just thinking about
money. They're not. They're not.

2440
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:26,920
It's kind of funny that you're,
you're selling art,

2441
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:30,760
but you're just thinking about money.
Like that's a real hard line to dance.

2442
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:33,310
You're going to make sure
that your product sucks
because your product is never

2443
02:18:33,311 --> 02:18:36,580
going to have any edges to it. It's not
going to be anything dangerous about it.

2444
02:18:36,581 --> 02:18:38,860
There's not going to mean
anything controversial about it.

2445
02:18:39,130 --> 02:18:42,400
Can you imagine if we could have a
radio show where we do like this?

2446
02:18:42,610 --> 02:18:46,450
We have a morning radio show and it's
like this completely uncensored and it's

2447
02:18:46,451 --> 02:18:50,830
on, you know, drive time, whatever.
Just take this. Why, why you,

2448
02:18:50,831 --> 02:18:53,650
why you have a, you know,
some, some other nonsense on,

2449
02:18:53,651 --> 02:18:56,170
just take this and if you need
to throw a little beep in there,

2450
02:18:56,171 --> 02:18:57,004
throw a little beep.

2451
02:18:57,610 --> 02:19:01,630
It's gotta be real people ready for this.
Listen to this society.

2452
02:19:01,631 --> 02:19:02,860
People were ready for this.

2453
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:05,100
Well, you know what they're going to be
ready for is having the Internet on their

2454
02:19:05,101 --> 02:19:07,350
fucking radio.
The Internet is going to be in your car.

2455
02:19:07,351 --> 02:19:10,650
You're just going to download them,
watch them or stream them live.

2456
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:12,870
Joe, how many times can
you get here? Hey Joe.

2457
02:19:12,871 --> 02:19:16,110
So what are you thinking this weekend?
Are you going to the race track?

2458
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:19,470
Yes we are. We're going to go.
Nobody wants to hear that no more.

2459
02:19:19,890 --> 02:19:23,820
We've gone through that.
1980 is fucking done. Okay,

2460
02:19:23,821 --> 02:19:25,830
so nobody wants to hear that shit.
You want to hear that shit?

2461
02:19:26,190 --> 02:19:28,870
Maybe that's a suit, but I want to hear
somebody who's telling me to fuck him.

2462
02:19:28,871 --> 02:19:32,060
The truth for a lot. I
want to hear somebody who's
telling me their fucking mind,

2463
02:19:32,061 --> 02:19:33,200
not what the advertisers are.

2464
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:37,880
Fucking tell them what they could say
and what they can't say that that's the

2465
02:19:37,881 --> 02:19:40,430
beauty about fucking podcast. That
is the beauty. That's the beauty.

2466
02:19:40,431 --> 02:19:43,670
But I don't give a fuck. You don't
want to sponsor? I don't give a fuck.

2467
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:49,090
We get our word out. This is pirate
radio to the grass roots as grassroots.

2468
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,000
As a kick fucking be.

2469
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:53,520
Yeah. This is crazy. Pirate
radios has ever been before.

2470
02:19:53,521 --> 02:19:58,230
Even greater radio was getting. This is
good as your fucking pirate radio wishes.

2471
02:19:58,231 --> 02:20:01,170
It was the internet. I love doing
this shit with a joint in my mouth.

2472
02:20:01,650 --> 02:20:04,110
What did he do? That shit.
I love all that shit. Well,

2473
02:20:04,111 --> 02:20:07,230
if you stop and think about it, like
from the moment we started doing this,

2474
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:11,940
all of us, everybody who does it now,
all of us already and Brian and you know,

2475
02:20:12,150 --> 02:20:15,340
calen and every, everybody who's
been doing this, we put just,

2476
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:19,560
just doing it to do it. You know? We just
started off doing it for fun. You know,

2477
02:20:19,590 --> 02:20:24,060
we started off doing it like as a goof.
So the intention was never as a business,

2478
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:27,560
the intention was to make it as fun
as possible and to make it as, as,

2479
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:30,540
as enjoyable to listen
to as possible to create.

2480
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:34,620
And it becomes sort of like a piece
that you're creating. It doesn't,

2481
02:20:34,621 --> 02:20:37,500
it's not like a,
it is like you're having a conversation,

2482
02:20:37,501 --> 02:20:40,500
but when you're aware that other
people are listening and you, you know,

2483
02:20:40,501 --> 02:20:42,810
you want to make sure that it's,
this is an entertaining,

2484
02:20:42,811 --> 02:20:45,150
that there's something to this.
You're, you're, you're like,

2485
02:20:45,450 --> 02:20:48,300
you're fashioning a piece,
you know?

2486
02:20:48,301 --> 02:20:50,910
And that's a lot of what you're
doing when you creating a podcast.

2487
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:54,900
It's a piece of art. It's a piece. I mean,
it's very pretentious to call it art,

2488
02:20:55,470 --> 02:20:58,680
but it's something that you're creating
and that's something you realize along

2489
02:20:58,681 --> 02:21:00,740
the way.
That's

2490
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:02,510
all it is,
is there's no difference.

2491
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:06,200
We're going on there and we're given you
what's in the heart and what's in our

2492
02:21:06,201 --> 02:21:09,740
head. What sticks out of our
mind. I don't fucking go on you.

2493
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:13,550
I don't go on Yahoo and see what the
hot topic isn't talking about it.

2494
02:21:13,551 --> 02:21:17,330
Anybody can do that. Anybody can do that.
I don't want to talk about that shit.

2495
02:21:17,630 --> 02:21:20,360
I want to talk about what
pertains to us today. I don't.

2496
02:21:20,361 --> 02:21:24,320
I don't go on there and talk about Obama
care. What do I give a fuck a fuck?

2497
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:27,120
You guys bought that Hook.
He's a fucking president.

2498
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:29,120
Why are you buying
insurance from this shit?

2499
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:30,680
I'm not saying the president is shit,

2500
02:21:30,681 --> 02:21:32,960
but why are you getting caught up
and I know everybody needs a shirt,

2501
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:35,810
but I'm not going to go in there and
talking about generalizations of sports.

2502
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:38,060
I don't want to do that.
I'm sick of doing that.

2503
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:41,480
How many times have you watched the news?
You have three TVs in your house.

2504
02:21:41,481 --> 02:21:45,320
Put them together one day and put
the news on it. Fucking synchronized.

2505
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:47,570
They're synchronized.

2506
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:51,260
Show what they're talking about on four
they're talking about on a five at the

2507
02:21:51,261 --> 02:21:52,094
same time.

2508
02:21:52,310 --> 02:21:56,040
Then Diane Sawyer comes on and world
news tonight comes on and then there's

2509
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:56,880
another person.

2510
02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:00,560
There's an interpretation of world news
tonight with Diane Sawyer on four and

2511
02:22:00,561 --> 02:22:01,394
I'm too,

2512
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:06,080
and that covered the same shit that
you're covering to the minute because they

2513
02:22:06,081 --> 02:22:08,690
want to get it to you before
anybody else gets it to you. Right?

2514
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:13,420
So we go live now. You know it's the same
shit when you wake up in the morning.

2515
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:14,540
You guys aren't end up in the morning.

2516
02:22:14,541 --> 02:22:17,780
You're got to get up at six and
watch TV in the morning and see what,

2517
02:22:17,930 --> 02:22:21,680
how bad they get you going in the
morning and the fear they put in you.

2518
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,980
Just that all, they talk about
it as teachers rape in a kid.

2519
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:29,120
This happened overnight and this
nothing's positive. Nothing.

2520
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:32,070
By the time you get in your car,
if you have any feeling at all,

2521
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:33,330
you fucking shock.

2522
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:37,440
That's why I get up at
four 45 and I smoked dope.

2523
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:41,610
Then I get on Twitter and I play fucking
music because let's get the fuck.

2524
02:22:41,611 --> 02:22:44,610
Let's get our head away from that shit.
Who gives a fuck? You still gotta get up.

2525
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:47,760
You know whether Obama Care's alive
and kicking. When you go to rouse,

2526
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:51,570
there's anybody pop up and pay for
your bills at routes or whatever.

2527
02:22:51,571 --> 02:22:54,300
Wherever the fuck are you do
shopping and you read Ben? No.

2528
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:57,210
All right then what the fuck are real
question. When you were at Ralph's,

2529
02:22:57,211 --> 02:22:59,770
nobody pops up in the face, but you
know, of course they don't show it. Yeah.

2530
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:02,910
So what the fuck? Wah. I don't
worry about that shit no more.

2531
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:05,940
You worry about your own path and what
you can do and how you can help your

2532
02:23:05,941 --> 02:23:06,541
community and your,

2533
02:23:06,541 --> 02:23:09,660
some of the people running and you move
forward and if you're not doing that

2534
02:23:09,661 --> 02:23:10,920
then what the fuck are you doing?

2535
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:13,930
Well there's a lot of people that
are, are, are not doing that,

2536
02:23:13,931 --> 02:23:17,080
but they are involved in the political
part of it. It's like you can't,

2537
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:18,310
I don't think you can do everything.

2538
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:22,270
It becomes a problem if you really want
to concentrate on fixing the economic

2539
02:23:22,271 --> 02:23:25,100
system and fix the system. I'm
only here for a short time. You,

2540
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:26,410
you're running up hill,
that's for sure.

2541
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:29,320
But that's a lot of people say that's
a cop out because that's the world that

2542
02:23:29,321 --> 02:23:33,460
you live in and this is the, the society
you're supposed to help it enhance it.

2543
02:23:33,910 --> 02:23:35,350
You want to solve the world,
you go do it.

2544
02:23:35,351 --> 02:23:37,900
All I'm doing is putting you in a good
mood for you to go to fuck out thing and

2545
02:23:37,901 --> 02:23:40,240
get out there and kick some fucking ass.
You know,

2546
02:23:40,241 --> 02:23:42,430
I'm a fucking this morning and I
was talking to my wife and she goes,

2547
02:23:42,431 --> 02:23:43,264
you're a scaffold.

2548
02:23:43,450 --> 02:23:46,030
You know the other thing I would go to
the ice house cause I was scared to go

2549
02:23:46,031 --> 02:23:49,090
out at night. Why? I don't
know. Because you eat edibles.

2550
02:23:49,091 --> 02:23:52,510
That would kill a fucking whore. I
don't know. Sometimes he'd edibles.

2551
02:23:52,511 --> 02:23:53,740
Thompson girl came on.

2552
02:23:53,741 --> 02:23:57,550
It was telling a story about you giving
him a Chiba chew and about you ate like

2553
02:23:57,551 --> 02:23:58,520
three or four of them.
You got,

2554
02:23:58,521 --> 02:24:02,200
you had lately like he ate a quarter of
it and you had literally eight times as

2555
02:24:02,201 --> 02:24:06,410
much in your system on the
airplane was fuck yeah.

2556
02:24:06,430 --> 02:24:08,530
He was telling me the whole story
about it and I was like that.

2557
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:10,120
That's one of the most terrifying.

2558
02:24:10,121 --> 02:24:13,090
So just thinking about you
that high on an airplane,

2559
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:18,250
like you're having anxiety attacks.
I was breathing heavy,

2560
02:24:18,251 --> 02:24:21,640
I was starting to sweat and just suck
and that's fucking really high man.

2561
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:24,340
What are you getting out of that?
Like what's walking out of that?

2562
02:24:24,430 --> 02:24:27,040
I love walking on that. No,
that they would sugar, right?

2563
02:24:27,070 --> 02:24:28,690
Either a whole cheat but you,
but it was a 17

2564
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,930
milligrams.
It was a Greenwood.

2565
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:35,070
I start my day with a double a one 70
how am I going to do 70 ain't gonna do

2566
02:24:35,071 --> 02:24:37,710
nothing. So I gotta pop two
of them and that's one 40

2567
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:42,210
and the third one is two 10
so I'm in range, mid range.

2568
02:24:42,211 --> 02:24:47,010
That's how I am saying the amount of
tolerance that the average person,

2569
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:51,210
the the length of time they would have
to indulge in marijuana to hit that kind

2570
02:24:51,211 --> 02:24:52,044
of tolerance.

2571
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,960
That shit that Jerry [inaudible] was
just talking about about all those local

2572
02:24:54,961 --> 02:24:58,800
news. I don't know if you saw a Conan
O'brien. He did a thing last week.

2573
02:24:58,801 --> 02:25:03,060
It was brilliant where he took all
these local news channels and showed how

2574
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:08,090
exactly generic they are reporting on
the same story and they edit it together.

2575
02:25:09,150 --> 02:25:13,140
If you want to. I have it right here.
Yeah, sure. Makes Sense. It's so funny.

2576
02:25:13,141 --> 02:25:16,830
Check this out. Even bigger story
that's sweeping the nation right now.

2577
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:21,720
Who are you really shopping for
this holiday season? It's okay.

2578
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:24,310
You can admit it if you an item or two

2579
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:25,930
or 10 for yourself.

2580
02:25:26,010 --> 02:25:27,450
Well, it's okay. You can admit it.

2581
02:25:27,451 --> 02:25:31,950
If you have bought an item or two
or maybe 10 for yourself, it's okay.

2582
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:35,520
You can admit it.
You've bought large 10 for yourself.

2583
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:39,570
You can admit it if you borrow an
item or two or 10 for yourself. Okay,

2584
02:25:39,571 --> 02:25:44,550
you get admitted. Brought it.
Item worth two or 10 or yourself.

2585
02:25:44,770 --> 02:25:45,603
It's okay

2586
02:25:47,910 --> 02:25:51,840
to work 10 for yourself. It's
okay. You can admit it. Todd,

2587
02:25:52,470 --> 02:25:55,540
if you bought an item or two
or 10 for yourself, okay?

2588
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:59,670
You can admit it or 10 for your songs.
Okay?

2589
02:25:59,671 --> 02:26:04,250
You can admit it if you've
got for yourself, okay?

2590
02:26:04,260 --> 02:26:08,930
You can admit it for yourself.
It's okay. You can admit it.

2591
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:14,280
One or two or maybe three or four,
maybe even 10 items. You can admit it.

2592
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:18,810
I had a bunch of cars on.
Keep it going.

2593
02:26:19,710 --> 02:26:22,830
I'm enjoying the show. This, by the
way, I want to fuck all of these people.

2594
02:26:22,831 --> 02:26:25,460
The guys too.
I don't want to or to fall.

2595
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:30,860
It's okay if he's bought an item
or two or maybe 10 for yourself.

2596
02:26:30,980 --> 02:26:35,810
Okay? Okay, and can it fun for yourself?

2597
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:40,560
Is it okay? You can admit it. Oh my God,
this is insane. It's still going. Joey.

2598
02:26:42,510 --> 02:26:46,460
Joey went to take a leak.
Nobody has a fucking, so

2599
02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:48,650
do you guys think this works?

2600
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:52,160
You think that there's like some sort
of a grand script that goes out over the

2601
02:26:52,161 --> 02:26:55,250
airwaves. They get these generic
packets from there that, you know,

2602
02:26:55,251 --> 02:26:59,720
like NBC and stuff like that.
They could change the wording,

2603
02:26:59,721 --> 02:27:02,960
but most days they do not. I do not.
Yeah, they're probably lazy as fuck.

2604
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:04,840
You have no idea what we get coached.

2605
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:07,730
And you have to realize that for
years when you were growing up,

2606
02:27:07,731 --> 02:27:11,540
when you were young, you always heard that
cliche. The media controls everything.

2607
02:27:11,541 --> 02:27:13,970
Well they fucking, they could
then they'll control everything.

2608
02:27:13,971 --> 02:27:17,150
They control what they want you to hear.
Right.

2609
02:27:17,151 --> 02:27:18,670
It's control what they want you to hear.

2610
02:27:18,690 --> 02:27:23,690
You can't shoot a fucking BB gun now
without the whole country finding 10

2611
02:27:24,111 --> 02:27:27,400
fucking seconds.
They will interrupt the fucking orgy.

2612
02:27:27,410 --> 02:27:32,410
Now you poured out a kid got
shot in New Orleans by a,

2613
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:37,410
I'm sorry. Oh No, I'm sorry. All right,
look, somebody fall over there. Ah,

2614
02:27:37,460 --> 02:27:39,170
what are you doing?
He's showing me gross.

2615
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:43,790
Oh Jamie don't distract conversation.

2616
02:27:44,210 --> 02:27:47,100
No, no, no. Ah, and that's
the thing. They, they, they,

2617
02:27:47,730 --> 02:27:49,650
so I just don't have
a second conversation.

2618
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:54,870
Those conversation and he think that
we're doing now is because people

2619
02:27:55,011 --> 02:27:58,490
eventually just got, I mean, how many
times? I don't mean to put anybody down.

2620
02:27:59,090 --> 02:28:02,360
You Watch a Sitcom
lately? No, it's painful.

2621
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:04,790
There are that aren't anything.

2622
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:09,290
They're like fucking everything
on two for Fox and whatever.

2623
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:11,000
They're all the same.

2624
02:28:11,420 --> 02:28:16,420
Just rewritten over and over and over
again and there's some nights it's like

2625
02:28:16,681 --> 02:28:19,660
going to the main room.
Carlos is on doing dices joke at.

2626
02:28:19,661 --> 02:28:22,010
He's in the original room.
Remember that Shit that

2627
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,281
night?

2628
02:28:22,281 --> 02:28:25,720
Somebody was saying that just one of the
original omen calls is doing decisive

2629
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:29,060
Joe. He just did dices dice. Did
the joke in the original room.

2630
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:32,570
Carlos did the same joke in the
main room one night. This was the,

2631
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:35,790
but I'm not talking.
It's the same thing with ta and that's,

2632
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:39,800
this is why this shit's winning. This is
why more people are turning into this.

2633
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:44,330
First of all,
I know this is this is it mean podcasts.

2634
02:28:44,360 --> 02:28:48,530
These podcasts, we do them, we put
them up, they run out of the TV shows,

2635
02:28:48,531 --> 02:28:50,690
operate under where they
interrupt things every 15 minutes.

2636
02:28:50,810 --> 02:28:54,980
That's it that I watched the walking dead.
You know when you get it on Apple TV,

2637
02:28:54,981 --> 02:28:58,340
you can't get it the night it comes
out on TV. So it was out on Sunday.

2638
02:28:58,341 --> 02:29:03,341
So I decided to watch it on regular TV
in real time and it was fucking brutal.

2639
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:08,330
They just cab having commercial
after commercial after commercial,

2640
02:29:08,510 --> 02:29:11,870
they kept throwing commercials up.
It was fucking crazy.

2641
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:13,910
I was like this is gross.

2642
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:17,420
It's such a terrible way
to watch an hour program.

2643
02:29:18,110 --> 02:29:22,160
We have so many different options now
with podcasts and people jumping on going

2644
02:29:22,161 --> 02:29:25,880
on like this.
You know when I watch Jay Leno and I may,

2645
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:29,540
I may like the guy from pirates of the
Caribbean. What's his name? Listen,

2646
02:29:29,541 --> 02:29:33,770
Jay Leno, if he was smart, he would
host a show on cars. That's a no, no.

2647
02:29:33,771 --> 02:29:35,540
I'm just saying what's the
guy that goes on in there?

2648
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:40,280
What's the guy who was Johnny Depp? We
all like Johnny Depp. I love Johnny Depp.

2649
02:29:40,281 --> 02:29:43,790
Ain't gonna go on. They'll
actually promoting the movie.
I aint promoting nothing.

2650
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:46,210
I'm here talking to you.
So every,

2651
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:51,160
so tell us about what happened that
time you were shooting on the set.

2652
02:29:51,161 --> 02:29:53,840
I did my own stunts.
Get the fuck out of my face.

2653
02:29:53,841 --> 02:29:57,300
You'll fucking half a fag
fucking Scott's I right.

2654
02:29:57,500 --> 02:30:01,430
You know it's the same shit.
So eventually some people said fuck it,

2655
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:04,860
we can't do this no more. These
things to me are interesting in shit.

2656
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:09,230
I listen to podcasts. Yes. The different
assortment of educational podcasts.

2657
02:30:09,231 --> 02:30:11,990
I try me to the history one
is fucking great by the way,

2658
02:30:11,991 --> 02:30:15,590
cause I'm a history reading. Uh,
and they're very interesting.

2659
02:30:15,591 --> 02:30:18,620
And even when you're doing the podcasts,
he listens to one that's educational.

2660
02:30:18,621 --> 02:30:21,590
It's not calming. You're like,
wow, I like how they're doing that.

2661
02:30:22,030 --> 02:30:25,730
As you heard radio lab, you ever heard
of Radiolab? Radiolab is really good.

2662
02:30:25,910 --> 02:30:29,090
It's um, it's interesting too
because they add in sound effects.

2663
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:31,720
They like tell a story and
they edit it really well.

2664
02:30:31,790 --> 02:30:35,060
They'll do an interview and
they'll explain things as
the interview is going on.

2665
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:39,290
Like they intersect a narrator explaining
things as they're going on with a cool

2666
02:30:39,291 --> 02:30:42,170
sound effects and shit.
It's like really well produced.

2667
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:46,940
So like they have a premise like one of
the premises was why are these athletes

2668
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:51,020
from this one particular era in Africa,
why are they such good runners?

2669
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:53,450
Like what is it about these guys
that make them good runners?

2670
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:57,290
And then during the whole show they'd
speak to experts to talk about it and then

2671
02:30:57,291 --> 02:31:01,970
they ultimately speak to a guy who was
born and raised in that tribe and he

2672
02:31:01,971 --> 02:31:05,240
explains what it is.
It's a combination of factors,

2673
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:10,010
but one of them being is
brutal circumcision thing
that these guys have to go

2674
02:31:10,011 --> 02:31:14,060
through unbelievably brutal rites of
passage to become a man when they're

2675
02:31:14,061 --> 02:31:18,500
circumcised you with a sharp stick,
they make you crawl naked through thorns.

2676
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:20,560
Like it's like really hardcore

2677
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:23,580
shit. Like what they make
these people do, they make the,

2678
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:27,810
they make them run like on a regular
basis while their dick is like twisted up.

2679
02:31:27,811 --> 02:31:30,520
Like they have their four skin
tied up in a bow and they're,

2680
02:31:30,530 --> 02:31:34,010
they're running naked. When they get
outside the, uh, the hot, they also have,

2681
02:31:34,011 --> 02:31:36,030
they have to run,
they can't walk anywhere,

2682
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:41,150
like incredible rites of passage to become
a man that is so brutal that they get

2683
02:31:41,611 --> 02:31:45,270
through this and they have this insane
tolerance for pain and they have this

2684
02:31:45,271 --> 02:31:47,370
genetic predisposition to be good runners,

2685
02:31:47,371 --> 02:31:50,670
like the way their bodies shaped
and built. Fascinating stuff.

2686
02:31:50,910 --> 02:31:55,110
So listening to it on this podcast
made me appreciate like that style of

2687
02:31:55,111 --> 02:31:58,590
podcasting. It's an is, it's a
different style obviously then we do,

2688
02:31:58,591 --> 02:32:02,700
but I like that, you know, everybody's
got to be creative now with this thing.

2689
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:05,820
People were sick and tired
of it, you know? Listen,

2690
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:08,730
I've said for years I've said that.
And I normally, the soap people,

2691
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:12,640
I don't know who fucking stays up and
watches those talk shows later than

2692
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:13,620
flipping through the channels.

2693
02:32:13,710 --> 02:32:16,680
I don't fucking know why this
Dalon half the fucking time.

2694
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:21,780
I don't fucking know who watches that
shit on a fucking and now you got sad.

2695
02:32:21,781 --> 02:32:24,780
And I live with now they've got to put
stars on every week to make it work.

2696
02:32:25,230 --> 02:32:27,270
Every fucking week.
They've got to put somebody famous.

2697
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:31,080
Now I get home on Saturday from
doing something and it's Miley Cyrus,

2698
02:32:31,081 --> 02:32:34,530
Justin Timberlake, and Paul Rudd. Got
It. No, last week was the other guy.

2699
02:32:34,531 --> 02:32:35,600
What the fuck did you,

2700
02:32:35,601 --> 02:32:39,120
what happened to the regular fucking
sign that live cast that nobody watches

2701
02:32:39,121 --> 02:32:41,550
that shit. So you have to have
those fucking people on there now.

2702
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:44,460
But that's amazing.
Who Watches late night talk show?

2703
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:47,010
Who the fuck tolerates that shit?

2704
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:52,220
You do chemo but looks at that fucking
Conan clip was great. I'll Kona Kona.

2705
02:32:52,230 --> 02:32:54,610
It's not at nine o'clock.
What time is here here?

2706
02:32:54,820 --> 02:32:59,760
It's eight o'clock nine o'clock and Pete
home comes on at 10 I watched Kodak.

2707
02:32:59,910 --> 02:33:02,430
I'm talking about 11 fucking
third Pete Holmes show.

2708
02:33:02,710 --> 02:33:06,090
I've never watched the beginning of a
couple of minutes there as he doing the

2709
02:33:06,091 --> 02:33:08,640
same standard thing like
monologue in the beginning.

2710
02:33:08,641 --> 02:33:12,540
And then I think he turned to his
is like a podcast show also. Eric,

2711
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:17,030
I haven't watched the whole thing. My
friend watched it. He's on um, after Kona.

2712
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:18,820
Is that what it is? Yes.
That's all I have to call it.

2713
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:22,680
And then there's Craig Ferguson still
does pretty no fucking watch that shit

2714
02:33:22,690 --> 02:33:25,650
that with the fucking morning.
I don't watch the other guy,

2715
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:30,120
Jay Leno kill me fucking day.
Every once in a while.

2716
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:33,480
I still got a hot out from my main
man, Dave Letterman. That's my dog.

2717
02:33:33,870 --> 02:33:36,160
That's all I watch him.
If he's got somebody cool.

2718
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:39,300
I know he's got a goof on him or
something. He's still an interesting guy.

2719
02:33:39,301 --> 02:33:43,260
He's very interesting. I've, oh,
I loved him since 80 fucking too.

2720
02:33:43,261 --> 02:33:44,410
I've been watching David.

2721
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:46,890
You know where you get to really
see an interesting side of him.

2722
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:51,090
He's in a comedians getting in cars,
getting coffee.

2723
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:53,620
You know that web series,
the Jerry Seinfeld did.

2724
02:33:54,030 --> 02:33:55,930
Have you seen that one
with David Letterman? Yeah.

2725
02:33:57,150 --> 02:34:01,020
It's really interesting because he has
a Volvo that he drives around and it's

2726
02:34:01,021 --> 02:34:05,910
crazy. Souped up Volvo and a, someone
famous called them up like, who was it?

2727
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:10,680
Who was it that wanted to know if he
wanted one of those? Volvo's some,

2728
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:15,390
some other crazy fucker, some
other crazy famous fucker. Forget,

2729
02:34:15,391 --> 02:34:18,270
I forget who it was, but someone, uh,

2730
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:22,030
said, hey, I'm a, I'm buying these souped
up Volvo, so you want one? He's like,

2731
02:34:22,031 --> 02:34:22,930
fuck it.
Count me in.

2732
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:27,220
So he got this Volvo with a six speed
and like a fucking ridiculous high

2733
02:34:27,221 --> 02:34:31,630
horsepower engine. Looks like
a crazy, like a regular wagon.

2734
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:35,320
You know that you would drive around in,
but it's, it's brutal. Click on that shit.

2735
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:39,610
You see can see what it is. That's
a big time. Bold the car too. Yeah.

2736
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:43,410
Oh, that's an ad, right? Is
that an ad? That was, they just,

2737
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:45,760
they get show those fucking 15 second ads.

2738
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:48,610
I liked the skip ad option or like,

2739
02:34:48,611 --> 02:34:53,410
are they doing that skip back in five
seconds? Yeah. You got to get me quick.

2740
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:58,470
You've got to get me quick.
Yeah.

2741
02:34:58,471 --> 02:35:00,880
This is a Volvo.
He's got a Volvo wagon.

2742
02:35:04,010 --> 02:35:08,540
This is the 1995 Volvo nine
60 station wagon. Oh my God.

2743
02:35:08,541 --> 02:35:13,330
Really?
It is in region bread.

2744
02:35:13,331 --> 02:35:18,210
It has a black leather interior,
premium sound system and a sunroof, but

2745
02:35:19,770 --> 02:35:24,280
it was built with the high performance
racing engine by none other than Paul

2746
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:28,980
Newman. It's a lady horsepower Ford v
eight with a supercharger and a Mustang,

2747
02:35:29,010 --> 02:35:30,300
five speed gearbox.

2748
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:35,370
It looks like the kind of car that you
would take to a place like this and do

2749
02:35:35,371 --> 02:35:36,450
things like this,

2750
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:40,560
but it's actually a car where
you can do things like this.

2751
02:35:43,890 --> 02:35:46,680
He's doing a burnout. Oh, how rude.

2752
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:54,990
Anyway, that's an interesting web series.
So He's another one like Jerry Seinfeld.

2753
02:35:54,991 --> 02:35:57,790
Like I like him in that more than
I even like him doing stand up.

2754
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:02,310
Like he's really good at that cause he
loves fucking cars that guys addicted to

2755
02:36:02,311 --> 02:36:06,120
car. Should we Seinfeld,
he's a huge Porsche owner.

2756
02:36:06,180 --> 02:36:10,530
Like he owns like some insane amount of
Porsche's. I mean I think he's got like,

2757
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:11,580
like,

2758
02:36:11,580 --> 02:36:16,200
like huge garages that he owns that are
dedicated to these cars is actually a at

2759
02:36:16,201 --> 02:36:20,760
an airport in senate. Yeah, but not just
here. Also on the east coast as well.

2760
02:36:20,761 --> 02:36:24,870
He's got a separate one set up over there
and he has a full time mechanic that

2761
02:36:24,871 --> 02:36:27,060
takes care of all of this stuff.
This is like,

2762
02:36:27,061 --> 02:36:28,710
they're just constantly
working on his car.

2763
02:36:28,990 --> 02:36:32,490
Like he has like rare cars are
worth like 1 million bucks,

2764
02:36:32,491 --> 02:36:34,830
like rare first edition,
you know,

2765
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:39,860
1973 nine 11 at rs cars are
super hard to get ahold of.

2766
02:36:41,610 --> 02:36:43,980
He's a car nut.
So like Jay Leno too,

2767
02:36:43,981 --> 02:36:47,580
like one at Jay Leno's best things
that he does is Jay Leno's garage.

2768
02:36:47,910 --> 02:36:50,790
It's a thing that he does online and it's,
it's,

2769
02:36:50,791 --> 02:36:54,960
I like it better than the tonight show
because the fucking guy loves cars.

2770
02:36:54,990 --> 02:36:58,260
I mean, he's in love with
everything and not just fast cars.

2771
02:36:58,261 --> 02:36:59,850
He's got a bunch of old stupid cars.

2772
02:36:59,851 --> 02:37:04,851
I don't like these crazy like 1910 fucking
shit boxes that he's got rebuilt and

2773
02:37:05,021 --> 02:37:09,450
he, he drives around in them.
Is this Jerry Seinfeld's
place? Yeah, just layered.

2774
02:37:09,810 --> 02:37:12,720
Yeah. He's got like all kinds
of cars. Mostly Porsches,

2775
02:37:12,721 --> 02:37:17,690
but obviously you could see there
he's got a Chevy Camaro. Ss. Vw Bug.

2776
02:37:17,691 --> 02:37:20,990
Yeah. He's got a fuck load
of cars, man. He loves him.

2777
02:37:22,490 --> 02:37:25,040
I mean, Hey, you know,
people are in a weird shit.

2778
02:37:25,041 --> 02:37:28,250
Some guys are in the steroids
or the guys are in a guns.

2779
02:37:28,310 --> 02:37:33,110
Jerry Seinfeld's in a car. Fuck
it. Get that Cadillac though.

2780
02:37:33,111 --> 02:37:36,570
Joey, do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

2781
02:37:36,910 --> 02:37:39,160
Let's let your wife drive the Subaru.
No,

2782
02:37:39,170 --> 02:37:41,780
she has the fuck Cadillac
or that fucking gangster.

2783
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:44,150
He has the one that I want
to say a silver one. Two.

2784
02:37:44,151 --> 02:37:45,400
You need one that looks
like it was fake shit.

2785
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:48,960
That wasn't the call of the year last
year. Everybody got what does die?

2786
02:37:49,350 --> 02:37:52,610
Hondai oh the um, the one that looks
like a Mercedes. Yeah, she's got that.

2787
02:37:52,940 --> 02:37:55,910
Those are supposed to be great. Somebody
told me those cars are fucking great.

2788
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:57,800
This guy who knows cars told me look,

2789
02:37:57,950 --> 02:38:02,420
the difference between that and then
Alexis, it's a barely evident. He's like,

2790
02:38:02,421 --> 02:38:06,770
yeah, the Lexus is a little bit sharper.
It's a little bit like higher tolerances.

2791
02:38:06,771 --> 02:38:10,280
It's a little bit better
designed, a little bit more
high end, but not that much.

2792
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:11,720
He's like that fucking car.

2793
02:38:11,721 --> 02:38:14,540
The one that looks like a Mercedes and
Hyundai Manx he goes like that is like

2794
02:38:14,541 --> 02:38:18,680
the bargain fucking car the year.
That's a fucking gun to great car.

2795
02:38:18,870 --> 02:38:23,570
I've done 80 just, I did 110 coming back
from San Diego one night. Like nothing.

2796
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:26,240
Nothing. Nothing. Yeah.

2797
02:38:26,241 --> 02:38:29,930
I have a friend of mine is
Korean and he was just like,

2798
02:38:30,410 --> 02:38:34,070
he was a doctor and he was always talking
about like Korean work ethic and like,

2799
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:37,640
he's like, you don't know man. He goes,
when these guys make a car, it's like, oh,

2800
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:41,300
cause it was when Hyundai was first
coming out. I was like in the 1980s yeah.

2801
02:38:41,301 --> 02:38:44,600
And he was like, listen man, these
cars are going to be good. Yeah.

2802
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:49,340
A $4,000 car that went ballistic.
They were great.

2803
02:38:49,370 --> 02:38:54,370
I knew salesmen selling Hyundai's making
$20,000 a month on $400 commissions.

2804
02:38:54,910 --> 02:38:57,920
That's how many fucking holidays that
we're selling amongst all those little

2805
02:38:57,921 --> 02:38:59,420
four doors.
It's called,

2806
02:38:59,630 --> 02:39:03,260
I forget the Hyundai
still are super cheap.

2807
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:04,840
They were relying on,

2808
02:39:04,841 --> 02:39:08,700
they went away for a while and they
came back with all new thing. Yeah.

2809
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:10,220
And you know it's like Mitsubishi,

2810
02:39:10,221 --> 02:39:13,520
like I've always said there's a
Mitsubishi part and every fucking car.

2811
02:39:14,270 --> 02:39:18,020
Mitsubishi has shit every fucking
car. A lot of, what's the well set?

2812
02:39:18,170 --> 02:39:22,460
What did Mitsubishi built? They built
the plane that drove people crazy.

2813
02:39:22,461 --> 02:39:27,180
A world did this.
Mitsubishi built the mic.

2814
02:39:27,200 --> 02:39:30,740
That's why a lot of old time people won't
buy fucking heavy cars with Mitsubishi.

2815
02:39:30,741 --> 02:39:31,574
Chrysler.

2816
02:39:31,730 --> 02:39:35,390
Chrysler had Mitsubishi Products and there
are a lot of people and these Sundays

2817
02:39:35,391 --> 02:39:39,680
are expensive down this [inaudible] e Q.

2818
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:43,140
U u s equity is $60,000
zero they ain't fuck.

2819
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:48,530
Yeah Dude. But when you look at
it, it's like $120,000 Mercedes.

2820
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:53,310
It's a dope fucking car man.
And you know the Hyundai and lunch room,

2821
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:55,880
you know it's a ball.
It's a ballsy move to,

2822
02:39:56,210 --> 02:39:59,390
if you've got some money and you buy a
Hyundai, like you don't want to pitch.

2823
02:39:59,930 --> 02:40:02,840
This is good enough.
This is all I need

2824
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:08,750
is the opposite of the Cadillac move.
It's the ANTIFA loss.

2825
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:14,160
Where was it looking at it right now.
Which car? Which one is the echo?

2826
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:18,090
E? Q. U. U. S. E. Q. U. U. S.

2827
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:24,120
Yeah. $61,000 man. That's not cheap.
That's what it starts at the hale.

2828
02:40:24,690 --> 02:40:29,670
Yeah, but it's a rock solid car in
comparison to the like the high end Lexus,

2829
02:40:29,671 --> 02:40:34,670
like what's the high end Lexis?
Let's say hi and Lexus,

2830
02:40:34,910 --> 02:40:36,560
Lexus ls four.

2831
02:40:36,561 --> 02:40:41,561
He's 4,600 it starts off at 71 so it's
like not that much of a savings and a

2832
02:40:42,811 --> 02:40:47,490
Mercedes Benz s five five zero is yeah,
they're comparing them right there.

2833
02:40:47,491 --> 02:40:48,181
The ultimate,

2834
02:40:48,181 --> 02:40:53,181
so the equities ultimate is 68,000
and the Lexus ls four six 60 starts at

2835
02:40:54,811 --> 02:40:58,440
71,000.
That Alexis is a motherfucker dude.

2836
02:40:59,670 --> 02:41:04,600
Those Japanese, those designers and
engineers that they have that uh,

2837
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:07,830
worked for Toyota and then went into
Lexis and made the high end Lexis.

2838
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:11,340
I had a Lexus truck. I still
miss that truck. Really? Yeah.

2839
02:41:11,341 --> 02:41:14,610
At least it at least did. And I was
a, I brought it with me to Colorado.

2840
02:41:14,970 --> 02:41:18,570
I missed that fucking truck. It was
perfect. It was one of those big ones.

2841
02:41:18,571 --> 02:41:23,010
I think it's called the LX. The
SUV got, damn that thing was good.

2842
02:41:23,011 --> 02:41:28,011
It was just rock solid the way it handled
in like snowy weather and the use,

2843
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:31,710
the way it drove, even though
it was a big car, like all the,

2844
02:41:31,711 --> 02:41:35,490
all these systems that were designed to
stabilize at around corners and stuff

2845
02:41:35,491 --> 02:41:39,690
and you know, is adjustable
suspension. Fascinating stuff man.

2846
02:41:40,290 --> 02:41:44,880
And they're the ls, which is their big
flagship. That's the one that's their, uh,

2847
02:41:45,270 --> 02:41:47,880
they're big, uh, you
know, they're big sedan.

2848
02:41:48,030 --> 02:41:50,580
That thing is the first
car to parks itself.

2849
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:53,930
It parallel parks itself and
they like it finds the spots.

2850
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:57,690
Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Ford has
that. Awesome. They just it at all. Yeah.

2851
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:58,930
Yeah.
I would trust the,

2852
02:42:00,190 --> 02:42:03,960
what has the braking system
to Alexis, right? Well,

2853
02:42:03,961 --> 02:42:05,350
they have a lot of braking systems.

2854
02:42:06,810 --> 02:42:09,150
There's a lot of different cards you're
talking about with cruise control.

2855
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:13,970
I don't know which curves. It's like
that smart cruise control. Yeah. Yeah.

2856
02:42:13,980 --> 02:42:15,510
But there are also,
uh,

2857
02:42:15,570 --> 02:42:18,690
there's things that recognize even
when you're not on cruise control,

2858
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:22,860
they apply the brakes. If you're getting
too close to cars. This car right here.

2859
02:42:22,861 --> 02:42:26,010
I was like that lane departure warning
where it tells you if you'd like to go

2860
02:42:26,011 --> 02:42:27,900
over in a lane. Yeah, that's fascinating.

2861
02:42:27,901 --> 02:42:31,820
I have that on my SUV and it also,
uh,

2862
02:42:31,890 --> 02:42:34,110
we'll slow down if there's
a car in front of you.

2863
02:42:34,110 --> 02:42:38,010
It's like a laser guided cruise control.
So say you get on the highway, you say,

2864
02:42:38,011 --> 02:42:40,950
okay, I'd like to go 70 miles an hour.
Well, if there's a bunch of traffic,

2865
02:42:40,951 --> 02:42:43,680
it slows you down to like whatever.
The traffic's going like 40.

2866
02:42:43,950 --> 02:42:46,360
And you don't even have to put your foot
on the brake. It slows you down, man.

2867
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:49,110
You have to put your foot on the
break of everything gets dead stopped.

2868
02:42:49,650 --> 02:42:52,320
But then when the traffic picks up,
it'll pick up.

2869
02:42:52,321 --> 02:42:55,800
So it'll go back from 40 back to
60, back to 70. That's amazing.

2870
02:42:55,890 --> 02:42:58,500
They came up with a new Mercedes
that drives itself, man.

2871
02:42:58,501 --> 02:43:00,840
They were reporting about it
in the Frankfurt auto show.

2872
02:43:00,841 --> 02:43:05,160
The newest auto show is this guy,
Chris Harris. I always follow, uh, uh,

2873
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:09,400
he's a really funny automotive
journalists. But, uh, he was, uh,

2874
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:12,640
there at the auto show and they were
talking about this new car that literally

2875
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:16,360
you're gonna be able to sit in and it's
going to follow the curve of the road.

2876
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:19,630
It's going to break. It's gonna
accelerate, decelerate it,

2877
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:23,710
do like virtually everything
that a person does. So they're,

2878
02:43:23,711 --> 02:43:28,660
they're super close to that kind of Google
technology from more than one source.

2879
02:43:28,661 --> 02:43:31,060
I know the Google car
has been real successful.

2880
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:34,690
They have a car that drives itself and
hasn't gotten into any fucking accidents

2881
02:43:35,230 --> 02:43:37,800
and a certain point in time it's
going to be like, why would,

2882
02:43:37,810 --> 02:43:40,840
why should we let people
drive he fucking dummies.

2883
02:43:41,020 --> 02:43:45,130
You crash into each other if you,
if nobody drives ever,

2884
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:47,230
you just getting your thing
and you press the button,

2885
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:51,880
there's never going to be a crash again.
Isn't that better? That seems, I mean,

2886
02:43:51,881 --> 02:43:54,310
I know that it's nice
to be able to drive it.

2887
02:43:54,311 --> 02:43:56,080
I like driving and I
know you like driving,

2888
02:43:56,081 --> 02:44:00,070
but wouldn't it be better if we knew that
no one that you love would ever die in

2889
02:44:00,071 --> 02:44:03,340
an automobile accident again? And
that's how it begins. Joey Diaz.

2890
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:06,100
That's how they take away your freedom
and that's how skynet goes live.

2891
02:44:06,430 --> 02:44:09,220
And it's all coming
through Google coincidence.

2892
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:11,530
They just bought the
fucking robot company, Joey.

2893
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:14,950
They bought that Boston dynamics. They're
making fucking robot frogs and shit.

2894
02:44:15,460 --> 02:44:18,580
Robot Cheetahs. What's next? Joey Diaz?

2895
02:44:19,860 --> 02:44:24,450
Friday night, the Mirage Friday
night. Ari should fear Brian Cowen,

2896
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:28,690
Joey Diaz. Um, anything
else coming on? Brian?

2897
02:44:28,691 --> 02:44:30,910
I know you got to get a gang

Texas again with Tiffany Haddish,

2906
02:45:02,001 --> 02:45:02,790

2910
02:45:16,590 --> 02:45:19,350

2912
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:28,170
Me and the motherfucker, Ari Shaffir.
We're going to have a good time.

2913
02:45:28,770 --> 02:45:31,020
January 9th, 2011 buffalo, New York.

2914
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:35,790
January 23rd to 25th.
I'm in fucking

2915
02:45:39,290 --> 02:45:41,060
Hawaii. Let's just go to Hawaii. Oh,

2916
02:45:41,061 --> 02:45:44,520
why is a fucking great place to go
no matter what you're going to do.

2917
02:45:44,521 --> 02:45:48,270
What did you do? Jay Dunkin just got
back. He was in Maui at a fucking retreat.

2918
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:50,880
That's how he's balling.
How he's living. Yeah.

2919
02:45:50,881 --> 02:45:54,000
He went to some crazy
spiritual retreat and um,

2920
02:45:54,600 --> 02:45:57,750
talked about it on his podcast and met
a bunch of people from the podcast.

2921
02:45:57,751 --> 02:46:01,050
They were there, but he said it wasn't
even weird. It said it was weird at first,

2922
02:46:01,051 --> 02:46:04,680
but everybody was like so tuned in to
what the retreat was actually really all

2923
02:46:04,681 --> 02:46:08,040
about. That it all turned out to be
like a really positive experience.

2924
02:46:08,370 --> 02:46:11,150
Could you do that? Could know.
I could never tell it. Shut up.

2925
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:14,600
Don't even put that fucking out there.
Bunch of freak show up.

2926
02:46:14,601 --> 02:46:18,590
Do you write your name on my ass? I'm
going to get it tattooed. Settle down.

2927
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:23,310
Look, I stay after every show and
I meet people after every show.

2928
02:46:23,311 --> 02:46:26,390
I take pictures with everybody until
they're tired of taking pictures.

2929
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:31,160
I try to be as accessible as possible.
I talk to people as much as possible,

2930
02:46:31,161 --> 02:46:34,340
but I think those type of scenarios where
you're just constantly around people,

2931
02:46:34,341 --> 02:46:38,450
like you were saying, like on a boat
or something with most of the people,

2932
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:42,050
like literally 90% of the people or
more that you run into it, it'd be fine.

2933
02:46:42,230 --> 02:46:45,450
But there's that 10% that don't
know when to leave you alone.

2934
02:46:46,070 --> 02:46:49,820
Don't give me any space occasionally,

2935
02:46:50,810 --> 02:46:55,610
but that's what they'll ask.
That's what I say to them occasionally.

2936
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:59,840
Let's not, can we not talk about me?
Joey, a jam band in his friend made a,

2937
02:46:59,841 --> 02:47:02,030
a song with uh, Joe, uh,

2938
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:05,330
with you and your blue cheese and
all that stuff and another song.

2939
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:09,740
I think they've finished. Are you finished
it, you guys, you should all drown.

2940
02:47:09,770 --> 02:47:14,540
We said ended the show with that.
