1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,150
My daughter Loves Bible stories.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,390
Really?

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,370
I'm an atheist.

5
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,110
It's usually once upon a
time before you tell them,

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,361
oh,

7
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:07,650
I know.

8
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,580
She knows that stories.

9
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:08,940
Okay,

10
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,061
yeah.

11
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:10,590
We call him the big invisible guy,

12
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,270
and you go old school,

13
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:12,991
Old Testament,

14
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,800
or do you go,

15
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,633
we'd do the whole thing.

16
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:14,960
Oh,

17
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,450
okay.

18
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,450
I've told you the story.

19
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,930
If you know the guy who's
going to kill his son,

20
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,100
because the big invisible guy,

21
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,581
I say,

22
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,630
making them in an ice cream,

23
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,780
like bake him in a pie with whipped
cream because you know it's,

24
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,580
that's how you certificate.

25
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,740
I don't have a knife to the throat.

26
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:25,970
I mean,

27
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,803
she was four,

28
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,800
but she loves the big
invisible guy stories.

29
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,120
She loves the Noah one.

30
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:32,490
She loves the Adam and Eve one
with the snake and the apple.

31
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:32,761
It's all,

32
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:33,120
I mean,

33
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
these stories that they've
stood the test of time.

34
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,240
There's really some of the best stories
around who was going to kill his,

35
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,080
his son was Cain and Abel.

36
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,130
Now Cain and Abel,

37
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,450
where the son of Adam and eve,

38
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:44,280
they were brothers and
they killed each other.

39
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:44,580
Right?

40
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,780
I said Isaac and Abraham,

41
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,480
I think Isaac and I,

42
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,300
you know,

43
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,150
do we have a web?

44
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,430
Abraham?

45
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,440
Abraham was going to go,

46
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,000
right?

47
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,680
Yeah.

48
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,940
So I think God is asking
him to kill the son for him.

49
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,570
Yeah.

50
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:56,881
You know,

51
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:57,660
as a love test.

52
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:57,850
Yeah.

53
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,681
Just because you know,

54
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,820
that's how you know,

55
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,470
if someone really loves you,

56
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:01,741
like,

57
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:01,951
you know,

58
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,491
this is why,

59
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,761
you know,

60
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,540
you give this,

61
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,200
um,

62
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,951
you give this to your,

63
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,611
to your wife,

64
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:05,821
you know,

65
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,420
like I would,

66
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,860
I would murder our offspring for you.

67
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,130
And that's the hallmark card that really
helps your wife understand how much you

68
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:11,341
love her.

69
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,060
I'm just as an ex boyfriend
murdering our right.

70
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,350
I would find out where your
next boyfriend the beat you up.

71
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,184
I'll murder him.

72
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,083
And so,

73
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,030
but,

74
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,180
and I'm trying to tell the
stories in a neutral way,

75
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,391
right?

76
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:21,741
Like it's,

77
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:21,841
I,

78
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,081
again,

79
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:22,500
I had my,

80
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,270
my opinions on all these
stories and all that,

81
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:27,840
but she really likes the stories
and she's a huge fan of Lucifer.

82
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:28,830
Whoa.

83
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,280
I mean,

84
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,630
Lucifer is the guy,

85
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,220
he is like her superhero,

86
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,551
you know,

87
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,470
like he is her mighty
morphin power rangers.

88
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:37,800
She thinks he is just the coolest cause
he's always standing up to big invisible

89
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:38,011
guy.

90
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:38,281
Right.

91
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,040
And because she,

92
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,250
for her prayer is,

93
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:41,491
you know,

94
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,510
everyone's standing around and say,

95
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,440
oh you're the best.

96
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,070
Oh you're the best.

97
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,790
Oh you're the greatest.

98
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,570
I love you so much.

99
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,111
Oh you're the best.

100
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:46,410
You know.

101
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,110
And so,

102
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,461
you know,

103
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,280
Lucifer gets kind of tired of that
and leads the rebellion and all that.

104
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,001
Cause you know,

105
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:51,350
I said,

106
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,680
you know,

107
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,411
just keep saying it.

108
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:52,711
And she said,

109
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:53,461
I'm getting tired of it.

110
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:53,871
It's like no,

111
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:53,980
no,

112
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,061
no.

113
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:56,570
It keeps saying it because it's an
eternity of saying that to the gate.

114
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:57,120
Right.

115
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,540
And she's like,

116
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:57,931
Oh man,

117
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,561
I'm really tired.

118
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,230
I want to sit down.

119
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,130
It's like now you know how Lucifer it.

120
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,461
Anyway,

121
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,510
so she's got this great,

122
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,010
she's just great song,

123
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,370
which goes basically Lucifer was raw hide.

124
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,790
Lucifer was right.

125
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,100
You know,

126
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,070
why the songs,

127
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,970
and I'm just waiting.

128
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:12,481
Cause you know,

129
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,030
in Canada there's some homeschooling,

130
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,140
which is kind of what are in schooling,

131
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,601
what we were doing.

132
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,434
But a lot of them are,

133
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,041
are Christians.

134
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,251
Right?

135
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,340
So we're going to at some point be around
a bunch of Christian kids and she's

136
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,770
going to break into this song and I just,

137
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,380
I'm looking forward to that moment of,

138
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:27,660
I've tried to explain that maybe
she's referring to a Beatles song.

139
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,790
I don't know how I completely
bail on her at that point.

140
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,624
I don't know where she gets this.

141
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,490
And when you structure your stories,

142
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:37,290
do you use a software program to
use index cards on a bulletin board?

143
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,880
Like how do you set up where you're moving
all your pieces in your tetris game?

144
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,560
I used to things we do use,

145
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:48,561
I got a magnetic whiteboard in the office
and write on the index cards and put

146
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,210
them all up with that
and sometimes you know,

147
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:52,290
strings between the cards,

148
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:52,891
that kind of thing.

149
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:56,130
That's the general getting
it all down the flow.

150
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,470
And then I use a program called scrivener,

151
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,590
which people can use for Mac or PC
and it's basically the same thing.

152
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,860
It's little index cards in the
computer and there's an index card that

153
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,570
represents a document,

154
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,010
each document as a chapter.

155
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,031
But it's great.

156
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,620
It's better than Microsoft
word because Microsoft word,

157
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,880
once you get a bit past a hundred pages,

158
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,451
200 pages,

159
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,630
you're copying big chunks and moving
around and it becomes a nightmare cause

160
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,650
you're gonna screw something up.

161
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,391
But Scribner,

162
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,760
he just grabbed this icon
and drag it before this icon.

163
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,810
It rearranges everything.

164
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,420
So I've gotten pretty adept at
using that a highly recommend it.

165
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,030
It's great for scatterbrain
to keep everything flowing.

166
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,800
And then a lot of times it'll just be,

167
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,400
you know,

168
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,430
I get overwhelmed with the screen and
everything going on and I'll just pull up

169
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,340
the three by five index cards and
start writing everything down again,

170
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,700
bullet points and those put them up on
the board and go through it that way.

171
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,150
So you like to do it digitally,

172
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,680
you liked to do it manually.

173
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,670
You like to just mix it up and constantly
keep doing it in a different way that

174
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:51,960
keeps your brain moving?

175
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,680
Yeah.

176
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
What I find is when you get stuck there,

177
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,620
there's a couple of different things.

178
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:55,981
Number one,

179
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,020
if you just staring at that screen,

180
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,880
you're stuck just getting
your hands involved and a pen.

181
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,171
And I,

182
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:00,311
you know,

183
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,300
like just an ink pen and paper
is a tactile experiences,

184
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,021
different experience.

185
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,270
It activates different parts of
your brain sometimes can like,

186
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,260
oh now I get it,

187
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,430
now I see what I was stuck on.

188
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,750
So that's part of it.

189
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,180
And other parts of it is either,

190
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,850
there's only so much screen real estate
so you can only see so many things at

191
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:15,684
one time.

192
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,681
If you're really stuck,

193
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:17,310
you pull back,

194
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,581
right?

195
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:18,361
All these index cards,

196
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:18,961
you put it up in this,

197
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:19,350
you know,

198
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,670
four foot by five foot whiteboard and
you kind of look at everything that can

199
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:25,530
spring your brain free at times too.

200
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
So it's largely,

201
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,370
it's grabbing whatever's,

202
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,760
if I get stuck in one area,

203
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,870
I'll start going to other areas and um,

204
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,280
when I get really
overwhelmed and frustrated,

205
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,830
I am more comfortable slipping back into,

206
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:38,060
you know,

207
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,420
the eight year old version of me,

208
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,440
which is a little piece of paper and some
notes or an next card and go back and

209
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:45,600
just ride it out until it all
kind of flows onto the page.

210
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,500
I think Colorado,

211
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:47,101
Washington,

212
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:51,330
and eventually Arizona will be great
testers to disprove all that bullshit

213
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:52,400
that's being said about Marilyn.

214
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,520
Do you know what they're doing though?

215
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:54,750
It's really sneaky thing.

216
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,650
The Colorado dispensaries,

217
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,230
they have dispensary's of,

218
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,220
they've had for a long time.

219
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:00,360
They had them back when I lived there,

220
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,970
but they have actual retail stores,

221
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,530
but they're not allowed
to have bank accounts.

222
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,840
So they have massive amounts of cash and
the government literally will not let

223
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,550
them put it in a federal bank.

224
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,170
They can't put it in a state bank.

225
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:13,681
The can't put it,

226
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,610
they can't put it in a bank.

227
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,430
They don't allow them to put
their business to take the,

228
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:18,080
so they're gonna,

229
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,320
they're gonna have a safe somewhere
and put stacks of fucking paper money.

230
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,070
Is this,

231
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,760
you gotta remember to count it or
like what are you talking about?

232
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
This is the stupidest idea ever.

233
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:29,091
You,

234
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:29,970
you can make money,

235
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:31,170
but you can't put it in a bank.

236
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,100
Here's even worse.

237
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:36,390
You've probably heard about in Denver
where they have outlets for picking up

238
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:36,960
marijuana,

239
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,380
but you,

240
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,870
there's no place legally
designated to smoke it.

241
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,280
That's hilarious too.

242
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:42,911
Yeah.

243
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,620
They even have these sniff machines.

244
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,251
Have you ever seen him?

245
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:45,671
They put on,

246
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,850
they've developed these things to pick
out nano particles in the air and they

247
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:49,720
put it over their nose.

248
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,040
Like you're watching a fucking movie.

249
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,620
They're sniffing to smell.

250
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,300
If they could smell marijuana
from your home outside your home,

251
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,470
and if they can,

252
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,700
they will give you a ticket.

253
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,700
It's a new way to make
money with a giant electric.

254
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,211
It looks like.

255
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,570
I was like a cartoon knows this
guy's got like a space knows on.

256
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,380
Have you seen it?

257
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,531
No,

258
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
I haven't seen it.

259
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,203
There's the,

260
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,580
there's a thing and when
they made it illegal,

261
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:13,790
half the people in Congress didn't even
realize that they had made marijuana

262
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,181
illegal.

263
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:14,580
Look at that.

264
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,950
Notice the electronic nose.

265
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,550
It's got a compass on the end of it
and shit to tell you where the smoke is

266
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,030
coming from.

267
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,230
This is so stupid.

268
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,371
Look at that.

269
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:23,900
That's a giant electric piggy.

270
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,300
That's a pig with electric piggy.

271
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,673
That's what that is.

272
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,281
And by the way,

273
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,780
you're a pig if that's what you do.

274
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,450
If you stand in front of people's houses
with a fucking electronic sniffer,

275
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,620
not even your own nose.

276
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,633
You're a pig.

277
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,330
You trying to arrest them because they're
smoking something that's now legal

278
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,111
inside their house,

279
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,250
but they left a window open.

280
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,233
You're a pig.

281
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,080
That's a pig.

282
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,100
Aussie disgusting.

283
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,910
I love technology.

284
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,650
Electronic fucking fake knows

285
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,080
the guy who made that must have been
laughing like a music fuck owned.

286
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,220
He was probably so high
when he so that patent,

287
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,730
he didn't even realize he fucked us.

288
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:56,770
Me and who?

289
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,740
He's one of us and he fucked us with
his stupid electric robot knows,

290
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,900
but he made lots of money
so he can go to Colorado,

291
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,610
have his own condo and smoke all day.

292
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,290
Imagine the Irene and manage.

293
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,560
If he just started his own pot selling
business after he sold those things.

294
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,720
Imagine if he was like the bank's
betting against themselves.

295
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:12,741
Hey,

296
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,850
we all need a cash cow.

297
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,540
That's the move.

298
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,111
That's what you do.

299
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:15,944
You develop,

300
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,870
you develop shit to help the cops while
while profiting off weed and all eats

301
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,704
itself.

302
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,671
Yeah,

303
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,320
it is legal to smoke
marijuana on your front porch.

304
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,390
And they voted last month.

305
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,800
10 Oh three good.

306
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:28,791
Yeah.

307
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,110
You could smoke on your front porch now.

308
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,910
Powerful Denver.

309
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,840
Wow.

310
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,480
Fuck yeah.

311
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,313
Denver.

312
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,460
Okay.
