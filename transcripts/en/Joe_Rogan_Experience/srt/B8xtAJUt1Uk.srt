1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,111
Drive by day,

2
00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:02,850
Joe Rogan podcast by night,

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,043
all day.

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,060
That's what you want to do.

5
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,893
Both of them.

6
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,541
I know that.

7
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:07,740
And then he can't lie to me.

8
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,770
There's nothing you're going to lie
to me about because if you lie to me,

9
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm gonna see you on Monday,

10
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,534
idiot,

11
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,980
and we're going to see
what you're made of.

12
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,300
You'll know anyway.

13
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,571
I mean,

14
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,670
without even knowing what they're made of,

15
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,670
you'll know their mind.

16
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:20,820
But it's different when
you fight somebody,

17
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,530
you literally know what they're made of.

18
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:27,090
When you see the look in their eye and
they say what they say and they do what

19
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,700
they do and then they go and they fight
and they don't say what they say and

20
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:30,570
they don't do what they do.

21
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,070
And that's just fighting.

22
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,380
And that's what's so
refreshing about it to me.

23
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,071
Yeah.

24
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,870
Well the psychological aspect of it,

25
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,201
I mean,

26
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,034
you know,

27
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,370
well,

28
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,370
who was it that said this fighting is 90%
mental and the other 10% in your head?

29
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,420
I forget who said that.

30
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,201
I remember either,

31
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:46,980
but I've heard it.

32
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,940
That's a great quote.

33
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,410
I remember who said it,

34
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:49,830
but I mean it's,

35
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,000
I believe it with all my heart.

36
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,170
There's so many people out there,

37
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,150
there's so incredibly physically talented.

38
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,300
And how many gym assassins do you know
that for whatever reason they just can't

39
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:03,270
put it together when the referee
says are fine or are you ready,

40
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,290
finery ready go.

41
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,070
They just are a fraction
of who they really are.

42
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,180
Just really break down and think about
what happens to the ones that do make it

43
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,480
and then have to deal
with the media and uh,

44
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,500
opinions.

45
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,750
And I really feel like athletes,

46
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,430
the biggest hurdle is effect.

47
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,630
That we're willing to actually
just get up there and say we might,

48
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:25,620
when we might lose.

49
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,540
And just put that out there and say,

50
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,613
are you willing to,

51
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,360
to put yourself out there like that.

52
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,840
Are you willing to embarrass
yourself if you do lose?

53
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,080
Are you willing to deal with the media?

54
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:42,081
If you win for 10 years straight and then
lose and then now you're the worst guy

55
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,080
that's ever been seen in the sport or the
worst female that's ever been seen the

56
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,280
sport you didn't even belong.

57
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,114
There,

58
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,650
are you able to deal with that?

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,060
That's the question.

60
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,860
That's what being an athlete is not.

61
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,790
Well those would be an fighter being
different strains to basketball game.

62
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,510
It's true.

63
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,270
You lose a basketball game and people
might think you're a fucking loser or a

64
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:00,751
scrub,

65
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:04,470
but it's nothing like the shit
that I see fighters face online.

66
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,741
No,

67
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:04,951
I mean,

68
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,670
just look at,

69
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,670
I gotta bring Ronda Rousey up because
it's heartbreaking for me as an athlete.

70
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,540
I know what she's feeling,

71
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,740
I know what she's going through.

72
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,300
And um,

73
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,340
as a female it's even on another level,

74
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,690
I can't really imagine that.

75
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,471
I just,

76
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,630
it's a different level of
scrutiny I would imagine.

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,100
But um,

78
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,691
it's just,

79
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,060
it shows how hard it is
to deal with this man,

80
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,210
the,

81
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,210
the ups and downs because the downs
hit hard just as hard as it hit and you

82
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:38,040
gotta be ready and there can't be any
separation and who you are with a win and

83
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:38,371
a loss.

84
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,121
Because if there is,

85
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:43,980
it's going to shell and you gotta be who
you are and not be solely connected to

86
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,630
fighting as your whole being.

87
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,260
Otherwise you're over when,

88
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,880
when it,

89
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,713
when it ends,

90
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,290
right.

91
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,290
There was something about the Ronda
Rousey promos that I always felt like I

92
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,373
just,

93
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,670
I didn't like hearing it.

94
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,720
Like she was like,

95
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,240
I gotta get back to fighting because
it's the most important thing and it's a

96
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,640
thing that I can be best in the world.

97
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,040
And I was like,

98
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,610
Ooh,

99
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,710
I actually like hearing that studio.

100
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,251
I do.

101
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,750
And the reason is,

102
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:12,730
it's such a lesson if you really listening
in between the lines to the issue of

103
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,564
the world.

104
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,040
And that's just my opinion.

105
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,640
We're all putting so much into this
one thing and we think that that is our

106
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,140
everything when really if she,

107
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,430
Eh,

108
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,580
Eh,

109
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,480
it sounds cheesy,

110
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,260
but if you put all that energy towards
loving yourself and not the fight career,

111
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,110
the fight career will still be
there just as heavy as it is.

112
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,190
Right.

113
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,521
You know?

114
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:35,110
So what I mean is she's using the
fighting as her identity with that

115
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,980
championship belt.

116
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,210
She is Ronda Rousey,

117
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,000
the Ronda Rousey without
the championship belt.

118
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,930
We don't know who she is.

119
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:41,800
She won't come out.

120
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,870
So who are you?

121
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,790
Unless you're winning.

122
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,201
We don't know.

123
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,034
Do you know?

124
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,560
You're counting on that belt
to know who you are now?

125
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,340
And that's,

126
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,630
that was my biggest point.

127
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,450
That was a hurdle I ran
into when I lost my belt.

128
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,130
I didn't know who I was anymore,

129
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,990
and that's how I knew this.

130
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,610
That's how I figured
out what my issues were.

131
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,260
[inaudible]

132
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:10,300
yeah.
