1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,170
Oh,
an unusual early morning for me,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,360
an early morning episode of the podcast.
Ethan,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,590
very nice to meet you,
man.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,930
Thanks for doing this now.
It's my pleasure.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,750
So drug policy alliance.
How far are we away?

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,430
Let's let's get this done.
Come on.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,930
Well,
it depends what it is,

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,730
right when it comes to legalizing 
marijuana.

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,180
I mean we got momentum that nobody could
have believed we'd had just four or five

10
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:21,930
years ago.
Right.

11
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:26,931
So in that sense things are flying.
I don't think it's in the bag yet 

12
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:26,931
though,
you know,

13
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:30,981
I might.
One of my biggest concerns is the sense 

14
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:30,981
of overconfidence where this whole thing
could trip up.

15
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:31,110
Yeah.
My biggest,

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,710
my biggest concern is that,
and it's also like Jeb Bush and guys 

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,370
like that,
like if those guys or that fat fuck from

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,400
New Jersey Christy,
can you believe the crapola coming out 

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,400
of his mouth on this stuff?

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,180
Somehow he's going to identify that 
niche of the Republican party that wants

21
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:50,181
to keep locking up people for weed and 
that Rubio was saying stuff like that 

22
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:50,181
the other day.
So I have a theory.

23
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,390
Yeah,
I have a theory.

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,380
I think what he's trying to do is make 
sure he's never president and really do.

25
00:00:55,381 --> 00:01:00,381
I really think that that guy is so 
deeply in embedded in corruption in New 

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Jersey that the moment he actually 
becomes a serious candidate for 

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,100
president,
I think the shit is going to come out of

28
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,680
the closet.
Like a broken fire hydrant.

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,710
Yeah,
because I think also his popularity has 

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,670
fallen so low in New Jersey right now 
that he just wanted to get out of town.

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,050
I think that's why he's running for 
president.

32
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:24,051
It's better than dealing with stuff and 
trend and acknowledging all the screw 

33
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:24,051
ups he's had.
I mean,

34
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll tell you something,
that we lead drug policy alliance lead 

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that effort to legalize medical 
marijuana in Jersey.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,270
Back a few years ago,
governor core resigned last billy sign 

37
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,270
was that one and then Christie came 
around.

38
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,120
He did old and Donald and didn't want to
do it.

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,150
Wouldn't have rutgers university grow 
the weed.

40
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,820
They didn't want to grow the weed.
It was weird.

41
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,150
And then finally he went on vacation 
like by 18 months,

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,020
his term,
he came back.

43
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,240
He goes,
I want to do this now,

44
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,060
and I kept wondering whether you had a 
puff on vacation,

45
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,690
who knows in New Jersey,
still hobbling along.

46
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:53,490
You know,
Christie,

47
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,430
the funny thing also is when it comes to
ending the drug war more broadly,

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,110
he's highly unpredictable.
You know,

49
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,950
we took on the bail bond industry,
the private bill button,

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,030
the trees,
just trying to keep people locked up for

51
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:08,031
as long as possible.
Local jails and Christy liquored up 

52
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:08,031
coming on our side,
you know,

53
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,620
bond industry was working to make sure 
that people stayed in jail.

54
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,620
I gotta tell you,
if you look at all the corrupt actors 

55
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:15,620
and the prison industrial complex,
you know,

56
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,391
you get to prison guards union,
you get the private prison corporations 

57
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:23,570
to private bail bond industry.
I mean if ever there was a sorted gang 

58
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,500
that had to be it.
And so we led that effort.

59
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,020
We got Christie to come along with us,
push them back,

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,690
you know,
so Christie's done some decent stuff.

61
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,880
He'll talk about addiction as a health 
issue.

62
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,020
There was an issue,
you know,

63
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,900
people dying of overdoses and we wanted 
to deal with that.

64
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:40,080
And he was initially vetoing it.
Did we got Bon Jovi involved?

65
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,630
He wanted to get a photo op,
but by Jovi.

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,010
So whose daughter had odd unfortunately 
lived.

67
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:46,620
So he came along then.
So he's been a mixed bag.

68
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:48,930
But for some reason on this marijuana 
thing,

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,660
he's just going over the top anti 
legalization.

70
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,970
I don't really get it.
I think he's.

71
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,450
I really honestly think that he's trying
to make sure that he's never president.

72
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,690
I really do.
I think he understands the tide and I 

73
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:02,690
think he's terrified.
I think he has a lot of skeletons in his

74
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,470
closet.
He's involved in New Jersey politics,

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,070
New Jersey politics is so much more 
corrupt than New York politics,

76
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,260
which is the most corrupt part of the 
country.

77
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,280
Yeah.
Although,

78
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,960
you know,
we're breaking some records in New York,

79
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:18,961
you think just last six months.
Both the head of the assembly and the 

80
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:18,961
head of the Senate have both been 
indicted,

81
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,440
you know,
so you know,

82
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,460
it's neck and neck between us in Jersey.
New Jersey's got that strong tradition 

83
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,230
history.
I remember Christie made his name by 

84
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,230
being the federal prosecutor going after
these guys.

85
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,730
Then he gets himself involved in this 
bridge gate scandal,

86
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,760
you know,
with a guy on one side of the bridge,

87
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,770
shut down traffic for two days because 
somebody had done something they didn't 

88
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:40,770
like.

89
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,450
So I think Christy had his moment back 
in 2012,

90
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:47,410
2011 when he was hot and riding high in 
the polls and his whole bullying act was

91
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:52,411
going over.
Well I think he's down in done with 

92
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:55,141
already just wants to be out of town.
Well you can only shine like that as a 

93
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:58,711
bully for so long because if you're that
guy that's yelling and screaming at 

94
00:03:58,711 --> 00:03:59,740
everybody else and she's sticking your 
fat gut out there,

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,330
eventually people start going,
hey man,

96
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,280
what about you?
I mean,

97
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:02,980
you know,
the sad thing,

98
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,981
that's the way Giuliani was,
the only thing that saved his ass was 

99
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:08,200
9:11,
9:11

100
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:13,201
comes along.
Sudden he goes from being like 20 

101
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:13,201
percent of the polls to 90 percent and 
he's the heroic mayor.

102
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,360
But quite frankly people were burnt out 
on his act and it was only.

103
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
And God forbid we do a crisis like that 
gives Kristi a second run.

104
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,870
Well,
Giuliani was like the antidote for mayor

105
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,040
Dinkins.
Yeah,

106
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,340
that's right.
Dinkins was like this really calm,

107
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,560
laid back guy and really racist people 
would call them.

108
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:34,561
The janitor folks who weren't around 
back in the nineties in New York don't 

109
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,250
know that.
First of all,

110
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,170
time square was a completely different 
animal.

111
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,200
Like you go to time square now it's this
beautiful tourist trap.

112
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:46,201
It's all neon lights and shining stars 
and I kind of missed the old time 

113
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,170
square.
It was a CD,

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,910
it was CD.
It's now got overtop the other way,

115
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:52,990
you know where it's like Disneyland on 
42nd street.

116
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Imagine that though.
If you could ever go back to New York 

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,670
City in 19 eighties and then see what 
times square was like and then come back

118
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:02,200
again.
You know what it is.

119
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,270
I mean,
because I live in New York City and so I

120
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:09,271
live in the center of the universe in 
which you realize is that there's only 

121
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:09,400
so long in the center of the universe 
can go on without,

122
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,870
you know,
people reinvesting in it.

123
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,110
It's the island of Manhattan has got to 
be the most amazing island in the world 

124
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,260
and I'm,
it's just glowing these days.

125
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,750
What do you,
what do you like about it?

126
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,310
Well,
first of all,

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,660
I mean,
I like being in this,

128
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,920
you know,
some people say it's a nice place to 

129
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:27,920
visit.
I want to live someplace else.

130
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:27,920
For me,
I want to live in New York.

131
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,720
I want to ride that energy and then as 
long as she can get out often,

132
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,750
I mean the key is being able to get out 
of town and I'm out of town about half 

133
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,030
the time,
so I get to go out,

134
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,860
see the stars,
see the ocean,

135
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:43,861
you know,
take hikes and then go back and write 

136
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:46,231
that energy.
I love the fact that it's a pedestrian 

137
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:46,231
city.
I don't own a car,

138
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:47,200
right?
I can walk to work,

139
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:49,030
I can take the subway,
you know,

140
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:49,670
and then I want.

141
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,240
But this past weekend for the first time
you,

142
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,100
Californians and others might not 
appreciate this,

143
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:57,290
but you're all over the place.
I drove my bike from the upper west side

144
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:02,291
of Manhattan down to Brighton Beach.
About a 20 mile bike ride over the 

145
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,250
Brooklyn Bridge through Brooklyn,
along the New York harbor.

146
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,280
It was gorgeous.
And the next day I took my bike up the 

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,310
Hudson river or to dikeman street.
So there's great beauty there.

148
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,870
Everything's there.
I could,

149
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,590
I could live my entire life and not go 
more than five blocks from my apartment.

150
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:20,591
And everything's available.
So the diversity of people live in 

151
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:20,591
there,
you know,

152
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:23,510
everybody comes through there.
A and New York,

153
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,630
New York's just a center.
It's happened to you.

154
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,280
It's perfect for you.
It's perfect.

155
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,120
Friendly.
Jeff,

156
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,730
my manager actually is a great friend of
mine.

157
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,490
Has been there forever and he couldn't 
imagine living anywhere else,

158
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,730
but he also has a house on an island 
that he visits occasionally and he'll 

159
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,140
stay there for a week and just sort of 
like tell you know what,

160
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,800
there's this place called fire island 
which spent an hour outside of New York.

161
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,520
Yeah.
And so there's the fame,

162
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:47,810
you know,
the,

163
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,450
the pines is the famous where all the 
gay community is.

164
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,280
And then there's all the other little 
towns,

165
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:52,940
uh,
you know,

166
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:56,330
and I been out there twice this summer.
It reminds me almost of Venice.

167
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:01,331
It's an island with no cars and take a 
one on my office is half a block from 

168
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:05,561
Penn station,
jump on the train one hour than a half 

169
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:09,670
hour ferry and also in his gorgeous 
little island that's got no cars on it 

170
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,631
and you just relax.
And the no cars things is what keeps 

171
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:14,090
people away.
There's a lot of deer on that island.

172
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,910
They used to be more,
you know,

173
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,940
now they're putting all this birth 
control stuff in the water for the 

174
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:20,940
theater.
Isn't that hilarious?

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:20,940
Yeah.
You know,

176
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,470
doing,
you know,

177
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:25,030
in the water shouldn't say the water 
because that would be good.

178
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,520
Everybody.

179
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
But yeah,
they had to deal with that solid thing 

180
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,410
there.
What are they doing it for food or 

181
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,941
something?
Leaving in something like that cost 

182
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:33,941
hundreds of thousands of dollars by the 
way.

183
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:33,941
Is that right?
Yeah,

184
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:37,820
they're trying to do the same thing to 
the Hamptons is a real dear issue.

185
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:41,000
And there was two options.
One bringing hunters and they were going

186
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,350
to hunt at night.
Snipers.

187
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,470
You reminded me there was a piece in the
Wall Street Journal years,

188
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,840
years ago,
maybe decades ago.

189
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,430
The Institute for Advanced Study is like
what?

190
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,530
It's this gorgeous place next door to 
Princeton University and it's where 

191
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,850
Albert Einstein was some of the greatest
philosophers and scientists.

192
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,850
It's where they go when they're in their
older years and do their thinking,

193
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,120
bucolic setting,
and they were overwhelmed with deer.

194
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,780
So the question was what to do?
Well,

195
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,870
you couldn't shoot them in this bucolic 
place,

196
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:11,300
right?
So what they do is they hired archers,

197
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,970
professional archers to kill them with 
bows and arrows,

198
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,290
and there was this uproar.

199
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,100
You know,
this song,

200
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,350
you know,
all of a sudden,

201
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,460
you know,
they're with a philosophers.

202
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,710
That bucks of deer bites the dust.
But yeah.

203
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,480
You know what way does it,
you got to deal with that stuff.

204
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Well,
it's food to these same people are 

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:28,720
eating cheeseburgers.
They're eating Turkey sandwiches,

206
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,641
they're eating dead animals that are 
killed in a way more horrific way and 

207
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:37,691
live in a way more horrific condition.
I know I've always thought I have an 

208
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:41,051
obligation as an occasional mediator to 
actually see the process by which the 

209
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:45,251
food I eat is produced.
I have to admit I've never made good on 

210
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:49,001
that commitment to myself.
I just started doing it about three 

211
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,491
years ago.
I started hunting three years ago and 

212
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:51,491
I'm addicted to it now.
I love it.

213
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,810
I get almost all my meat from hunting.
I had bear last night.

214
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:56,070
I served bear to my five year old and my
seven year old.

215
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,630
Wow.
So you know me,

216
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:00,630
I grew up Jewish and closure.
I'm still kosher.

217
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,670
It's the one relevant,
my traditional upbringing.

218
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,520
And so traditionally Jews don't hunt,
you know,

219
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,320
although it's weird.
You may choose from the south,

220
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,250
you know,
Jews who hunt.

221
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,160
It's kind of a contradiction in terms of
the Jews in the south that hunt.

222
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,210
Oh my God.
Yeah.

223
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,260
You know,
it's part of the culture,

224
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,370
part of the tradition,
you know,

225
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,440
most of those Jews don't keep kosher so 
they don't care.

226
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,930
So there's gotta be some and then you've
got texted Jews.

227
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,550
They're a special breed.
They got to do it.

228
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,060
He just text and Jews,
they probably had a like Jews in Lebanon

229
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,050
and we were talking about yesterday.
Um,

230
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,980
when you,
when you say that your kosher,

231
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:33,981
what exactly does that mean?
Like you have to have a rabbi kill your 

232
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,550
beef and he is like say some Voodoo and 
then cut its throat more or less it,

233
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,340
it's,
you know,

234
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,950
I mean basically it's this,
you know,

235
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,600
some of it's ground in the Bible,
you know,

236
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:47,601
in some clause that says,
do not eat the meat of the calf and its 

237
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:47,790
mother's milk so you don't eat meat 
together with dairy.

238
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,270
And then they say you may meet,
it's got to the animals.

239
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,210
Got to have a split huff.
Intuit's cut,

240
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,340
right.
Could be a cow.

241
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,200
Actually,
venison would be okay.

242
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,390
Cow deer,
sheep.

243
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,580
Then it needs to be slaughtered in a 
special way,

244
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,530
which for Millennia was the most humane 
way of killing that.

245
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:06,720
It'll bleed,
has to be absolute,

246
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,880
perfectly sharp in the last couple of 
decades.

247
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:11,970
There's now a dispute because in Europe 
they're beginning to band the kosher way

248
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:16,971
of killing because it's no longer than 
most humane way according to the 

249
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:20,331
science.
That takes more time if you ever seen 

250
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:20,350
it.
I haven't thrown up rough.

251
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,370
I've seen it.
I went to a butcher not to a butcher 

252
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:25,370
rather to a slaughterhouse.
Once we're kosher,

253
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,540
kosher one,
will they do kosher as well?

254
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,380
Um,
it,

255
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,810
it was a slaughter house for fear 
factor,

256
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,030
fear factor stunt there.
And it was,

257
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,480
the stunt was these people had a dunk 
their head in these giant buckets of 

258
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,480
blood.

259
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,920
So we had to have this cow's blood that 
was chilled to slightly over 32 degrees 

260
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:48,060
and we can only keep it for a short 
amount of time or could possibly contain

261
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:53,061
pathogens.
So it was really cold water or really 

262
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:56,330
cold blood rather.
So they gave me like a little tour of 

263
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:56,330
the place and explain to me how they do 
it.

264
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,920
And they have this area where the cow 
goes in,

265
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:03,921
they locked the commonplace in a piston,
goes through the cow's head and kills 

266
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:03,921
them.
But they're like,

267
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:08,760
you know,
the guy was pretty adamant about and 

268
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,461
he's like,
we have a rabbi that comes and they do 

269
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:10,890
the kosher slaughter and it goes in.
It's way worse.

270
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,850
Yeah.
It's way worse.

271
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,060
They hold the collar in place with the 
thing and then they slice it snack and 

272
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,941
it's it boxing exactly from Millennia.
It was a more humane way because in the 

273
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,150
old days you just knock it over the head
and all this stuff has been kosher way 

274
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,821
was if the blade was not razor sharp,
if they had the tiniest nick in it and 

275
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,970
you discovered that afterward the animal
is not kosher.

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,790
So there was a way of doing it that was 
supposedly better,

277
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,530
you know.
But you know,

278
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,600
it is.
It's the one true.

279
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:37,260
I grew up,
my dad was a rabbi,

280
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:42,261
I grew up traditional and all that 
Sabbath observant and this is the one 

281
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:42,261
thing I'm still keeping.
Its like why?

282
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,330
Why do you keep it?
It's partially my own sort of 

283
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,511
commitment,
my Jewish connection and sort of daily 

284
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:50,670
reminder of that.
It's partially a family thing,

285
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:51,690
like a family,
you know,

286
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:56,691
we grew up this way and partly 
superstitious that this is part of my 

287
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,570
bargain with the cosmos,
with my bargain,

288
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,680
with God.
You know,

289
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,430
that,
okay,

290
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm going to do this little sacrifice in
my life and it's,

291
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,440
you know,
I've led a blessed life and uh,

292
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,010
hey man,
maybe this is part of it.

293
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,420
Why risk advice stuff in it?
The only way I can.

294
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
I've had,
I've had some of the things by accident,

295
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,600
like I've had hand by accident and 
probably a trip by accident.

296
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,810
I've never had it intentionally.
Don't think I've had bacon.

297
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,450
Although when I eat in the diner,
they got the bacon grease on the eggs.

298
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,770
I get,
you know,

299
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,540
I love the smell of Bacon.
I'll say that.

300
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,760
You've never eaten it?
No,

301
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,300
because it's just,
it's just this thing about bear big.

302
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,910
And could you eat bear?
Oh No,

303
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,180
it's split huff too.
It's good.

304
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,610
That's it.
But they don't have a split.

305
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:35,080
Whoa.
I have paused.

306
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,180
That's something they need to split.
Oh yeah.

307
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:37,990
That's the thing.
So.

308
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,130
And the only exception is if you're 
starving to death and you can eat 

309
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,500
anything.
Chickens find chicken that.

310
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,300
Because that goes into the separate 
category of poultry.

311
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,890
Oh,
right.

312
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,940
So you can't shoot birds,
but you can eat that.

313
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,580
You can shoot them.
Will not.

314
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:56,581
I don't think so.
I think it's also going to be 

315
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,621
slaughtered a certain way.
So there's kosher chickens as oppose 

316
00:12:58,621 --> 00:12:58,621
your chicken kosher duck.
And you're living in New York.

317
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:01,120
You got a lot of choices when you travel
around.

318
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,130
Mind you,
the kosher industry,

319
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:08,131
food industry is growing faster than the
organic food industry proportionally 

320
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:08,131
really going to tell you.
I mean,

321
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:09,430
doing this thing here with you and uh,
you know,

322
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:12,130
in California you go to Manhattan Beach,
now you go whatever,

323
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:12,910
you got the,
uh,

324
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:16,540
the trader Joe's big kosher sections.
And it's not just Jews,

325
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,320
it's all sorts of other people who still
see it as an effect.

326
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,040
To some extent it is,
it's more reliable,

327
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,190
good quality.
The highest ends not going to be kosher,

328
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,440
but in terms of reliable,
good stuff,

329
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,840
you know,
people say Kosher is a pretty good bet.

330
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,360
That's interesting.
More than organic.

331
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,850
I would never have imagined,
it's not bigger than organic,

332
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:38,851
but it's growing proportionately faster 
and that's partially because you have 

333
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,720
orthodox Jews are the fastest growing 
part of American Judaism,

334
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:41,890
right?
Liberal views like yeah,

335
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,230
liberal Jews like me have one kid,
I got one kid,

336
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,220
two kids,
right.

337
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,990
Orthodox Jews are having,
you know,

338
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,780
five or 10 kids.
So they're growing incredibly fast.

339
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Right.
So they're a market and you have Jewish 

340
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Orthodox Jewish communities that popping
up all around the country.

341
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,450
Manhattan beach out here in California.
La has got a big orthodox community,

342
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,850
you know,
and then there are people on the African

343
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,280
American people see it as basically,
you know,

344
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,310
they hear this kosher is better.
And then remember the Muslim Halaal is 

345
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,270
very similar to similar rules.
No pig.

346
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:12,010
The slaughterings I think somewhat 
similar.

347
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,730
So a lot of people out of Muslims by 
kosher food because for them all I know.

348
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,240
Is that something the Jews won't buy.
Hello?

349
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,190
In place a kosher.
But I think Muslims,

350
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:26,191
some Muslims will buy kosher because it 
meets the Heloc and the headline reads 

351
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:27,400
Muslims more tolerant than Jews.
There you go.

352
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,910
Here you go.
Here and a half.

353
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,990
There's that area around canter's Deli 
in La.

354
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,580
Have you ever been to cancers?
I don't think so.

355
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,430
Oh,
you got to go.

356
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,580
Best Deli in all of La by far so good.
The pastrami is off the charts.

357
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:42,670
The Best Pastrami in La problems though 
with some of these delis.

358
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:45,100
They used to be kosher.
Now they're just kosher style.

359
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,680
It's like they got the Pastrami and 
stuff like that,

360
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,890
but it turns out because it's expensive 
to pay the rabbi to bless it and 

361
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,980
slaughtering,
so I have to make sure it's actually 

362
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:56,980
strictly kosher.
Wow.

363
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,650
You really do did into that high,
you know,

364
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,130
it's been my thing.

365
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,800
I got to tell you,
I've had more people,

366
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,510
more friends and others rag on me than 
anything.

367
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,710
And I say people say so would you ever 
stop?

368
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,860
And I say the only way I'd ever stopped.
I think you said if they made it a law 

369
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,380
that I had to keep kosher.
If they made it a law,

370
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,810
you had to keep kosher kosher that very 
next day.

371
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,400
Well who would make it a law?
Well,

372
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,870
that's what I'm saying.
It's not gonna happen in America,

373
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:20,630
but I look what's going on in Israel 
where the religious parties are becoming

374
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:24,430
more and more powerful and dominant and 
you go to Jerusalem and their frequency,

375
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,750
or here's the rules on the Sabbath.
Here's the rules on this.

376
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:31,751
Here's the rules on that one can 
envision a generation from now that it 

377
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:31,751
Israel,
you might have,

378
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:36,280
you know,
the religious folks driving everything 

379
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,280
and make a law like that.

380
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,220
If they did that and I'm still alive,
I'll stop.

381
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,010
So if they did that in Israel,
you would stop in America.

382
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,950
Probably just had a protest.
Just that approach just because you want

383
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:44,780
bacon.
That's what's up man.

384
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,430
You know what happens?
I'll tell you the hard,

385
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,780
the hardest thing you keep kosher.
I've never had lobster and shrimp.

386
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,230
I've never really had.
The hardest stuff is when there's a 

387
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,991
beautiful steak or a beautiful piece of 
duck or a lamb out there and it's 

388
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,140
basically no different in the kosher 
stuff,

389
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,110
but I can't eat it because they didn't 
pay the rabbi to bless it and they spoke

390
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,480
differently.
That's the one that hurts,

391
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,290
right?
People I to do.

392
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,570
I got to tag onto what people.
They say,

393
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,250
Oh,
do you mind if I order some pork or as a

394
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,790
lobster?
I say,

395
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,140
please,
whatever you do,

396
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,960
don't order a beautiful lamb chop or 
steak or something like that.

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,120
That's actually going to torture me 
there.

398
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:20,390
I'm eating my damn piece of fish for the
eighth time that week and you know,

399
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,910
it was a beautiful state that I can eat,
so it's fish.

400
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,370
Always Kosher.
Is that the rule is if it comes from the

401
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,710
sea,
it's got to have fins and scales.

402
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,370
Jesus Christ.
So octopus is off the charts to you name

403
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:36,371
it.
All that stuff's all God have fins and 

404
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,111
scales.
The shellfish is off and scallops and 

405
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:41,171
for that matter,
things like shark and skate and even 

406
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:44,220
catfish is the one I cheat with a little
bit and this is a debate about 

407
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,220
swordfish.
I go with,

408
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,220
I,
I,

409
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,670
I'm part of the school that says 
swordfish.

410
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,520
It's kosher,
but my dad was a rabbi.

411
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,930
He came down that side.
I'm going,

412
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,390
my dad.
Does your dad still alive though?

413
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,770
Dialogue that I would have fucking had a
lobster that moment.

414
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,440
That dude was in the.
Oh yeah.

415
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,520
Hey,
he didn't even grow up keeping kosher.

416
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,780
He loved rabbit.
You know,

417
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,510
he loved God.
He became a rabbi.

418
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:03,710
He had no choice.
You know,

419
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,660
it just seems so odd to me that a 
rational man like you,

420
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,460
so obviously intelligent and educated 
would follow that.

421
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:14,270
You know what's good about this?
It gives me a sense of empathy for other

422
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:19,010
people with their rational attachments.
Attachments to drugs.

423
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:20,480
Exactly,
exactly.

424
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,680
Or irrational attachments,
anything.

425
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:24,440
My view is irrational attachments are 
fine.

426
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,750
Maybe even good so long as they don't 
hurt anybody else.

427
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,570
My keeping kosher doesn't really hurt 
anybody else.

428
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:34,571
Right.
And there's all sorts of other 

429
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:34,571
attachments to religious things,
to types of Gods,

430
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:34,571
to habits,
to name it.

431
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,830
It's not hurting anybody else.
I can kind of,

432
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:41,831
you know,
I got that little empathic sense for 

433
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:41,831
what it means to be irrationally 
committed to something.

434
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:42,320
All right,
man,

435
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,470
look at you.
You're looking at irrational thinking in

436
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,620
a rational way to do that.
You know,

437
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,810
you got to be just totally rational.
That'd be kind of boring too.

438
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,960
It was.
So let's get back to drug legalization 

439
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,030
because we've got right now,
we've got two states that are across the

440
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:59,020
board.
One hundred percent.

441
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:00,910
We've got Washington state and we got 
Colorado.

442
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,770
What's on the ballot right now?

443
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,890
Remember also Alaska and Oregon joined 
the group,

444
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,300
uh,
last November.

445
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:09,760
So we have four states that are 
illegally there.

446
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,820
And Oregon's can open up sales I think 
in a few months.

447
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:15,280
And Alaska should open up sales.
I can't remember the end of this year,

448
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:20,281
beginning of next.
So we've got four states that have 

449
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,250
legalized each one of them doing with 55
percent of the vote,

450
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,520
typically getting more votes.
And the guys who are running for 

451
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,891
governor,
attorney general in those states got 

452
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:28,891
that.
Those years,

453
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:32,360
big dc did everything except legalized.
They basically said you can grow your 

454
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,270
own,
you can transfer it,

455
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,290
but they're not,
they haven't.

456
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,620
They haven't set up formal sales yet 
because people worry that Congress will 

457
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:40,690
sort of put a hammer on them.
Right.

458
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,680
So you can't go to a store know those 
stores in DC.

459
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,920
There's a little movement on Capitol 
Hill right now that might allow some 

460
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:49,920
room there.

461
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:49,920
But the guy,
you know,

462
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:49,920
the,
the city council,

463
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,841
the mayor in,
in dc who are on board with 

464
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:54,841
legalization,
but they're just saying,

465
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:59,720
do we want to provoke congress because a
lot of those guys would just come down 

466
00:18:59,720 --> 00:18:59,720
hard,
you know,

467
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,960
they're used to treating dc like the 
plantation,

468
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,080
right?
If it's one of the great absurdities in 

469
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,080
American politics that you got a 
population of what,

470
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,330
six,
700,000

471
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:12,331
people,
I think it's as big as a few of the 

472
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:14,101
smaller states,
but they got no representation on 

473
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,741
Capitol Hill.
They got a member of the house who can 

474
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:16,741
vote.
They got no members of the Senate,

475
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,590
they can vote for president.
Right.

476
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,450
And then they got congress basically,
you know,

477
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,520
the ability to veto any law.
They pass.

478
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,540
So.

479
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,620
And they have an extremely fucked up 
situation as far as the haves and have 

480
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,320
nots in their own town.

481
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,930
They really do.
Although there's a shift in the.

482
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,240
I mean DC was recently like two thirds 
African American.

483
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,510
Now as it's become more gentrified,
it's still about 50 percent African 

484
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,510
American.

485
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,510
Well,
the,

486
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,330
the issue is not just the African 
Americans,

487
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:46,331
the poverty,
the poverty is in massive poverty and 

488
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,720
crime in certain sections of DC and the 
fact that that's the nation's capital.

489
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,610
They can't even clean up their own 
backyard.

490
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:49,970
Yeah,
no,

491
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:54,971
that's completely ignored it.
When it was really highlighted when 

492
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,180
Marion Barry was president,
and I should say as garden centers,

493
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,690
Mayor

494
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,750
Mayor it,
it's gotten better since those days and 

495
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,421
the sense that there's been more to 
address those issues has been some 

496
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:04,421
gentrification.
Poverty is not as bad.

497
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:09,191
They still got bad crime rates.
It's not as bad as Baltimore's bid a 

498
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,950
bunch of Baltimore's one of the worst 
places in the country right now.

499
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,430
Detroit,
New Orleans.

500
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,230
Although you've got a few places out 
here in California,

501
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,980
I have a hard time.
You.

502
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:16,760
Oh,
for sure.

503
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,910
CCS Weird in that you can go from really
nice to really bad in a couple of 

504
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,470
blocks.
I was shocked when I was driving through

505
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:26,240
dc because I was like,
this is crazy.

506
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,540
You've seen these really a cute white 
couples with the little stroller and 

507
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:36,620
they're in these really nice brownstones
and they have a Volvo parked in front of

508
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:41,621
the house and right next to them as a 
bmw and then you go two blocks down and 

509
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:46,031
you see people drinking on the street 
and there's kids with no shoes on and 

510
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:47,060
is.
It's garbage piled up.

511
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,030
I was like,
this is

512
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,160
really nuts.
It could be partially about 

513
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,160
gentrification.
Properties list expensive.

514
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,880
So first typically gays will move in,
right?

515
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:56,410
Because they don't have kids to worry 
about and such.

516
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:01,411
And then after that you get some young 
couples and others moving in and so you 

517
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:04,801
begin to get that.
You saw the same thing in parts of New 

518
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:04,801
York City,
upper east side or lower east side.

519
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,010
Um,
you know,

520
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:09,100
it's when things begin to change that 
way that you get that kind of stuff.

521
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,130
Wasn't that the big complaint about New 
York City's at so many rich financial 

522
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,461
people have moved in that the entire 
city is kind of used to be this artist 

523
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,440
community and there's now that's kind of
Brooklyn now.

524
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,910
The funny thing is now they're saying 
Brooklyn's moral becoming more like 

525
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,631
Manhattan and Queens is becoming the new
Brooklyn and I got to say living in the 

526
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:31,801
upper west side where it's,
I mean I'm lucky I'm in a rent 

527
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:31,900
stabilized apartment there,
but,

528
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:34,690
and I live in a beautiful tree lined 
street in a little apartment,

529
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,830
uh,
you know,

530
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:38,950
but then you see the banks moving in and
taking over the street corners,

531
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:39,370
right?

532
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,370
And you see more chain stores coming in 
and so Manhattan has become this 

533
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,941
beautiful place,
but less and less affordable now 

534
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:50,821
Brooklyn people,
like most of the people work for me in 

535
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:53,251
New York living in Brooklyn,
but now they got to move out to the 

536
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:54,820
further further away from Manhattan part
of Brooklyn and Queens and the Bronx and

537
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:57,700
Upper Manhattan are becoming the places,
you know.

538
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,210
I mean,
look,

539
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,980
the city's happen.
It's great.

540
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:04,981
It's amazing.
The downside of our economic growth has 

541
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:06,850
been at the same thing with Wall Street.
Wall Street is the,

542
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,270
the gap between rich and poor in New 
York City is,

543
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:13,270
is horrific and huge.
On the other hand,

544
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:18,271
Wall Street is providing massive amounts
of tax revenue and New York City taxes 

545
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:22,621
itself at a very high level,
so we actually have better services in 

546
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:22,621
New York City that most parts of the 
world.

547
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,730
My friend Shane was living in Brooklyn 
and um,

548
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,420
me and my family came to visit and we 
hung out with him one night and we had 

549
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,350
this apartment that overlooks the 
Manhattan skyline and we were looking at

550
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:38,351
it and I was like,
this might be the best looking view on 

551
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:38,351
the planet.

552
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,360
Like there's something about that.
There's,

553
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,520
there's like,
I think there's two types of amazing 

554
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,311
views.
There's amazing views of the mountains 

555
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:47,350
and nature,
which is pretty stunning.

556
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,450
But there's something about the 
Manhattan skyline that is so insane that

557
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:55,450
someone built that.
It's like,

558
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,690
it's gorgeous because it's all lit up 
and the shapes are cool and then he has 

559
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,090
the history behind it and you're looking
at all this activity and bustling people

560
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:09,091
back and forth.
And then there's also the magnitude of 

561
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:12,181
the amount of effort that was put into 
creating something like staring you in 

562
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:13,840
the face to face.
Usually I'll be on a plane that's coming

563
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,980
from north,
from the north,

564
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:19,981
say from Albany or Montreal or wherever 
it's coming from and it lands up going 

565
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,230
down the Hudson River.
Right.

566
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,270
And you know,
Manhattan's basically a long island.

567
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:23,020
It's like,
I don't know,

568
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:28,021
15,
20 miles long and about a mile wide or 

569
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:31,111
sell and you look down at that thing and
Manhattan and New York harbor and 

570
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:35,480
there's a statue of liberty and there 
you can see Staten Island and Brooklyn 

571
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,180
Jersey around it and then you see the 
empire state building and then you see 

572
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,180
the freedom tower.

573
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,270
You see central park in the middle of 
it,

574
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,290
one of the largest,
you know,

575
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,320
inner city parks in the world.
It brings tears to my eyes still.

576
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,670
It's just incredible.
Yeah,

577
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:48,860
it was pretty awesome spot.
But you can't get weed there.

578
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,460
Well,
what do you mean you can't get.

579
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,620
You can get a weed anyway.
You can get to talk to David Lee Roth.

580
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,120
Got arrested.
Trying to get weed there.

581
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,360
You know,
you've got to be either really unlucky 

582
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,131
or dumb.
What kind of compress David Leroy Leroy 

583
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,460
passed.
Are You sir?

584
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,480
I got to tell you,
I think our delivery services are very 

585
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,480
well developed in New York City,
right?

586
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,920
But they're always under the wire.
Like that was always the problem that I 

587
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:14,920
have in la.
Before it was legal.

588
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,580
I used to deal with this dude named Jake
the snake.

589
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,530
That was his nickname.
I'm not kidding.

590
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:19,400
And he wasn't a wrestler.

591
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,140
Jake,
the snake was so annoying.

592
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,360
He was so annoying and he,
uh,

593
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,390
he would sell a W.
I would get it from my friend Eddie and 

594
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,500
Eddie would get it from jake the snake,
and we would have to deal with this guy.

595
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:35,501
So this is like we'd have these 
conversations with this guy and now and 

596
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:35,501
then,
you know,

597
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:39,521
and it's like.
And I always felt like it wasn't a bad 

598
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:39,521
guy,
wasn't he was a bad guy,

599
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,551
but it was annoying that you had to deal
with this dude who was willing to do 

600
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:43,340
something illegal because like there was
some criminal aspects to it.

601
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,880
There's always going to be like.
And I got to say I'm lucky because one 

602
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,870
of the perks of my job is I can just 
rely on the kindness of strangers.

603
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,140
I mean forever I go,
people are going to euthanasia and want 

604
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,140
to try a little bit.

605
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Hey,
they got this one is,

606
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,170
it's hard to take it home with me.
Right.

607
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,090
But even in New York,
people are kind of.

608
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,180
So I haven't had to buy weed and a very 
long time.

609
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,510
I'm happy to say good for you.
Yeah.

610
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,930
Yeah.
Now you saw that,

611
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,960
uh,
my job has got some very nice elements 

612
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,890
to it and this is one of the informal 
positive benefits to it,

613
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,920
you know,
but New York is now they finally the 

614
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,800
state just approve 20 outlets for 
medical marijuana.

615
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,020
So most of those are going to be in the 
city.

616
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,670
It's still going to be very strict 
system.

617
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:25,790
We led that effort in New York last year
to legalize medical marijuana.

618
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,090
Unfortunately,
governor Cuomo acted in total bad faith 

619
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,970
and made a system that is far,
far too tight,

620
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,880
a no logical reason for it.
But that said they just,

621
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,970
the state just approve five companies to
have five gross sites with 20 I outlets.

622
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,480
So we're locking down the profit aspect 
of it.

623
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,020
They are.
I mean my God,

624
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,090
it's going to be a boondoggle for these 
five.

625
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,700
You know,
that God,

626
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,430
it's so fucked up.
Why do that?

627
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,500
That doesn't make any sense.
Is that the case for tomatoes?

628
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,600
Is that the case for any other piece of 
produce?

629
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:58,601
Anything grown from the earth?
What about lettuce can buy lead us 

630
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:01,990
anywhere.
I imagine if there was a company in New 

631
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,540
York that locked down the lettuce market
and the only way you can get a salad 

632
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:04,550
from this one fucking company.
Yeah.

633
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,610
No I agree with you totally.
Just kind of hear what's going on at 

634
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:09,610
Ohio.
Right?

635
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,170
And Ohio is going to have a kit to vote 
to legalize marijuana in this year.

636
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:17,171
Twenty 15.
The only initiative on the ballot this 

637
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:18,980
year as opposed to next year is from 
Ohio when I was in the papers today.

638
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,080
Because the initiative just qualified 
yesterday.

639
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Right.
And what they found that when we 

640
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,081
basically what happened there was 10.
I think it was roughly 10 business 

641
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:29,180
interests got together,
right?

642
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,590
To put an initiative on the ballot.
They each ponied up like over $2,000,000

643
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,610
a piece.
Right?

644
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,790
We asked for our help in drafting it and
we said we help them draft it to get 

645
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,821
some good stuff in there,
but the one thing they did that nobody 

646
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:45,971
likes is they put into the initiative 
that only the 10 investors are 

647
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:50,511
technically the properties they own will
be allowed to produce marijuana 

648
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:52,830
wholesale in Ohio in perpetuity.
Right.

649
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,800
It's like you always say,
this is an agricultural product.

650
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,980
We're going to have a constitutionally 
mandated oligopoly.

651
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:02,550
We're only 10 properties can grow for 
the state forever and ever,

652
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,200
and so I'm profoundly toward because 
that oligopoly model in the constitution

653
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,900
sucks and we're talking about this 
yesterday.

654
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,340
Yeah,
it's bullshit.

655
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,250
It's bullshit and you should pass on it 
and just get weed illegally.

656
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:19,251
That's what I say,
fuck those people because what they're 

657
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:21,561
trying to do is they're trying to take 
something that's good and profit off of 

658
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:25,251
it in a way that only they can profit 
off of it and lock everybody out and 

659
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:26,610
they think they're being sneaky.
They can go fuck themselves.

660
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,560
Well,
I'm torn because on the other hand,

661
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,800
if this thing winds this year,
Ohio is a major swing state in American 

662
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,370
politics,
2016,

663
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,890
all the candidates are going to be vine 
and Ohio.

664
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,110
Meanwhile,
the thing will only be in theory because

665
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:45,111
it will not have been implemented and 
there's all sorts of people trying to 

666
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:47,541
block the oligopoly provision,
so what an Ohio when this oligopoly 

667
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,800
provision,
if it all works out well,

668
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,700
this thing winds opens up.
The national discussion forces.

669
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,420
The candidates talk about this issue,
puts it in Ohio in a major way.

670
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,300
Meanwhile,
everybody's so revolted by the oligopoly

671
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:05,301
model.
You already had the state legislature 

672
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:05,301
trying to knock it out with a 
competitive initiative.

673
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:06,870
The thing is going to land up in the 
courts anyway.

674
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,270
I don't see any of the other states 
adopting this model.

675
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:14,271
I mean,
none of the other initiatives on the 

676
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:14,271
ballot in 2016 had this oligopoly 
provision in it.

677
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:16,530
I think the sense of revulsion as kind 
of doing that sort of thing.

678
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,580
So my sense is if it all works out well,
initiative winds,

679
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,770
the oligopoly thing never gets 
implemented.

680
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,080
That's why you're here.
Anything we need to hear this.

681
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,290
This is beautiful.
We need to hear this kind of stuff now.

682
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,990
Do you face any pressure at all?
Um,

683
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,190
to not talk about the fact that you 
smoke weed yourself being the fact that 

684
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,091
you're a part of the drug policy 
alliance and you have to have put ties 

685
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:41,430
on and meet with some serious folks.

686
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,530
You know,
it's been an evolution Joe,

687
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,070
because I would say when I really got 
going in this in the late eighties,

688
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,240
I was very careful about that because 
that was the height of the drug war.

689
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,350
Right?
And,

690
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,500
and,
and I that my dissertation research,

691
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,280
I wrote my Phd at Harvard and it was on 
the internationalization of criminal law

692
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,590
enforcement,
which is three years earlier.

693
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,650
I had had a security clearance.
I'd worked in the State Department's 

694
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,411
Narcotics Bureau.
I'd wrote a classified report on drug 

695
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:09,411
trafficking,
money laundering.

696
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:12,570
I traveled all around South America and 
Europe interviewing dea guys and foreign

697
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:17,571
drug enforcement guys.
I'd written a dissertation and the book 

698
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:17,970
an international drug controls will cops
across borders,

699
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:23,150
so I just knew these guys and they and 
they had opened their doors to me and 

700
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,240
now three years later I'm out there 
saying we got to talk about legalization

701
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:26,860
and at that point when the drug war was 
like,

702
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,770
mccarthyism on steroids,
right?

703
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,870
It was just so.
I was very discreet.

704
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,940
I never would deny that I had smoked 
marijuana,

705
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:35,580
but I would never talk about being 
occurring consumer.

706
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,480
And then as things began to ease up into
the late nineties,

707
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:43,420
early two thousands,
I began to be a little looser with it,

708
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:48,421
but I still would say go to the cannabis
cups would invite me and I maybe showed 

709
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,630
up at the hemp fest in Seattle a couple 
of times,

710
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,600
but I'd still be careful now.
The Times are changing.

711
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,660
Right.
And it's a lot like the evolution with 

712
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,281
gay people in America,
right at the points at which different 

713
00:29:59,281 --> 00:29:59,281
people would feel comfortable coming out
and all this sort of stuff.

714
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,720
And so now I'm quite comfortable saying,
yeah,

715
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,010
you know,
I smoke weed.

716
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,380
I had been occasional consumers since I 
was 18.

717
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:07,990
It's been a net positive in my life,
you know,

718
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,930
and I actually even a few years ago on 
psychedelics it,

719
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,940
you know,
we do this big biennial conference on 

720
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,060
and a few years ago it was in la,
um,

721
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,650
and I,
and I said,

722
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,270
this was kind today,
did it.

723
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,230
I said,
you know,

724
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,760
I'm Jewish,
right?

725
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,750
And so once a year I fast on Yom Kippor,
25 hours,

726
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,620
no food,
no water.

727
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:29,860
I think it's good for the soul to fit to
a fast once a year.

728
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,890
I'd say that's the way I view doing 
psychedelics as well.

729
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,920
You know,
that people should keep doing 

730
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:37,920
psychedelics at least once a year,
well into their elder,

731
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,390
elderly years because it's a good way to
stir up the emotional sediment in 

732
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,650
intellectual sediment and stay honest as
you grow older.

733
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,840
And so I think,
you know,

734
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,820
I felt coming out about that as well.
I think the times,

735
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:49,470
you know,
we're,

736
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,480
we're in a day and age in America right 
now where we can talk about this and 

737
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,841
need to talk about it more openly.
And what is your second dog of choice 

738
00:30:57,841 --> 00:30:58,300
that you like to do annually?
Well,

739
00:30:58,301 --> 00:30:59,980
mushrooms is sort of the standard.

740
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,610
I mean that's one just over Christmas 
vacation,

741
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,640
you know,
I just did a sort of mega dose and it 

742
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,611
was,
it was really clarifying how many grams 

743
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:10,611
is a mega dose,
you know,

744
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:10,940
from a quarter ounce,
you know,

745
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,430
six,
seven grams of dried.

746
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:13,540
My son's.
Yeah.

747
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:13,960
Yeah.
No,

748
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:16,030
you don't want to fucking hear.
You don't want to be around it.

749
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,210
Sasha,
Sasha Shogun used to call me a hard 

750
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,210
head,
you know,

751
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,210
it's like by which he meant,
you know,

752
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,290
I need it.
I need a big dose to Iowasca done a few 

753
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,050
times,
both in once in a Santa dime ceremony in

754
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,060
one sit.
A just a more laid back way.

755
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:30,280
And that was really amazing.
You know,

756
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,520
Lsd,
that one.

757
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:32,930
I mean,
I,

758
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,060
you know,
I've enjoyed it.

759
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,280
I've never done a megadose with that.
Uh,

760
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,890
you know,
I think it's a,

761
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,860
but it's not resonate with me the way 
mushrooms.

762
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,020
Have you ever do dmt?
No.

763
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:45,940
Well,
um,

764
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,630
well,
sort of,

765
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:49,930
you've done Iowasca.
You've had a milder version of it.

766
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,390
I mean,
there was one time somebody had made up,

767
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,780
a guy knows a good scientist had done a,
made up a,

768
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,740
a thing that was a combination of dmt 
and ketamine and Ah,

769
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,870
you know,
that was a,

770
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:03,010
that was.
No,

771
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,490
no,
no.

772
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:05,320
He was actually,
he was an interesting,

773
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:10,350
interesting guy and he did it and found 
that he had found that he was dealing 

774
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:16,261
with significant depression and he found
that this Combo actually lifted his 

775
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:21,061
baseline depression.
And now there's all this research about 

776
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:22,020
ketamine being fairly effective as an 
antidepressant.

777
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,480
We've actually had a friend on Neal 
Brennan who talked about it.

778
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:28,150
He's a good friend of mine who's a stand
up comedian.

779
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:30,580
He was a,
the cocreator of the Chappelle show.

780
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,910
Very funny guy and put his head like 
some troubles in his life and went 

781
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,980
through legal in Los Angeles,
went through legal ketamine treatments,

782
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,860
depression,

783
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,130
and he goes,
he wasn't exactly sure what that was 

784
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,130
going to be like.
So he sits down,

785
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,410
they do it intravenously,
right?

786
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:49,040
So he sits down in this doctor's office 
and they will walk him out and he goes,

787
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:54,041
dude,
I'm on a 45 minute journey through the 

788
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:54,041
university.
Goes in.

789
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:57,170
It's like the strongest fucking trip 
I've ever been on an I can't believe I'm

790
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,570
doing this in a doctor's office.
So I gotta ask you,

791
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:02,840
I was reading your bio before and I saw 
that you have an isolation tank.

792
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,560
Yeah,
use it.

793
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,330
Have you ever read John Lilly's?
Sure.

794
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,470
Scientists I've read that I read,
uh,

795
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,580
the deep self have read a couple of us.
I remember reading that book and fishes 

796
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:14,780
that itinerary science.
And for your listeners who don't know,

797
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:16,130
right?
John Lilly was the great,

798
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,380
you know,
Pioneer state teaching communications,

799
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,990
communications with whales and dolphins,
dolphins and all that.

800
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,160
And also the person who may have 
invented the isolate he did did.

801
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,620
And he goes through this period in his 
life where he starts injecting ketamine 

802
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,510
every hour on the hour.
It is isolation tank like 12 to 18 hours

803
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,910
a day,
almost kills himself in the end lives to

804
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,070
be like in his mid eighties.
Um,

805
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:40,280
and that's the way in which he ventured 
into trying to figure out what the world

806
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:45,281
is all about.
My friend Todd Mccormick did deep has 

807
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:49,421
his tank.
He owns his tank and he did ketamine in 

808
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:51,160
that tank with lily.
Is that tied to that?

809
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:54,220
Yeah.
Todd Todd did ketamine like,

810
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,140
like he was about to do the tank and 
lily asked some,

811
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,550
do you want ketamine or.
No,

812
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:00,980
and he's like,
when John Lilly asked you if you want to

813
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:03,470
do ketamine before you get into his 
tank,

814
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:06,320
you say yes.
So he whacks him with the ketamine.

815
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,560
He goes under and apparently he was like
screaming or something while he was in 

816
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,380
there because he's out of his fucking 
mind first of all,

817
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,010
because the tank by itself is a 
psychedelic experience and shut the door

818
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,820
as long.
I mean,

819
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:17,290
you're,
you're,

820
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,890
you're more aware and you can shut it 
off at any time.

821
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,890
It's more of a conscious decision to 
enter into the psychedelic state,

822
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,310
but when you add that to the academy and
apparently it's just this unbelievable 

823
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,200
journey through the mind and todd was 
just not prepared for it.

824
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:38,201
So Lily,
we had another tank next to his other 

825
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,920
tank,
gets in the second tank,

826
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:44,921
wax himself out and visits him,
goes and visits him in the fucking 

827
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:49,660
ketamine dimension while they're both in
a side by side parallel isolation tanks.

828
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:53,090
Like that's something to tell your 
grandchildren about.

829
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,340
Kid about won the world series.

830
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,340
So you've done Ella psychedelics in your
isolation tank.

831
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,570
I've only done mushrooms and edible weed
in the isolation tank.

832
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,750
The edible weed is my favorite.
The high doses of edible weed is one of 

833
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:12,431
the most underrated psychedelics today.
There's a lot of people that don't 

834
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:15,330
understand that if you get a really high
dose like a,

835
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,150
and it doesn't even have to be a big 
thing.

836
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,360
That's the thing.
What they're doing today with these 

837
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,330
concentrates and Hash oils,
they have these fucking gummy bears,

838
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,720
man,
gummy bears that are 250.

839
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,660
Some of them like what does achievement?
She was 500 milligrams.

840
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:34,220
They have 500 milligram thc Chiba Chews.
If you eat one of those and get into the

841
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:38,050
isolation tank,
you will go on a journey that I liken

842
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,890
to any DMT trip,
any mushroom trip,

843
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,010
but the vedic texts,
a lot of the Hindu scriptures,

844
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,170
they were all written by people who are 
eating hash.

845
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,790
Like a lot of the really crazy visuals 
and the Buddha and all that stuff.

846
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,060
You see that shit when you eat it.
Is there any jokes?

847
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I tell you for me,
I mostly associate the high dose edible 

848
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,130
with just being knocked on my butt and 
just like,

849
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:00,320
you know,
didn't go high enough.

850
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,390
Yeah.
Well that could be it because there had 

851
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:05,390
been some good experiences and not 
quite.

852
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,800
I know what you're talking about,
but I haven't gone to that level with 

853
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,321
it.
I've only gone a couple times by 

854
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:12,321
accident.
You know,

855
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:12,321
the,
the,

856
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:14,640
the real accidental ones in places where
I didn't know that I was going to do it.

857
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,170
I've had some terrible journeys on 
planes were like right before,

858
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,720
like I'm like,
I don't like flying.

859
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,730
It's annoying.
I got to do it too often so I'll take 

860
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:25,730
something like right when I pull up to 
the airport,

861
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,210
I don't want to have anything on me when
I'm going through security.

862
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Right.
So I'll eat like a cookie or something 

863
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:32,300
right before I go.
And then like as you know,

864
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,870
the bags are going through and then I go
to starbucks,

865
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:38,871
get a cup of coffee,
then I sit down at the gate and I'm 

866
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:38,871
like,
Oh fuck,

867
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:40,590
I might've taken too much and then give 
the ticket,

868
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,870
get on the plane.
And then once I sit down I'm like,

869
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,790
okay,
at least I know I'm going to be here for

870
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:49,620
the next six hours.
And then the universe dissolves.

871
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:54,621
And you could shot through some worm 
hole to the center of your mind and you 

872
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,250
reexamined your childhood and like,
fuck,

873
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,840
I don't mean I gotTa tell you I've done 
that.

874
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,900
Edibles and planes a few times,
one time to somebody,

875
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,910
like you said,
don't want to count a plane.

876
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,640
Had a little nibble before Chicago to 
Laguardia.

877
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,290
I landed all my God,
please somebody get me home here.

878
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,100
You know,
on the other hand,

879
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:12,900
at the time thing of finding yourself on
thinking,

880
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,380
God,
this stuff knocked me all the time.

881
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:19,381
Why don't I just do little edible 
instead of a sleeping pill because I 

882
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:19,381
don't like some of the sleep people 
effects.

883
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:21,690
It didn't work.
It was kind of fidgety and it was closed

884
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:26,691
and you know,
so I've stayed away from the edibles on 

885
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:27,200
the planes.
They're very tricky because you,

886
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,260
you really have to be in the right state
of mind and you really have to treat 

887
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,541
them with respect.
I think edibles have always been 

888
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,181
associated with silliness and I think 
that's the trick that they've played on 

889
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:38,181
us.

890
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:40,650
Like have a little pot,
Brownie man will be,

891
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,200
we'll get crazy.
I know it's not silly.

892
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,870
It's serious business and the fact that.
I mean,

893
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,450
it's funny because now with all the 
concerns about edibles that,

894
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,710
you know,
somebody asked me the other day,

895
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:52,130
what's the thing that most surprised me 
about the evolution,

896
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,670
this whole marijuana reform thing last 
five,

897
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,920
10 years and it's been the emergence of 
the edibles.

898
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,290
It.
If you had asked me five,

899
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,300
10 years ago,
I would not have anticipated that 

900
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,610
edibles and drinks and all those.
We playing such a major role in legal 

901
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:04,610
marijuana.
Oh yeah.

902
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,021
Well they're paper pens to vape pens,
but at least those are the vape pens I 

903
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:13,161
might've seen because of the antismoking
stuff coming in and the e-cigarettes 

904
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:14,590
coming along,
but the edible stuff and the gummy bears

905
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:16,110
and the chocolates and all this sort of 
stuff,

906
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,970
breath strips.
If you had one of those now don't very a

907
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:22,350
full one.
Is that right?

908
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,460
Yeah.
You got to break them up.

909
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,260
Yeah.
You gotta break them up drunk.

910
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,480
Me and Tommy.
Shakira was a good friend.

911
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:28,410
Mine stand up.
Comedian.

912
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,840
We tore one in half and ate it on a 
plane.

913
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,710
We're doing some gigs in Florida,
popped it on the way to a.

914
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,710
It was a nighttime flight,
a Redeye,

915
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,950
and we landed and we both turned and 
looked at each other and go.

916
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,320
We were like,
how terrifying was that?

917
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,460
Fucking terrifying.
What was in that like?

918
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,260
I.
Well,

919
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:45,890
I got to tell you much stealing from 
this.

920
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,620
From a policy perspective.
I mean,

921
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:52,621
we're doing everything we can to have 
some responsible regulation in this 

922
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:52,621
area.
You need better testing.

923
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,040
You need to know that if you're buying a
cookie,

924
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,900
that stuff's going to be evenly 
distributed.

925
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:01,090
Find a chocolate bar,
distributed people got to figure out 

926
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,090
their dose.
You know,

927
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,920
I found for me,
like right now I know about seven 

928
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:04,920
milligrams.
It's just kind of a nice cat.

929
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,960
Seven relatively low dose.
That's really hard to find.

930
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,510
Usually the lowest 20 though.
Well,

931
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,180
what I'll do is I'll get a candy bar 
that's broke it up into bits of 10.

932
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:15,520
It'll split it a little more than half 
or something like that.

933
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,980
So that's like a calm,
mellow,

934
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,200
calm,
nice to kick back,

935
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:21,730
relax.
Maybe go for a swim,

936
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:23,800
go for a massage,
maybe go to movie.

937
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,440
I mean it's that level,
right?

938
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,720
And the higher level can be good too,
but it's got the risk of knocking me on 

939
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,320
my ass to higher level to me is like 
this,

940
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,410
it's a potential like a,
like a treasure hunt.

941
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,791
Maybe treasure hunt for ideas or an 
exploration of maybe there's something I

942
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,090
missed,
you know,

943
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:48,091
maybe like because I'm always trying to 
like dig down into my psyche and find 

944
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:52,051
out what I don't like about me or what I
need to improve or what I need to work 

945
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:52,550
on more what,
what,

946
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,600
what aspect of my career,
my life I need to be putting more 

947
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,930
attention to.
And usually the pot sort of lets me know

948
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:01,030
about that in the pot,
in the tank.

949
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,060
That's my big exploratory journey.
They eat a cookie getting the tank and 

950
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,300
then get out and go.
I gotta go to work.

951
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,780
It's interesting for me.
Pot sometimes does that,

952
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,240
but it's unpredictable when it's going 
to work that way,

953
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,100
you know?
And then I grabbed the opportunity.

954
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:20,101
I may be sitting at a concert and had an
edible or smoke and all sudden like my 

955
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:21,390
brides fly and stuff down,
you know,

956
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,570
listen to music.
But,

957
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,460
but for me,
the thing about the mushrooms,

958
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:27,910
which I don't like to do it is when you 
get older it takes more of a toll.

959
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:29,100
You don't recruit,
you know,

960
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,860
like I do mushrooms and the next day 
it's like I'm,

961
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:33,250
I'm burnt out.
Really?

962
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,030
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

963
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,590
Now that wasn't true when I was in my 
twenties,

964
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,490
early thirties about my fifties.
Now you know,

965
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:40,480
did you ever try five htp and when you 
come back from it,

966
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,580
I was just talking about that this 
morning.

967
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:47,850
I don't think I have tried that.
That's a big one because for mushrooms 

968
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,000
are in DMA.
Well for either one but much more so for

969
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:51,610
Mtma then for mushrooms because that's a
direct effect.

970
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:55,000
That's exactly what it's doing.
But mushrooms as a toll on it as well.

971
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:00,270
And a lot of people that have done the 
heavy mushroom trips have found success 

972
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:00,320
in taking um,
l,

973
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:05,370
Tryptophan and five htp afterwards.
L trip to fan actually converts to five 

974
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,740
htp and five htp convert to Serotonin 
can get those over the counter.

975
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

976
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,170
We actually sell.
So I'll get you some.

977
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:12,670
Do we have any new mood here?
Do we have in that?

978
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,710
So we have some.
We get you some.

979
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,630
Yeah,
yeah.

980
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,310
This is it right here.
Yeah.

981
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:18,780
Oh No,
no,

982
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,080
this is.
Thank you.

983
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:24,780
Yeah.
That's a combination of five htp trip to

984
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:29,790
fan and all that stuff does is it gives 
your brain the building blocks to 

985
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,390
produce human neurotransmitters.
That's what it does.

986
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:34,070
It keeps you being the building blocks 
and that stuff to

987
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,600
produce serotonin.
I have to say,

988
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:36,830
well,
what am I great regrets?

989
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,320
Is that the,
you know,

990
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,000
first did it I guess in the early 
nineties when I was in my early thirties

991
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,160
and,
and I loved it,

992
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:51,190
you know,
and did it both for going to occasional 

993
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,190
rave or be with my wife at the time or 
friends.

994
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,830
But I have to say now it just doesn't 
seem to work for me as well anymore.

995
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:57,200
That's a downside.
Begins to exceed the upside.

996
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:02,290
And it's a bummer.
I've only done it once and the downside 

997
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,560
was so strong.
The upside was amazing.

998
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,000
It was an I,
Amanda done too much.

999
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,010
I took two tabs and um,
uh,

1000
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,490
the,
the,

1001
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:11,900
the experience was beautiful and it 
taught me so much about insecurity,

1002
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,080
so much about like the way I behave in 
the way people behave and interact with 

1003
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,080
each other.

1004
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,200
How much of it just based on insecurity,
you know,

1005
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,870
it was weird like,
ah,

1006
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,030
this sounds gay as fuck,
but this is exactly what happened.

1007
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,040
Me and this dude,
we're on a couch.

1008
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:30,041
We were holding hands and we're talking 
about how good it feels to just hold 

1009
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,310
hands.
And we weren't scared to like,

1010
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:34,790
hold hands was another dude.
It was totally nonsexual.

1011
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,820
It's so funny because I remember one 
time we have a close friend and some of 

1012
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,110
these friends are like leading academics
and drug policy,

1013
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:47,111
drug studies.
I mean major figures and we'd become 

1014
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:47,720
good friends and we would occasionally 
get together and do you know,

1015
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:52,721
do it Mtma thing like once a year.
And I just remember one of my friends 

1016
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:56,940
who's distinguished professor him,
just four of us were sitting on the 

1017
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,041
couch and he just laid down on top of 
our days and we all just put our heads 

1018
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:00,041
out of.

1019
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,610
And it was so loving,
so wonderful.

1020
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,100
So I know you're talking about 
nonsexual.

1021
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:09,101
It's a weird thing.
The MTMA apparently they say I've never 

1022
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:09,330
tried.
Not only did it once,

1023
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,650
but people say that it's really hard to 
have sex when you're on it.

1024
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,040
Right.
Well,

1025
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,890
the thing is with the goal,
it's not the sex drug.

1026
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,910
It's a hug.
Yeah.

1027
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,550
Right.
I mean that's the thing and it's,

1028
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:20,330
it's something you can't get aroused on 
it,

1029
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,020
but it's,
you know,

1030
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:22,700
at some point the I,
that's been my experience.

1031
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,170
You can get aroused.
They're all that sort of stuff.

1032
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:27,260
But at some point the energy is shifting
towards more hug energy,

1033
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,540
loving energy,
you know.

1034
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,200
Whereas for example,
psychedelics and sometimes and go into a

1035
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:37,201
highly sexual direct.
Well that was the argument that Mckenna 

1036
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:38,240
had for mushrooms being the catalyst for
human evolution.

1037
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,590
Do you ever,
you know,

1038
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:40,220
about all that?

1039
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,590
Do you know Mckenna's?
Yeah,

1040
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,830
yeah,
yeah.

1041
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,920
I mean I kinda liked the theory,
the notion of hunter gatherers and 

1042
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,250
hunter gatherers who consumed silicide 
mushrooms or whatever.

1043
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,460
We're the ones who are going to be 
better at whether it was warfare thing 

1044
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,670
or a whole range of other things,
so it's intriguing and terrence was a 

1045
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,661
remarkable speaker who's the best 
speaker who was so fascinating 

1046
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:02,660
technique.
I only met him a few times,

1047
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:07,661
but one of the last times he called me 
up because I think you were supposed to 

1048
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:11,240
speak at Ucla or USC and at the last 
moment they were gonna prohibit him from

1049
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:14,570
speaking or whoever was loaning them the
hall or something like that,

1050
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:19,780
and so he just called me up and I called
the local Acu and I got on it and we 

1051
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:19,780
solved the problem.
Wow,

1052
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,930
that's great.
That's beautiful.

1053
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:23,000
As you lead to one of the speeches.

1054
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,840
I think so,
yeah.

1055
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,250
And his brother,
Dennis Mckenna,

1056
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,400
he and I were both at the first World 
Iowasca Congress need Biesa last 

1057
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,430
October,
and that was something.

1058
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,500
I mean,
here you have it.

1059
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,220
It was either it was an ebc because he 
beats his right.

1060
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,950
The party island and Iowasca is not a 
party drug.

1061
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:42,951
It's a serious thing,
but there were about a thousand people 

1062
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:46,010
in this conference will not be,
so you had leading academic scientists 

1063
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,030
like Dennis Mckenna,
you had shamans both new age Sharmans in

1064
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,370
traditional shamans from La,
from Latin America.

1065
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,740
You had people who were.
There was a guy,

1066
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,950
Polish guy who would do an occasional 
iowasca ceremony where he would invite 

1067
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,330
musicians who would then make music 
together and the influence of Ayahuasca,

1068
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,630
and then I was invited because the 
organizers wanted to know how does 

1069
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,480
Iowasca connect to broader drug policy 
reform,

1070
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,300
so that was quite a gathering.
Dennis is amazing.

1071
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,360
I love that guy.
I've had him on a few times now and had 

1072
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,210
some beautiful conversations with them.
It's just I'm always like,

1073
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:17,220
I can't believe I'm sitting here talking
to Dennis Mckenna.

1074
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,170
He's.
He's psychedelic royalty.

1075
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:19,860
Yeah,
yeah.

1076
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:21,420
No,
now he really is.

1077
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:22,260
And the stuff.
You know,

1078
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:27,261
it's funny.
I've never gone on one of those Iowasca 

1079
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:27,261
tours down in south.
Have you done that?

1080
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:29,370
Nina did.
Occasionally.

1081
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,920
What?
I hate bugs apparently Dennis does too,

1082
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:33,570
so he does them in a different part of 
Peru.

1083
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,180
It's not.
It's a dry climate.

1084
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,520
It's not a moist jungle climate.
He's like,

1085
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:40,290
you don't have to go to the jungle.
And I'm like,

1086
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:45,291
yeah,
well I go to the jungles fucking 

1087
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:45,291
mosquitoes man,
get eaten alive.

1088
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:46,890
But for some people it's like part of 
the beauty of the journey,

1089
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:50,390
it's like the suffering of dealing with 
the bugs and the like.

1090
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,610
My friend amber got bit on the leg by a 
spider and our whole fucking leg turned 

1091
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,670
black.
Like a black and blue brothers.

1092
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:01,671
Giant Qj yes.
So people do these things out in the 

1093
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:01,671
forest and they,
you know,

1094
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:02,400
they start walking off in the middle of 
ceremony.

1095
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,260
Nobody ever finds them again,
but Jaguars.

1096
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:06,930
Yeah.
No,

1097
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,140
I was perfectly happy to do my first 
IOWASCA experience in Santa Barbara,

1098
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,550
California.
That's perfect.

1099
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,330
Yeah.
No bugs,

1100
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,760
no bugs.
Just rich people.

1101
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,670
Yeah.
Yeah,

1102
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:16,900
exactly.
Exactly.

1103
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,350
The only thing that hard is the plastic 
surgery around you.

1104
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,560
That's true.
But I'll tell you the Iowaska think too.

1105
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,740
It reminds me when you read about the 
the emergence of LSD and Mescaline in 

1106
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,300
the fifties and the guys who went around
dosing people,

1107
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,170
cary grant,
famous actors,

1108
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:34,410
politician cary grant used to dos para.
Not He didn't those people,

1109
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:36,030
but he became an enthusiast.

1110
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,040
Who's that famous,
who's.

1111
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,830
She was a famous female swimmer who then
was in movies.

1112
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,890
I forget her name,
but you know you had famous people doing

1113
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:48,891
it,
life magazine writing about it and I 

1114
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:49,260
think Iowasca is almost a bigger version
of that right now.

1115
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,170
You're having IOWASCA ceremony is 
happening all around the world,

1116
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,810
not just the US or North America and 
South America,

1117
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,220
but in Europe,
Asia.

1118
00:46:56,221 --> 00:47:01,221
I mean it's extraordinary and so many 
people describing profound and 

1119
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:03,720
transformative experiences and it's not 
totally without risk,

1120
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,680
but the benefit risk ratio is so 
enormous.

1121
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,170
What is the risk though?
Well,

1122
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,700
I no physical risk.
The risk,

1123
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:16,080
the risk is only psychological and if 
you are psychologically unstable person,

1124
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,990
you really shouldn't be doing anything 
to perturb your consciousness.

1125
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:22,410
If you have issues with psychosis or 
bipolar or you know,

1126
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:27,411
there's a lot of people that have.
The other thing with powerful 

1127
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,590
psychedelics is if you have a 
cardiovascular risk because you're,

1128
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,300
you're,
you're so stimulated,

1129
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,460
so stimulated and then the thing is 
because Iowasca,

1130
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:38,461
you know,
every shaman makes the batch of 

1131
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:38,461
different ways so you're not exactly 
sure what's in that stuff.

1132
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:43,410
And then there's thing about making sure
the person's safe while they're under 

1133
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:43,410
the influence,
you know,

1134
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,491
it's like the horrible story.
What happened with that guy in Colorado 

1135
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:47,491
with the edible,
right?

1136
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:50,881
Who had never done it before and he 
jumps off the balcony or the horrible 

1137
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:51,340
stories about people doing lsd and 
thinking they can fly.

1138
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:52,270
So,
you know,

1139
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,880
Bill Hooks joke on that.
Yeah,

1140
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,010
Bill Hooks.
What a tragedy.

1141
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,790
Someone jumped out,
he goes,

1142
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,620
what an idiot because we thought it 
could fly.

1143
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:01,360
What did he take off from the ground 
first?

1144
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,600
This whole bit about it,
about a young man on acid is a,

1145
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:10,601
a bit about a positive drug story.
And his thing was like all the media 

1146
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:14,971
ever tells you about is these negative 
drug stories by the guy jumped off the 

1147
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:14,971
roof.

1148
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:15,680
Well,
I mean it's part of it.

1149
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:21,090
As marijuana is becoming more legalized 
in our society and hopefully around the 

1150
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,970
world and as we move forward in the 
psychedelics to begin to open them up as

1151
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:29,971
well and maybe not too old to new 
psychoactive substances and some of the 

1152
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:31,210
synthetics which may have some upsides 
to them,

1153
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,420
but the key is going to be putting out a
door and out there about what it means 

1154
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:36,480
to use safe.
I mean,

1155
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,110
for example,
get doing mushrooms,

1156
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:40,780
real estate and going to a concert with 
50,000

1157
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:45,400
people around or 10 times people around.
Generally not a good idea unless they're

1158
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:48,370
also on LSD and you know them all.
That's true.

1159
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,780
That's true.
That might work.

1160
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:51,140
Okay.
But maybe.

1161
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,470
But that's a scary thing.
It's like people think,

1162
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:55,840
oh,
let's go do this as a party drug and all

1163
00:48:55,841 --> 00:49:00,841
of a sudden all sorts of information 
overload and losing perspective and all 

1164
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:04,921
this sort of stuff and people that are 
always going on or do you see going to 

1165
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:04,921
burning man?

1166
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:08,550
Right.
And I remember meeting a guy who'd done 

1167
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:08,590
some weird drug and and he had just 
totally flipped out.

1168
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:10,990
He thought an animal is trying to eat 
him alive,

1169
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:12,370
right?
While he was flipping out,

1170
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,480
and fortunately,
you know,

1171
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:15,820
Rick Doblin,
the guys had maps and set up these kinds

1172
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:16,180
of,
you know,

1173
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:21,210
safety zones and so they were able to 
get this guy away from the cops because 

1174
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,351
the cops are going to shackle him,
put them on a helicopter and take them 

1175
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:28,021
to a jail which could have been horrible
and instead they gave them to rick and 

1176
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:29,620
rick is able to talk this guy down and 
you know,

1177
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:31,750
do it.
But we have to be weird that when,

1178
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:36,780
when people are taking these powerful 
mind altering substances which can have 

1179
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,420
these wonderful things as you and I have
experience,

1180
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,290
we got to be aware that there are people
who are not as stable as they think they

1181
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:41,710
are.

1182
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,890
People who have deep seeded shit going 
on and they don't know what's buried 

1183
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,610
that's going to come flying out people 
or don't understand that yet.

1184
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,580
If you're going to jump jump from the 
first floor,

1185
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:55,610
not the fifth floor.
So we got to make sure because the jump 

1186
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:55,770
from the first floor,
the ground floor,

1187
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:56,800
the ground,
exactly,

1188
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:59,490
you know,
but that it's going to be so key because

1189
00:49:59,590 --> 00:49:59,950
I mean,
look,

1190
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,960
just to shift away from the silos for a 
second,

1191
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:07,230
one of the issues we're working on big 
time is trying to reduce the number of 

1192
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:10,060
people dying from overdoses involving 
either heroin or pharmaceutical opiates.

1193
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:15,230
So last couple of years,
more people have died of an accidental 

1194
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,980
overdose involving heroin or other 
pharmaceuticals than in a car accident.

1195
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,430
It's the number one cause of accidental 
death in America today.

1196
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,710
I mean,
it's absolutely crazy stuff.

1197
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,670
Right?
And in fact,

1198
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:26,770
when we say overdoses suggests you took 
too much.

1199
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,810
Most of what our overdoses or drug 
combinations,

1200
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:32,240
they're typically doing this opiate,
your pharmaceutical,

1201
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,380
opiate,
oxycodone,

1202
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:38,470
whatever it might be.
It might even be prescribed to you with 

1203
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,470
booze or with Benzos,
valium type drugs.

1204
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,060
Right?
So what we're trying to do is to put out

1205
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:43,700
there the notion that don't care if you 
do it.

1206
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:45,980
Opiates,
don't combine it with booze.

1207
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:51,010
Don't combine it with tranquilizers.
There's a miracle drug called Naloxone 

1208
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,130
and we're trying to make that stuff as 
widely available,

1209
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,200
reverses the,
it's like an antidote for an overdose.

1210
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:59,350
Make it available.
We're passing nine slash 11 good 

1211
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,721
Samaritan laws.
So if people are around and a buddy 

1212
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:01,721
there's overdoses,
they don't just flip out,

1213
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:03,770
they call nine slash 11 right away,
the way with a heart attack.

1214
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,490
So,
you know,

1215
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:06,440
it's true with the psychedelics and 
marijuana,

1216
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,890
but even with the drugs that we see as 
less elevated in a way,

1217
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,000
but that huge numbers of people are 
using life,

1218
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,020
the opiates,
it's really important that we become 

1219
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,321
more and more of a society that 
understands the notion that we need to 

1220
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:21,920
make it safer to use these drugs.
Right?

1221
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:24,400
We got to keep people from getting hurt 
the way that

1222
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,740
people get hurt.
But we had a guy on here yesterday,

1223
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:28,740
um,
uh,

1224
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,270
his two guys,
Chris and Mark Bell,

1225
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,060
uh,
who,

1226
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:34,910
uh,
they were a part of a documentary called

1227
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:35,600
bigger,
stronger,

1228
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:37,610
faster,
which was about steroids.

1229
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,250
And now they have a new one called 
prescription thugs.

1230
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:41,440
And it's all about,
uh,

1231
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,520
the,
the opiate pill industry and how many 

1232
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,030
people die from it and how many people 
are addicted to it and the numbers.

1233
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,720
I wasn't prepared for the numbers when 
we had the.

1234
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:53,150
And we started exploring the numbers.
They were talking about this from 2010.

1235
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,480
There was eight point 7 million people 
abusing these pills on,

1236
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,190
on a daily basis in this country.
I mean,

1237
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:02,230
that's a staggering.

1238
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:02,670
Well,
I mean,

1239
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,950
nobody really knows the number,
right,

1240
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:07,500
because what it means to abuse it and 
whether it is abuse,

1241
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,610
but it,
you know,

1242
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:13,650
20 years ago you had a massive problem 
of the undertreatment of pain,

1243
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,860
right?
That people were so flipped out about 

1244
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:18,860
using opioids,
had people who were terminally ill,

1245
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,500
children who are terrible burn victims,
people going through a traumatic,

1246
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:25,800
you know,
post operative recovery from surgery and

1247
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:28,170
stuff like that.
We're not having their pain treated.

1248
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:33,290
And the failure to treat pain 
appropriately can shorten people's 

1249
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:33,290
lives,
lead to major depression,

1250
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,920
lead to other drug taking and all that 
sort of stuff.

1251
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,560
So over the nineties,
early two thousands,

1252
00:52:37,561 --> 00:52:42,561
we began to solve that problem.
So now it's opiates are used much more 

1253
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:43,830
correctly,
but then what happened is that we,

1254
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:48,060
we really have in America is an epidemic
of chronic pain,

1255
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,880
right?
Lower back pain,

1256
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,100
Sciatica,
chronic fatigue,

1257
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,590
fibromyalgia,
carpal tunnel,

1258
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,720
I mean the tens of millions of Americans
may be close to 50 or 100 million 

1259
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,761
Americans go through some chronic pain 
episode during the course of every year 

1260
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:04,950
or two,
whatever it might be.

1261
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,300
And it turns out that for many people 
going through dealing with chronic pain,

1262
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,740
opioids don't work that well,
right?

1263
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,780
They just don't work.
They're appropriate for sort of severe 

1264
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,930
pain and they're appropriate for some 
chronic pain patients.

1265
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,630
So what happens is people start taking 
this stuff,

1266
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:26,810
they have chronic pain and they're 
taking opioids and the doctor's given 

1267
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:27,150
the opioids and then they're building up
tolerance.

1268
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:29,580
So they're taking higher doses which is 
building the risk,

1269
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,530
right?
And then maybe they're combining it with

1270
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:33,840
like a value type drug to reduce their 
anxiety,

1271
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:36,570
or maybe they're taking alcohol because 
that makes him feel better.

1272
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,940
And then what happens is at some point 
your heart,

1273
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,710
your breathing stops,
right?

1274
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:45,330
And so what we need to do with that,
that overprescription of these opioids,

1275
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,350
it's not just by physicians who are 
criminals and are doing these things for

1276
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:54,351
money.
It's not just black mount market 

1277
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:54,351
marketeering.
It is stuff.

1278
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:57,860
It's also a lot of people just trying to
help doc good meaning doctors trying to 

1279
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,301
help people who are suffering with pain,
by giving them the opioids they think 

1280
00:54:02,301 --> 00:54:03,060
they want and need.
When it turns out,

1281
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,830
that's probably not the best way to deal
with it.

1282
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:10,320
Well,
there's an issue that people have with 

1283
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,940
pain that comes from work,
from sitting down all day.

1284
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
There's an issue that people have from 
not taking their body as important or as

1285
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,900
taking the health of their body as 
significantly as they should.

1286
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,480
I think that there's a lot of people 
that just don't.

1287
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,900
They don't know the consequences of 
sitting at a desk with bad posture all 

1288
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:35,941
the time.
Like these chairs that you're sitting 

1289
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,411
in.
These things are special ergonomic 

1290
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:38,470
chairs that make you kind of support 
your body weight up straight.

1291
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:42,070
They're called Pisco chairs or this 
company called Ergo Depo,

1292
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:47,370
but before I got.
These are sat in regular office chairs 

1293
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,400
at the end of every episode,
out of my fucking back,

1294
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:52,090
the middle of my back killing me,
and this eliminated them.

1295
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:57,810
Ergonomic chairs are very important.
Sometimes people like to sit on those 

1296
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:57,810
balance balls.
That's important,

1297
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:00,250
but what's also important is taking care
of your health and fitness,

1298
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,260
taking care of your body,
like yoga.

1299
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,710
If more people did yoga,
the you would have way less back pain,

1300
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,770
less joint pain,
way less stress,

1301
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:14,190
but they don't have the time or if they 
do have the time they choose to have do 

1302
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:14,410
that.
Time to go get drunk.

1303
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,040
What you like.
That

1304
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:20,170
me and I've had more people tell me to 
take a yoga than any other piece of 

1305
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:20,630
advice in my entire life and I just 
can't get into it.

1306
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,540
Have you tried it?
Tried it many times,

1307
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:24,320
you know,
and I just,

1308
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,760
I just know that you know,
I'm sitting.

1309
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,840
You know what I realized.
I'm in your beautiful Ergonomic chair 

1310
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:30,840
here,
Joe,

1311
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,280
but I'm slouching.
So now I'm going to sit up straight.

1312
00:55:31,281 --> 00:55:33,020
Let me readjust the mic here.
You know,

1313
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,700
and then I'll feel better.
I'll breathe better,

1314
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,380
you know,
it's like I gotta tell you something.

1315
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,010
What do you mean by you can't get into 
it?

1316
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:44,870
I just don't enjoy it.
You're not supposed to enjoy it the way 

1317
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,900
I will say an hour and a half of suck.
But you know,

1318
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,760
other parts of life suck quite all I do 
that,

1319
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:52,761
you know,
I wouldn't say the ideas that there's a 

1320
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:53,850
benefit for that suck.
What are the things I love about weed is

1321
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,560
I love to stretch.
When I do,

1322
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,410
we get into my body,
you know,

1323
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,860
and that's the thing.
It's just whether it's swimming,

1324
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,810
but the only time I like feeling that,
you know,

1325
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,080
stretching my I hate,
hates trish in my hands,

1326
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,410
but when I'm high,

1327
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:07,740
well,
you know,

1328
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,940
that's what Mckenna believe that yoga 
was in the first place.

1329
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,240
Yoga set.
Mckenna had this one lecture that was 

1330
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,061
talking about a yogis and that the real 
secret about sod dues is that their 

1331
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:24,010
highest fuck and what yoga really is is 
it's almost like

1332
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,040
a how to manual on how to properly use 
cannabis and that they believe that 

1333
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:34,080
eating cannabis especially or smoking 
hash and then going into the yoga poses 

1334
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,851
would they would achieve these higher 
states of consciousness and so they 

1335
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:41,791
would pass this down from generation to 
generation and the Indian in India 

1336
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:45,871
rather,
the Hindus have a long history of both 

1337
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:49,770
eating hash and smoking hash and he 
believed that that was the dirty secret 

1338
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,420
of Yoga.
The Yoga was really all about how to use

1339
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:55,600
cannabis correctly,
which is why it feels so good to stretch

1340
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:57,310
when you're high.
I'll tell you a few things about that.

1341
00:56:57,311 --> 00:57:02,311
What did I think it was the San 
Francisco Chronicle just last month or 

1342
00:57:02,311 --> 00:57:05,510
so had a piece about yoga where they 
basically asked people to smoke before 

1343
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,210
they go and do the yoga class.
The other thing is have you seen as will

1344
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:08,220
they say?
What was the result?

1345
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,190
I mean,
people.

1346
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,410
It's the same thing.
So many people are like me.

1347
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:13,240
They get more into their body.
Right?

1348
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:15,760
That marijuana helps in that respect.
You know,

1349
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:21,120
the other thing is,
have you seen this book that was just 

1350
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,120
reissue called Zigzags Ed?
No.

1351
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,770
You should have this guy on Alan Alan.
I'm a diner and zag zig zag zed and the 

1352
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:29,530
paint.
You know Alex Gray is the guy,

1353
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:34,540
the friend of mine.
Alex is the one who did the artwork for 

1354
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,210
it at Albert died or did the writing and
as I recall what the book is about is he

1355
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:42,211
was struck by all of these kind of Zen 
spiritual leaders in America for whom 

1356
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:49,110
their psychedelics experience in their 
younger years was pivotal to their 

1357
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:51,880
evolution and to their becoming a master
of some type of meditation,

1358
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,190
but who would not talk about it.
Right.

1359
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:54,900
And it's.
So.

1360
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,530
It's very interesting because you know,
there's also,

1361
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:59,140
you have in some of these spiritual 
world,

1362
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:04,141
whatever,
that they're looking down on the use of 

1363
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:05,200
marijuana or psychedelics that you 
should keep your body as a sacred vessel

1364
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:07,090
and keep it free from these substances.

1365
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:12,390
But in fact,
you see a lot of evidence that these 

1366
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,540
things go really well together.
Well the issue is legality and also most

1367
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:18,541
of these people have actual jobs and 
when you have an actual job and you 

1368
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:21,040
start talking about drugs,
people look at you like you're some sort

1369
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:26,041
of a fucking crazy person.
If you work as an insurance company and 

1370
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:26,041
you say,
well on the weekend,

1371
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:30,361
you know what I did this week and I 
smoked dmt with my friends and I 

1372
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:31,810
experienced God,
what the fuck is wrong with Ethan?

1373
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,370
I know it's crazy,
asshole.

1374
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:38,390
Like.
And then you get passed up for job 

1375
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:38,390
promotions.
I think you're a loose cannon.

1376
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,000
It can be detrimental to your interest 
or your family.

1377
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:45,150
Especially if you have children.
There's a lot of people that have 

1378
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,551
children that don't like to talk about 
drugs or even admit they smoke pot 

1379
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:47,551
anymore.

1380
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:48,550
I've experienced that resistance all 
over the place.

1381
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:50,180
Or what about the,
you know,

1382
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,360
if your kids are inviting their friends 
over and then you have to worry about 

1383
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,251
that.
Your kid's friends will tell their 

1384
00:58:59,251 --> 00:59:00,841
parents,
oh so and so's parents smoke weed or 

1385
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:03,811
whatever.
And then all of a sudden you have the 

1386
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:03,811
neighbors and the fellow parents,
you know,

1387
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:04,990
getting all worked up about that or tell
their kids they can't go over.

1388
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:08,290
Well listen,
I go through that mean that's me.

1389
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,160
You know,
look,

1390
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:13,360
I have pot tattooed on my body now.
I have a DMT molecule on my left arm.

1391
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,270
It's pretty well known that I'm in the 
drugs.

1392
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,770
I like them.
I think they're awesome,

1393
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:22,040
you know,
but I'm healthy as fuck and a also

1394
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:25,040
an independent operator as Ami.
But it's so true.

1395
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,220
I got to tell you,
in my emails I get from people who have 

1396
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:34,240
solid employees for 20 years and then a 
drug test popped out and they were 

1397
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,591
totally fine at work.
It's just because they got high in the 

1398
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:40,900
weekend and they lose their job after 20
years except that sort of stuff that's 

1399
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:40,900
going on.
I think by the way,

1400
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,330
John Oliver maybe doing something on 
this issue soon.

1401
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,850
So it's a nonsense issue.
The idea that you can get high on Friday

1402
00:59:46,851 --> 00:59:51,851
and lose your job on Monday.
How come you can get drunk all weekend 

1403
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:52,580
and show up on Monday and we all tell 
you something.

1404
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:54,950
But now here's what.
I'll give you a policy dilemma.

1405
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:00,220
So back in 2010,
the ballot initiative in California 

1406
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:00,620
legalized marijuana,
Richard Lee,

1407
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:02,480
the fellow who was driving that and we 
agreed,

1408
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:06,530
we put in a provision there that 
basically said people could not be fired

1409
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:11,270
for testing positive for marijuana so 
long as they were totally competent work

1410
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:16,271
not high at work and there's one to 
protect people who were having a joint 

1411
01:00:16,271 --> 01:00:16,440
in the evening or on the weekend,
right?

1412
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,370
The Chamber of Commerce flipped out.
Right?

1413
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,430
And the problem is,
is you don't want to provoke some very 

1414
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:24,430
powerful bears and all this sort of 
stuff.

1415
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:29,020
So now when we're drafting these 
initiatives around the country for 2016 

1416
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,381
and beyond,
what we find is we do not include a 

1417
01:00:32,381 --> 01:00:33,920
clause protecting people because we know
the one thing that might get the chamber

1418
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,090
of Commerce,
so will flip out,

1419
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,340
you know,
and to basically defeat the initiative.

1420
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:42,550
And then which had basically hope is 
that as marijuana becomes more 

1421
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:42,550
legalized,
you can read hesitant.

1422
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:45,350
And I think that's what's happening.
I haven't looked at it yet in Oregon and

1423
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:50,351
Washington,
but my guess is that the number of 

1424
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:51,200
employers who are drug testing for 
marijuana is decreasing.

1425
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,220
Right?
I mean,

1426
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:57,250
look,
it's always been a bad way to determine 

1427
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:57,250
performance,
right?

1428
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:57,250
Because we know marijuana stays in the 
system,

1429
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,460
you know,
the craziness of drug testing.

1430
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,640
If you want to get totally bombed at a 
Friday night and be okay at work Monday 

1431
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,421
morning in terms of drug testing,
don't smoke a joint for alcohol and 

1432
01:01:07,421 --> 01:01:07,760
cocaine is the right combination for 
you.

1433
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,220
That's a crazy message to same with drug
testing,

1434
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,680
right?
So because cocaine's out of your system.

1435
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,260
Exactly in the alcohol,
same thing.

1436
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,500
It's stupid,
it's really stupid.

1437
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:23,501
And these stereotypes are ridiculous.
These stereotypes and pot smokers are 

1438
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:23,501
dominant,
lazy,

1439
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:23,610
and you know,
they,

1440
01:01:23,611 --> 01:01:24,740
they,
they insult me,

1441
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,020
you know,
it really drives me nuts and I,

1442
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:29,360
I hate having defended because it's,
it's,

1443
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:34,361
you're defending just ignorance.
Stereotypes that were propagated by 

1444
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:38,441
reefer madness.
I mean that was really started it all 

1445
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:41,261
off.
And the effectiveness of the propaganda 

1446
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:41,261
that hearst publications put out in the 
19 thirties.

1447
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:46,420
It's a magazine,
how well that worked almost a hundred 

1448
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:46,420
years later.
You know what else it is,

1449
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,350
and I used to make this analogy more 
often than I do today,

1450
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:52,130
but I'd say you know something in 
America,

1451
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,270
50 years ago,
everybody knew a gay person.

1452
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,030
They just didn't know they knew a gay 
person,

1453
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,910
right,
and therefore their image of who was gay

1454
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:03,710
was determined by what they saw in the 
media.

1455
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:08,711
Somebody getting arrested in a men's 
room or somebody flamboyantly walking 

1456
01:02:08,711 --> 01:02:10,100
down Christopher Street in New York City
or people who are very,

1457
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,420
very feminine right now.
Of course everybody knows a gay person,

1458
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:19,421
right?
It could be their cousin or their 

1459
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:21,011
employer,
the it's all around the place and 

1460
01:02:21,011 --> 01:02:21,011
therefore our image,
who is the gay person,

1461
01:02:21,011 --> 01:02:21,260
right?
Has become.

1462
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:26,270
We don't have any associations,
is just the person who seems a feminine 

1463
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:27,390
or just a person doing odd stuff will.
Similarly with marijuana,

1464
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,540
everybody in America knows not just a 
marijuana user,

1465
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:33,870
but a responsible marijuana user.
The problem is they don't know.

1466
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:38,871
They know that therefore who's their 
image of the person who uses marijuana 

1467
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:42,861
user,
they think of that high school dropout 

1468
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:44,610
or the kid with hemp leads in as broad 
blond dreadlocks who's a troublemaker at

1469
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:45,060
school.

1470
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,880
They think of their friend's kid who got
in trouble with drugs.

1471
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:49,500
That's who they think.
Now mind you,

1472
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:54,710
the kid who just got straight a's in is 
going to an ivy league school or uc 

1473
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,400
Berkeley or Stanford or whatever and 
who's also smoking weed.

1474
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,490
That kids being more discreet and nobody
knows he's doing.

1475
01:02:59,491 --> 01:03:04,491
We'd except his friends so we have a 
biased image of who in fact the 

1476
01:03:04,491 --> 01:03:07,810
marijuana user has been in America now.
As it becomes more legalized,

1477
01:03:07,811 --> 01:03:09,810
as people become more open and out with 
it.

1478
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:12,390
I had been struck at all the people I've
known for many years.

1479
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:17,391
We're finally saying to me and admitting
to me that they've been using marijuana 

1480
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:17,460
or psychedelics regularly for a long 
time.

1481
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:21,450
Now we're seeing that thing begin to 
shift in our society the same way we saw

1482
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:22,800
it happening with gay people in this 
school.

1483
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:28,340
I think you're right and I think I've 
seen a giant shift just within the last 

1484
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,090
15 or so years,
you know?

1485
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:31,910
Um,
I started smoking pot when I was 30.

1486
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:36,970
I'm 48 now,
so I've been smoking pot for 18 years 

1487
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,570
and before I smoke pot I thought it was 
for losers.

1488
01:03:38,571 --> 01:03:40,010
I really did.
I got lucky.

1489
01:03:40,011 --> 01:03:45,011
I met my friend Eddie Bravo and he is a 
really creative musician and explained 

1490
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:50,381
to me that it helps them like write 
music and create music and he's an 

1491
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:52,100
interesting guy that I used to do 
Jujitsu with.

1492
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,040
That's also a weird thing about martial 
arts,

1493
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:58,400
a tremendous amount of UFC fighters 
smoke pot,

1494
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:03,430
I mean a massive amount where it's a 
huge issue for them with involving drug 

1495
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,430
tests,
you know,

1496
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:08,640
that they have to stop smoking weed for 
the last four weeks or so in order to 

1497
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,040
pass drug tests.
When I say I mean more than,

1498
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:14,480
more than don't more,
more UFC fighters smoke pot than don't.

1499
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:16,220
Same thing.
True of the NBA,

1500
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,730
the giant nfl

1501
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:20,750
I had,
I met a football player ever retire full

1502
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:25,751
player,
Marvin Washington at the end of last 

1503
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:28,380
year.
And he was spending about have all the 

1504
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,541
medical marijuana thing,
but he's really brilliant guy and he 

1505
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,980
cares about the broader policy issues.
We landed up drafting with him and three

1506
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:35,530
other pro bowl,
you know,

1507
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:39,490
pro bowl winners.
I'm basically a public letter calling on

1508
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:44,491
the NFL to change it's marijuana testing
policy to admit that marijuana has 

1509
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:49,081
medical value,
that it's safer for many players that 

1510
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:49,081
when it comes to dealing with concussion
injury,

1511
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:50,540
that marijuana may actually have a 
therapeutic.

1512
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:53,800
I mentioned to it,
not just made does without a doubt.

1513
01:04:53,801 --> 01:04:58,801
So the evidence there,
I was also encouraged to inflammatory 

1514
01:04:58,801 --> 01:04:58,801
properties of it.
Do you see the US,

1515
01:04:58,801 --> 01:05:01,510
the International Olympics Committee.
What they've done now is I think they've

1516
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:04,150
changed the level or when they test for 
marijuana,

1517
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:06,550
so they base their saying if you 
haven't,

1518
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,110
if you haven't used marijuana,
you know,

1519
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:12,400
within the 24 hours before a match,
you're not our concern anymore.

1520
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:17,580
So you see an evolution happening and at
different rates in different types of 

1521
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:17,620
professional sports,
you do.

1522
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,230
And it's,
it's,

1523
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:23,280
it's so important.
It really is because otherwise you're 

1524
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,040
basing your laws and your.
The way you punished me blind ignorance.

1525
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,850
It's just foolishness and the idea 
behind it is for what are you doing?

1526
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,530
Yeah.
I mean it came out.

1527
01:05:30,531 --> 01:05:32,620
I mean part of this was we came out of 
the drug war ideology,

1528
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:37,621
right?
Drug testing sleeps into American 

1529
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:37,621
society and the Ronald Reagan days in 
the mid eighties,

1530
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:39,160
drug work goes crazy and the late 
eighties,

1531
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:44,310
everybody's feeling you have to drug 
test most major corporations or drug 

1532
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:44,950
testing.
So we just got caught up in that.

1533
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,220
Being in a,
a professor at Princeton late eighties,

1534
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:52,210
early nineties and I saw the kids like 
they knew they were going to be applying

1535
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:57,211
for jobs.
We needed to be drug tested and it just 

1536
01:05:57,211 --> 01:05:57,670
began to shape the whole way they 
thought about this sort of stuff.

1537
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:02,730
Yeah.
It's just so unfortunate because it 

1538
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:02,730
doesn't make you a bad person.

1539
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:06,690
It doesn't make you a lazy person.
These are what's in what the thoughts 

1540
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:07,840
that are implied and testing people.
The idea is like,

1541
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:09,370
Hey,
I am your employer.

1542
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:14,550
I don't want you fucking up on the 
weekend and then coming into work on 

1543
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:14,620
Monday.
All scrambled,

1544
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,350
but there's no evidence of that at all.
Well,

1545
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:21,360
I would say this,
I mean I would always want to do is to 

1546
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:21,460
give the other side what I think might 
be true,

1547
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:24,250
where might conform with own experience.
For some people,

1548
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,900
marijuana,
smoking too much.

1549
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:29,590
Marijuana does make them lethargic.
Some people smoke it at work.

1550
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:35,320
If people look,
nobody wants kids wake and bake and 

1551
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:35,320
before they go to school,
right?

1552
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,120
Some people can smoke marijuana 24 slash
seven.

1553
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:39,280
It's sort of medical.
Does it harm the workability?

1554
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:40,540
Other people,
it's a problem.

1555
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,370
You know,
it can be a motivating.

1556
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:42,940
For some people.

1557
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:48,230
Look,
it's a drug and that means that some 

1558
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,230
people can use it in the wrong ways 
problematically.

1559
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:49,990
The problem is,
and this is where we fundamentally agree

1560
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:55,100
for the large majority of people who use
marijuana do so responsibly and are not 

1561
01:06:55,211 --> 01:07:00,211
having a problem with it,
and there's a huge number of people use 

1562
01:07:00,211 --> 01:07:03,121
marijuana in a way that actually 
enhances their life and there are many 

1563
01:07:03,121 --> 01:07:04,870
of them who find it preferable to using 
pharmaceutical medications or alcohol or

1564
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:07,120
things like that.
There are people I know,

1565
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:12,180
brilliant intellectuals and academics 
who've done some of their best work and 

1566
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:15,571
come up with some of their best ideas 
under the influence of marijuana or 

1567
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:18,091
psychedelics,
so marijuana can be a huge positive in 

1568
01:07:18,091 --> 01:07:19,090
many people's life.
It can be neither here nor there in some

1569
01:07:19,091 --> 01:07:21,090
people and for some people to negative 
there,

1570
01:07:21,091 --> 01:07:24,880
including Carl Sagan,
who was a huge proponent of marijuana.

1571
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,880
I think that the people that have issues
with marijuana have issues and that's 

1572
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,500
one of the things that's been sort of 
dusted under the rug.

1573
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:36,590
You're blaming it on marijuana.
These people that smoke pot and it ruins

1574
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:37,260
their life.
I mean,

1575
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,330
I had a joke about it where I was like,
it's just because pot got there first.

1576
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:42,130
It could have been anything that fucked 
your life up.

1577
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:47,131
It's usually some sort of an underlying 
traumatic issue that you're trying to 

1578
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:48,610
run away from or hide or cover up.
Yeah,

1579
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,650
I mean the problem of course is when 
people in power a whole.

1580
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,800
I mean I'll tell you on both ends of the
country,

1581
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,020
governor Cuomo,
Governor Brown,

1582
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,210
I don't know what their issue is.
Marijuana.

1583
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,840
Well,
their issue is that there there's,

1584
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:04,860
there's financial interests that are 
trying to lead them in the way of 

1585
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,390
illegal.
John.

1586
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,400
I don't think so.
I actually think that I've talked to 

1587
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:10,630
both of them about it and I can see and 
both of them are Willie.

1588
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:14,080
I think both of them had been decent 
governors and other areas of their life.

1589
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:19,350
I think some of the okay on sort of 
rolling back some elements of the drug 

1590
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:19,350
war.
They're kind of mixed in that regard,

1591
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,790
but cuomo just has this weird anti 
marijuana thing.

1592
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:25,680
I don't get.
And Brown talked to him a few months ago

1593
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:27,410
at this same thing and when you're 
saying,

1594
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,450
okay,
well let's be specific,

1595
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:34,451
like what?
It's not political for quote Como being 

1596
01:08:34,451 --> 01:08:37,481
such a jerk,
a New York's medical marijuana law and 

1597
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,260
trying to carve it down so only like 
five businesses can run this thing.

1598
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:43,460
I mean all the stuff he did the.
It's got a medical model supported by 80

1599
01:08:43,461 --> 01:08:44,840
percent of New Yorkers.
Right.

1600
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:47,780
There was no political reason for him to
do that sort of stuff,

1601
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:51,110
but somehow some weird anti marijuana 
things in there,

1602
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:56,170
but then hold on,
but that doesn't seem like an anti 

1603
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:56,170
marijuana thing at all.

1604
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:56,170
When you're talking about boiling down 
to five businesses,

1605
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:59,090
it sounds like a business look,
there may have been some of that theory,

1606
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:02,300
but in been.
Well that seems like the only motivation

1607
01:09:02,301 --> 01:09:07,301
there's.
It seems to be there's no rational 

1608
01:09:07,301 --> 01:09:08,990
motivation other than financial and in 
Iowa know because in the end there was a

1609
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,480
whole competitive process through that.
The five licenses,

1610
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,250
it's hard to.
So whether the governor friends,

1611
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:14,990
we haven't seen any evidence yet that it
was governor,

1612
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:18,370
his buddies who benefited.
I think there was something that he felt

1613
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:20,420
a need to be hyper controlling in this 
area.

1614
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,940
I think sometimes people go to that 
ignorance,

1615
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:27,830
he's got to know the financial massive 
profit margin,

1616
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:29,130
the massive,
uh,

1617
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:32,900
the possibility for profit of these 
people are going to experience that does

1618
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:38,080
not ignorant.
He's got to know that you're talking 

1619
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,361
about something in Colorado that just 
the tax revenue alone has been 100 

1620
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:40,361
million dollars.

1621
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:42,080
A good reason for him to have done the 
right thing.

1622
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,260
Right.
The question is why does a guy like 

1623
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:47,260
that?
I try to sabotage a good bill and put it

1624
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,670
in a bad bill in place once I,
you know,

1625
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,420
I don't know.
I only know some.

1626
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,130
Sometimes you think it could be 
something involving a friend of theirs,

1627
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,830
a kid of theirs,
their own personal experience.

1628
01:09:57,831 --> 01:09:59,840
I think it's something personal 
oftentimes.

1629
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,200
And with Jerry Brown,
I've,

1630
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,500
I've heard rumors with both governors if
they used to smoke.

1631
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:05,150
I've never heard I've other people say,
oh no,

1632
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:09,250
these guys at Brown in California didn't
used to smile more shocking that he did.

1633
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,250
Who knows?
But I mean,

1634
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:11,420
I gotTa tell you Jerry.
Hi.

1635
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:12,410
Right.
And I talked to Jerry.

1636
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,830
Jerry think marijuana is the downfall of
American civilization right?

1637
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:16,850
I mean,
but there's a part of that.

1638
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:22,410
He actually,
he's don't say that publicly and 

1639
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:22,410
privately and he actually seems to 
almost believe that at times,

1640
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:27,281
and I think the other part of his brain 
is smart enough to know that's 

1641
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:27,281
ridiculous,
but there's a lot of people who have had

1642
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:28,850
a negative encounter with marijuana.

1643
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:34,090
They've had a kid who started smoking 
weed and waking and baking and went and 

1644
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,270
got into bigger trouble with other drugs
and I think they just like,

1645
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,920
this is bad,
this is bad.

1646
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:42,190
Or there people have had experienced 
problems with alcohol and their family 

1647
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:42,980
and they think if alcohol was that bad,
weeds going to be even worse.

1648
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:46,190
I think there's still that irrational 
stuff driven.

1649
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:51,191
Oftentimes by knowing somebody or 
knowing of somebody with a associate 

1650
01:10:51,191 --> 01:10:52,850
marijuana with bad things have happened 
to that person.

1651
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,980
I think Jerry Brown,
Jerry Brown has got a bigger problem and

1652
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,440
that no one even knows he's the 
governor.

1653
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:03,040
The guy became the governor of 
California after Arnold Schwarzenegger 

1654
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,831
and no one paid any attention was 
literally no one even knows he's the 

1655
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:09,041
governor.
You never fucking hear governor Jerry 

1656
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:09,041
Brown,
like you said that,

1657
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,550
and I had to and I know and I,
you said that I go,

1658
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,690
oh yeah,
he's the governor.

1659
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,160
Oh yeah.
I forgot sometimes that's a good sign,

1660
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,500
but he used to be the governor a long 
time.

1661
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,270
Everybody knows Jersey and you know,
he ain't so

1662
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:25,530
there anymore,
but he was the governor and he was an 

1663
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:26,040
interesting candidate for president in 
the 19 eighties.

1664
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:27,380
Right.
It was the eighties or nineties

1665
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:31,490
to maybe what year was it?
Might've been [inaudible] 92.

1666
01:11:31,491 --> 01:11:32,330
The year that Clinton.

1667
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,320
Yeah,
it was a long ass time ago and you know,

1668
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:40,350
they would call them moonbeam governor 
Moonbeam and they were making fun of 

1669
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:44,111
him,
but he had some unique ideas when it 

1670
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:44,111
came to running for.

1671
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:45,710
I actually thought he was a really 
interesting candidate back then.

1672
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:48,650
I remember that.
I remember and I actually from New York,

1673
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:49,610
you know,
it's fine.

1674
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:54,740
When I bumped into a plane,
we're chatting and then we're making 

1675
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:54,740
Chitchat as the plane lands and he goes 
to,

1676
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,060
how's that?
How's that New York Governor Yours Doing

1677
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,920
Cuomo?
And I say he's Kinda like,

1678
01:11:57,921 --> 01:11:59,390
Yo,
he's a pretty good governor overall,

1679
01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:01,940
but he stinks on the things that matter 
when it comes to drug policy.

1680
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,820
No,
it actually not all those things.

1681
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,510
I said it to his face and we're ready to
get hit and now he left last.

1682
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:11,150
Let's say you didn't see smiled.
He smiled.

1683
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:12,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1684
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,740
No comment though.
I got to tell you,

1685
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,720
you want to see something ugly.
Go on Youtube and type in the words rude

1686
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:19,370
debate or type in the words.
Really rude debate.

1687
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:24,640
And what pops up is me and Jerry Brown 
pummeling one another and amy goodmans 

1688
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,750
democracy now show in 2008 when we had a
ballot initiative that would have been 

1689
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,250
the biggest prison reform ballot 
initiative in the history of America.

1690
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:36,610
And Jerry Brown was then the attorney 
general and he did everything he could 

1691
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:40,510
to kill it.
And so we just went at it one day about 

1692
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:40,510
what,
what,

1693
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:40,640
what?
What's his rationalization?

1694
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:42,770
I think at that point he wanted to run 
for governor.

1695
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,900
He wanted at the prison guards behind 
them,

1696
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:50,020
the prison guards union was making very 
clear that if they were going to be 

1697
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:50,020
sport,
he had a blocked this.

1698
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,190
They got every former governor and 
governor,

1699
01:12:51,191 --> 01:12:53,960
governor and gubernatorial candidates to
get up and stand up against this.

1700
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:59,140
I got to tell you,
if California passed that ballot 

1701
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,151
initiative prop five back in 2008,
it would've solved the big part of the 

1702
01:13:01,151 --> 01:13:02,480
prison problem in this state at that 
time.

1703
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:06,250
That seems like I hear stuff like that.
I feel like it's treasonous.

1704
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:11,610
I really do.
When I feel like a guy is doing for his 

1705
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,251
own benefit,
trying to block something that will be 

1706
01:13:14,251 --> 01:13:16,600
beneficial to people especially 
recognized and we have a huge issue with

1707
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:21,601
the prison industrial complex in this 
country and the idea that we had 

1708
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,260
privatized prisons in the first place.
The idea that someone's profiting off of

1709
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:28,261
putting people in jail and the idea that
they're actively lobbying to make sure 

1710
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:30,940
that there's more laws in place that are
going to incarcerate people so that they

1711
01:13:30,941 --> 01:13:35,941
can make more money.
The idea that that's illegal is that 

1712
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:35,941
that drives me a bit.

1713
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:40,580
I gotta tell you with the between the 
prison guards union on the one hand and 

1714
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,570
the private prison corporations,
on the other hand please those guys,

1715
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,410
I mean just thank God they hate one 
another.

1716
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:45,630
The prison guards union and the private 
prison corporations,

1717
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:48,060
because those guys have just been 
feeding in that regard.

1718
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,300
It's just money,
man.

1719
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:54,301
It's just money.
Whenever you get money involved in 

1720
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:54,370
anything when it you getting money 
involved in pharmaceutical industries,

1721
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:59,371
when you get money involved in this,
the marijuana thing with these five 

1722
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:00,760
different corporations that are going to
control all the pot money,

1723
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,280
fucking money.
My people trying to get

1724
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:04,950
it is,
but the basic idea,

1725
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:09,951
Joe,
were you saying before that that you 

1726
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:12,591
have a prison guards union that needs to
keep the prisons full in order to pad 

1727
01:14:12,591 --> 01:14:15,700
their overtime pay or that you have a 
prison?

1728
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:19,420
Corporations that are making money if 
more people get incarcerated and they'll

1729
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:24,430
end up becoming advocates for laws that 
lock up more people or advocates for 

1730
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,780
opposing the reform of laws that are 
popping up,

1731
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,840
popping up.
Too many people being a prison guards a 

1732
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:30,840
shitty job,
but those dudes need to do is grow.

1733
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,950
We'd have to do.
You might know something interesting.

1734
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:37,980
That's a great job.
Prison Guards Union did not oppose the 

1735
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:37,980
marijuana legalization initiative in 
2010.

1736
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,010
Really?
Yeah,

1737
01:14:39,011 --> 01:14:40,690
and I think the reason is,
is a,

1738
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:45,780
I think there's two reasons.
I think one is marijuana prohibition 

1739
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:45,780
says a lot of people,
local jails,

1740
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:50,581
but not that many of the state prison,
but the second reason is if you're a 

1741
01:14:50,581 --> 01:14:51,490
prison guard and you're living in the 
middle of God knows where,

1742
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:53,950
you know,
California surrounded by nothingness.

1743
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,080
What do you want to do when you get home
from work?

1744
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,270
You want to get high.
Exactly.

1745
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,590
You know,
in fact,

1746
01:14:59,591 --> 01:14:59,820
I,
I,

1747
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,570
my,
my guess is the prison guards union.

1748
01:15:01,571 --> 01:15:04,780
It's like anybody else right now,
they probably got members of their union

1749
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:09,930
who are medical marijuana patients and 
dealing with state laws that probably 

1750
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:09,930
prohibits.
They're using marijuana.

1751
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:14,140
Do you think that with the current 
climate that we have,

1752
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:19,160
um,
with social media and the ability to 

1753
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,980
distribute information,
and then when outrageous laws are trying

1754
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:23,920
to get past you can,
you can tweet them and facebook them and

1755
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:26,620
people find out about them in this 
online petitions.

1756
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,920
Do you think that this,
this is lending itself more to 

1757
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,061
transparency,
this transparency is beneficial to 

1758
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:38,070
getting these more rational laws passed 
or more,

1759
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,710
more rational ideas promoted?
It's a great question.

1760
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:43,900
I think it leans in our favor.

1761
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,960
It's not the cure all.
It means that the ability of young 

1762
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,260
people to express themselves to 
legislators,

1763
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:55,261
the fact that more and more legislators 
pay attention to facebook and twitter 

1764
01:15:55,261 --> 01:15:55,900
and things like that,
I think that's generally good for us.

1765
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:01,200
On the other hand,
what I also know is that we now see not 

1766
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,291
just on legalization of marijuana,
we see all this bipartisan consensus 

1767
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:07,891
that just too many people behind bars in
America that we need to reduce the 

1768
01:16:07,891 --> 01:16:11,431
prison population.
That there's this horrible racism 

1769
01:16:11,431 --> 01:16:14,191
permeate our criminal justice system 
that the incarceration of black people 

1770
01:16:14,191 --> 01:16:17,491
in this country is just an absolute 
humanitarian and social and racial 

1771
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,430
nightmare.
Right?

1772
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:23,550
So we see all of that happening.
We see bills being introduced to 

1773
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:26,611
reducing the prison population in the 
states and had congressional level and 

1774
01:16:26,611 --> 01:16:30,631
then a new drug scare pops up.
All of a sudden it's Flocka or best 

1775
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:34,060
salters synthetic cannabis or blah blah,
and then there's this knee jerk reaction

1776
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:34,500
like,
you know,

1777
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,640
criminalized first ask questions later.

1778
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,040
Right?
And that's the thing we're still dealing

1779
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:44,041
with that people will begin to come to 
their senses about more sensible 

1780
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,630
policies and then they get scared and 
when they get scared they do.

1781
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:49,450
Some things don't do dumb things and 
pass bad loss.

1782
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:54,780
That's interesting because things like 
bath salts only exists because what we 

1783
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,440
would call quote unquote legitimate 
drugs are illegal.

1784
01:16:56,441 --> 01:16:59,770
So you find a work around why is both 
Cynthia,

1785
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:01,360
what's the market for synthetic 
cannabis.

1786
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:06,390
Most of that has to do with the fact 
that people are worried about drug 

1787
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,160
testing for marijuana at all.
You're not going to get picked up.

1788
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:11,150
I normally would choose if you had a 
choice between regular pot or synthetic,

1789
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:13,340
whatever the fuck it is.
What is that stuff anyway,

1790
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:14,740
and what does it even coming from?
You know,

1791
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:19,750
it it,
it's either synthetic cannabinoids or 

1792
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,750
maybe it's also,
I think Catherine own,

1793
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:20,790
which is the ingredient that's in 
caught,

1794
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:23,600
you know the thing they choose issue in 
east Africa,

1795
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,070
east Africa and Yemen.

1796
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:30,090
That's like a amphetamine.
It's a stimulant and it's sort of like 

1797
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,070
used the way the Indians to coca and 
Bolivia and Peru,

1798
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:32,420
Colombia,
so it's a.

1799
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,850
When it's done in the chewing,
the leaf,

1800
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,940
it's fairly innocuous.
When you extract the chemical,

1801
01:17:37,941 --> 01:17:41,000
you can then make it into something much
more potent and much more problematic.

1802
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:46,370
See,
I was under the impression that even 

1803
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:46,790
chewing the leaves had more of a,
an amphetamine like effect.

1804
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:51,820
It is.
It's the same thing like chewing cocoa 

1805
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:51,820
leaf,
right?

1806
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,521
Chewing coca leaf releases.
It's slow drip of cocaine into the 

1807
01:17:54,521 --> 01:17:57,110
system,
but it's basically almost a healthy form

1808
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:59,090
of cocaine consumption.
Isn't that funny?

1809
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,700
Yeah.
It's hilarious that the leaves itself,

1810
01:18:01,701 --> 01:18:05,000
like chewing the leaves.
Like I have a friend who was recently in

1811
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:07,010
Peru and they,
they would all do it.

1812
01:18:07,011 --> 01:18:12,011
They give,
they give you like a bag of it and they 

1813
01:18:12,011 --> 01:18:12,011
were on these hikes and they would chew 
it.

1814
01:18:12,011 --> 01:18:12,011
And I liked,
what was it like?

1815
01:18:12,011 --> 01:18:12,110
He's like,
well,

1816
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:13,670
it's like coffee,
but better.

1817
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:14,660
Yeah,
exactly.

1818
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:17,980
And it's actually has like flavonoids in
it and you know,

1819
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:23,340
like a vegetable proteins or um,
what were the properties of vegetables 

1820
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:26,960
that are healthy,
like a vital nutrients like different,

1821
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:30,140
like it's actually good for you.
You're chewing green vegetables.

1822
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:35,200
When eight years ago the World Health 
Organization organize a global study of 

1823
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,671
coca and cocaine.
It experts from 19 countries and after 

1824
01:18:39,671 --> 01:18:41,210
this extensive survey,
what they found were two things.

1825
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,270
One was that the vast majority of people
who use cocaine,

1826
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:45,320
sniff cocaine,
whatever,

1827
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:47,870
did not have a problem with it.
We're not addicted to it.

1828
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:49,400
Even though there was obviously a 
minority,

1829
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:52,520
you had a big problem.
The second thing they found was that the

1830
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:57,521
chewing of coca leaf by the Indians 
probably headed net benefit from the 

1831
01:18:57,521 --> 01:18:59,180
health perspective for exactly the 
reasons you're talking about.

1832
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:01,470
The we're vitamins and the leaves that 
the,

1833
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:02,990
that the,
they were consuming.

1834
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,400
When you chew coca leaves during the 
day,

1835
01:19:04,401 --> 01:19:08,000
you're consuming essentially the 
equivalent of a few lines of cocaine,

1836
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:11,690
which over the course of a day is like 
having a few cups of coffee in a way.

1837
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,660
Right.
And what they found is the only downside

1838
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:17,240
was that to release the cocaine from the
coca leaf,

1839
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:19,670
you had added a little lie and the lie 
could hurt.

1840
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,980
I think something had achieved the 
enamel in the teeth,

1841
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:27,490
something like that.
There's an issue with people that chew 

1842
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:27,490
coca leaves all the time to have these 
rotten teeth.

1843
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:29,060
I,
yeah.

1844
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:31,310
That may be from the lime.
I don't know.

1845
01:19:31,311 --> 01:19:33,500
It may just be that they generally have 
bed height,

1846
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:35,180
you know,
teeth hygiene and those parts.

1847
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,570
It's just like people say about meth 
mouth and losing your teeth.

1848
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:42,410
It's not about methamphetamine per se,
it's that nothing sort of,

1849
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,230
you know,
reduces the moisture in your mouth.

1850
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:50,430
And so you have to take extra special 
care of your teeth if you're using 

1851
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:53,810
amphetamine with any regularity.
And most people know that people taking 

1852
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,010
amphetamine aren't taking extra special 
care of anything.

1853
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,210
Well,
the funny thing is this,

1854
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,280
if you look at the 10 to 20 million 
kids,

1855
01:19:58,281 --> 01:20:02,180
teenage boys in America taking Ritalin 
or these things so they can focus better

1856
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:07,181
in school.
Some of them being prescribed 

1857
01:20:07,181 --> 01:20:07,181
appropriately,
others not.

1858
01:20:07,181 --> 01:20:07,980
It's essentially the,
as the amphetamine or

1859
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,150
methamphetamine crazy and the 
methamphetamine that people are smoking,

1860
01:20:12,151 --> 01:20:17,151
getting in trouble with.
If you take that in an oral form like a 

1861
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:20,300
pill,
it's essentially indistinguishable from 

1862
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:20,300
the riddle and the kids are taking in 
schools,

1863
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,290
you know,
I was reading an article on the sugar 

1864
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:24,290
and the,
the um,

1865
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:27,120
the negative aspects of sugar,
processed sugar and how much of it is in

1866
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:29,640
our diets and how much of it is and 
things that you don't even consider.

1867
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:34,650
And that's really essentially the same 
thing when you talking about extracting 

1868
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,730
it from fruits because everybody agrees 
at eating fruits is healthy.

1869
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,390
And that's,
I mean,

1870
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:40,290
when you're eating bananas and you're 
eating apples and oranges,

1871
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:40,770
what,
why,

1872
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,900
why does it taste good?
Well,

1873
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,680
you know,
there's sugar in it,

1874
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,050
natural sugars,
but those natural sugars,

1875
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:47,820
when you get them in that form with the 
fiber,

1876
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:50,010
with the planet itself,
with the vegetable itself,

1877
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,060
is actually good for you.

1878
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,150
It's actually the same as the coca 
leaves,

1879
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:56,040
three most powerful drugs knowing that 
you have been kind sugar,

1880
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:56,520
fat,
salt,

1881
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,540
sugar,
fat,

1882
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:58,320
salt,
sugar,

1883
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:01,620
fat and salt,
and that the ability of the sort of food

1884
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:06,621
producing corporations and their science
and their ability to produce products 

1885
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:07,350
that kind of,
you know,

1886
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:12,380
hit that part of the brain in a be that 
sort of is beyond your capacity when 

1887
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,430
they look at the explosion of obesity 
and,

1888
01:21:13,431 --> 01:21:16,680
and people being overweight in America 
and many other parts of the world.

1889
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:21,681
Part of that is about the ability of 
food producing companies to produce 

1890
01:21:21,681 --> 01:21:22,530
products that hit that part of the 
brain.

1891
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,810
I remember Chris Rock,
he won't play,

1892
01:21:24,811 --> 01:21:29,811
do in a routine,
and he was talking about a Krispy Kreme 

1893
01:21:29,811 --> 01:21:32,961
donuts and it was found the secret 
ingredient of Krispy Kreme donuts 

1894
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,470
cocaine.
Right?

1895
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:36,240
But in point of fact,
if you think about it,

1896
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:41,420
I remember walking past the Krispy Kreme
donut outlet when they first opened up 

1897
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:43,020
and you could not walk past it without 
this part of your brain twitching,

1898
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:43,590
right?

1899
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,840
In the same way that somebody is 
addicted to drugs,

1900
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:50,990
get to twitch when all of a sudden you 
know they smell or see that drug in 

1901
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:52,260
place.
So the power of those substances,

1902
01:21:52,261 --> 01:21:54,630
there's psychoactive properties we're 
used to them.

1903
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:56,610
These are powerful drugs we know and 
love,

1904
01:21:56,850 --> 01:22:00,750
but in point of fact,
if you ask what's doing more harm to the

1905
01:22:00,751 --> 01:22:03,090
health of Americans today?
Sugar,

1906
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:08,150
refined sugar or cocaine or heroin,
could well be refined sugar.

1907
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,900
Well,
there's an article,

1908
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:14,950
like I said,
that I was reading that was they were 

1909
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:16,170
making the argument that it's a toxin.
There were saying essentially says sugar

1910
01:22:16,171 --> 01:22:18,570
is a very common toxin that people 
consume.

1911
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:23,720
But as you say,
when it's consumed in natural forms or 

1912
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:23,720
for that matter,
consumed in moderation,

1913
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,610
no big deal.
But when you're taking large amounts,

1914
01:22:25,611 --> 01:22:29,450
when we see all the drinks,
yeah,

1915
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:32,610
I mean just what you get in a glass of 
Coca Cola.

1916
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,030
That's way more sugar than you're 
supposed to have in your day and it's in

1917
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,010
a coke,
coke and how many people have three,

1918
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:43,011
four cokes throughout the day and you 
see these people with their guts and 

1919
01:22:43,011 --> 01:22:45,540
they have all these issues with their 
body and your face is fucking fat.

1920
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,720
Like what is that that?
Well,

1921
01:22:46,721 --> 01:22:48,510
that's.
You're taking in too much sugar,

1922
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:53,511
way too much.
When you look at people from the early 

1923
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:53,511
19 hundreds,
what they looked like,

1924
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,440
I mean obviously a lot of that has 
refrigeration.

1925
01:22:55,441 --> 01:23:00,441
They didn't have as much food.
People were much smaller than because 

1926
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:00,990
they weren't.
It was literally malnutrition,

1927
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:06,180
so common aspect where we've gone 
completely the other way now we have 

1928
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:06,760
enormous human beings.
People are way bigger than ever.

1929
01:23:06,761 --> 01:23:11,761
The.
It's a small world ride and Disneyland 

1930
01:23:11,761 --> 01:23:11,761
had to be.
They had to carve their trench deeper.

1931
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:14,170
They had to shut down the ride and carve
their trench deeper.

1932
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:18,820
I was at Disneyland the other day and I 
was with my daughters and their friend,

1933
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:23,910
so there was three little girls and me,
but we couldn't sit in the same row 

1934
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:27,730
because you can't have more than three 
people because they've got this thing.

1935
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:32,731
I'm like,
I weigh more than the three of them do 

1936
01:23:32,731 --> 01:23:32,731
together.
Like this is crazy.

1937
01:23:32,731 --> 01:23:36,511
Like you can't know with them.
What are the airlines going to adjust 

1938
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:36,520
the width of the seats to accommodate 
this and.

1939
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,250
No kidding,
right.

1940
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:42,251
I travel a lot and my one nightmare is 
being in sitting next to somebody who's 

1941
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:44,620
just kinda double size and all of a 
sudden part of them's mic.

1942
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:49,730
How about triple a,
but my friend Ralphie may a stand up 

1943
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:50,500
comedian.
I don't know if he flies first class,

1944
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:52,480
but even if he does,
it's not first class enough.

1945
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,220
He's 500 fucking pounds.

1946
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:54,980
I don't know how.
I don't.

1947
01:23:54,981 --> 01:23:59,981
I literally don't know how he does it.
Although I did read that the country is 

1948
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:02,941
turning the corner on this.
That is actually beginning to come down 

1949
01:24:02,941 --> 01:24:03,220
really fast.
People are dying.

1950
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,890
Uh,
I think the message is beginning to sink

1951
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:10,891
in,
really know some of it is just a matter 

1952
01:24:10,891 --> 01:24:11,110
of just kind of being a little more 
conscious,

1953
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,810
you know,
I mean that whole supersize me stuff and

1954
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:16,300
all this kind of stuff,
but once you get that big,

1955
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:19,390
it's way past that.
That's lap band stuff.

1956
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:21,070
Well,
Ralphie's had a couple surgeries.

1957
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:23,380
I think he's had at least two of those 
lap band things.

1958
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:25,130
He blows through them.
You know,

1959
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:26,050
when you,
uh,

1960
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:30,040
I know several people who've had that 
operation broke,

1961
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:35,070
whatever.
They fixed the shrink your stomach down 

1962
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,851
and then you wind up having to go back 
and having another operation because 

1963
01:24:38,851 --> 01:24:42,590
you're stretching this tiny new stomach 
out too much because it be,

1964
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:46,300
it's a psychological issue more than is 
even a physical issue.

1965
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,180
It's the same thing when you're talking 
about people that abused marijuana,

1966
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:54,860
marijuana that's causing you to do that,
or is it some underlying trauma that 

1967
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:58,330
you're trying to smother with food,
with sugar,

1968
01:24:58,331 --> 01:24:59,620
with pot,
with alcohol,

1969
01:24:59,621 --> 01:25:03,280
with whatever the fuck it is.
It seems like the psychological issue is

1970
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:05,950
as much of a factor as the physical 
addiction.

1971
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:09,250
And there can be no doubt there are 
physical addictions to food and sugar,

1972
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:11,650
but what is really going on there 
that's,

1973
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:15,590
that's overwhelming your life and making
you indulge in it.

1974
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,070
And to some people would say,
and I think there's,

1975
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:24,160
there's really something to this,
is that if we have an epidemic of 

1976
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:27,010
anything in our country and maybe in 
many modern societies,

1977
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:32,400
it's pain and it's a combination of a 
pain that sometimes manifests 

1978
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:34,630
physically,
but it actually has to do with emotional

1979
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:39,631
pain and a sense of emptiness and the 
food and psychoactive drugs or ways of 

1980
01:25:39,631 --> 01:25:41,200
filling this sort of stuff.
I mean,

1981
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:46,201
I will tell you that we were talking 
about back pain and all this sort of 

1982
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:49,741
stuff before and about the overuse of 
opioids probably back in the early 

1983
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:51,820
nineties.
Two things happened to me in short order

1984
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:56,821
that really affected,
really powerfully affected my 

1985
01:25:56,821 --> 01:25:56,821
understanding of the mind body 
relationship.

1986
01:25:56,821 --> 01:26:01,800
The first one was doing Mtma for the 
first time and that was sort of just 

1987
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:02,670
kind of not just mind opening but openly
with my conscious.

1988
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:04,370
Is there a mind body consciousness?

1989
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:09,700
But the second one was I had gone 
through three terrible episodes of back 

1990
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,780
pain and Sciatica and and I,
you know,

1991
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:15,680
I did Mris and cat scans and I had a 
herniated disc at the l,

1992
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:20,681
four L,
five l five s one the whole sort of 

1993
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:22,511
thing.
I was 48 hours away from being operated 

1994
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:22,511
on,
you know,

1995
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,320
I knew the operation surgery is risky.
And then I called a friend of mine,

1996
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:29,321
Andy Weil,
Dr Andrew Weil who's a well known 

1997
01:26:29,321 --> 01:26:29,321
integrative medicine guy and he said,
don't get the surgery.

1998
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,950
He said,
go see this doctor,

1999
01:26:30,951 --> 01:26:34,820
this guy named John Sarno at the end one
you're talking about.

2000
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:39,800
And soreness theory was all of this 
stuff about herniated disc causing lower

2001
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:42,830
back pain and leg pain radiating down.
He goes,

2002
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:47,831
it's overwhelmingly bullshit.
And his theory is that what's really 

2003
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:51,371
going on is that it's,
there's nothing physically wrong with 

2004
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:52,140
your body,
that there's underlying emotional anger,

2005
01:26:52,270 --> 01:26:54,140
angsty feet,
whatever it might be,

2006
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:58,190
and that your brain plays a trick by 
turning this emotional pain and physical

2007
01:26:58,191 --> 01:26:58,580
pain.

2008
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,640
And it does that through a process of 
reducing the flow of blood around those 

2009
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:03,640
nerves.
And muscles,

2010
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,010
et Cetera.
So without going on with this,

2011
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:07,370
this approach,
Sarno approach worked for me.

2012
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:11,630
I went from having this horrific pain to
sort of coming out of it very quickly.

2013
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:13,160
Being able to pick up my little daughter
again,

2014
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:18,161
do the sports I used to do,
and seeing myself as having a totally 

2015
01:27:18,161 --> 01:27:21,611
healthy back though Sarno believes right
that it's not just lower back pain and 

2016
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:22,040
Sciatica.
Right.

2017
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:23,560
And he uses.
This is not just faith healing.

2018
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:28,570
This is what I mean pretty he,
he's his stuff is 90 percent supported 

2019
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,420
by the science on this stuff more than 
any other,

2020
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:34,430
any other theory of this stuff.
But his thing is that a lot of pain is 

2021
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:38,141
probably underlying emotional pain being
turned into physical pain and then we 

2022
01:27:38,141 --> 01:27:39,770
deal with that through food,
through alcohol,

2023
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,600
opiates,
whatever it might be.

2024
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:46,720
And the reason why we ended up getting 
into such trouble with drugs or with 

2025
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,081
food is because we're trying to address 
this underlying almost existential pain.

2026
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,640
Not by dealing with what's really 
causing it,

2027
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:56,030
but by trying to feed it things that we 
think will cover it over now.

2028
01:27:56,031 --> 01:27:57,140
Sardo's.
Right.

2029
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:58,820
And My,
I can't prove these right,

2030
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
but based upon my own personal 
experience and my reading and my 

2031
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,610
understanding what's going on with drugs
and food in this country,

2032
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,140
I think there's a lot there.

2033
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:11,280
Well,
Sarno certainly has some really good 

2034
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,021
points,
but there are definitely some physical 

2035
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:14,971
aspects to numbness and bulging discs 
impeding on nerves and atrophy like 

2036
01:28:15,701 --> 01:28:20,701
atrophied limbs,
which is a big problem with athletes 

2037
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:23,131
that have nerve issues were bulging 
discs pushed down on nerves and it 

2038
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:27,211
actually cuts the nerve supply to the 
muscles themselves and caused them to 

2039
01:28:27,211 --> 01:28:27,820
atrophy.
That's real.

2040
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:31,360
That's all real injuries are real,
but I think it's very important though,

2041
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:36,361
that you recognize in it.
Everybody hearing this recognizes that 

2042
01:28:36,361 --> 01:28:37,570
there are legitimate injuries that you 
have.

2043
01:28:37,571 --> 01:28:38,620
Well,
it's hold on,

2044
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:39,640
yeah,
through your discs,

2045
01:28:39,641 --> 01:28:42,220
bulge out and impinge,
impinge on nerves,

2046
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:47,370
and you need to get that treated and 
there's a bunch of different ways to 

2047
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:48,280
treat that that don't involve surgery.
Yoga is one of them.

2048
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:53,350
Yoga is a really good one.
Another one is decompression because 

2049
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:57,120
I've gone through all this.
I've had some series bulging disc 

2050
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:57,780
injuries from Jujitsu and the,
you know,

2051
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:02,070
I've had Mris that show this issue and 
I've dealt with all it without surgery

2052
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,590
so it can be done,
but click.

2053
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:09,591
It's important to the.
There are people that have legitimate 

2054
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:09,591
injuries.
Yeah,

2055
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:09,591
no,
no question about it.

2056
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:12,270
I think even Sarna would say there are 
people who have legitimate injuries.

2057
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:15,240
How did you hurt yourself?
That's the whole thing.

2058
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:20,270
See,
part of what Sarno points out is that 

2059
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:21,720
now that we have Mris and cat scans 
being done commonly in our society,

2060
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:26,100
that if you take 100 people who are 
showing that they have herniated this,

2061
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,530
right,
and you have 100 people who were showing

2062
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:33,531
no herniated disc,
you'll have the same incidence of back 

2063
01:29:33,531 --> 01:29:36,291
pain would whole show.
Is that the evidence that some when you 

2064
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:39,351
see that the people assume there's a 
causal relationship between that MRI or 

2065
01:29:39,351 --> 01:29:42,000
cat scan of the herniated disc and that 
lower back pain now could be that you've

2066
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:43,350
had a serious injury,
right?

2067
01:29:43,351 --> 01:29:48,351
You've been hit by a car,
you'd been at a sports injury where 

2068
01:29:48,351 --> 01:29:48,351
there really is something going on 
there,

2069
01:29:48,351 --> 01:29:49,950
but for many people there's not a 
serious injury.

2070
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,170
There's some little thing that kind of 
triggers it,

2071
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:57,380
but then somehow it transforms and this 
and then he looks at people live in 

2072
01:29:57,380 --> 01:30:00,390
other societies were lower back pain and
Sciatica or not sort of accepted reasons

2073
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:05,391
for missing days of work or all this 
sort of stuff and he finds much lower 

2074
01:30:05,391 --> 01:30:05,700
incidence of these pain.
Right?

2075
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,620
And the same thing.
Look at the carpal tunnel thing.

2076
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:08,610
What's that about?
I mean,

2077
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:13,611
people have been typing typewriters 
forever and ever and ever and all of a 

2078
01:30:13,611 --> 01:30:13,611
sudden we have this epidemic of this 
thing,

2079
01:30:13,611 --> 01:30:15,780
right?
And then somehow that epidemic begins to

2080
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:17,400
fade,
is replaced by something else.

2081
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,520
Well,
let's hold on a second there because 

2082
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:22,520
carpal tunnel is real and we're one of 
the reasons for carpal tunnel,

2083
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,080
repetitive stress,
repetitive stress causes inflammation.

2084
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:30,081
Inflammation locks up when you're forced
to sit at a keyboard in the same 

2085
01:30:30,081 --> 01:30:31,830
position over and over again and 
repeatedly do the same exercises.

2086
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:37,100
You absolutely do.
Put undue stress on your hands and on 

2087
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:37,100
your wrist,
and if you're not prepared for it,

2088
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,230
if your body's not conditioned and 
you're you,

2089
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:42,360
you're not a rigorous person,
you can have real issues with it.

2090
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:44,940
My mom had to have surgery for carpal 
tunnel.

2091
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:46,080
I mean,
it's legitimate.

2092
01:30:46,081 --> 01:30:48,680
Then raise the question we had in the 
1920,

2093
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:49,160
30,
40,

2094
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:50,610
50,
sixties and seventies,

2095
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,300
tens of millions of American,
mostly women who were typing eight hours

2096
01:30:54,301 --> 01:30:55,290
a day,
12 hours a day.

2097
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,070
Well,
first of all,

2098
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:59,120
I couldn't type as fast because there 
was the whole reason why the court,

2099
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:04,121
he method was invented to keep the keys 
from binding up because now we don't 

2100
01:31:04,121 --> 01:31:06,180
need that because you have your fingers 
just gently touch these things.

2101
01:31:06,181 --> 01:31:08,580
You can do it really quickly.
The other thing is diet.

2102
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:11,460
Um,
there's a lot of inflamed inflammation.

2103
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:15,390
Promoting foods are foods rather than 
cause inflammation.

2104
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:17,160
And that's just a fact.
Sugar is a big one.

2105
01:31:17,161 --> 01:31:19,110
Alcohol is a big one.
Process,

2106
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:20,460
flowers,
wheats,

2107
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,090
like things that your body has to break 
down which breaks down to sugar.

2108
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:26,940
Like this big thing in this country,
like gluten free.

2109
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:31,320
This gluten free that go what?
What it is gluten.

2110
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:33,600
There are people that have gluten 
intolerances,

2111
01:31:33,601 --> 01:31:35,730
celiac diseases,
things on those lines.

2112
01:31:35,731 --> 01:31:37,670
People have wheat intolerance,
but I think it would.

2113
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:42,680
A lot of it is is just sugar because if 
you're eating bread that your body 

2114
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,620
breaks that stuff down.
Process,

2115
01:31:43,621 --> 01:31:47,040
flowers directly to sugar,
bread and pasta,

2116
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,990
all that.
That white stuff,

2117
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:51,590
that's shit's not natural.
You're breaking it down.

2118
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,600
Your body takes that bleached process.
Flour and it converts it directly to 

2119
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,300
sugar and sugar causes inflammation and 
that's.

2120
01:31:58,301 --> 01:31:59,860
That's a huge issue with people.
Yeah.

2121
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,750
I'm no expert on all that sort of stuff,
Joe,

2122
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:02,410
so I don't know.

2123
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,870
I'll say that.
My takeaway from going through that pain

2124
01:32:04,871 --> 01:32:09,871
experience and all the reading I've done
and this thing is that when it comes to 

2125
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:10,360
treating certain farms of chronic pain 
like this,

2126
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:14,920
that the approach that works best is the
one that won most believes in,

2127
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:17,640
right?
Whether it's Chiropractic,

2128
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:20,410
whether it's yoga,
whether it's Sarno,

2129
01:32:20,411 --> 01:32:23,590
whether it's surgery.
The reason why surgery tends to have the

2130
01:32:23,591 --> 01:32:28,591
most immediate benefit right away is 
because surgery is effectively the most 

2131
01:32:28,591 --> 01:32:31,660
powerful placebo there is,
but when you see research that's showing

2132
01:32:31,661 --> 01:32:35,560
the three years after people who have 
had back surgery are as likely to have a

2133
01:32:35,561 --> 01:32:37,720
back problem is that people did not have
the surgery.

2134
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,240
You have to start questioning the 
evidence around some of that.

2135
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,400
Actually,
it's because of lifestyle choices.

2136
01:32:42,401 --> 01:32:47,401
I mean if you think about a person who 
has surgery for a back issue and then 

2137
01:32:47,401 --> 01:32:49,930
three years later they have more issues,
most likely they're living a life in the

2138
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:54,931
exact same way,
which means they're putting the same 

2139
01:32:54,931 --> 01:32:56,350
stresses on their body they were doing 
before like sitting at a desk all day or

2140
01:32:56,351 --> 01:32:58,480
doing something like you're picking 
stuff up.

2141
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:03,480
Folks that work in warehouses and things
along those lines and you have to pick 

2142
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,240
stuff up all the time and your body's 
not conditioned for it.

2143
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:06,370
So you have repetitive stress in that 
regard.

2144
01:33:06,371 --> 01:33:09,350
There's a lot of issues and you know 
what caused it.

2145
01:33:09,351 --> 01:33:14,351
You may be right.
That could be it and that certainly can 

2146
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:14,351
trigger the pain,
but I'm going to tell you,

2147
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:18,810
having been through the experience and 
I've met many people a since that who 

2148
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:20,920
for whom at work I think and because the
Sarno approach,

2149
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:23,050
if it works for you,
is one way.

2150
01:33:23,051 --> 01:33:28,051
You get to see your body as whole once 
again and not as vulnerable and because 

2151
01:33:28,051 --> 01:33:31,630
it pushes you to deal with underlying 
emotional stuff that may be driving some

2152
01:33:31,631 --> 01:33:34,720
of this physical pain.
I mean for all those reasons,

2153
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:39,721
I think my.
My view is when people ask me and I'll 

2154
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:39,721
say,
read sorrows book,

2155
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:39,721
you know,
on back pain,

2156
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:39,850
right?

2157
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:42,400
Or healing back pain and I'll say if it 
doesn't make sense to you,

2158
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:47,650
try something else.
But the thing about desanto thing is if 

2159
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:50,491
it does work for you,
it's in some respects the most 

2160
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:53,161
miraculous of all the.
I think the Sarno approach is a great 

2161
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:53,161
approach.
Don't get me wrong,

2162
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:54,880
but I don't think they're mutually 
exclusive to taking care of your body in

2163
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:59,881
a physical sense.
And I think that most people just don't 

2164
01:33:59,881 --> 01:33:59,881
take care of their body in a physical 
sense.

2165
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:01,400
They don't exercise.
I think exercise is,

2166
01:34:01,401 --> 01:34:05,440
and especially treating your core as if 
it is the foundation of your body,

2167
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:06,990
something that supports you all day 
long,

2168
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:08,410
you're back,
you know,

2169
01:34:08,411 --> 01:34:13,411
there's very few people work out their 
back in a sense of like long static 

2170
01:34:13,411 --> 01:34:16,810
exercises like yoga where you're holding
poses for 30 seconds,

2171
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:22,110
you know,
and doing one after the other and doing 

2172
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:22,110
it over a course of Oregon.

2173
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:22,110
It's not fun.
Like you said,

2174
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:23,470
he can't get into it because you don't 
find it enjoyable,

2175
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:25,660
but the benefits of doing that,
man,

2176
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:30,900
I'm telling you,
I just got into it a bit less than a 

2177
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,240
year ago.
I've been doing on a weekly basis,

2178
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:34,810
like fairly regularly.
The benefits are tremendous for me.

2179
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:36,760
Your,
your back just feels way better.

2180
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,380
Just feels like you have more.
There's more vigorous with it.

2181
01:34:40,381 --> 01:34:42,850
More with core exercises,
with Yoga,

2182
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,650
with yoga exercises,
Yoga.

2183
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:47,800
A big part of what yoga works is what we
call our core.

2184
01:34:47,801 --> 01:34:49,100
I mean it's literally your,
your,

2185
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:50,610
your spine,
you know,

2186
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:55,710
from your neck down to your back.
And that's a big part of what you're 

2187
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:55,980
holding these poses.
And you know,

2188
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:59,420
you have to hold your in a straight 
line,

2189
01:34:59,421 --> 01:35:00,290
like what are you doing?
You're,

2190
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:05,291
you're,
you're supporting everything with your 

2191
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:05,291
back and with your spine sound like 
lifting weights is,

2192
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:09,140
it's a different sort of thing where 
you're holding your own bodyweight.

2193
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:14,320
Well,
I'll tell you something to return to 

2194
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,701
where our conversation got going.
One of the great things about living in 

2195
01:35:15,701 --> 01:35:19,061
Manhattan is we walk and the result is 
that there's a lower incidence of 

2196
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:23,150
obesity in Manhattan than there is in 
most of the United States.

2197
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:28,151
Makes Sense.
And that walking is one of the safest 

2198
01:35:28,151 --> 01:35:28,670
even for people who don't want to take 
out the time to exercise because walking

2199
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:33,671
is the way we get places.
It turns out that we land up to believe 

2200
01:35:33,671 --> 01:35:34,370
relatively healthy lives in a place like
Manhattan,

2201
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,090
not was standing all the crazy.
What are you doing when you're walking?

2202
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,090
You're carrying me.
What do you weigh?

2203
01:35:38,091 --> 01:35:41,960
One hundred and 80 pounds or something 
like carrying that 180 pounds around.

2204
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:47,450
Whereas that amount of energy and that 
amount of calorie expenditure is lost if

2205
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:49,490
you're sitting in the car driving to 
work,

2206
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,590
getting in an elevator,
going to your office,

2207
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,450
sitting in your cubicle,
all that's lost,

2208
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:56,930
all that's lost and it's probably 
thousands of calories a day.

2209
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:02,240
You're also making me think about when I
remember my experience with him Dma,

2210
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:07,590
uh,
you know how there are some people when 

2211
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:09,761
they do an and they just like to sit and
get in a place and other people like me 

2212
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:12,020
just want to move,
move around,

2213
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:14,060
know,
get the energy going and such.

2214
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:19,120
You know,
I also found some times he only talked 

2215
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:19,120
about going back to the whole mushroom 
thing.

2216
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,230
I remember feeling especially that.
So it's the mushrooms you take them and 

2217
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:23,300
they start to come on and I can find 
like,

2218
01:36:23,301 --> 01:36:28,301
it's like this energy force going into 
your body and in some ways the best way 

2219
01:36:28,301 --> 01:36:29,810
to deal with that stuff is movement.
It's running,

2220
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,940
it's swinging around,
it's moving around,

2221
01:36:31,941 --> 01:36:34,610
like opening up your body to lift that 
powerful energy.

2222
01:36:34,611 --> 01:36:35,240
Yet,
you know,

2223
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:40,330
I think there's a lot of tension that 
people carry around their bodies or 

2224
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:43,161
their bodies just aren't being used 
correctly or they're bunched up or 

2225
01:36:43,161 --> 01:36:44,690
they're not stretched out and are 
confined and bound up and they have poor

2226
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:49,691
posture and then the stress of life and 
bills and all the things that are 

2227
01:36:49,691 --> 01:36:49,691
weighing down in.

2228
01:36:49,691 --> 01:36:53,840
I think in that sense Arno's out an 
excellent point that pressure and stress

2229
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:57,890
and pain and just frustration just 
causes you to be tense and everything is

2230
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:01,370
fucked up and if you can address that 
and sort of relax a little bit,

2231
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:07,510
just that alone just to alleviate a lot 
of tension and that's a lot of what 

2232
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:11,591
people carry around them.
That's also a lot of what people like 

2233
01:37:11,591 --> 01:37:14,231
about pot.
Like you said that how we used to like 

2234
01:37:14,231 --> 01:37:14,231
to smoke pot and stretch out what's 
going on there.

2235
01:37:14,231 --> 01:37:17,300
You're releasing releasing tension.
He smoked pot like,

2236
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,370
man,
I love doing that before a show.

2237
01:37:19,371 --> 01:37:24,371
I like smoking a little weed before show
and stretching out and that was one of 

2238
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:24,430
my favorite things to do.
Just sit,

2239
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:27,590
sit in a dressing room before I go on 
and just stretch,

2240
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:29,640
warm up,
loosen up my back,

2241
01:37:29,641 --> 01:37:32,090
stretch my back out and stretch my body 
out.

2242
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:34,970
It's.
It's something that we don't do enough.

2243
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:37,910
You buy your meat vehicle,
move that fucker around.

2244
01:37:37,911 --> 01:37:38,460
I know,
I know.

2245
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,290
It's true.
Look man,

2246
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:44,320
I work in an office a lot of the time 
and it's just so easy to get in that 

2247
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:44,320
zone and you're in front of that 
computer.

2248
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,160
That's what you're doing,
you know,

2249
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:46,980
and all the sudden you realize your 
shoulders about.

2250
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:50,330
You're exactly right when you're going,
especially if you have bad posture,

2251
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:53,120
you carrying it.
Like if you're sitting like I,

2252
01:37:53,121 --> 01:37:55,040
you know,
when I had my back injury,

2253
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:59,040
which was sports related,
but when I started getting treatment for

2254
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:04,041
it,
I realized there's a lot of other 

2255
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:05,211
underlying issues and one of them is if 
you're sitting in a desk and you have 

2256
01:38:05,211 --> 01:38:09,201
poor posture,
the strain has been a lot of studies 

2257
01:38:09,201 --> 01:38:10,110
done on this street is in a very 
specific area,

2258
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:15,290
so instead of being straight where your 
back is carrying the weight in an even 

2259
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:19,950
form through the top of your head all 
the way down to your lower back,

2260
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:25,160
you're causing this undue spot,
this weird spot in the middle by 

2261
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:30,260
slumping where you get all this pressure
in this one area that really shouldn't 

2262
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:30,260
be there.

2263
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,000
And over time,
like cab drivers that have a,

2264
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:36,390
a thick wallet and they keep it in their
back pocket and they sit on there.

2265
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:38,760
They developed bulging disks in their 
back.

2266
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:42,720
It's just the slow water that causes the
rock to go smooth.

2267
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:44,920
Well,
the other cuts of channel through put.

2268
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,720
I mean,
for me,

2269
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:47,790
the thing I've learned from so many 
people,

2270
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:52,850
and it's basically the kind of common 
ingredient and almost all spiritual 

2271
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:56,661
practices,
meditative practice is just simple deep 

2272
01:38:56,661 --> 01:38:56,661
breathing,
right?

2273
01:38:56,661 --> 01:38:59,580
Because just having to fill your lungs 
just,

2274
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:04,700
it just forces you to have to sit up all
of a sudden if you want to fill your 

2275
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:04,700
lungs and that,
that breathing,

2276
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:08,490
this just the slow breathing gets went 
to focus to center.

2277
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:10,900
I mean I know that when I'm stressed off
the advantages,

2278
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:15,920
grabbing a drugs,
I think that's the wrong way to use 

2279
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:15,920
drugs.

2280
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:15,920
Just trying to remember,
take a breath,

2281
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,450
try to take five breaths,
10 breaths,

2282
01:39:18,451 --> 01:39:23,451
slowly in and out,
and that's one of the best centering 

2283
01:39:23,451 --> 01:39:23,451
things.
There are.

2284
01:39:23,451 --> 01:39:23,451
Well,
you know,

2285
01:39:23,451 --> 01:39:24,900
I've been teaching that to my five year 
old.

2286
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,800
I kind of taught her when she was three,
when we started talking about it,

2287
01:39:28,801 --> 01:39:30,690
like she would get upset,
like something would happen.

2288
01:39:30,691 --> 01:39:34,950
Like she would like stubborn pto or not 
even like a big deal,

2289
01:39:34,951 --> 01:39:39,951
like hurt or something would something 
would get her upset and she would cry 

2290
01:39:39,951 --> 01:39:41,990
which was crying.
And then I fell down and I do that.

2291
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I'd be like,
you've got to breathe in and breathe 

2292
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,000
out.
Let's do this together.

2293
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,000
We'll do it together.
And I do it with her.

2294
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,280
I'm like,
take a breath.

2295
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:52,160
And you're like,
it's hard for them because they're,

2296
01:39:52,161 --> 01:39:54,330
they're hyperventilating.
But it made me realize like,

2297
01:39:54,331 --> 01:39:59,331
wow,
that's a lot of people that go through 

2298
01:39:59,331 --> 01:39:59,331
that with issues in life,
you know,

2299
01:39:59,331 --> 01:40:03,441
you have some incredibly stressful issue
and it just overwhelms you and you take 

2300
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:06,480
this shallow,
panicky breath and you know,

2301
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:09,150
it's one thing when a three year old 
doesn't know how to deal with,

2302
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:14,180
you know,
hurting herself or falling down or 

2303
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:14,180
whatever.

2304
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,480
What is that made her upset.
But when adult,

2305
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:20,560
you know,
gets to 50 years old and they still 

2306
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:20,790
don't know how to deal with stress as 
kind of a tragedy.

2307
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:26,140
It's like either you have.
We don't really teach that in our 

2308
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:26,140
society anyway,
you know,

2309
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:26,140
it's interesting to,
uh,

2310
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,050
my,
my niece has just started medical school

2311
01:40:28,051 --> 01:40:30,450
and I was asking her what she was 
thinking of specialty shoes,

2312
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:33,360
thinking about.
And I was saying to my,

2313
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:37,500
I think if I ever decided to pursue 
medicine instead of what I did do,

2314
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:42,980
I think the single most fascinating area
of medicine right now is pain 

2315
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:46,251
management.
It is the most interdisciplinary of all 

2316
01:40:46,251 --> 01:40:48,330
areas because it requires you understand
physical pain,

2317
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,220
you understand pharmaceuticals and 
biochemistry and understanding,

2318
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,250
but it also requires

2319
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:58,600
that element of understanding things 
like breathing and exercise and the body

2320
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,960
and it's that area.
I mean the pain is such physical pain is

2321
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:07,090
such an epidemic in America today for 
all these reasons.

2322
01:41:07,091 --> 01:41:09,310
You and I are giving different reasons 
and agreeing on a lot of it,

2323
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:14,640
but I think that becoming a more 
thoughtful and sophisticated society in 

2324
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,330
terms of how we deal with this,
how will you alleviate it,

2325
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,360
how we prevent it and doing so in a way 
in which the government is playing a 

2326
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,110
positive role as opposed to a 
destructive role.

2327
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,780
Because right now,
right,

2328
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:30,150
the role of the government,
these are the physicians who want to 

2329
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:31,240
properly deal with pain management is 
intimidating them and scaring them.

2330
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:36,500
Then the way in which the pharmaceutical
companies drive where drugs people have 

2331
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,680
means that oftentimes people don't have 
access to the things they need.

2332
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:43,860
Meanwhile,
the failure to think about the 

2333
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:43,860
importance of breathing in our society 
of posture,

2334
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:45,940
the things you're talking about.
Exercise is another element.

2335
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,390
All this sort of stuff and on some level
I think,

2336
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:49,210
you know,
look,

2337
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:54,270
a lot of the drug problem has to do with
issues of race and class and stuff like 

2338
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:55,270
that,
but a lot of it also has to do with this

2339
01:41:55,271 --> 01:42:00,271
kind of pervasive sense of pain,
physical and emotional pain that people 

2340
01:42:00,271 --> 01:42:01,600
are trying to treat and all sorts of 
ways.

2341
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,290
Yeah,
I think you're right.

2342
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:08,120
I think it's also the requirements of 
life are really unnatural.

2343
01:42:08,121 --> 01:42:09,770
The life that we've set up for 
ourselves,

2344
01:42:09,771 --> 01:42:14,771
the requirements of managing bills and 
dealing with taxes and dealing with the 

2345
01:42:14,771 --> 01:42:19,301
stress of marriage and the nonsense that
comes with divorce and the chaos that 

2346
01:42:20,331 --> 01:42:23,180
comes with all sorts of different 
aspects of our life.

2347
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:28,210
It just seems just overwhelming and then
the existential angst of your own 

2348
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:32,201
mortality compounding every day.
The futility of getting up every morning

2349
01:42:32,241 --> 01:42:34,370
when you want to stay in bed,
the alarm goes off,

2350
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:39,470
hit that fucking button,
he get up and you put your fucking 

2351
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:42,491
clothes on just like every other day and
you drink your coffee and you do your 

2352
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:44,930
rituals and you go to a job that you 
find unsatisfying.

2353
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:49,340
That is the vast majority of Americans 
and probably have people in the world.

2354
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:54,620
I think that you live a fulfilling life.
You're doing what you enjoy doing and 

2355
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:57,881
I'm very lucky to feel the same way,
but I think that we're in the minority 

2356
01:42:57,881 --> 01:43:01,481
and I think there's a large amount of 
people out there that are longing for 

2357
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:05,111
something better than what they have.
Whether it's a better relationship or 

2358
01:43:05,111 --> 01:43:06,020
it's a better connection to their family
or it's a better,

2359
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:08,750
some rewarding thing to do with their 
time.

2360
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:09,420
Well,
you see,

2361
01:43:09,421 --> 01:43:14,421
I mean,
part of that explains why more and more 

2362
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:16,251
people are seeking out the church,
whether it's evangelical churches or 

2363
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:16,251
other types of truth.
I think so.

2364
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:16,530
I mean,
look,

2365
01:43:16,531 --> 01:43:19,420
you see those numbers grow in these mega
churches that are happening.

2366
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:24,750
The other.
I think that the numbers of people that 

2367
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:24,750
are involved in organized religion or

2368
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:27,050
I think the ones who are going to the 
conventional churches,

2369
01:43:27,051 --> 01:43:29,150
the more mainstream churches and 
synagogues,

2370
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:33,110
that's what's dropping the ones who are 
being drawn to the angelical ones,

2371
01:43:33,111 --> 01:43:36,710
the ones where they sort of are more 
attentive to bring in the spirit and the

2372
01:43:36,711 --> 01:43:39,740
body into the practice of religion.
Right,

2373
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,000
but evangelical churches,
you know,

2374
01:43:41,001 --> 01:43:42,080
you,
you dance,

2375
01:43:42,081 --> 01:43:43,940
you move,
you do all this sort of stuff.

2376
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:46,760
I think people doing the same thing in 
the world that we know of,

2377
01:43:46,761 --> 01:43:50,930
psychedelics and doing these things.
People want to link their body,

2378
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,070
mind their

2379
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:55,850
spirit community.
That's look at millions of people,

2380
01:43:55,851 --> 01:44:00,200
young people now going to sort of the 
whole kind of a dance dance world,

2381
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:01,700
the nightlife world,
all that stuff.

2382
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:06,320
Same thing that kind of almost 
collective quasi religious communitarian

2383
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:09,140
feeling of letting go in the company of 
others.

2384
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:13,820
I think people are so much want and need
that and it's a good thing for people to

2385
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:18,821
do that.
It's not hurting other people or people 

2386
01:44:18,821 --> 01:44:19,910
that are getting hurt in the process and
that's another thing we started.

2387
01:44:19,911 --> 01:44:24,911
Drug Policy Alliance is a whole project 
and trying to keep young people safe as 

2388
01:44:24,911 --> 01:44:26,450
they're in this whole night.
Life Dancing,

2389
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:31,630
right?
People are taking all these drugs are 

2390
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:31,630
doing things.
Somebody said drinking too much,

2391
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:35,201
they're overheating and people get hurt 
and the question is young people going 

2392
01:44:35,201 --> 01:44:36,980
out and enjoying themselves for hours or
days,

2393
01:44:36,981 --> 01:44:40,970
listening to music being another moving 
train and even doing mind altering drugs

2394
01:44:40,971 --> 01:44:44,510
can be a perfectly healthy and good and 
even liberating thing,

2395
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:47,510
good for their lives,
but we need to make sure it's being done

2396
01:44:47,511 --> 01:44:48,050
safe.

2397
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:53,290
That notion of making our societies as 
safe as possible for people to open up 

2398
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:56,780
and let go,
whether it's with or without drugs,

2399
01:44:56,781 --> 01:44:58,910
I think is something we have to evolve 
towards.

2400
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:03,940
I think you're dead right,
but I also think that the issue is that 

2401
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:08,200
we haven't built a foundation of 
stability in these people up to this 

2402
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,340
point where they're taking these 
exploratory journeys of the mind.

2403
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,120
I mean,
they're.

2404
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:14,210
Their foundation is fucked up there.
You know,

2405
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:19,211
there's so much going on outside of that
they need to take care of before they 

2406
01:45:19,211 --> 01:45:23,381
just dive into the world of psychedelics
and it's one of the reasons why people 

2407
01:45:23,381 --> 01:45:23,720
have bad trips.
I mean,

2408
01:45:23,721 --> 01:45:28,721
what is a bad trip?
You're resisting all the things that 

2409
01:45:28,721 --> 01:45:30,140
these drugs are exposing.
You put these blinders on,

2410
01:45:30,141 --> 01:45:34,470
gone through this life and whether it's 
childhood trauma or you know,

2411
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:37,280
unfulfilled expectations that are 
haunting you,

2412
01:45:37,281 --> 01:45:40,730
whatever it is that's that is causing 
the quote unquote bad trip.

2413
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:45,760
A lot of what that is is resisting the 
message that these boundary desolving 

2414
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:50,670
experiences are giving you.
They're sending you as a message,

2415
01:45:50,671 --> 01:45:53,040
as a.
you're inherently unhappy.

2416
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:57,980
You're unhappy in,
in almost like a cellular level and that

2417
01:45:57,981 --> 01:46:00,560
it's not as simple as just like diving 
in and,

2418
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:03,290
and having a mushroom trip and it's all 
going to clear out.

2419
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:06,770
You've got to deal with the foundation 
of your own personality.

2420
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:10,420
I agree.
The question is how do we do that really

2421
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,820
board,
when you look at now,

2422
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:16,400
I mean look at younger people who are on
the Internet,

2423
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,470
24 slash seven.
It's constant.

2424
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:23,471
You know,
that people will look to stand on any 

2425
01:46:23,471 --> 01:46:24,860
corner and see the number of people 
walking around looking at their,

2426
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:25,640
at their,
you know,

2427
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:26,880
little gadget,
right?

2428
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:28,850
Looking at their facebook,
looking at this or whatever,

2429
01:46:28,851 --> 01:46:30,590
right?
People are interacting with the world in

2430
01:46:30,591 --> 01:46:32,360
an entirely different way.
Right?

2431
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,330
And then of course the way society is 
evolving so quickly,

2432
01:46:35,331 --> 01:46:38,060
you know,
entrepreneurial folks can thrive,

2433
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:43,061
but for huge numbers of people,
there's no sense of security about what 

2434
01:46:43,061 --> 01:46:46,931
the economy,
the society is going to be like in the 

2435
01:46:46,931 --> 01:46:49,361
future.
I mean we are kind of hurtling into the 

2436
01:46:49,361 --> 01:46:51,551
future.
Artificial intelligence is going all 

2437
01:46:51,551 --> 01:46:51,551
sorts of crazy

2438
01:46:51,551 --> 01:46:52,560
places.
All sorts of jobs are being displaced by

2439
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,780
robotics and things like that.
So,

2440
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:57,150
you know,
just talking with my daughter,

2441
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,630
my daughter who's now 20,
about to be 27 and you know,

2442
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:01,320
it's just,
it's,

2443
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,580
it's a,
it's a whole.

2444
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,800
The world is,
is the pace of change is so remarkable 

2445
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,721
in this regard.
There are so few guides and the ability 

2446
01:47:11,721 --> 01:47:12,000
of the parental world to play a 
constructive role.

2447
01:47:12,001 --> 01:47:13,140
First of all,
many parental,

2448
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:18,440
mainly parents aren't that good as 
parents or they're not that good at 

2449
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:18,440
helping young people,
you know?

2450
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:22,810
Um,
but beyond that they're so disconnected 

2451
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:22,810
sometimes from what's going on for,
you know,

2452
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:23,850
kids growing up in a whole different 
way.

2453
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:29,090
Right.
When I think when I was growing up in 

2454
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:29,090
the sixties and early seventies,
you know,

2455
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:31,380
the pace of change which so much slower 
than than it is now.

2456
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:36,680
Right.
So I don't know what to curate all that 

2457
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:36,680
stuff is.

2458
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,440
Yeah.
I think we're going to have to adapt to 

2459
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:40,440
this new world where people are getting 
information.

2460
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,850
It's just staggering rate that you got 
to decide how to manage it.

2461
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:45,280
And you know,
some like my friend Ari,

2462
01:47:45,490 --> 01:47:50,490
Ari Shaffir,
he switched to a flip phone and he's 

2463
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:50,490
like,
fuck this,

2464
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:53,131
I can't do this anymore because he would
say he would tell me that he would get 

2465
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:56,281
up in the morning and then he would 
spend like a half an hour going over 

2466
01:47:56,281 --> 01:47:57,850
facebook and going over all this and 
that before we ever got anything done.

2467
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:03,210
Now he just gets up and does stuff and 
if he wants to take care of all his 

2468
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:03,760
bullshit,
he does it on a computer.

2469
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:05,350
So he sits down,
he says,

2470
01:48:05,351 --> 01:48:07,660
okay,
now I'm going to answer my emails.

2471
01:48:07,661 --> 01:48:12,661
Now I'm going to.
Instead of just constantly being 

2472
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:12,661
attached to social media.
Like I said,

2473
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:16,810
I had a weird experience.
I accidentally signed up for facebook 

2474
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:18,720
two weeks ago.
I had this public facebook account which

2475
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:21,030
like my staff managed,
but then my phone

2476
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:24,730
got lost.
I had to reset the whole thing and I had

2477
01:48:24,731 --> 01:48:29,731
received my spotify account,
was hooked up to my facebook thing and 

2478
01:48:29,731 --> 01:48:30,580
if that password,
next thing you know,

2479
01:48:30,581 --> 01:48:31,000
Bang,
Bang,

2480
01:48:31,001 --> 01:48:36,001
Bang.
All of a sudden I created my own 

2481
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:36,001
personal facebook thing

2482
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:36,001
and so now I'm trying to feel what do I 
do with it.

2483
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:39,110
So I friended a few people.
A few people I work with are all freaked

2484
01:48:39,111 --> 01:48:40,910
out that the boss is thread to them,
you know,

2485
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:46,260
and,
and now I'm scrolling through and now I 

2486
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:46,260
understand when people are looking at 
and it,

2487
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,780
you know,
you just see you're talking about sugar,

2488
01:48:47,781 --> 01:48:48,500
fat,
salt.

2489
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:51,260
Nothing more addictive than that little 
gadget there.

2490
01:48:51,290 --> 01:48:52,670
Yeah,
it's very addictive.

2491
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:57,020
I've backed off way hard over the last 
few months.

2492
01:48:57,410 --> 01:49:02,410
Over the last few months.
I very rarely even go on my own message 

2493
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:06,551
board.
I have a message board on my website 

2494
01:49:06,551 --> 01:49:07,190
that I've had since 1998 and I go on 
there occasionally and check to see what

2495
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:12,310
what's going on in the news or what 
people are talking about are debating 

2496
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,890
and this and that,
but I find it to be.

2497
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:18,430
There's a massive requirement of time to
check all these different things to 

2498
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:21,790
check facebook and twitter and then 
there's social media.

2499
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:27,030
There's websites that I visited,
his message boards that have visited 

2500
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:29,720
different websites that aggregate news 
stories and it's just too much.

2501
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:32,440
It's just to back way off of it over the
last couple.

2502
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:37,670
I try to stick with the discipline that 
there will be at least once or a few 

2503
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:41,811
times a year where I will go into a 
total blackout on any communication 

2504
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:48,020
using that gadget.
I did a vacation a few years ago for 

2505
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:51,220
days where I did not pick up my laptop 
computer.

2506
01:49:51,221 --> 01:49:52,390
Even my phone,
my,

2507
01:49:52,391 --> 01:49:55,540
you know,
nothing right and know for the first day

2508
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:57,930
or two like my hand was like fidgeting,
you know,

2509
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:00,430
like it was going through withdrawal 
from that whole sort of thing.

2510
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:05,730
But I have to say I got today six and I 
had achieved a level of calm that I 

2511
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:06,970
associated with like,
you know,

2512
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:10,060
biting surfing as a 12 year old on the 
beach.

2513
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:14,530
I mean it was so,
so good and I got to tell you something,

2514
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:17,710
I haven't done it since I did it for a 
few days over Christmas.

2515
01:50:17,711 --> 01:50:22,711
I am so looking forward to finding some 
days the next week or two or I'm going 

2516
01:50:22,711 --> 01:50:23,800
to do that again.
Almost brings tears to my eyes.

2517
01:50:23,801 --> 01:50:26,380
When I think about that level of 
disconnection I think.

2518
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:28,960
I think human beings need to do that.

2519
01:50:29,090 --> 01:50:34,090
Well I,
I certainly don't think the word 

2520
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:35,731
designed to deal with the influx of 
information and the opinions of other 

2521
01:50:35,731 --> 01:50:39,650
people are thrown at you on en masse.
Like,

2522
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:44,830
like we get with social media.
I just think it's too much and I think 

2523
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:46,460
it's very addictive.
Communication is addictive in just being

2524
01:50:46,461 --> 01:50:51,461
able to,
like you always think you're going to 

2525
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:52,961
miss out on something.
There's gonna be some new thing that 

2526
01:50:52,961 --> 01:50:55,121
comes out that you're not aware of and I
think that managing that is really 

2527
01:50:55,671 --> 01:51:00,671
critical because we're not.
We haven't developed to deal with that.

2528
01:51:01,311 --> 01:51:06,080
This is a completely new thing and I 
don't think we're designed even media.

2529
01:51:06,081 --> 01:51:11,081
I think just the movies and songs,
there's a lot bunch of people running 

2530
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:15,191
around out there that don't have a 
realistic view of human beings because 

2531
01:51:15,191 --> 01:51:18,380
their view of human beings is based on 
heroes in movies and songs playing.

2532
01:51:18,381 --> 01:51:23,381
When people talk and everybody either 
acts no bully or they act obviously 

2533
01:51:23,381 --> 01:51:28,091
evil.
It's like these ideas of human beings 

2534
01:51:28,091 --> 01:51:28,091
are shaped by 15

2535
01:51:28,091 --> 01:51:32,230
shannon when people are doing that,
you're getting as opposed to reading 

2536
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:33,350
reading novels as I did when I was 
younger but barely do today.

2537
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:38,590
You get a much more deeper nuanced sense
of human beings by reading novels and 

2538
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:40,880
you possibly can by watching a movie 
watching a thing.

2539
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:42,530
Right,
so you're exactly right.

2540
01:51:42,531 --> 01:51:44,630
Same thing with body shape,
body consciousness,

2541
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:47,420
all the ways in which that's so screwed 
up in our society once again,

2542
01:51:47,421 --> 01:51:52,421
shaped by the media.
I mean I'm trying to do my few little 

2543
01:51:52,421 --> 01:51:54,980
disciplines like try not to look at my,
at my phone over the last year,

2544
01:51:54,981 --> 01:51:57,740
the last hour before I go to sleep 
because they say you sleep better if you

2545
01:51:57,741 --> 01:51:59,000
don't do that,
you know,

2546
01:51:59,001 --> 01:52:02,360
just trying to find some space sometime.
Try to turn off the ringer,

2547
01:52:02,630 --> 01:52:03,530
you know,
more often.

2548
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:06,350
Uh,
just some way of carving out that space.

2549
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:08,830
Yeah,
I think that that's a good thing.

2550
01:52:08,831 --> 01:52:11,260
It's a good thing to manage what's 
coming in.

2551
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:16,430
It's a very,
very good thing to manage what's coming 

2552
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:16,450
in because you just can't.
You can't rely on all these other people

2553
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:20,110
to,
to have access and to be able to input,

2554
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:23,050
you know,
into your own mind is just too many.

2555
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:24,460
There's too many people out there that 
want to,

2556
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:26,980
first of all,
how many people just want to bark at you

2557
01:52:26,981 --> 01:52:29,730
to get attention?
How many big review we're fucking doing.

2558
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:31,660
Your job pot would already be legal and 
you read.

2559
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:32,590
They're like,
what the fuck,

2560
01:52:32,591 --> 01:52:37,591
man,
I don't even know this guy and he's 

2561
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:37,591
yelling at me that I'm not doing my job.
He doesn't know what I'm doing.

2562
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:39,120
He doesn't even know me.
He doesn't want to know you,

2563
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:42,190
what he wants his attention and he's 
using this as a vehicle,

2564
01:52:42,191 --> 01:52:45,270
like a whiny baby screaming out for 
attention.

2565
01:52:45,271 --> 01:52:46,010
And oftentimes

2566
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:51,010
that squeaky wheel does get the say.
I don't even read a lot of that stuff 

2567
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:54,641
that shows up on various know public 
allies when I speeches go up on youtube 

2568
01:52:54,641 --> 01:52:54,720
and stuff like that.
But it's,

2569
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:55,600
it's,
it's,

2570
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:57,620
it's true.
It's just the other thing,

2571
01:52:57,621 --> 01:53:02,621
of course there's a power dynamic here 
which is there for people who work for 

2572
01:53:02,621 --> 01:53:03,980
somebody.
The risks that we're moving into society

2573
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:07,580
where your boss or your employer expects
you to be accessible.

2574
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:08,480
Uh,
you know,

2575
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:11,180
so like I let my staff,
although at the alliance,

2576
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,910
if they get an email from me on a 
weekend,

2577
01:53:13,911 --> 01:53:15,740
which they might,
because I sometimes work on weekends,

2578
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:18,470
there was no obligation and they'll 
expectation that they answered,

2579
01:53:18,471 --> 01:53:19,850
I think told Monday.
Right?

2580
01:53:19,851 --> 01:53:22,880
I mean that just so people know,
there's a sense of space.

2581
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:27,980
I have a friend who goes to work on 
Monday and his boss will get pissed at 

2582
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,350
him if he doesn't answer emails from the
night before,

2583
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:32,480
like he'll get an email at night and 
he's like,

2584
01:53:32,481 --> 01:53:33,830
why didn't you respond to that email?

2585
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:34,850
And he's like,
look,

2586
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:35,380
I,
you know,

2587
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:37,610
I came home and spend time with my 
family is like,

2588
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:39,020
look,
there's no excuse.

2589
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:40,580
Check your email,
check your numbers.

2590
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:42,650
Like what the fuck kind of a job have I 
gotten.

2591
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:44,830
That's not the definition of a civilized
society.

2592
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,730
Isn't that what's going on with trump 
testing?

2593
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:49,790
Because if someone's telling you that 
you can't smoke a joint after work,

2594
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:51,950
what they're telling you is they own 
your body,

2595
01:53:52,150 --> 01:53:55,190
their own your body.
Because if you smoke a joint at 9:00

2596
01:53:55,191 --> 01:53:57,650
at night and you go to work at 9:00
in the morning,

2597
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:59,540
guess what?
That joints gone.

2598
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:00,460
It doesn't.
The,

2599
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:02,150
the,
the effects don't linger.

2600
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:05,000
Quite frankly,
the employer has a greater basis.

2601
01:54:05,001 --> 01:54:10,001
If you come to work Monday,
nine morning hung over because that may 

2602
01:54:10,001 --> 01:54:13,740
of way have been.
If you've been up all night because you 

2603
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:15,740
were in pain or having a fight with your
wife or your kid was sick,

2604
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:20,800
that may affect work performance,
but the fact that you smoked a joint on 

2605
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,140
a Saturday or do something else and 
you're finding a Monday,

2606
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,490
none of their damn business.

2607
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:25,610
This is ultimately about sovereignty of 
our own minds and bodies.

2608
01:54:25,611 --> 01:54:30,611
Right?
I mean the core principle right here is 

2609
01:54:30,611 --> 01:54:32,030
that we're all sovereign over our own 
minds and bodies and that my boss,

2610
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:37,031
my government has no power to tell me 
what I do to my own body or in my own 

2611
01:54:37,161 --> 01:54:39,260
mind so long as I am not hurting another
soul.

2612
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:41,780
That has to be the core principle of a 
free society.

2613
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:46,990
Not only that,
it's the same sort of argument with wwe 

2614
01:54:46,990 --> 01:54:50,170
in respect to doing crimes when you're 
on these drugs like the crimes 

2615
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:55,061
themselves or the issue and the 
punishment should be in relation to the 

2616
01:54:55,061 --> 01:54:58,901
crimes.
They should have absolutely nothing to 

2617
01:54:58,901 --> 01:54:59,170
do with what substance caused you to do 
the crime.

2618
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:04,240
Exactly.
That's exactly my you on this thing and 

2619
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:04,240
said if you used drugs and you don't 
hurt a soul,

2620
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:04,670
that's none of the government's 
business.

2621
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:08,390
If you use drugs and you go out and hurt
somebody,

2622
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:11,630
well the fact that you use drugs so that
you were addicted,

2623
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:16,810
right?
You'd have to be held just as 

2624
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:16,810
accountable,
right?

2625
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:18,971
Somebody's drug addiction.
It cannot be an excuse that it will 

2626
01:55:18,971 --> 01:55:19,040
allow them to do harm to others.
That said,

2627
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:24,100
and there's a little position in the 
middle that if a judge in his wisdom or 

2628
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:28,091
somebody else decides that you hurt this
person and it was driven by your drug 

2629
01:55:28,091 --> 01:55:32,441
addiction and decides that you should go
to some treatment program instead of 

2630
01:55:32,441 --> 01:55:35,621
jail because that's better for you and 
better for society than that might be 

2631
01:55:35,621 --> 01:55:39,281
the reasonable compromise,
but ultimately people need to be held 

2632
01:55:39,281 --> 01:55:42,971
responsible for their actions.
Is affects other people that were very 

2633
01:55:42,971 --> 01:55:44,520
well put,
the compromise

2634
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,560
and.
But it's very difficult to leave that in

2635
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:47,770
the hands of the judges because when 
you.

2636
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:52,340
The judges impose their own moral ideas 
and attached the.

2637
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:55,920
I mean there's been so many instances.
Just really recently there was a guy who

2638
01:55:55,921 --> 01:56:00,921
got in a fight with his girlfriend's ex 
boyfriend and beat him up and the judge 

2639
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,730
told him that if he didn't want to go to
jail,

2640
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:04,540
he had to marry the girl.
Like,

2641
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:08,520
who the fuck is this judge?
And here's another one where this guy,

2642
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:10,860
this young boy,
he was 19 years old,

2643
01:56:10,861 --> 01:56:14,730
he was on this social media application.
It's called hot or not.

2644
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:20,090
Were you?
Someone decides whether or not they 

2645
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:20,090
think you're hot.
I heard it.

2646
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:20,090
Yeah.
So he,

2647
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:20,370
uh,
contacts this girl,

2648
01:56:20,371 --> 01:56:23,100
she's 17,
goes and drives to her house,

2649
01:56:23,101 --> 01:56:25,110
has sex with her.
It turns out she's 14.

2650
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:28,590
So now he's locked up.
They put them in this,

2651
01:56:28,591 --> 01:56:30,930
uh,
this database as a sex offender.

2652
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:32,560
Yeah.
And one of the,

2653
01:56:32,590 --> 01:56:37,590
the judge,
one of the judge's statements is that 

2654
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:40,730
sex should be something that people do 
when they're in love and that it should 

2655
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:42,930
be this very important thing to sacred 
thing.

2656
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:48,110
And you shouldn't be involved in these 
social media things where you just go 

2657
01:56:48,110 --> 01:56:48,660
around fucking each other.
Like,

2658
01:56:48,661 --> 01:56:50,130
who the fuck is it?

2659
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:52,570
Tell Ya we haven't.
My for drug policy alliance,

2660
01:56:52,571 --> 01:56:57,571
the problem with drug court judges,
I mean some of these guys are doing the 

2661
01:56:57,571 --> 01:57:00,931
Lord's work,
but so many of them are simply imposing 

2662
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:00,931
their own moralistic views about drug 
use.

2663
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:01,240
They're telling people,
okay,

2664
01:57:01,241 --> 01:57:04,270
I won't send you to prison as long as 
you clean and sober for the rest of your

2665
01:57:04,271 --> 01:57:05,980
life for as long as you're under my 
supervision.

2666
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:11,160
And if somebody wants to smoke a joint,
that becomes a basis for taking away 

2667
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:11,560
their freedom.
So there's something fundamentally wrong

2668
01:57:11,561 --> 01:57:16,561
with assuming that judges who are not 
trained in these areas who have their 

2669
01:57:16,561 --> 01:57:18,500
own biases and prejudices should be 
determining the quality.

2670
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:23,510
You know how people live a life when 
they haven't done anything to hurt 

2671
01:57:23,510 --> 01:57:23,510
anybody else,

2672
01:57:23,510 --> 01:57:27,030
comes down to human beings being put in 
positions of power over other human 

2673
01:57:27,401 --> 01:57:30,730
beings and once you can dictate what 
happens to that person's freedom.

2674
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:36,060
That's intoxicating feeling to a lot of 
these guys and they or gals and they 

2675
01:57:36,131 --> 01:57:41,131
just choose to impose their own 
viewpoints on that person because they 

2676
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:42,010
can.
Because they gets.

2677
01:57:42,190 --> 01:57:47,190
That's how they get their rocks off so 
that that's how they avoid their own 

2678
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:51,031
existential angst.
That's how they avoid their own 

2679
01:57:51,031 --> 01:57:52,440
depression by imposing power over these 
other people.

2680
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:53,800
It's judge Judy,
right?

2681
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:54,620
I mean that's.
That's.

2682
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:58,480
That's the whole show is that she's 
allowed to be.

2683
01:57:58,481 --> 01:57:58,660
Yeah,

2684
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:01,460
the most Venal of all the actors,
but we're talking about the role,

2685
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:04,260
which money is driving the prison 
industrial complex in what you're saying

2686
01:58:04,261 --> 01:58:09,261
about judges,
the worst of all the actors or the 

2687
01:58:09,261 --> 01:58:09,840
prosecutors,
those guys,

2688
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:13,350
because it's all about power.
It's about interpersonal power.

2689
01:58:13,351 --> 01:58:15,660
It's about power within the criminal 
justice system.

2690
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:20,810
For many of them,
it's about making a name for themselves 

2691
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:20,810
by beating up people and thereby,
you know,

2692
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:23,460
running for politics and ultimately it's
not money.

2693
01:58:23,461 --> 01:58:28,461
In many cases it's about power,
power and showing how effective you've 

2694
01:58:28,561 --> 01:58:30,260
been as a prosecutor.
Kit

2695
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:32,980
My record and then that sense,
I liken it to sports.

2696
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:36,610
I think the real problem with 
prosecution and even with police,

2697
01:58:36,910 --> 01:58:39,130
is that it becomes a winning and losing 
thing.

2698
01:58:39,131 --> 01:58:40,930
If the guy got off,
you lost.

2699
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:46,080
Not that the guy was innocent.
It's not that you were incorrect in 

2700
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,901
assuming that he had broken the law and 
should be punished by the laws of our 

2701
01:58:48,901 --> 01:58:49,930
society,
by the rules that we've agreed to govern

2702
01:58:49,931 --> 01:58:50,710
ourselves by.
No,

2703
01:58:50,711 --> 01:58:50,950
no,
no.

2704
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:56,070
It's a game.
It's a game like basketball that's 

2705
01:58:56,070 --> 01:58:56,070
driven game.

2706
01:58:56,070 --> 01:58:59,770
We've decided in America that we're 
going to have an adversarial system of 

2707
01:58:59,770 --> 01:58:59,770
justice.
Right?

2708
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:00,250
That's a good way of putting it and,
and,

2709
01:59:00,290 --> 01:59:02,690
but what happens of course is that most 
of the power,

2710
01:59:02,691 --> 01:59:07,691
unless you're rich,
is in the hands of the government and 

2711
01:59:07,691 --> 01:59:07,691
the prosecutor.
It's why poor people are getting.

2712
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:12,870
Look,
why does America have the highest 

2713
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:12,870
incarceration rate in the world?
Why do we have the highest incarceration

2714
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:15,410
rate of any democratic society in 
history?

2715
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:20,500
Why do we lock up more black people at a
rate that forest [inaudible] the rates 

2716
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:20,960
of incarceration is Soviet gulags in the
thirties,

2717
01:59:20,961 --> 01:59:21,890
forties,
and fifties.

2718
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:27,130
In part it's because we have an 
adversarial system that's fundamentally 

2719
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:29,891
broken and we're the cops and the 
prosecutors drive this thing 

2720
01:59:29,891 --> 01:59:33,701
overwhelmingly,
and we're a few are the typical person 

2721
01:59:33,701 --> 01:59:34,250
in that system who doesn't have money to
hire a good lawyer.

2722
01:59:34,251 --> 01:59:39,251
Stuff like that,
you are going to be removed and you're 

2723
01:59:39,251 --> 01:59:39,590
going to be caught in a system where you
may never escape it.

2724
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:44,770
You know why America,
we didn't use to be where we had a 

2725
01:59:44,770 --> 01:59:48,310
incarceration rate that was basically at
the world average for most of our 

2726
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,951
history,
but the last 40 years we went ape shit 

2727
01:59:50,951 --> 01:59:51,380
in terms of locking people up in this 
country,

2728
01:59:51,381 --> 01:59:56,381
especially black people.
That's the thing we have to fight to 

2729
01:59:56,381 --> 01:59:59,411
pull back from.
That's where we have to undermine the 

2730
01:59:59,411 --> 02:00:01,481
power of the of the money driven 
interest at corporations and the prison 

2731
02:00:01,481 --> 02:00:05,201
guard unions.
It's where we have to challenge the 

2732
02:00:05,201 --> 02:00:05,201
abuse of power by,
by,

2733
02:00:05,201 --> 02:00:05,201
by,
by,

2734
02:00:05,201 --> 02:00:09,280
by judges and especially with 
prosecutors and they have to be pulled 

2735
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:13,481
back in a major way and the sheriffs I 
should say because in California got to 

2736
02:00:13,481 --> 02:00:17,321
sheriffs who are the ones trying to 
build new jails and keep marijuana 

2737
02:00:17,321 --> 02:00:20,951
illegal and all this sort of stuff.
That grows in judgment of power in the 

2738
02:00:20,951 --> 02:00:25,391
hands of people whose job it is to take 
away people's freedom and to use no 

2739
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:29,891
judgment and the ways they do that or 
minimal judgment and the presumption 

2740
02:00:29,891 --> 02:00:30,890
that if you violate a law,
you have to lose your freedom.

2741
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,620
That's what screwed things up so badly 
in our society.

2742
02:00:33,650 --> 02:00:37,070
That's the movement we're trying to 
build to Ed and on that joke.

2743
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:38,570
I got to go to the next meeting.

2744
02:00:38,570 --> 02:00:39,560
Beautiful.
You nailed it.

2745
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:41,120
Thank you sir.
Really appreciate it.

2746
02:00:41,121 --> 02:00:42,860
Let's do this again.
When are you when you're in town?

2747
02:00:42,861 --> 02:00:47,861
Often I come to town fairly often.
I may be back here in October with a 

2748
02:00:47,861 --> 02:00:49,010
ballot initiative in California coming 
up in 2016.

2749
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:54,280
You know,
so I'm here a lot and let's do it in 

2750
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:54,280
October man.
Come on back.

2751
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,310
Let's work on that ballot initiative to 
get people active.

2752
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:56,360
Sounds good.
Thank you Ethan.

2753
02:00:56,361 --> 02:00:57,230
Really,
really appreciate it.

2754
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,890
Great to meet you.
Great to meet you too.

2755
02:00:58,891 --> 02:00:59,900
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

2756
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,480
Alright fuckers.
See you soon.

2757
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:04,100
Was Fun.
That was great.
