1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,290
Yes,
and we're live.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,090
Welcome back,
Mr Wood.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,030
Thanks for having me buddy.
It could.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,680
It's been a wild year for people who
don't know.

5
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,960
Michael was a former,
um,

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,823
you were.
Well,

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,630
you never really a former marine,
right?

8
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,130
Isn't that one of those things where
you're a marine,

9
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:18,970
you stay marine.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,150
I don't quite buy that.
If I,

11
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:23,880
if I would have stayed maybe,
but uh,

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,870
for the Marines who agree with that.
Okay.

13
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:26,190
You were

14
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,080
marine,
a former sergeant in the Baltimore

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,440
Police Department and he came on the
podcast a while back and expose some

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,040
pretty eyeopening information about how
the whole system sort of works in this

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,350
sort of a kind of a closed loop in,
in Baltimore where the same

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,580
neighborhoods are having the same kind
of crime in the same sort of scenarios

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,270
over and over again.
And that was a really important podcasts

20
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:01,090
for me and it was really important
podcast for a lot of people that listen

21
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:06,091
to it because they got exposed to the
inner workings of police departments by

22
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:07,900
someone who's,
you know,

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,810
I was really happy how honest you were
about all of it.

24
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:15,720
About the thrill of chasing people and
uh,

25
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:20,721
all of all the cool stuff about it and
we scheduled this podcast quite a while

26
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:26,151
ago and it's kind of crazy that you're
coming in the weekend after these insane

27
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,910
shootings in Orlando and I'm,
I'm absolutely not happy that that

28
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:33,990
happened,
but I'm happy.

29
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,050
Is happy as I could be that your here
while this is all going down and we get

30
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:43,680
to kind of talk about
these,

31
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,050
these moments,
these insane moments that happen.

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,880
It seems like every few months or so,
some new insane moment happens where

33
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:56,881
some person,
usually a man blows a fuse and winds up

34
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:59,560
killing a ton of people.

35
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,790
I don't know what,
if anything,

36
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,830
and I'm hoping maybe you'll have some
insight.

37
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,370
What if anything could ever be done to
stop something like this?

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,993
Well,

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,080
this is where we get into the Mike
Rhodes a dirty liberal thing and we're

40
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,900
going to start talking about gun control
because I don't know what else we can

41
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:25,510
talk about.
Your only other option is to continue a

42
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:29,070
cycle of more and more force upon one
another.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,640
So what we know for sure without a doubt
that the path we're on,

44
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,440
it is only a matter of time before this
record is broken.

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,610
Right?
So what we're doing will result in that,

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,880
but we have this anti-intellectualism in
America that just won't take that

47
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:51,951
evidence and apply it to what we know is
going to be the end result like it.

48
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,590
We have countries that have done gun
control,

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,830
they don't have mass shootings,
we have mass shootings literally on the

50
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,440
daily in America.
You just don't hear about them all.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,800
So when a mass shooting is generally
characterized three or four more

52
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,060
casually,
something like that.

53
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,240
But this happens every day in the cities
doesn't really.

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,280
Yeah.
You don't hear about it when it's a

55
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:15,430
backyard barbecue shooting in the right.
Yeah.

56
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,150
So that you can think of that.
Um,

57
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,220
a lot of people don't categorize those
as mass shootings because think of mass

58
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:24,460
shootings is someone going into a
crowded place and killing a bunch of

59
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,130
civilians or innocent people I should
say.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Whereas they think of those kinds of
shootings in the hood as rival gangs,

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,390
people competing over drug dealing
territory.

62
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,780
Things along those lines,
which is another point because you were

63
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,900
running for you,
you wanted to be the head of police of

64
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,880
Chicago.
Is that still going on?

65
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,070
No,
I mean they certainly,

66
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,740
uh,
the corruption went in and uh,

67
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:54,340
so we can tell that story real quick.
What they did is they did a national

68
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:58,170
search,
so the laws in Chicago said that this

69
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,450
appointed police board has to do a
nationwide search and then they give

70
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,290
three names to the mayor.

71
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,100
The mayor investigates those people and
then chooses one.

72
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,100
So I predicted they weren't going to go
with me.

73
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:17,101
I'm too far ahead still that no one's
really ready to take that bite yet,

74
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,960
but it's still something we could have
talked about and they would have had the

75
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:22,800
opportunity.
I figured they would pick that,

76
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,790
uh,
that I figured they'd pick a black guy

77
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,970
who was educated and not from Chicago.
That was my prediction.

78
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,280
And that's who the police board did
choose.

79
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:38,281
They chose a guy from Atlanta who fit
that bill to the t.

80
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,380
He was going to be
the black guy that represents the police

81
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:48,340
department but still totes their line.
I'm thinking of a word that everybody

82
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,280
knows and I'm just not saying it so you
can all pick up on what I'm suggesting.

83
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:55,030
You're saying uncle Tom and people have
an uncle Tom,

84
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,520
but he's a nice guy,
so if you have an uncle and his name's

85
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,420
Tom,
don't worry about it.

86
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,280
So that's what they're gonna.
Look for something that will visually

87
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,180
seems satisfying.
I see instructionally be exactly the

88
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:12,181
same.
So they chose that guy and the mayor

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,320
still said,
yeah,

90
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,950
I don't know what that guy I want you
was this guy that didn't even apply and

91
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,700
that skews the commissioner.
So who is this guy that didn't imply he

92
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:25,990
was a couple of ranks down.
I'm already in the agency.

93
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,110
He is a.
He said that he has never seen

94
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:33,320
misconduct or corruption in the Chicago
Police Department and his entire 20 some

95
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:38,321
year career,
he is intimately tied into a cheating

96
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,020
scandal,
a promotional test.

97
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,750
Another thing that you could solve
easily.

98
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:48,751
So his friends like wife or something
got number one,

99
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,070
the lieutenant's test,
which is extremely a qualifying.

100
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,100
So say.
And as soon as the information comes

101
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:03,440
down that he actually was the one that
was developing the tests,

102
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,560
had the answers,
and then she gets this super high score

103
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,780
out of nowhere is when everybody says,
oh,

104
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:10,040
come on,
we've seen this before,

105
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,960
we know what it is,
so you can solve it.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,220
You could retest them.
Right.

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,440
And see who does it.
But at first of course not.

108
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,990
So they're not going to do that.
Did they have any interest in exposing

109
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,550
thing?
So if I'm going to come in there and I'm

110
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,780
going to say,
all right,

111
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,100
that's it.
We're going to be transparent,

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,140
I don't think there.
Okay.

113
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,170
So now when you say that you were a
little too far ahead,

114
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,420
what do you mean by that?
Well,

115
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:34,421
it seems the people of a city or of any
area have to be pushed hard enough to,

116
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,940
to have that change.
Like they have to have that breaking

117
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,630
point where they say that's it.
We're going to do something different.

118
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
Because what I really push is for
civilian controlled policing.

119
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:52,160
I want you guys to tell me what what
should be done,

120
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,640
which is a huge drop in power,
so that's.

121
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,740
That would require a mayor that's
willing to give in to the people that

122
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,690
have pushed hard enough to say,
look,

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,580
I'm going to relinquish control of my
essential armed wing and I'm going to

124
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:09,380
give it to the people,
and so it's been done before.

125
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,030
Not that I'm aware of.
Not In America.

126
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,430
It's certainly hasn't.
So who's going to be the city that takes

127
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,540
that leap?
It has to come.

128
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,920
It has to.
We all know it,

129
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,510
so it's a matter of fact.

130
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,320
Well,
what they've tried to do in some areas

131
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:24,321
like in New Jersey in particular,
is force these people to integrate more

132
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,390
into the community,
make them walk the beat,

133
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,480
which is not like,
you don't hear about that anymore.

134
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:34,680
Now everyone's in a car and you're
driving around this closed up vehicle.

135
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,010
Whereas before everybody was walking
around and you were sort of like,

136
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:39,510
oh,
there's officer Mike,

137
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,800
you know,
he's a part of the community and they

138
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,430
get it.
It became normal to see these people,

139
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,760
they develop friendships with the people
that were in their neighborhood that

140
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:49,950
they were patrolling and it's sort of
ingrained.

141
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,570
She hated them more.
I think having a bunch of people that

142
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:57,750
you don't know,
patrolling your streets with guns in a

143
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:01,450
car just driving around and you know,
hardly ever getting out and

144
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,640
they're arresting somebody.
That's a little odd,

145
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:06,110
right?
Well yeah,

146
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:11,111
but I don't see that the foot patrol is
the solution to that because what they

147
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,640
do is they put a facade on it so they
make it look like foot patrol,

148
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,560
but it still has his essential
underpinnings of,

149
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,530
of being motivated to go and make
arrests and to get the stats.

150
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,420
So I did four patrol for like six months
and that's what it was.

151
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,120
It was just being thrown into get drug
arrests.

152
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:36,050
I didn't know anybody or meet anybody.
It was still those same pushing to get

153
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:36,980
somebody,
put them in a,

154
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,630
in a prison cell,
do the paperwork,

155
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:43,250
go back out and do it again.
So what we really need is to change the

156
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:47,600
incentives and disincentives so that no
matter what the role,

157
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:50,810
we're still going towards that objective
that actually serves you.

158
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,913
Right?

159
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,020
I had Dave Smith and the other day,
excuse me,

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,510
I'm Dave Smith,
who is a hilarious standup comedian and

161
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:01,500
he's also a on this podcast called
Legion of skanks and he's a libertarian,

162
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,060
very smart guy,
but he was,

163
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,680
he was bringing up a point about New
York after the shootings in New York

164
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,910
where a bunch of cops had gotten shot.
Um,

165
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,850
um,
there was this sort of a cool off period

166
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:19,851
where they had just stopped arresting
people for Bullshit and the bullshit

167
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,540
arrests,
like loose cigarettes,

168
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,930
things along those lines just dropped
substantially.

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,020
And people were really excited about
that.

170
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,651
They were like,
look,

171
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,070
this is like a good step.
Like,

172
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:33,360
this is really how it should be.
The police shouldn't be glorified

173
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:38,361
revenue collectors just arresting people
for the taxes last on loose cigarettes.

174
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,190
And that's what killed Eric Gardner.
Right?

175
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,330
Precisely.
Yeah.

176
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,380
I mean,
it's disgusting.

177
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,960
It's not,
it's not policing because not hurting

178
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,950
anybody.
Policing should be protecting and

179
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:50,880
serving.
Right.

180
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,010
I'm really glad that you brought up that
instance in New York,

181
00:09:55,011 --> 00:10:00,011
so what that is is direct evidence
against what the head of the FBI has

182
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,770
said Komi who's coming in these pushing
this ferguson effect,

183
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,410
right?
So the idea around there saying,

184
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,850
oh,
we have crime going up in these

185
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:10,730
different neighborhoods because there's
this ferguson effect that the cops are

186
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:14,240
laying back so they're not being as
proactive and because they're not being

187
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,700
as proactive,
then they're not locking people up.

188
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,760
So.
So stats are going up and we know that

189
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:24,380
if you have a theory and there's one
situation that says your theories

190
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,990
complete crap when your theory theories
complete crap,

191
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,300
and that's what New York was.
So New York,

192
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,180
they step back and they want it to be
like,

193
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,770
oh,
look how much you need us.

194
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,480
And didn't show that the stats showed
lower crime.

195
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,990
They had less calls for service.
Everybody was happier with what was

196
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:46,991
going on because that is,
we want to say that policing should

197
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:50,990
prevent things and it's just not
possible.

198
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,940
Police are there to clean things up and
to investigate after the fact.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,540
Every arrest should be viewed as a
failure of the system.

200
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,870
We shouldn't praise and arrest.
That is when we failed.

201
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,570
That's an interesting way of looking at
it.

202
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,740
I think

203
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,130
another way to look at it that's maybe
more a more common ground is your

204
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,350
fucking with people.
When you're.

205
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:14,300
When you're around them all the time and
you're like,

206
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:15,590
what's going on over there?
Boys?

207
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,390
You know like that kind of shit.
You're fucking with them.

208
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:21,010
You create intention.
Intention creates arguments.

209
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:23,030
It creates crime.
It creates resentment.

210
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:26,360
It creates anger.
All those things contribute to crime 100

211
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:30,350
percent and when you fuck with people
over loose cigarettes or any sort of

212
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,330
nonsense,
petty crime that nobody gives a shit

213
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:34,590
about.
That kind of stuff isn't.

214
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,630
It's not good for anybody.
It's not good for the relationship that

215
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,400
police have with citizens.
It's not good for the perception of the

216
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:43,190
citizens of,
of the way they view the police.

217
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,310
You make some view the police as these,
these thugs

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,120
which citizens though a significant
amount and the citizens in this country

219
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:53,900
very much like that.
The fact that police do that well did

220
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,190
they don't live there,
right?

221
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,580
But if they were poor and they lived in
those communities,

222
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:00,700
they wouldn't feel like you always do
this.

223
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:04,210
You hit on these big issues because
you're just like,

224
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:05,230
well wait,
this is obvious.

225
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:10,231
It's right in front of our face and what
they're doing is they are funded and you

226
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,780
know,
so you have a mayor in Baltimore,

227
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,930
the mayor directs the police
department's a way,

228
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,890
no matter what city you're in,
and what that person is doing is they're

229
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,870
serving those,
those rich people,

230
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,170
they're serving,
uh,

231
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,220
the mass voters of the area who just had
that mentality still that they want

232
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:32,620
those animals caged in sentiment and to
keep them there.

233
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,730
So as long as it doesn't affect us,
then who cares?

234
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,570
Right.
That's really what you're hitting on

235
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,580
there is that they,
I don't know that more of this country

236
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,270
doesn't want our police to be that way.
I think they are happy about it.

237
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,710
I think you're probably right,
but I think they're misinformed and I

238
00:12:55,711 --> 00:13:00,711
think they have this,
this incorrect understanding of how that

239
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:05,370
affects the people that these cops are
interacting with and that that it

240
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:09,150
actually does probably create more crime
and then on top of that,

241
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,830
I think there's also the problem with
those people that are in those poor

242
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:18,090
communities could just as easily be Uri,
if we were born into those situations

243
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,480
and we were talking about giving people
an opportunity to get out,

244
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,510
given people a possibility to get out
and do better and improve their

245
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:29,130
situation,
their standing in life,

246
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,170
well,
if they're getting fucked with all the

247
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:32,460
time,
that's not going to happen.

248
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:37,230
If they're in a terrible poverty laden
crime laden community,

249
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,960
good luck with that.
Good luck getting out of that.

250
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:44,961
It becomes almost insurmountable and I
think it's real convenient for people to

251
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,120
be outside of that and and look at those
folks and go,

252
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,680
well,
those people need to stop doing crime.

253
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,450
What you need to do is just lock them
all up.

254
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,120
Well,
that doesn't seem to make sense.

255
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:59,121
It seems much more likely that the best
way to handle that is to lock them up

256
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:04,431
less and to sort of somehow or another
try to calm that area down and I don't

257
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,220
know how you would do it.
I mean,

258
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,020
whether it's through some universal
basic income idea,

259
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:13,530
which I've been paying a lot of
attention to that lately and trying to

260
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,010
explore those ideas and see if I can
read my own,

261
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,150
call me a socialist and you're talking
about minimum.

262
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,620
It wasn't my idea.
It was.

263
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,120
It was an idea that Eddie Huang brought
up on the podcast and I initially

264
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,180
laughed at him.
I was like,

265
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,160
nobody's going to fucking go for that.
And then I started reading some articles

266
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:32,670
on it and I started thinking about it
and financially the issue is where's

267
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,610
that money come from?
And you're obviously gonna.

268
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,490
It's a shit ton of money that's going to
have to somehow or another come out of

269
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,200
something else.
And I'm not A.

270
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm not a financial person.
I don't understand the economy.

271
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:48,690
I'm not an economist so I'm not the
person to do the numbers,

272
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:52,460
but when I think about it like
objectively

273
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,550
as far as from a social stance,
when people have less problems,

274
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:02,330
when bills are paid easier,
when they're more relaxed as far as like

275
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,620
where food's coming from,
where you know,

276
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,690
what basic needs are covered,
they're less likely to commit crime.

277
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,720
So it just makes sense that you would
have to spend less money on law

278
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,470
enforcement,
less money on prisons,

279
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:19,400
less money on jails,
and that perhaps that could translate.

280
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,730
There was a great article written by,
see if you could find A.

281
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,380
Jamie's is some prominent libertarian
who wrote this piece about universal

282
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:32,381
basic income is the idea is essentially
giving people $13,000 a year that if you

283
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:37,010
give Americans through essentially a
thousand bucks plus a month and that if

284
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:40,790
you did that,
you would take care of a shitload of

285
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,610
problems that we have in inner cities
and crime and all this.

286
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,400
And he a sort of outlined it and made a,
a,

287
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,960
a pretty interesting case for this idea.

288
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,620
Um,
but of course you've got a lot of people

289
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,720
that want to go on and on about welfare
babies and,

290
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:00,320
and,
and people that are juking the system

291
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:03,070
and buying cigarettes with food stamps
and you know,

292
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,130
things along those lines,
but it's like this callous sort of

293
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:10,880
approach to dealing with really poor
people in really bad neighborhoods.

294
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,390
And one of the things that you brought
up about Baltimore that made it so

295
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:19,391
disturbing was that black people had to
buy houses in these areas.

296
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:23,630
They would not sell houses in certain
areas to black people.

297
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,020
And that this was like a law.
And this was actually written.

298
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:29,240
Dennis was not,
not like everybody conspired.

299
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,870
This was something that they actively
set out to do.

300
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,741
They,
the,

301
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,750
this idea of caging them,
keeping them in,

302
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,410
they,
they,

303
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,440
they literally did that through
paperwork.

304
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,060
Right?
And that's a,

305
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,870
so things that you're talking about and
like that sociologists that has that

306
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,704
study,
we,

307
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,030
we know these things.

308
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,060
So what you're observing is things that
the scholarly community has known for a

309
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:57,500
long time and is trying to,
to get these things out there so that

310
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,530
people understand this.
It's not even a matter of how much is

311
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:05,180
this going to cost because we're already
spending the money that we're spending a

312
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:07,730
lot more this book,
this is why I brought it with me because

313
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:10,100
I just finished going through it.
It was just put out.

314
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,170
So this is by a Johns Hopkins researcher
and Stefanie Deluca who's a friend of

315
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:15,741
mine,
you know,

316
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:20,060
so everybody knows that I am saying it,
but she,

317
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,410
they did a study,
they followed Baltimore youth around for

318
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,330
well over a decade.
I think it was like 15,

319
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:31,250
16 years and their path that they go
through and part of that was it costs

320
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:35,810
$27,
billion dollars to America every single

321
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,890
year for disconnected youth.
So that's just youth that don't have a

322
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:43,280
drive and don't have a focus or how is
that,

323
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:44,050
um,
money?

324
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,420
How does it trickle down so they don't
chase things,

325
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,750
right?
So you get stuck in this,

326
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,280
this,
this idea

327
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,520
that you can't escape this neighborhood
because we have so many blockades in the

328
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,530
way.
There are stories that go through.

329
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,240
They track like a hundred and some
people,

330
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,190
parents having kids in these
neighborhoods.

331
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:06,600
And moving them out and what happened to
them and the two biggest pushers for the

332
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:11,601
success of these have any kid in these
cities was that they had an identity

333
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:15,840
project,
which means they're finding their

334
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:19,800
passion and what they're going to go
towards because they don't know these

335
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:23,280
passions.
They don't know that a photographer like

336
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,710
Devin Allen,
who a friend of mine in Baltimore can,

337
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,790
can come out and do things for their
community and can actually achieve that

338
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,280
dream.
So once they see it and it's possible

339
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,940
and you start taking the hurdles down,
like the hurdles of where they live and

340
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:40,690
the hurdles of the arrest for the bag of
weed or for,

341
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,573
like you said,
the,

342
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,630
the talking yourself into jail because
the cops messing with you every single

343
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,730
day and you're saturated with police in
these neighborhoods.

344
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,770
You start taking down these barriers and
these kids excel and it goes completely

345
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,970
against the narrative that we're hearing
that these kids don't have motivation

346
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,570
and they can't push out.
Eighty percent of these kids that grow

347
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:04,020
up in the city never touched the streets
or have anything to do with it.

348
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,350
They're getting high school degrees at
four or 500 percent.

349
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,010
The rate of their parents,
it's just that what we keep doing is we

350
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:14,040
keep getting them behind and they're
still fighting super hard,

351
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,890
but we're still throwing more and more
hurdles in their wet,

352
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,390
so the money that you're talking about
how much it costs for these disconnected

353
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:26,110
use.
This is all in prisons.

354
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,750
This isn't even phrase it.
What is.

355
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,230
This is just the lack of their product
productivity from achieving what they

356
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:37,231
can achieve and what it's costing us to
then take care of of what the fallout is

357
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,230
in that,
that,

358
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:43,090
that just that microcosm.
We're not throwing in locking up

359
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,980
everybody else.
We're not throwing in the parents.

360
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:46,420
We're not throwing in all this other
stuff.

361
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,580
Just youth that don't have a passion.

362
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,730
Well,
this is one of the subjects that come up

363
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,450
over and over again on this podcast
because I've always tried to figure out

364
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,380
what it is that keeps people from trying
to socially engineer these,

365
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
these environments and make them better
for the people that live there.

366
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,560
Like we're always concentrating on all
these other countries.

367
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:13,561
We're concentrating on helping
Afghanistan and rebuilding Iraq and all

368
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,870
the stuff that we do,
humanitarian efforts all over the world.

369
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,610
Right.
What about our own inner city?

370
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,840
I think they do.
I think they're misguided,

371
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:26,050
so what we end up doing is we have this
idea that we're rich and often white and

372
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:32,201
we're going to come in and we're going
to have the handout or we're going to

373
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,390
give them what we want.
We're going to show them the right way

374
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,920
and that's not the answer.
The answer is to ask what they want and

375
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:43,370
provide the structure and platform for
that to take place.

376
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
So when these smart people that haven't
been there,

377
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,380
they'll look at stats and they'll look
at the paperwork and they'll say,

378
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,080
oh,
we just need to move people out and

379
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:55,390
relocate them,
or we need to.

380
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,560
The idea was,
all right,

381
00:20:56,561 --> 00:21:00,670
well we'll put them in this big tower
and we're have resources around them and

382
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,890
everything will be fine and we're making
sure they have their own police

383
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:05,110
department so everything will be will be
good,

384
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:07,900
but then the police started locking
everybody up and you just.

385
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,960
You get into that cycle again because
you're not giving the identity project

386
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,660
even to adults,
adults where you can say whether it's

387
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:19,840
comedy or whether it's photography or no
matter what,

388
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:24,280
you have to have that goal,
that vision because all they see is that

389
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:29,140
their future is in dealing or in a
prison cell and they keep being told

390
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:31,810
that if they do the right things they
can move on,

391
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:36,811
but when they do the right things are
sometimes good intentions have put up

392
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,390
the roadblocks that prevent them from
doing that.

393
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,840
So what but how do you.

394
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,100
You sort of engineer,
for lack of a better term,

395
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,270
a whole society.
Like how do you give them goals?

396
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:52,610
How do you,
how do you expose them to all these

397
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,430
possibilities

398
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,970
and how do you set up pass?
You just said the word expose.

399
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,120
They're isolated.
They don't know.

400
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,070
Right,
but how do you do that though?

401
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:07,071
I think social media is helping a ton so
they can see and interact with people

402
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,140
that are different from them and they
can see,

403
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,060
oh look,
this kid from New York,

404
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,590
he did get into this school and he has
this job now and now I can maybe go work

405
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:20,970
for his company or whatever it is.
They see these examples of success and

406
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:24,540
then they start to pick them up and
chase them and that's what these stats

407
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:29,541
and all this bookers showing that.
It's staggering how much effort these

408
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:34,851
kids are putting in to their goals.
It's just that we're actually setting up

409
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,210
the prevention of it by doing things
like,

410
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,120
oh,
okay.

411
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,060
We charge a black kid in the city.
You know,

412
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,200
you charge him.

413
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:51,180
He commits a homicide because he was
defending his sister from getting raped,

414
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,170
but when he gets a prison sentence,
we know that that prison sentence just

415
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:58,650
slams him.
But when it's a white kid from Sanford,

416
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,220
you know what happens.
So it's kind of this.

417
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,980
I don't want to push empathy all the
time,

418
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:06,840
but there is that,
that empathy angle,

419
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,950
but it's just kind of helping people get
where they want to get instead of

420
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:12,960
pushing them where you think they should
be.

421
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:16,140
They'll find their own paths.
It's like we treat poor people like

422
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:18,810
they're children and they're not.
They're poor people.

423
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,260
There's a dude who works at the comedy
store who was a criminal defense

424
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:28,730
attorney and he resigned.
He stopped doing it because he got tired

425
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,750
of his.
When he was bringing cases to trial.

426
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,360
If it was a white guy,
the white guy would get,

427
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:35,931
you know,
whatever,

428
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:40,340
six months for an identical crime,
a young black guy would get 10 years and

429
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,020
he was like,
you've got to.

430
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,930
Someone's got to tell me what the fuck
is going on here,

431
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,160
because all I'm looking at

432
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,430
is systematic racism.
I'm looking at institutional racism.

433
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,130
He was like,
this is just over and over and over

434
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,030
again.
I'm confronted by the same kind of

435
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,790
people,
the same age brackets,

436
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,980
but completely different types of
sentences.

437
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,450
And,
uh,

438
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,150
what's the mentality behind it?
And he said everybody wanted to just

439
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:04,880
bury their head head in the sand and he
couldn't do it anymore.

440
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,070
It was so strong.
I mean,

441
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,780
when the guy talks about he's like
smoking cigarettes and freaking out

442
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,310
because it was just a huge 10 years of
his life and it was just too much.

443
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:18,311
He couldn't do it anymore.
That kind of shit is almost

444
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,210
insurmountable when you.
You're living in that world and you are

445
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:27,020
one of those people that gets sent down
the river for 10 years for something

446
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:29,690
that you know,
if you were a white Irish kid,

447
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,620
you would get six months or you know,
a much lesser sentence.

448
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,510
That alone is got to be a gigantic
hurdle for someone living in these

449
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,640
environments.
And this is not saying that people

450
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:43,460
shouldn't be punished for crimes.
They definitely should be punished for

451
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,170
crimes.
But for sure about that,

452
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,720
they also should be punished.
Absolutely.

453
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,660
It should be our view for be our view.
Do you think they should do about

454
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,150
murder?
She punish them or just give him a hug?

455
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,430
It was certainly depend on the
situation,

456
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,080
but I can't help but keep coming back to
the fundamental idea that our criminal

457
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:04,250
justice system is based on punishment
like that.

458
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,900
It's not a moral system.
It's like the death penalty.

459
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,350
We know that these things don't work.
So now now do they get rights taken

460
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:15,180
away?
So what I would like to see is,

461
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,440
let's take for instance,
we know that it costs so-and-so

462
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,720
thousands of dollars a year to house.
Somebody thinks 24,000 depends on where

463
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:25,920
you are though.
So a college degree from an online

464
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:29,100
school that's accredited,
which we can all do easily right now

465
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,490
would cost way less than that.
So put them in a,

466
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,510
in a,
in a cell,

467
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,540
and you keep them around,
but you treat them like human beings.

468
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,410
You give them an identity,
a goal where they can achieve something

469
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:42,510
and they actually.
Because right now we send them into a

470
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:44,790
prison of punishment and what happens
when they come out,

471
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,200
they're in a worse situation.
So now we've created a greater criminal

472
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,670
than we had before.
So our goal is supposed to be some kind

473
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:57,540
of rehabilitation that this is a better
person when they leave than when they go

474
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,280
in.
But we have that in us.

475
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,020
We want these fuckers to pay.

476
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,720
Well,
certainly for murder,

477
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,210
I mean for the families of someone that
they victimized,

478
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,640
they don't want this person to come out
better.

479
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,690
Not even all victims feel that way
though,

480
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,963
you know,
and it,

481
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,920
it's so there are plenty of murder
victims who,

482
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,280
who their parents have gone and asked
for leniency for,

483
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,410
for the person,
or ask the not give him the death

484
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,290
penalty because that's pretty fucking
rare that it is.

485
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,161
Yes,
yes.

486
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,940
Most people want revenge,
but we have to look beyond that because

487
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,060
you know when,
when your sister gets in a fight and

488
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:32,310
killed your neighbor,
who's your friend or something like

489
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:34,170
that,
you're not asking for the death penalty.

490
00:26:34,171 --> 00:26:35,490
Right?
Because it's close to you.

491
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,500
Well,
the others,

492
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:41,460
we do that to others.
We wouldn't do that to the ones we know

493
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,080
well,
threats to society,

494
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,160
those.
That's the real

495
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,690
issue with some people,
White,

496
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:46,411
black,
whatever.

497
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:48,930
Someone's associate,
associate pass some as a psycho.

498
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,720
They're a threat to society,
like I'm the guy who killed all those

499
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,150
people in the theater in Denver.
That's a psycho.

500
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,460
I mean that.
That guy needs to be locked up forever.

501
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,733
Right?
Okay.

502
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,100
You don't need to know about it.
Well,

503
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,290
what do you do about a person like that?
I mean,

504
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,600
how do you.
How do you take a person like that and

505
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,720
you give them goals in prison?
Do you try to give them an education

506
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,563
mean?
Obviously,

507
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,020
think about that.
He could become,

508
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,840
not not him obviously saying he doesn't
mental illness,

509
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,290
but somebody else you could educate them
why they're there and they can

510
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,810
contribute to literature and contribute
to science.

511
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,420
They can give back to some society in
some way.

512
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,010
Is that financially feasible?
How much more money would it take to

513
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:28,160
make prison a safer environment for
people that are locked up?

514
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,880
I mean were the idea is that we're
supposed to be protecting the rest of us

515
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:34,370
from these people that have committed
these awful crimes,

516
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:36,020
right?
Someone's committed rape,

517
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,360
someone's committed murder or armed
robbery.

518
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,830
We separate them from us because we
don't want them to victimize anymore

519
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,010
people.
Then goal number two is rehabilitation

520
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:48,980
and that goal is overwhelmingly a
failure.

521
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,650
Overwhelmingly,
if you look at the statistics,

522
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:53,390
if we sit in,
it's been attempted.

523
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,130
Yeah,
that's a good point.

524
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,960
I mean,
we'll do our,

525
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,210
I mean Rick Ross,
the guy that we've had on before,

526
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,100
the real rick Ross,
not the rapper guy.

527
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,420
Um,
he,

528
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,770
I mean he learned how to read and
literally figured out what was wrong

529
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:08,600
with his case in prison.

530
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,790
Do that though.
A lot of them won't give them any access

531
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,820
at some do.
So there are wardens out there that are

532
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,500
progressive and are thinking of these
things.

533
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,920
So that shouldn't really be on the
warden.

534
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,510
Honda should be some sort of a standard
nationwide,

535
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:24,150
what we should look at it as a culture,
as a society,

536
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:26,100
as a civilization and say,
hey,

537
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:26,760
you know,
what,

538
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,390
what should we be trying to do to try to
make these people better people?

539
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,920
Right?
And you do that when you arrest them

540
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,890
though.
So what we say now is when he goes and

541
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,820
shoots or when someone rapes,
we're not looking at it at that as that

542
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:40,260
failure.
So if you,

543
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,900
if you were running this business and an
asset,

544
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:47,160
a facet of your business failed,
then you would want to have an analysis

545
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:48,420
and you would want to say,
all right,

546
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:51,510
let's do a regression and figure out
what went wrong and you would want to

547
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:54,360
fix that for the next time.
But we don't do that.

548
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:55,500
We just go,
all right,

549
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,620
throw that one away and continue.
Path is normal.

550
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,770
We shouldn't be so focused when we
arrest somebody to figure out how we're

551
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:05,580
going to throw them away from the
longest.

552
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:09,300
We should be figuring out why it
happened so we can prevent it for the

553
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:12,450
next person.
But it doesn't seem like we actually

554
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:16,080
care about solving the crime.
We're just keeping these wheels turning.

555
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,320
So if you commit murder than I want to
know why.

556
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,710
I want to know the scenarios that led
you up to that because the only way that

557
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,260
I can actually prevent that is not
minority report.

558
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,890
It's finding out what that hurdle was.
That moment that you said,

559
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:31,830
fuck this.
And finding ways to prevent that as much

560
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:33,720
as possible or reduce it for other
people.

561
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:39,070
Lot of it must have to do with the
developmental period that you go through

562
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:42,040
when you're a young person and what
you're exposed to as a small

563
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,030
child.
I mean that stuff becomes so deeply

564
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:51,031
ingrained in a person's mind to try to
reverse that boy is so much harder than

565
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,120
to try to race someone correctly the
first time.

566
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,940
All that's in this book,
they talk about that is coming of age in

567
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:01,630
the other America that they talk about
these things where that's one of the

568
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:06,580
predictors is how much exposure to
violence that these kids have had when

569
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:08,560
they were going between the ages of zero
and 10,

570
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,210
and so when they got them out of the
city and they gave him opportunities

571
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,920
than they got exposed to less violence.
The really crazy thing in this study is

572
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:22,000
that we found out that the kids that
were in this city that didn't get help,

573
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,300
they also fought their way out.
Actually a higher rate.

574
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,870
So we did these nice things and we have
to tweak it,

575
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,410
but like are nice things that we did
actually didn't pan out in the same

576
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:34,990
results as kids that were just fighting
on their own.

577
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,120
So explain that.
Yeah,

578
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:37,871
yeah.
It's wild.

579
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,900
So they had these housing voucher
programs where they would.

580
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,710
The idea was to take people out of those
neighborhoods and put them into nicer

581
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:48,640
neighborhoods where they would be
exposed to less things.

582
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:52,150
They would have neighbors around that
that did things that was very beneficial

583
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,270
when,
when that happened,

584
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,100
but about an equal percentage of those
kids went back,

585
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,340
ended up being in the low income areas
and get involved in to the streets.

586
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,200
And then the ones that fought themselves
out on their own ended up at a higher,

587
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,560
slightly higher percentage actually
getting out and being exposed to less

588
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:12,520
because of their own individual efforts
and the control group trying to get out

589
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:16,340
of there.
So while it says that the programs need

590
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,290
some tweaking,
but it shows that it's counter narrative

591
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,500
that these kids aren't trying and that
they're not succeeding to get out.

592
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:28,530
Like they are pushing super hard to make
something of themselves and our cultural

593
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,080
idea is like,
oh look at these kids are not doing

594
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:33,400
anything.
They're just turning to drugs and

595
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:36,610
they're just dealing and surprisingly
they're not.

596
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,860
It is a 12 percent of the kids raised in
Baltimore in this study ever spent and

597
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:45,520
these are in the worst neighborhoods.
It's east and West Baltimore ever spent

598
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:48,040
a moment on the streets doing any
criminal activity.

599
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,920
Twelve percent staggering.
I'm going to have shocked.

600
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,920
I feel dumb because I did the same
things like Yo.

601
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,520
So they're exposed to.
Right,

602
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:57,970
but it's not.
They're fighting out like crazy and

603
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:01,000
we're the ones stopping them from coming
to fruition.

604
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,120
Well not US society.
We're responsible,

605
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:06,380
right?
Like so what are we mean?

606
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,190
Here's the thing.
It's like how much effort is actually

607
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,640
being done to try to fix this?
I mean how many people are actually

608
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,490
thinking about it?
How much money is actually being spent

609
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:18,430
to try to fix this?
It seems like there's so many problems

610
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:23,200
in the world that to concentrate on bad
neighborhoods or crime ridden

611
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:26,860
neighborhoods,
it's so low on the list of things.

612
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,590
The world's worried about.
The polarized caps are melting.

613
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,590
Polar bears are drowning,
you know,

614
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,930
there's so much shit we're worried about
on top of that.

615
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,590
They're trying hard as hell to keep it
the way it is though and was trying

616
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,460
hard.
Governments are in Baltimore

617
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,720
for example,
there's this,

618
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,800
this patent,
that thing that I'm a professor from

619
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:49,380
Morgan state.
Lawrence Brown is really into this and

620
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,980
tracks it all down,
but there is a white l,

621
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,350
we call it the White Allen Baltimore.
It goes down through the rich

622
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,560
neighborhood and comes across to the
other rich neighborhoods by the bay and

623
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,100
then there's the black butterfly which
comes off to the sides East and West

624
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,490
Baltimore and it looks like butterfly
wings dispersing out poverty and black

625
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,850
people in the city and what this is in
every single aspect that you're going to

626
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:12,340
find.
Where that.

627
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,040
Where the money goes for schools.
Where are the bus routes are?

628
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,590
Where the free buses,
like the white neighborhoods have a free

629
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:22,160
bus and the black neighborhoods have to
pay for their bus.

630
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,520
Yes.
So we have all these things that no

631
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:29,960
matter what you think of this white out
and this black butterfly come to

632
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:33,170
fruition.
I'm on where resources are allocated and

633
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:35,120
what problems are.
How is that possible that white people

634
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,890
don't have to pay for the bus and the
black people do.

635
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,010
That seems ridiculous when you want me
to tell you that they,

636
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,930
it's the neighborhood because the
neighborhoods,

637
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,620
you know,
so they're not serving the white people.

638
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,140
They're serving those upper class
neighborhood.

639
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,580
But is it a,
is it a tax issue?

640
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:54,840
Is it a property tax issue where they
spent money for the buses?

641
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,460
All Baltimore city.
So all the money.

642
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,500
So how the fuck could they justify that
they,

643
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,970
they just do it and nobody cares.
I mean it's,

644
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,040
it's so people should follow them.
It's at be more dark on twitter.

645
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,620
He,
he lays this out in so many different

646
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:08,454
avenues.
You,

647
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,040
you just,
you have to be willfully ignorant to not

648
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,890
realize that this is going on at Bemer
doc.

649
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,970
Okay,
that's,

650
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,520
that's insane.
Now how much of it is dealing with a

651
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:25,550
prison guard unions and police unions
that are trying to keep business as

652
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:29,820
usual because that keeps people employed
or that's a significant portion and

653
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:33,420
you're seeing that with the NRA and
you're seeing that with the police

654
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:36,960
unions and like you said,
the correctional unions were and like

655
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,010
see,
even them,

656
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,040
they don't have these bad intentions.
What they have is job preservation

657
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,830
comes back to those incentives and
disincentives,

658
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,740
so they're fighting for their job and
that's all they're thinking.

659
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:50,461
Well,
we want jobs,

660
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:53,730
we want safer conditions.
I want to make sure that this is a big

661
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:55,980
company that blows up,
so they're gonna put their money towards

662
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:59,340
politicians that support them and that's
just the way it goes this way.

663
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:01,200
It's always been,
as long as we have money in politics,

664
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,280
you can't get away from that.

665
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,210
Well,
the most transparent example that is

666
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:07,930
marijuana that we've shown time and time
and again with a million different

667
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:12,160
studies that marijuana is not dangerous
or if it is dangerous.

668
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:17,161
The danger that it poses is so minimal.
It's so small that consenting adults

669
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,750
should be able to do whatever the fuck
they want with it and yet prison guard

670
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:27,751
unions and police unions still lobby to
keep the drug laws exactly the same way

671
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:30,520
they are because that ensures that
you're gonna need a certain amount of

672
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:32,050
guards.
You're going to need a certain amount of

673
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:34,630
police officers.
That's counterintuitive.

674
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,970
It being that's dangerous for society
because that sets up this us versus them

675
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:46,410
mentality where it doesn't need to be
where you're telling people there's a

676
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,680
certain forbidden plant that they're not
allowed to use.

677
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,020
We've decided this,
we're going to keep it this way even

678
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:54,660
though it's completely illogical,
even though we know the history of it

679
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,640
and we're going to do it simply because
people want to keep their jobs instead

680
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:04,641
of trying to figure out what other jobs
these people can do like shouldn't there

681
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:08,820
be a way you could take some of these
people that are prison guards or police

682
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:13,821
officers and give them a job with a
commensurate income that's involved in

683
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:15,300
helping communities.

684
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,810
Something positive,
something setting up community programs.

685
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,080
I mean how many guys that are cops who
were also into martial arts or fitness

686
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,710
or into something else,
or you know,

687
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,310
anything where they could teach people
in these communities,

688
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:34,311
set up community centers and give people
high paying jobs to establish really

689
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:39,180
good environments for development and
for growing and give people a chance to

690
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:42,480
be exposed to maybe one of these things
that could be these paths that you were

691
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:43,620
talking about.
Yeah,

692
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:46,440
I mean I have.
Obviously I'm gonna have zero objections

693
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:48,390
to that.
I mean that that's a great way of going

694
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:53,391
about it and cannabis is obviously the
shining example of complete illogic.

695
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:57,540
They just did a new study where they
tracked people for 30 years.

696
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,070
You know what health problems they
found,

697
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,390
what ginger vidas bad breath.
They just didn't brush her teeth.

698
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,210
The hippies didn't brush their soki
breath.

699
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,360
Hippies study people said they said the
same thing,

700
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,800
but that probably goes because segment
of the population.

701
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,690
Yeah,
and it doesn't have anything to do with

702
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,100
the cannabis.
That's hilarious.

703
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,580
So we know without a doubt that,
that that's the case.

704
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,510
But what we can do,
so say you still want to do that and we

705
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:27,180
only have to change them that far to,
to get them away from the drug where

706
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,980
even though that's,
that's probably the biggest chunk that's

707
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:32,430
fucking everything up is the drug war.
But if we spend that money,

708
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,330
instead of incarcerating them,
we can spend the money in education.

709
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,190
So for every million dollars that spent
fighting the drug war on the supply

710
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:44,580
side,
there's a 100 kilogram reduction of,

711
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,080
of supply.
So,

712
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,590
uh,
if,

713
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,160
if you have the kilograms of cocaine
coming over the border,

714
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,940
if you fight it with force,
you fight the supply side,

715
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,460
then you get a 10 gram per kilogram
reduction.

716
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,120
But if you spend that same million
dollars on the demand side educating

717
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,940
people,
you have a reduction of 100 kilograms.

718
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,530
Whoa.
So we,

719
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,790
that's,
where's this from?

720
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,380
I don't know.
Somebody can look it up.

721
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,480
It's really easy to find it right away.
That's very logical and it makes sense

722
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:14,730
to me.
So we know that if you just educate

723
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:19,500
people and tobacco is the shining
example of that is tobacco rates have

724
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:23,110
gone down like crazy.
Now let's take the hair gardner

725
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:26,550
situation out of that.
The large part of that has been because

726
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:30,180
of education.
So you educate people out of drugs,

727
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,130
educate people,
you know,

728
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,260
like they say all the time.
If,

729
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,040
if heroin is on Amazon right now to you
order it.

730
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,070
No,
I don't know how to

731
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,380
write.
I don't know about Jamie and Tara when

732
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,310
freak.
He loves it.

733
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,830
He gets a bunch of different styles and
mixes them up.

734
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,230
So it's prohibition.
That messes us up.

735
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,550
Yeah.
And we know that.

736
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:50,551
And when you have prohibition,
you are not determining what happens to

737
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:53,920
the drugs.
All you're doing is determining who is

738
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:57,040
distributing the drugs because they will
be distributed.

739
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,880
The question is,
is it the government and I e the people

740
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,490
doing the distribution or is it the
black market,

741
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,200
the gangs in the mafia?
Well,

742
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:08,050
as long as it's under prohibition,
it's the black market and the gangs in

743
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:08,884
the Mafia.
We,

744
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,460
we literally know this.
There's nothing to discuss.

745
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,710
And yet we continue with this anti
intellectual asm and denial at that.

746
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:21,160
That's kind of,
it runs throughout our society in

747
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:24,400
America.
Speaking about the guns,

748
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,470
you know,
we're dealing with the same thing where

749
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:29,500
it's just constant.
We have evidence we can prove things

750
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:34,330
empirically and we still continue to do
the opposite for for reasons I just

751
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:38,260
can't get my mind wrapped around lake.
It's were I feel like I'm fighting

752
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:43,261
denial and it's been like a year that I
fighting this denial and talking on

753
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,770
radio shows constantly.
But yet,

754
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,160
you know,
a couple months ago we pull up the

755
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:51,880
Internet and the FBI director is pushing
the ferguson effect and it's just like

756
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,070
fuck,
like how do we get past this?

757
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,590
Well,
I think that we're dealing with two

758
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,120
completely different subjects,
right?

759
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,240
The gun control subject is a very
different subject than trying to figure

760
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:06,760
out how to elevate people in bad
neighborhoods.

761
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,990
The gun control subject is,
you know,

762
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,930
if you look at the statistics of how
many Americans have guns,

763
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:17,530
how many rounds of ammunition there are,
how many armed people there are in this

764
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:21,250
country.
And then you look at how many crimes

765
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,140
there are,
how many gun shootings there are.

766
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,630
It's relatively small,
very small.

767
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,820
We're dealing with massive numbers of
people.

768
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,740
Yeah,
I mean if you.

769
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,840
There's $3 million,
okay.

770
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,450
There's $300,
million plus people in this country.

771
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:39,890
So if you look at this,
this blip on the map where every few

772
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,960
months someone goes fucking crazy and
killed a bunch of people.

773
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,110
If we really had a an armed problem in
this country,

774
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:53,530
the logic that the anti gun control
people use would be that you would see

775
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,410
way more shootings and you would see
them all the time.

776
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,590
If we really had a gun control problem,
you have so many armed people.

777
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,760
If it was a real issue,
but the issue would they try to say,

778
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,540
and I'm not picking the team here,
but what they try to say is that what

779
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:11,120
we're dealing with,
just massive numbers of people,

780
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:16,270
massive numbers of people.
The number $300 million is so hard for

781
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,930
the average person like you were.
I to wrap our head around what that

782
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:25,580
means in terms of the volume,
the sheer volume of people and how many

783
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:27,870
guns are out there.
This has many guns,

784
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,960
more guns,
and there are people in this country

785
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,150
which is even more insane,
and the

786
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,810
the people that own these guns for the
most part are law abiding citizens that

787
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:41,510
don't do anything wrong.
Why take away their rights?

788
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:46,870
Because some dude like this asshole in
Orlando goes fucking crazy and kills 50

789
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:51,260
gay people exist that have a couple of
premises there and one of them was that

790
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,150
they have a right to that weapon.
Right?

791
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,940
Which I'm going to argue to the end of
the day that they don't.

792
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,520
Okay.
The second amendment is clear.

793
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,150
Well regulated militia.
It's literally clear.

794
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,690
It says it in black and white,
well regulated militia and even if we go

795
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,330
to bear arms,
sure.

796
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:09,080
Right.
Even if we go past that,

797
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,070
forget that I'm not a big fan of the
constitution and leaning on it because

798
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,790
the world is changed dramatically.
We're in a whole new situation.

799
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,500
Rethink with the evidence that we have
now.

800
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:23,090
Let's not rely on the document that's on
parchment somewhere decaying,

801
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:23,510
right?

802
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,620
So written with a feather.
That's why they made it amendable.

803
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,750
So the first thing is that they have
that right?

804
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,820
I don't think they have the right.
And the second is that that number is

805
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:38,960
acceptable.
I see what you're trading in there is

806
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:41,480
what are you getting?
So if you have an equation where they

807
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:45,140
can have these guns.
So what are you benefiting and what are

808
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:49,160
you losing?
Tell me what is the society we benefit

809
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,060
from handguns and rifles?
Well,

810
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:56,060
the people that have been able to
protect themselves against dangerous

811
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:58,310
crime,
the people that have been able to stop

812
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:01,160
people from breaking into their home,
stealing their property,

813
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,860
harming them physically or protecting
their level.

814
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:08,861
So when you talk about ratios,
there's 30,000 hand gun crimes in

815
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:10,820
America every year,
right?

816
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,420
That's it.
The document it have shootings.

817
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:17,060
30,000.
So I thought it was way more than that.

818
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,410
So if we take the percentage of people
that defended themselves,

819
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,830
I mean you've got five to 10 cases a
year like that doesn't actually occur,

820
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,050
but what are they defending themselves
against

821
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,200
those people with handguns and rifles.
So you're in,

822
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,830
you're trapped in this circular logic
where you need a gun because I have a

823
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:43,040
gun and then eventually Jamie says,
well those fuckers have a gun.

824
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:45,920
I want to gun two.
And we know where that goes.

825
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:50,921
We literally know it keeps getting more
and more and more.

826
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,860
Now if we have this perpetual society
where everyone has everything and

827
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,950
everything's perfect,
but that's just not gonna happen,

828
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:02,360
we're going to have strife and a lot of
these guns are concentrated in a few

829
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:04,760
people's hands that have 200 guns.
You know,

830
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:07,190
dudes that have 50 guns.
I know dudes that 50 guts.

831
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:08,660
I know due to so many guns.

832
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,520
Justin,
I'm talking about you motherfucker.

833
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,480
My Buddy Justin has so many guns.
He doesn't know know how many guns do

834
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,890
you have?
So they have those instances of giant.

835
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,030
He's seven feet tall and he has 150,000
fucking guns.

836
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,400
So they have,
they have them in a safe or they have

837
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:27,020
them out in rural America where they're
not even like interacting with people

838
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,720
like to have the strife.
Well,

839
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:34,721
he's a firearms enthusiastic and he is
also a guy with a squeaky clean criminal

840
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:38,640
record.
What's the argument against him being

841
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:42,180
able to be a firearms enthusiast and
possess all these guns because of what

842
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:46,110
it's done to our society.
He just wants to have something.

843
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,950
And I've talked to in particular,
I know,

844
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,310
but I'm just saying it because he's my
friend.

845
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,870
So anybody,
anybody.

846
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,080
What are you gaining?
So there's an equation in one,

847
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,540
one side of the equation,
we have 30,000 hand gun victims,

848
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,120
we have a society that's gripped by
fear.

849
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,080
We have dudes that can go get an ar 15
and days later,

850
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:06,000
light up a nightclub and do a hate
crime.

851
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,870
We know that that's gonna happen.
And we know that as the future

852
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:12,660
progresses,
that that 103 casualties of this

853
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:17,170
shooting is going to be superseded by a
bigger shooting that that's going to

854
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:19,560
happen because you know,
we got to break the records right?

855
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:20,820
And so,
and we're going to have more and more

856
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,830
guns that keep coming in and keep
coming.

857
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,070
So that's when the right hand side of
the equation and on your left hand side

858
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:27,810
of the equation for,
for having guns,

859
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,480
the argument is,
well I like them.

860
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,970
Well,
there's also the argument that a well

861
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:37,830
armed society is a polite society and
that there were people that had guns in

862
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:39,840
that nightclub.
They would've been able to prevent that

863
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:41,250
crime by taking that guy out.

864
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,950
There were eight cops.
I mean that was the same thing in

865
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:45,690
Denver.
Like if there were cops there,

866
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,050
but the cops are getting shot by the
cops get to a point where I wasn't

867
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:50,310
there.
A hostage situation.

868
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:52,170
I mean I don't know the details about
Florida.

869
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,380
So it's a,
it's really problematic.

870
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:56,130
We're true.
Cops wouldn't get killed,

871
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,620
right?
They have the biggest army.

872
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:02,370
That's when our streets.
So if more guns we keep having more cops

873
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:04,320
with more and bigger guns then it would
stop.

874
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,154
Right?
Because the cops,

875
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,280
the cops roll in armored vehicles with
ar fifteens to combat juveniles dominant

876
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,970
mall during the uprising.
So don't more cops shoot more criminals

877
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,830
than criminal shoot cops don't more cops
kill more people that are trying to

878
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:24,980
commit crimes than those people.
Of course,

879
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,050
that is predicated upon the premise that
they're trying to shoot the cops and

880
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:28,884
they're absolutely not.

881
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:32,040
We're trying to get away some of them.
Sure.

882
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,280
The ones that are actively trying to
shoot cops are super smart because you

883
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:37,290
got to read.
You're saying the cops are getting shot

884
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,740
when they do get shot.
Right?

885
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,571
Right,
right.

886
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:43,690
But what I'm saying is yes,
but isn't that sort of an argument that.

887
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,071
No,
no,

888
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:45,740
no,
you bet.

889
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,840
And there is one guy with a rifle that
he purchased legally and a bunch of cops

890
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:52,980
and a bunch of cops.
The cops still get shot.

891
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,420
Right.
But a lot of those jobs.

892
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,320
But a lot of those guys that you're
talking about,

893
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:02,820
this one guys like the remember the
north Hollywood shootout famous of

894
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:07,380
course arm to the fucking gills and
wearing body armor and all that shit.

895
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:09,510
They were.
The cops were just so outgunned as far

896
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:10,770
as fire power.
Sure.

897
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:13,400
So our answers that they get more
firepower right now.

898
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,050
That's not saying that's the answer to
keep having.

899
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,320
This is one of the reasons why these
cops are getting shot.

900
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,530
They're getting shot and killed in that
situation in particular because they're

901
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,270
walking around with 38 revolver,
nine millimeter glock getting shot

902
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:30,480
because that guy has armor and a fucking
air through and saying,

903
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,040
this is what I'm saying is they don't
adequately.

904
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:37,870
Armed with a handgun would be perfectly
fucking fine if we didn't have ar 15

905
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:39,310
saturating our streets.
Will that guy.

906
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,810
I don't even think he had an ar 15.
You had something like that.

907
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,430
It's all heavy shit.
That's all.

908
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,293
Okay.
Yeah,

909
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,360
so like which by the way,
it's the same gun as an m 16 folks.

910
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:51,340
It's A.
It's a military weapon.

911
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:55,780
It's the same gun that was created.
It was created in the fifties to deal

912
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:58,120
with the AK 47.
There was an HPO,

913
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,740
a part series on real sports recently
that talked about it.

914
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,880
They were talking about Ar 15 in two to
three can do that damage.

915
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:11,800
That's a semiauto and we get caught up
in the assault weapons and the assault

916
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:13,630
weapons are going to keep you having
better aim.

917
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,060
They're going to keep you having a
higher magazine capacity.

918
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,440
Could be a little more reliable weapon,
but have a hunting rifle with a 10

919
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:22,120
magazine clips.
That's a two to three and it's a

920
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:26,080
semiautomatic is gonna do the exact same
level of damage that we're talking

921
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:28,390
about.
So my position on gun control is

922
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,060
extremely simple.
You want your guns for these other

923
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:35,740
things like say hunting bolt,
action rifles and shotguns.

924
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,550
There you go.
Everything that you can that's on your,

925
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,500
on the pro gun side that they want to
achieve can all be accomplished by

926
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:48,310
shotguns and bolt action rifles.
Well,

927
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,530
yeah,
I see that argument,

928
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:54,910
but I also see the argument that hunters
would use in that situation that if you

929
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:59,080
limit the amount of rounds that a guy
can have in his gun or the ability to

930
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:03,460
fire off round quickly,
you're limiting their ability to make a

931
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:06,670
quick followup shot on an animal that
would kill that animal.

932
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,130
Yeah.
And so if you have somebody that's that

933
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:10,270
dedicated,
right,

934
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,430
I don't have a problem with that
personally.

935
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,640
So if you have somebody that we want to
establish this high standard,

936
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,790
so say say we have the super high
standard where this guy,

937
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:23,820
he can get his big gun that he uses in
his well trained on and he's gone

938
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:28,510
through a super long process of
backgrounds and he's all checked out

939
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,860
that I don't have any objection to that.
But like say his gun gets stolen,

940
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,590
you don't get it anymore,
you're done.

941
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,170
Right.
So you have to maintain this high

942
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:42,490
standard in order to have such extreme
privilege.

943
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,930
And I'm fine with that.
Like people that have c,

944
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:44,950
four explosives,
you know,

945
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:48,580
there are people that can legally carry
det cord and c four to blow up

946
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:50,840
buildings.
They're not a big problem to the rest of

947
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:53,170
the society using their debt court and
see for,

948
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,430
to,
to hurt people.

949
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,550
So if that's a unique class of
individual.

950
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,440
Yeah,
I see what you're saying.

951
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:04,090
So you think that should be more
stringent testing and background checks

952
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:06,800
on people that are getting guns?
Yeah.

953
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:10,270
Especially those kind of high powered
ones or handguns,

954
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:11,020
we,
we,

955
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,170
we get caught up a lot in the high power
because they're,

956
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,520
they're capable of that mass
destruction,

957
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,530
but it's the handguns that caused the
fear in society every single day because

958
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:20,950
it's so easy to conceal.
Yeah,

959
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,830
that's the whole problem is the
concealment that you can just pop it out

960
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:26,170
and use it.
You don't know who has what and so

961
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:27,980
everyone becomes a.
because you have

962
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,570
this small death device on you that
anybody can do anything and it's just

963
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,710
like we gotta go back to that equation,
like what is on the other side of the

964
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:41,711
equation of 30,000 handguns and $300
plus a mass shootings per year.

965
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,550
The other side of that equation is,
is that ridiculous idea.

966
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:48,710
I mean,
if you can figure out something for me

967
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,920
other than I liked collecting guns and I
think they're cool and it's my right

968
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,840
then,
then I'm willing to hear it.

969
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,690
I just don't hear an argument beyond
that.

970
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:59,930
Well,
the only argument is that a person who

971
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:04,430
is not a criminal and a person who
doesn't have any ill will in their

972
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:08,120
hearts and just enjoys firearm,
should be able to have them just like

973
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:11,480
you should be able to have a truck that
you could just drive through a fucking

974
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,810
crowd of people with if you want it to
yet,

975
00:51:13,811 --> 00:51:18,110
but so the argument there that you can
have the truck and the truck is capable

976
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:21,050
of of harm,
so just like a knife,

977
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,870
but a knife has a drilling and other
uses.

978
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,110
So on that other side of that equation,
when you can say,

979
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:28,460
well,
what do we need a knife for?

980
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,110
Well,
it's to chop up food.

981
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:35,111
It's to skin a deer.
It's to do a thousand other things that

982
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,800
the ar or something like that.
It's for one purpose and one purpose

983
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:42,650
only and that's to kill a human being.
Well,

984
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:45,230
that was what it was designed for,
but people use them for hunting.

985
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,900
They have a better rifle to used in that
for hunting.

986
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,150
Well,
the thing about hunting with those is

987
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:54,650
that you can pull the trigger many times
like for hog hunting and things like

988
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:56,300
that.
There are a lot of people actually

989
00:51:56,301 --> 00:51:57,170
prefer them.
Sure.

990
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,060
So let's say you even want to do that
again,

991
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:02,780
we're talking about that higher class
person and so higher-class hog hunter.

992
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,663
Yeah,
higher class.

993
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,530
I'm pretty sure that's not an actual
effect.

994
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,540
I'm like,
so you want to go shoot it and you want

995
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:10,310
to shoot those,
those animals,

996
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:14,870
right?
Go check it out from your parks and rec

997
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,760
and go use it.
Check out.

998
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,170
Yeah,
check it out.

999
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,420
You said you just want to use it right?
But what do you mean?

1000
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,710
But check it out.
Right?

1001
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:26,711
So say you could start at an armory
armory that who runs the government to

1002
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:27,410
run.
Of course.

1003
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,820
Good Lord.
It could be the private,

1004
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,640
the private rifle range.
Okay.

1005
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,750
Alright.
Well that's how it is in a lot of places

1006
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:35,540
in Europe when you know how to do this
shit.

1007
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,310
We literally,
other countries have done this.

1008
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:39,860
Australia is the shining example.
They had one mass shooting said,

1009
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:42,050
fuck this,
and I have none sense.

1010
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:45,110
Right,
but you can get a rifle in Australia.

1011
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,930
Okay,
and this is something that gets bandied

1012
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,120
about many times,
so I actually had to do some research.

1013
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,630
It's not impossible to get rifles for
hunting in Australia.

1014
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,790
You could super hard.
It's difficult,

1015
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:01,490
but Australia also has less people than
California and an enormous chunk of land

1016
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,670
yet.
But we have other countries take China.

1017
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,570
China's four times.
Our population doesn't.

1018
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:11,270
It doesn't even hit the radar screen
when the amount of people they have

1019
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,160
imprisoned or the amount of violence
they have.

1020
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,500
That's true.
But China is.

1021
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,680
Well was until really recently,
it's a communist dictatorship that was

1022
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,900
run with an iron fist.
I mean,

1023
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:27,690
think about Tiananmen and what happens
when people rebel against the government

1024
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:30,120
there.
It's two completely different sort of

1025
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:31,080
culture.
Is it?

1026
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,340
Is it different than what happens here
though?

1027
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,240
Really though,
I mean if you stand up against the

1028
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,830
government was going to happen to you.
It's not just standing up against the

1029
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:38,730
government.
I mean they,

1030
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,210
the people,
they don't have much power over there

1031
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,433
too.

1032
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,930
We live in an oligarchy,
like we've proven that.

1033
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,110
That's another thing we've proven,
so princeton did a study where they

1034
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:54,111
tracked 19,000 cases of laws that were
going on and going through congress,

1035
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,090
so what they found out is that public
opinion on whether a law gets passed or

1036
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:00,870
not.
For instance,

1037
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,170
gun control,
which over 80 percent of NRA members

1038
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:07,890
agree with increased gun control and
background checks and things like that.

1039
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,340
We don't get it passed congress at all.
It doesn't have any bearing on public

1040
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,240
opinion,
doesn't have any bearing on whether a

1041
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:18,750
law gets passed,
but if you have donors that care about a

1042
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:21,000
law getting passed,
then it's going to get past.

1043
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,510
And even when public sentiment is
completely against the law being passed.

1044
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,300
If the public,
if the donors want the law passed,

1045
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,730
they still have a 30 percent chance of
getting the law passed.

1046
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,060
I think what the NRA is trying to do is
they're trying to prevent the slippery

1047
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:39,060
slope.
They're trying to establish laws and

1048
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:43,170
keep them in place so that established
rights that are already in place,

1049
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:46,050
right?
Keep them in place because they worry

1050
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:48,240
that if you start increasing background
checks,

1051
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:51,930
if you start ramping up any sort of
restrictions on gun owners,

1052
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,200
that it's a slippery slope that will.
They'll never get back.

1053
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,450
They'll never get the freedom back.
But what I mean,

1054
00:54:57,451 --> 00:55:00,240
I don't know what that freedom is.
We're all afraid to go somewhere.

1055
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:04,730
We don't have freedom in this gun
saturated country where we're not.

1056
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:05,371
We'll hold on.
No,

1057
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:06,210
we're not.
No,

1058
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:06,841
we're not.
We're not.

1059
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,280
I don't think people are afraid.
No,

1060
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:09,810
I don't.
I don't think people are generally

1061
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:12,390
afraid of fighting to keep the gun,
but hold on.

1062
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,600
You're saying we're all afraid as if
every day when you go to the movies,

1063
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:17,780
you're worried about a mass shooting
every day when you go to the wall and

1064
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:18,614
we're not afraid.

1065
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,630
We travel freely.
Occasionally things like this happen and

1066
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:25,530
they're horrific and terrifying,
but people aren't generally afraid.

1067
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,740
We're all afraid to do things.
I just don't think that's true.

1068
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,270
I Dunno.
So

1069
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:36,210
why then would we all want to protect
this so much?

1070
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,220
Well,
the NRAS position,

1071
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,060
the NRAS position is that Liberals,
Democrats,

1072
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,290
whatever they want to take away your
right to own a gun,

1073
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,790
the NRA does not want that.
So they spend all their money,

1074
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,470
they do other lobbying,
they do everything they can to stop any

1075
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,530
new restrictions from passing and to
stop anyone who is trying to take away

1076
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:03,370
guns.
Right?

1077
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,870
So,
so the way you framed that is that they

1078
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:11,730
are trying to protect their rights and
they want to preserve this thing,

1079
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:16,020
but I just don't see it that way.
A lot of people with those people that

1080
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:17,880
are fighting against guns like so.
So me,

1081
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,070
I have guns.
I like shooting,

1082
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,720
I enjoy it.
I'm fucking good at it.

1083
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:23,380
I made a career out of it,
right?

1084
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,490
But

1085
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,900
at one point in time I did enough
research and enough understanding that

1086
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:33,901
my ultimate goal is that we have a safer
society and that we protect people.

1087
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:38,920
But the way we protect people
empirically is to not have these guns.

1088
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,930
Nobody has the gun crime that we have.
Nobody in the entire world as a

1089
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:48,040
developed country has the gun crime and
incarceration rate in everything that we

1090
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:51,310
do.
We are the worst example in the in the

1091
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:55,660
developed world of how to do this.
Every other example is a better example

1092
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,320
than what we do,
but we're continually trying to stay

1093
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:02,950
into into this same mold that we know is
failing.

1094
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,310
I want to protect people and the
evidence says that in order to protect

1095
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:09,220
people,
we can't have handguns and assault

1096
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:12,300
rifles there.
I said the damn assault right forward

1097
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,550
again,
but we can't have a semiautomatic rifles

1098
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:19,840
out there like crazy that enables
society to have that risk.

1099
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,820
I mean those,
those on the other end of that stray

1100
00:57:22,821 --> 00:57:26,800
bullet is a nine year old girl who's
bleeding out to death in the city and I

1101
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:29,500
just.
I don't want to get rude with people,

1102
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:31,690
but the idea that you want to go fucking
shoot something,

1103
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,720
I just don't give a shit about that.
When you see the destruction close to

1104
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,640
you is suddenly Gabby Gifford can go
for,

1105
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,850
for gun control after it touches,
you know,

1106
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:45,250
or somebody like that.
Whenever it touches you,

1107
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:50,050
suddenly we start to care if,
if right now a masked gunman comes and

1108
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,240
starts shooting up the rest of this
building and they,

1109
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,570
they killed Jamie,
we're all going to care a hell of a lot

1110
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:57,400
more by Jamie.
How come you don't?

1111
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:02,460
Because I didn't want to die that
Jamie under the bus please nobody.

1112
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:06,560
Shoot Jamie.
And I think,

1113
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,310
I think we would all take a slightly
different perspective.

1114
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,310
I think you're right.
And I think that's an issue with all

1115
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:13,870
sorts of crimes.
And uh,

1116
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:17,650
that's also an issue with poverty and
bad communities is that it's not

1117
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:19,180
touching.
The people that are,

1118
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,490
that are just want to be safe.
Lock those people up,

1119
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:23,200
get them off the street.
They're in my way.

1120
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,470
I think you're right in that regard.
I mean,

1121
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:30,910
I don't know if there is a perfect
answer to getting rid of 300 million

1122
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:33,250
guns are controlled.
Don't think you can do it in guns.

1123
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,470
I just want stop making them.
Yeah.

1124
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,540
Like let's just stop making them.
So one of my ideas,

1125
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:40,540
they are gun companies.
They're making a doctor.

1126
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,390
They're making,
making a weapon of death.

1127
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:47,110
I don't care about what they want.
So we know guns can last hundreds of

1128
00:58:47,111 --> 00:58:48,610
years if you take care of them.
Right?

1129
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,750
So if we stop making them,
their value will all go up and then

1130
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:53,870
we're going to concentrate it.

1131
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,100
And I know the Libertarians would be
like,

1132
00:58:56,101 --> 00:58:57,270
oh my God,
all the rich people are gonna.

1133
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,270
Hold the guns.
I get it.

1134
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,650
Whatever.
They're not going to use them.

1135
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:03,130
We know that.
So let's make it more valuable so

1136
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:06,310
they're not worth $200 on the street so
that,

1137
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,031
uh,
you know,

1138
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:11,740
a gun of disrespect before a drug war,
beef can lead to that shooting.

1139
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,700
I want to have you sit down with someone
who's a gun proponent.

1140
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,560
Good luck.
What do you mean?

1141
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:19,000
Good Lord,
I've been here for a year.

1142
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:22,010
Doing this day in and day out,
challenging everyone from Sam Harris

1143
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,560
to whoever.
They're not going to.

1144
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,820
They're not going to do this.
The evidence is on my side.

1145
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,950
They're not going to do what?
You're not going to have a debate

1146
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:29,720
because it certainly would.
I could definitely set that,

1147
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,860
set it up.
Okay,

1148
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,620
well I can up my friend Justin.
Okay,

1149
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,130
100 percent you can get to do this
please because he needs to give me that

1150
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:41,870
push back that other people need to hear
and if he's right on a position I will

1151
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:43,220
absolutely change.
Okay,

1152
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:46,340
well we're definitely going to set that
up then I'm going to bring in Justin

1153
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:49,790
because Justin is very articulate and
don't be intimidated because he has a

1154
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,430
giant,
does have a thousand fucking guns or

1155
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:53,540
something like that.
But he's a nice guy.

1156
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,070
He's a very nice guy.
He's a good buddy.

1157
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,810
Um,
and he is a,

1158
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,820
like I said,
and firearms enthusiast,

1159
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:02,040
but also a really nice guy that has no
criminal record,

1160
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,580
never done anything wrong and very
articulate.

1161
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,960
Very smart,
very well read.

1162
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,270
But he's going to say that people like
him should have the guns.

1163
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:08,790
Right.
And he's,

1164
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,370
he's right where he is,
right?

1165
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:11,840
Yeah.
I mean he's never done anything with

1166
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,770
those guys and he's the wrong fucking
dude to break into his house every once

1167
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:18,140
in a while you're going to need a dude
like him to kick down the door,

1168
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:18,860
right?
Yeah.

1169
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,970
Okay.
We know that,

1170
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,940
so I wouldn't argue if he's going to say
he needs,

1171
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,880
you know,
we need this elite members of society

1172
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,600
that Swat teams or something like that
that can handle these situations.

1173
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:31,900
Of course we do.
Well he's a competitive shooter.

1174
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,970
Does contest and stuff.
They should shoot like me.

1175
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,290
Well,
I'm sure he's right.

1176
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:38,690
Like if they can handle it and their
professionalism as him,

1177
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,300
you're not going to get pushed back from
society because nothing's going to

1178
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:41,720
happen.

1179
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,840
But it's what I'm saying is that he's
not doing anything wrong and it's

1180
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,630
something he enjoys.
Like when do we decide,

1181
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:50,390
and I'm just putting this out there.
I'm not taking a stance because I don't

1182
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:52,130
understand it myself.
Uh,

1183
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:56,690
and you know,
people saying that I'm anti-gun or pro

1184
01:00:56,691 --> 01:00:59,120
gun or not.
I'm pretty neutral on this.

1185
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:04,121
I also owned guns,
but I see the problems.

1186
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:09,290
I definitely see when something like
this happens in Orlando and some crazy

1187
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:12,740
fuck can go in and just shoot up a
nightclub and kill all these people.

1188
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,310
We've got a real problem.
I don't know how to solve that problem.

1189
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:19,760
I'm sure some people would say concealed
carry permits,

1190
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:22,430
so all these people in the nightclubs
could shoot out that guy,

1191
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:25,550
but that's false.
It's empirically false gunfight in a

1192
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:27,620
nightclub and more people are going to
get shot.

1193
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:31,160
Well not only that,
most of the people that get involved in

1194
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:33,170
these gunfights it will be their first
gunfight,

1195
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,730
so you're going to fuck it.

1196
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,500
Shit your pants.
You're going to get target panic.

1197
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,120
You're going to miss,
you're going to hit people.

1198
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,090
It's going to be a lot going on.
Glad you're saying that.

1199
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,680
Yeah.
I mean it's not as simple as via to gun.

1200
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:44,760
If he had a gun,
you'd probably wouldn't be able to point

1201
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,580
it at people and if you pulled the
trigger,

1202
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,470
you'd be lucky if you hit someone right
in front of you.

1203
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,750
So where.
Where was that shooting?

1204
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,320
It was relatively recent.
It was out of college and there were two

1205
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:59,321
Marines on base on the college campus
with weapons and they didn't engage

1206
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,420
because they said,
hey look,

1207
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:04,160
I was only going to make the situation
worse.

1208
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,160
The cops weren't going to know who I am
if I had my weapon out,

1209
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,380
but I could have missed and done
something else.

1210
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:13,820
And two guys that were in their actual
right state of mind that we're armed

1211
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:18,970
decided that engaging was more dangerous
and it's actually empirically more that

1212
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:24,120
if you engage,
your more likely to die and you're

1213
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,700
something,
you're going to shoot somebody else or

1214
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,050
the situation's not going to be
resolved.

1215
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:28,510
We,
we,

1216
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,510
we literally know this.
People have done this.

1217
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:34,290
They've done studies where they've tried
to take people and simulate it and it

1218
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,490
never pans out.
Yeah.

1219
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,290
But that's engaging with,
uh,

1220
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,790
an instance where you're not involved.
If you are involved,

1221
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:43,140
you absolutely have to engage.
You're going to get shot.

1222
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,060
Like if you're,
if

1223
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,330
you have to run like so.
All the evidence says that if you run,

1224
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,460
that's your best bet for safety.
And like,

1225
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:54,840
we don't want to do that,
right?

1226
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:56,310
Because that's a bitch move.
Please.

1227
01:02:56,311 --> 01:02:58,830
I'm done.
Someone shooting,

1228
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:03,090
I'm all better hero.
There's this delusion of Hiroshima.

1229
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,520
You know that somebody is going to save
the day.

1230
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:08,850
And sure,
you may find that happen every so often.

1231
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:09,421
It's,
wait a minute,

1232
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:11,250
have you not seen Sylvester stallone
movies?

1233
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:14,880
Because it happens all the time.
Is that that is a problem,

1234
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:17,430
right?
Super problem that they shoot people in

1235
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:19,700
the leg while they're running and Tulsa.

1236
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:24,820
Like we've developed this sort of idea
of what goes down in a gunfight based on

1237
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:28,470
fiction not based on reality.
The amount of people that have actually

1238
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:33,471
been exposed to a bullet hitting a live
thing is so small sound.

1239
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,070
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1240
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,700
They don't realize how loud that is.
If you show shoot with,

1241
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,340
with headphones in your whole life,
go ahead and start clacking off 15

1242
01:03:41,341 --> 01:03:44,170
rounds with without ear protection on
your.

1243
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,500
You'll be ringing.
You can't even understand what's going

1244
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,360
on.
You have to be well trained in that

1245
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,820
environment and understand like cops
aren't even in there the first time they

1246
01:03:51,821 --> 01:03:55,340
get a real gun battle because they shoot
with earfold earplugs in and everything.

1247
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,730
The first time they're shooting their
gun,

1248
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,920
they're hearing the sound and everything
else.

1249
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:00,950
So yeah,
I mean you got those people like

1250
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:04,410
everybody that I was in the Marine Corps
with doing fast team,

1251
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:08,340
I don't think they're going to get any
gun crimes and I think they can handle

1252
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:11,970
situations,
but these are a certain segment that

1253
01:04:11,971 --> 01:04:14,100
needs to live up to a high standard.

1254
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,860
Well not only that,
those are people that have been trained

1255
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,560
and they've.
They've developed this understanding of

1256
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:23,250
firearms that's so deep.
Most people just don't get to that.

1257
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:26,790
It's like the average person watches a
UFC fight and thinks they can kick

1258
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:30,300
someone's ass and then if you fought
against a train martial artists,

1259
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:32,070
you're fucked.
Like you really don't know what you're

1260
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:33,840
doing.
That's kind of the same thing.

1261
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,890
And when you compare someone who really,
like my friend Justin really understands

1262
01:04:37,891 --> 01:04:41,270
firearms versus the average person who
goes and buys a gun and thinks,

1263
01:04:41,271 --> 01:04:42,120
well,
I'm safe now.

1264
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:45,960
I got this gun.
It maybe,

1265
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,370
maybe,
maybe,

1266
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:50,870
but statistics say that you're more
likely to shoot a family member and an

1267
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,730
in a fight or yeah,
suicide.

1268
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,770
Which,
you know the other thing,

1269
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,570
a lot of people.
That's a wonderful analogy.

1270
01:04:57,571 --> 01:05:01,200
I love that you did that because I mean
it's a perfect analogy almost for mma

1271
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:06,260
and who can handle a weapon as well,
but what's all about undue confidence,

1272
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,570
you know,
and perfect.

1273
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,040
So like here's,
here's the thing,

1274
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,870
I've always wanted to tell people that
feel that way.

1275
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,330
We can.
I can tell you,

1276
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,060
you can have a gun on you right now and
we can set this up in the morning and I

1277
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:22,300
can tell you,
walk around your day as normal at some

1278
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:24,880
point in time today,
I'm going to take that gun away from

1279
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:26,200
you,
right?

1280
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,980
I will get that gun.
It's going to happen because you,

1281
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:32,710
you're not going to be able to protect
it and you know I'm coming.

1282
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,590
So then why are you actually think
you're safe,

1283
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,750
that you have that gun on you.
You're just,

1284
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,700
as long as you're fighting against the
inferior opponent or you're in this

1285
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:47,580
situation where you have distance and
you have all these things like that,

1286
01:05:47,581 --> 01:05:51,420
just like in an MMA fight,
it's not going to go as you planned it,

1287
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,520
I promise.
So what are you saying?

1288
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:55,020
Look,
as far as like you're going to take the

1289
01:05:55,021 --> 01:05:57,120
gun away from him.
Let's say you wanted to have a concealed

1290
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,080
weapon on you.
Right?

1291
01:05:58,081 --> 01:05:59,940
And so you're standing in line at the
bank.

1292
01:05:59,941 --> 01:06:02,790
You're going about your day as normal.
I could tell you at some point in time

1293
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,990
I'm going to get that gun from you and
I'll get it because if everything's

1294
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,940
about surprise.
So when the bank robber comes in,

1295
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,830
well it's not surprised if you tell them
you're going to get it.

1296
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:12,510
Well sure.
I've just given you 24 hours,

1297
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,410
I'll be all fucking jacked up on
adderall for 24 hours.

1298
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,110
Thinking about the life you're meant to
keep that gun safe,

1299
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,110
you definitely wouldn't be.
Well it makes it an adventure.

1300
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,490
Wait,
but that's the thing that you're bigger

1301
01:06:23,491 --> 01:06:25,170
than me.
You can be ready for it.

1302
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,220
It's still.
I'm sorry.

1303
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:28,770
You're just not going to be because it's
just going to come out of nowhere.

1304
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,950
So when people have these guns,
are you like really good at disarming

1305
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:32,930
people or something?
No,

1306
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,490
more than anybody else would be.
If you learn how to a holster works.

1307
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,330
Somebody goes from my gun,
I'm punching him in their fucking face.

1308
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,870
Come from behind you.
We're going to be standing in line at a

1309
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,030
w.
where's my gun?

1310
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,570
When your head right here.
So they're going to come from behind.

1311
01:06:45,571 --> 01:06:46,290
They're going to grab it.

1312
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,260
Sure you can do.
But how hard is it to get a gun out of a

1313
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:50,460
holster?
There's certain holsters,

1314
01:06:50,461 --> 01:06:52,050
as long as you know the holster works.
It's cake.

1315
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,680
Oh,
okay.

1316
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,900
What does that one holster wear?
If you yank on it?

1317
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:56,970
It doesn't work with the triple
retention holsters.

1318
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,770
Yeah.
I'm really going to see your gun if you

1319
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:00,660
have one of those because those are
pretty darn big.

1320
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,030
What if I'm wearing a puffy coat?
Sure.

1321
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:04,980
I guess you could figure out ways to get
around it.

1322
01:07:04,981 --> 01:07:08,820
I'm good at that,
but you're just not actually safer.

1323
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,720
I know a dude who keeps several guns on
them all the time and two knives.

1324
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,400
He's got a knife in his boot.
He keeps several guns on them all the

1325
01:07:16,401 --> 01:07:17,700
time.
He's been hitting the head a bunch of

1326
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,170
times,
so it's just.

1327
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,440
Some people think you just,
you can't.

1328
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,690
You can't think that that's what's going
to make you safe.

1329
01:07:24,691 --> 01:07:26,460
It's your mindset,
it's your,

1330
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,590
it's your awareness of your
surroundings.

1331
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:30,420
It's your ability to make logical
decisions.

1332
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,130
Okay.
But you're talking about a very specific

1333
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,950
case where someone's trying to take your
gun away.

1334
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:36,210
Right?
But that's the thing is you're in a,

1335
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:39,750
you're in a bank.
I don't even need a gun because odds are

1336
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:40,620
they're going to be one there

1337
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,700
and that's what we have.
So like a big thing of policing is you

1338
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:50,701
don't get into like Jujitsu Kinda of
wrestling matches because of that gun.

1339
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,420
Right?
Because no matter what fight you're in,

1340
01:07:55,510 --> 01:08:00,510
there's always a gun there.
And it's the same thing with non cops,

1341
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,980
right?
You don't want to get in a fight as a

1342
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:07,090
cop because if the evidence shows
statistically that if they get that gun

1343
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:08,380
from you,
they're going to use it on you.

1344
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:11,020
Right?
That's no different from you.

1345
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,010
If they get that gun from you can use it
on you.

1346
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,710
Right?
Right.

1347
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:18,710
So why would you want to be in a fight
with somebody?

1348
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,940
Well,
that's a wrestling match,

1349
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,200
right?
So you're saying that.

1350
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:26,210
But I introduce the gun,
you're introducing that potential for

1351
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:30,260
you dying and there's a high possibility
and you didn't have it before.

1352
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:33,500
You literally are making yourself more
at risk.

1353
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,150
I mean the statistics are clear on this
that if you bring a gun to this fight,

1354
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:42,970
the odds are against you even higher now
because most people that bring a,

1355
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:46,520
if even if you bring a knife to a fight
at a significant portion of those people

1356
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,230
get the knife taken away from them.
It gets used on them.

1357
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,520
I can't tell you how many cases we've
been where you're trying to figure out a

1358
01:08:52,521 --> 01:08:54,320
stabbing call and come to find out.

1359
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:59,060
Know they tried to do the stabbing,
but they got that shit taken from them

1360
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:02,660
and they got stabbed themselves.
So once you introduce that,

1361
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,250
that potential,
you were more dangerous or yourself.

1362
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,870
But this is again,
you're talking about non trained

1363
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:12,440
individuals and it sort of brings us
back to you and I not the

1364
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:14,990
responsibilities.
They fight hard on those really trained

1365
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:16,250
people.
I get that.

1366
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,360
Yeah,
no,

1367
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,320
that,
that's fine.

1368
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,260
And that's not a right at that point.
It's a privilege.

1369
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,510
So it's like driving a car,
driving your car on a right,

1370
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:26,060
it's a privilege.
So if these people want to earn that

1371
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,810
privilege,
so be it.

1372
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,140
But it becomes a problem,
doesn't it?

1373
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:33,140
When a really fucking crazy person earns
that privilege.

1374
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,360
I mean,
if someone hasn't done anything yet

1375
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,120
criminal,
I mean there's been several people that

1376
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:41,930
have committed mass shootings but didn't
do anything before they did that

1377
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:42,764
shooting.

1378
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,401
I mean,
yeah.

1379
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:44,630
So,
so you're still left with those.

1380
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:48,170
You still decided as a society that on
that side of the equation,

1381
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,680
you're willing to accept that amount
even though it's a lesser amount,

1382
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,160
you have decided to set that amount and
if we can just move to a point where we

1383
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:57,650
can accept a lesser amount,
that would be wonderful.

1384
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:02,180
But we're continually accepting in ever
increasing amounts because more people

1385
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:04,430
are buying guns,
more people buying ammo.

1386
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,940
Hm.
So what is the solution then in your

1387
01:10:07,941 --> 01:10:09,190
eyes?
Well,

1388
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,900
I would like to stop manufacturing.
I would,

1389
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:15,080
uh,
like handguns and rifles to be banned.

1390
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,090
And maybe that has to take a long time.
Not Rifle.

1391
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:22,100
It's just a semiautomatic,
meaning you can't own them anymore.

1392
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,010
No,
let's not go.

1393
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:26,870
Shit.
Yeah,

1394
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:30,500
same trick is shit.
Then it becomes a privilege.

1395
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,110
So like the handguns,
your twitter accounts getting attacked

1396
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:36,100
right now and that was a real fucking
liberal.

1397
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,950
You're never taking my gun.
So you have to be those people that

1398
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:42,470
earned that privilege.
The idea that it's a right.

1399
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,770
It's just,
I think,

1400
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:47,540
I think we could call it a lot in that,
that it's just even if it,

1401
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,080
like we were saying earlier,
I think the evidence is there that it's

1402
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:52,220
actually not.
You're right,

1403
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:56,400
but if it is like,
can we rethink that?

1404
01:10:56,401 --> 01:10:57,830
I mean,
what is the Second Amendment?

1405
01:10:57,831 --> 01:10:59,510
Read it exactly.
Jamie.

1406
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:02,930
In its form please.
So we can be again,

1407
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,350
the idea that we keep the constitution
and the bill of rights exactly intact

1408
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:11,510
some shit that was created hundreds of
years ago before any of the variables

1409
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:14,070
that we have to deal with in society,
whether

1410
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,430
it's variables about privacy,
electronic communications,

1411
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:22,431
whether it's variables about the power
and the ability that guns have.

1412
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,160
I mean we're dealing with a totally
different world.

1413
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,020
They made the shit back when people had
muskets,

1414
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,810
we really need to consider that and by
the way,

1415
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:35,811
they had just gotten done fighting off a
totalitarian regime and had expanded and

1416
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:38,350
become their own country.
Second,

1417
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,280
I'm in the United States.
Constitution reads a well regulated

1418
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:45,690
militia being necessary to the security
of a free state.

1419
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:50,460
The right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed.

1420
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,740
See,
that's pretty clear.

1421
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,800
The right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed.

1422
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,470
Yeah,
but a well regulated militia being

1423
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:03,990
necessary to the security of a free
state,

1424
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,520
the right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed if they are

1425
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:12,000
a well regulated militia,
but it's not saying if it's saying

1426
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:15,900
capital letter a,
a well regulated militia being necessary

1427
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:18,810
to the security of the free state,
so they're establishing that it is

1428
01:12:18,811 --> 01:12:22,860
important that you have a well regulated
militia being necessary.

1429
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:25,770
Well-Regulated.
That's the weird term.

1430
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,290
Well regulated militia.
What does that mean?

1431
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,900
National Guard?
Is that what they're saying though?

1432
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:34,310
Because it's saying the right of the
people to keep and bear arms right?

1433
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:38,280
They will not be in the state though.
So the idea that you fight,

1434
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:39,840
what is it?
People of the state mean they're just

1435
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:42,550
people know because that's what the
states are mean.

1436
01:12:42,551 --> 01:12:43,950
We the people that's the country,
right?

1437
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,080
But this is a free,
a free state.

1438
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:49,380
What that means is they,
they're worried that we might be invaded

1439
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:53,310
and taken over by England at the
government or the government.

1440
01:12:53,311 --> 01:12:54,960
Any government.
It's against the federal government.

1441
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:58,350
Right.
So that's a state being able to defend

1442
01:12:58,351 --> 01:13:02,430
itself against the federal government
because they still were lingering with

1443
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:04,290
that.
That from Britain.

1444
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,350
I don't know if that's what they meant
when they said a free state.

1445
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,080
Is that what they could pull that up
again so I can see that please.

1446
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:11,643
It's,
I mean,

1447
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,790
look,
it's kind of weird arguing about this

1448
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:19,440
because if we had to do this over again,
I mean this is obviously something that

1449
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:21,510
was established as we said a long time
ago.

1450
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:26,511
If we had to do this over again,
if we had established new new amendments

1451
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,290
or new rights,
I don't know how we would rate,

1452
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,530
but that's a prep propositional phrase,
a well regulated militia.

1453
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,550
That means everything after that is in
regards to a well reg and Mr. so if I

1454
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:41,760
said and then Joe and everything in that
sentence would be about.

1455
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:44,550
Joe is a prepositional phrase.
I mean that that's exactly what they

1456
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:45,420
mean.
Well,

1457
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,520
a rel.
Well regulated militia,

1458
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:52,110
meaning that there's a bunch of militia
meaning regular people,

1459
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:55,890
civilians gathering together to form
some sort of a makeshift army.

1460
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,710
Yeah.
Being necessary to the security of a

1461
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:01,500
free state.
Now when they say a free state,

1462
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,740
this is back when,
what were their fucking three states or

1463
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:07,260
something like that.
When the 13 isn't,

1464
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,290
should've been 13.
Then the first ones were 13,

1465
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:11,890
right.
The first initial states,

1466
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,640
the right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed.

1467
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,250
Sees fucking.
Nobody talks like that.

1468
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:21,570
You fucks,
you know today in 2016 if you wrote a

1469
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,020
sentence like that,
but like,

1470
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:24,190
hey bitch,
what are you trying to say?

1471
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,300
You know what I mean?
I mean,

1472
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:31,510
people,
thou shalt not for score in 16 years ago

1473
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,030
what?
Speak Normal Bitch,

1474
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:35,410
right?
It's,

1475
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:38,500
um,
the right of the people to keep and bear

1476
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:41,530
arms shall not be infringed is the one
that everybody claims to.

1477
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,440
People of the Free State though,
is that,

1478
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:47,170
that's definitely what they meant
because they did that back then.

1479
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:47,571
You know,
they,

1480
01:14:47,571 --> 01:14:49,830
they formulated those,
those books,

1481
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,800
but they're saying shall not be
infringed the right of the people.

1482
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,810
But remember,
that's the federal government shall not

1483
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:59,120
infringe that right against the state.
No,

1484
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:03,100
it's not saying against the state.
It's saying the people to put attack the

1485
01:15:03,101 --> 01:15:06,880
security of the state,
the right of the people to keep in bare

1486
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:09,520
arms shall not be infringed the people
of this state.

1487
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,330
Right?
But what they're saying is that was

1488
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,570
annoying for people listening.
We got to do the car chase story after

1489
01:15:16,571 --> 01:15:17,081
this,
that we all.

1490
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:17,891
Everybody.
Oh,

1491
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:18,760
that's right,
that's right.

1492
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,400
A well regulated militia being
necessary.

1493
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:23,410
So there's establishing that.
And again,

1494
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:27,360
if you're angry right now and you'll
fuck I'm writing my congressman,

1495
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,200
you fucking pussies and try to take my
guns.

1496
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:33,250
We're just trying to.
We're trying to unpack this amendment,

1497
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:39,280
a well regulated militia being necessary
to the security of a free state.

1498
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:43,090
So they're establishing that we need a
well regulated militia to make sure that

1499
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,080
we don't get taken over by tyranny.
The right of the people to keep and bear

1500
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:49,900
arms shall not be infringed.
I don't know man.

1501
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:53,680
I mean I'm not a constitutionalist by
any stretch of the imagination.

1502
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:55,180
Nor am I a scholar of the bill of
rights.

1503
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,260
That seems pretty clear.

1504
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,620
The right shall not be infringed.
Okay.

1505
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,850
So I'll give you.
Let's say we give you the right of the

1506
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:08,140
people is what they mean is that the
people can hold the arms until they're

1507
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:11,470
needed to form this militia.
Well that's weird because that is what

1508
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:13,560
it sounds like to me to hold the arms.
Yeah.

1509
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:16,120
So the people,
right of the people to keep and bear

1510
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:17,080
arms.
Right?

1511
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:18,620
So they have the guns,
right?

1512
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:22,810
And so they can have them.
It's just that so that they can

1513
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:25,270
formulate a well regulated militia later
if needed,

1514
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,180
so it does kind of relate that as well.
I don't know about,

1515
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:30,160
but you don't think so.
No.

1516
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,790
The right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be in front of the people

1517
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:34,720
have the guns.
Right?

1518
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,960
What I'm saying.
And then the idea could be that they

1519
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:41,620
meant that you can have the guns in case
you need to formulate the militia to

1520
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:42,454
fight tyranny.

1521
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:45,630
It could be read that way in case.
Yeah.

1522
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,500
Yeah.
Well it's just not giving you any

1523
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:49,810
options and saying shall not be
infringed.

1524
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:51,490
Scroll down.
What is it saying?

1525
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:54,150
What is the Second Amendment?
Actually said the exact same.

1526
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:58,240
That was.
What is the definition of modern

1527
01:16:58,241 --> 01:17:01,750
definition of the rights granted by the
second amendment.

1528
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:05,140
Is there any sort of legal.
Nobody's agreed on this thing.

1529
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:08,230
Yeah.
It seems like these cocksuckers that

1530
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:11,300
wrote that chair,
they've made it so weird,

1531
01:17:11,301 --> 01:17:14,720
but even if you can get them,
like they certainly weren't talking

1532
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:19,010
about Ar fifteens and they weren't
envisioning a government with 5,000

1533
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:20,660
nuclear weapons.
Right?

1534
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:24,080
Then they weren't envisioning 300
million people.

1535
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:27,500
The PROZAC,
the idea of fighting the government just

1536
01:17:27,501 --> 01:17:30,530
really seems weird like so what you're
saying there.

1537
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:34,220
So I was in the Marine Corps.
What you're saying then is that if they

1538
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:37,640
make a wall like trump gets into office
and he says,

1539
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,510
all right,
that's it.

1540
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:42,770
We're going to crack down on our people.
You think that I'm going to come after

1541
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,210
you for that.
Come on,

1542
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,190
come on.
Like the the most.

1543
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:48,320
Some people will.
People at our military will not do that.

1544
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,960
These generals aren't going to do that.
They're not going to command their their

1545
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:52,730
members.
Do you have a military coup?

1546
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,970
You probably would,
but you will have some people that are

1547
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:59,900
willing to comply,
but you are saying that your friends and

1548
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:04,250
brothers and sisters that are in the
armed forces are going to turn their

1549
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:07,400
guns on their friends and family.
Get the fuck out.

1550
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,890
That's interesting because you could
make that same argument about the

1551
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:12,200
police.
You're saying that your friends and

1552
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:14,690
brothers and sisters that are in the
police are going to turn their guns on

1553
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:15,890
the civilians,
so they do.

1554
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:19,160
They do,
but that's a small amount of people that

1555
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:19,994
are affected.

1556
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:22,910
So if you're talking about affecting the
entire country,

1557
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:26,870
then those people will have that
personal effect because it's not just

1558
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,090
there,
they're turning on their own family.

1559
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:33,110
They're not just turning the same
argument that a small amount of

1560
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:36,380
noncompliant people would be the ones
that the military would have to go

1561
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:37,580
against.
Yeah,

1562
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:39,020
I mean,
I guess if you have that kind of

1563
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:40,070
scenario,
sure.

1564
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,260
It's Kinda the same.
They're literally say they were to come

1565
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:45,230
take all the guns and they were going to
do it by force.

1566
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,180
Right.
You're also seeing this huge force for

1567
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,530
one,
the military is not allowed to operate

1568
01:18:48,531 --> 01:18:50,330
on our soil,
but they already do.

1569
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,790
They're already rolling the national
guard through cities.

1570
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:57,791
And if you look at,
well have a well regulated militia.

1571
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,650
Yeah.
Look,

1572
01:19:00,651 --> 01:19:03,020
I mean when you look at the tanks and
some of the,

1573
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,100
uh,
the,

1574
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:09,300
the fucking military vehicles that
they're using in some of these riot

1575
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,110
drill militarization of police is a
separate,

1576
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:13,430
a separate argument.
Well,

1577
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:16,010
it is a separate argument,
but it becomes a military then.

1578
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,050
I mean,
you're talking about war machines,

1579
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,530
that's something that clearly wasn't
envisioned and so I would rather you

1580
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:24,180
didn't open up that.
It's another channel.

1581
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,700
Arms Man.
Fuck,

1582
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:27,690
where's this going?
Right?

1583
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:29,460
Yeah,
this is it.

1584
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:34,490
It's a very unusual sort of a debate
because I see both sides.

1585
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:39,050
I absolutely see both sides.
Just remember that equation though.

1586
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:41,780
The both sides of that equation where
they can be logical.

1587
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:44,420
One side of that equation is death.

1588
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:50,030
Well,
and the other argument would be that

1589
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:53,420
protecting yourself against death is a
right,

1590
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,510
but we know that if you want to have a
safer society,

1591
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:59,600
if you want to live in Australia,
you have to get rid of the Goddamn guns.

1592
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,070
Yeah,
but Australia so different than adults.

1593
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,640
I just don't buy those small.
I don't buy that.

1594
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:09,990
We buy it this way by it this way.
How many mass shootings have there ever

1595
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:11,970
been in California besides San
Bernardino?

1596
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,590
Take San Bernardino out of the mix.
How many black people in the hood that

1597
01:20:16,591 --> 01:20:18,090
we don't hear about?
Hm,

1598
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:22,470
okay.
Mass shootings in this country daily,

1599
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,350
so you're going to get them every week
or two weeks in California.

1600
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,530
Do they really get them every week or
two weeks in California?

1601
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,910
Yeah.
You just don't hear about them because

1602
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:31,390
you're tall because they happen in
Compton.

1603
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,160
No one gives a shit.

1604
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,000
Right,
and you're.

1605
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:37,200
You're talking about people who are
criminals shooting other criminals and

1606
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:39,990
that's one of the arguments that gun
control,

1607
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:43,680
anti gun control people use against
people that talk about how many people

1608
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:45,720
get shot.
It's how many people.

1609
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,660
Like when you look at the numbers of
people that get shot in this country,

1610
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:52,500
there are also calculating the number of
people that are shot by law enforcement

1611
01:20:52,501 --> 01:20:54,270
officers.
Oh sure.

1612
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:57,300
They do know they don't even get counted
as they don't get reported to the FBI.

1613
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,940
The Guardian just figured out how many
people got shot.

1614
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:02,820
The Twenty 15 is the first year we
figured out how many people got shot by

1615
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:04,050
police in this country.
Okay,

1616
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:07,650
but it is 2016 and we do calculate,
you know,

1617
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:10,940
the newspaper does it,
the federal government or nobody doesn't

1618
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:14,670
look up statistics of how many people
are killed by guns every year.

1619
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:19,080
They do include bad guys killed by cops.
Know what?

1620
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:21,790
No.
So an argument that Ted nugent is don't

1621
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,450
count as homicides either.
Well,

1622
01:21:23,451 --> 01:21:25,590
we're not talking about homicides were
just talking about the them.

1623
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,390
It doesn't count.
It doesn't count.

1624
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,070
No,
it doesn't count against our homicide

1625
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:30,680
count because it's considered justified,
justified.

1626
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:32,490
Homicides don't count,
but deaths,

1627
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:34,770
they don't.
I don't think they use the word homicide

1628
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:36,900
when they're counting firearm deaths.
Interesting point.

1629
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,200
Let's follow that up because this was
what a Ted nugent and Piers Morgan,

1630
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:43,260
I can't believe I'm using Ted nugent.
One appears.

1631
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,730
Well,
he's piece of shit,

1632
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,480
but he what his argument with Ted
Nugent,

1633
01:21:48,481 --> 01:21:50,510
he got shredded and then argument
because he,

1634
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:55,580
he went into it on armed with facts and
nugent spews this out every point he

1635
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:57,091
can,
and by the way,

1636
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:59,190
he would argue with you all day.
Sure.

1637
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:00,810
But that's,
that's arguing with crazy person.

1638
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:03,180
He's allegedly was crazy.
A little crazy.

1639
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,023
That's not go.

1640
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:08,820
There are certain people I'm willing to
call out from time to time.

1641
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:12,150
That'd be one of them.
You think Ted knew just crazy is crazy

1642
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,540
bottom.
Have you seen him talk clearly crazy.

1643
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,390
He's going to argue that until the end
of day you can.

1644
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,830
He's one of those people.
You can put the evidence in front of him

1645
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,950
day in and day out and he'll just move
the goal and moved the goalpost and no

1646
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:25,170
one's interested in having an argument
with somebody who's just going to

1647
01:22:25,171 --> 01:22:27,780
continually move posts.
I don't know about all that.

1648
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,170
I don't know if he would move the
goalposts.

1649
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:34,020
Say the one thing that he makes coherent
arguments about is in fact against gun

1650
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:35,850
control.
What do we got there at Jamie?

1651
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,243
I'm halfway

1652
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,510
something,
but I got this,

1653
01:22:38,511 --> 01:22:40,080
uh,
from the Washington Post,

1654
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:45,050
this article that starts with the year
of 1000 people nearly being shot by

1655
01:22:45,051 --> 01:22:46,490
police.
That sound as annoying.

1656
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,353
But,
um,

1657
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:51,260
it says right here they start to compile
a record of every fatal police shooting

1658
01:22:51,261 --> 01:22:55,250
in the nation as of 20 15 something no
government agency had done.

1659
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:59,180
It started after Michael Brown shooting.
That was when they started looking into

1660
01:22:59,181 --> 01:22:59,820
it.

1661
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:03,870
British newspaper did that Goddamn
commies or whatever they are.

1662
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,010
It's Washington Post,
but other posts

1663
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,850
so sought to compile a record.
This is a Washington Post.

1664
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:14,380
The Guardian started,
but it says the post sought to compile a

1665
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:16,580
record of every fatal police shooting in
the nation.

1666
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,230
Two thousand 15 something no government
agency had done the project,

1667
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:23,500
began after police officers shot and
killed Michael Brown in Ferguson,

1668
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:27,600
Missouri in August of 2014,
provoking several nights of fire rise,

1669
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:27,911
blah,
blah,

1670
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:29,920
blah.
Race remains the most volatile

1671
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:32,350
flashpoint in any accounting of police
shooting.

1672
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,320
The black men make up only six percent
of the US population.

1673
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:40,060
They account for 40 percent of the
unarmed men shot to death by police this

1674
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:43,060
year.
The Post database shows in the majority

1675
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:46,360
of cases which police shot and killed a
person who had attacked someone with a

1676
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:48,910
weapon or brandished a gun.
The person who was shot was white.

1677
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,610
Hmm.
Interesting.

1678
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,100
That's interesting.
Why hasn't the majority of cases in

1679
01:23:57,101 --> 01:24:00,030
which police shot and killed a person
who had attacked someone with a weapon

1680
01:24:00,031 --> 01:24:01,960
or brandished a gun?
The person was shot,

1681
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:04,780
was white,
but a huge disproportionate number three

1682
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:08,260
and five of those killed after
exhibiting less threatening behavior

1683
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:12,700
were black or Hispanic,
so meaning they valued the life less of

1684
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:16,450
people who are black or Hispanic.
They were quicker to shoot them with

1685
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:20,140
less threatening behavior than they
would with white people regardless,

1686
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,790
regardless of race and more than a
quarter of the cases,

1687
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:26,830
the fatal encounter involved officers
pursuing someone on foot or by car

1688
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:30,250
making chases one of the most common
scenarios in the data.

1689
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,773
Hmm.

1690
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:34,790
That's interesting.
That's interesting that it's shooting

1691
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:36,860
more white people,
but I guess there are more white,

1692
01:24:36,861 --> 01:24:39,590
more white people.
It's because there's one percent of the

1693
01:24:39,591 --> 01:24:41,060
population.
It's probably more than that,

1694
01:24:41,061 --> 01:24:43,000
right?
How many of them?

1695
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:44,750
White people either see.
It's getting down.

1696
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,480
It's going down slowly.
Brown people are fucking their way up to

1697
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:50,720
the top.
We joke about that.

1698
01:24:50,721 --> 01:24:53,450
How?
What does that movie where everything

1699
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:57,020
goes crazy stupid?
Come on.

1700
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,340
Which one?
Michael Douglas.

1701
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,910
No purge.
No.

1702
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,180
Idiocracy,
yeah,

1703
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:02,750
yeah,
yeah.

1704
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,730
Okay.
So like the silly one,

1705
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,910
we know,
we know that the more educated someone

1706
01:25:07,911 --> 01:25:09,800
is,
the less kids they have.

1707
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,990
So as soon as you do that you go,

1708
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,890
oh no,
fuck.

1709
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:17,400
All the smart people don't have kids.
Right.

1710
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:22,610
And everybody that's poor as poor kids.
So like that's why another reason why we

1711
01:25:22,621 --> 01:25:24,060
have to educate.
Yeah,

1712
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:29,930
the counter to overpopulation that when
they look at the charts and graphs that

1713
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:30,860
when you,
uh,

1714
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:35,490
in industrialized nations,
when they become more closer to the

1715
01:25:35,491 --> 01:25:38,190
first world,
they have less children.

1716
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,230
China.
Yeah.

1717
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,880
But it's also,
they're also puck and working more

1718
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:45,000
grinding son necessarily.
Good.

1719
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:48,510
My might be better off being poor with a
bunch of kids and be happy.

1720
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,850
All right.
So we know that the most likely time to

1721
01:25:50,851 --> 01:25:53,550
get to a shooting is in a chase.
Yeah.

1722
01:25:53,551 --> 01:25:55,920
So we owe chase story and we should
lighten this up a little bit.

1723
01:25:55,921 --> 01:25:56,754
Okay.
Let's.

1724
01:25:56,850 --> 01:26:01,850
So this is a story.
This is the story that we just got

1725
01:26:02,311 --> 01:26:04,010
sidetracked from

1726
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,740
the first conversation.
We're in the middle of talking about it.

1727
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:08,390
We never got to it.
So.

1728
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,670
All right.
We were talking Jamie and I earlier

1729
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:12,770
about it would probably be pretty cool.
We can probably pull this up on street

1730
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:16,070
maps,
so let's go to the 1800 block of West

1731
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:17,690
Pratt.
We can actually look at it.

1732
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,190
Okay,
interesting.

1733
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,690
Anybody who's got their finger on the
send button right now,

1734
01:26:25,691 --> 01:26:30,691
ready to send an evil email or twitter,
but just relax.

1735
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:33,370
This is a debate folks.
This is a conversation.

1736
01:26:33,371 --> 01:26:36,820
I know you wish you were here.
She could yell at Mike or me.

1737
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,050
I don't know.
You said a pretty a.

1738
01:26:38,051 --> 01:26:39,970
you've made a couple of points that I
didn't even think about that.

1739
01:26:39,971 --> 01:26:42,490
We're pretty darn liberal.
I'm pretty liberal.

1740
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:45,750
I'm a fucking confusing motherfucker.
If you're trying to pigeonhole me.

1741
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,750
I'm a.
I'm a liberal Hippie who owns guns and

1742
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:54,190
hunts and loves weed and gay people.
I love.

1743
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:55,570
I love everybody.

1744
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,460
All right.
Can we do.

1745
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,750
Can we go to.

1746
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,410
Okay,
so this is the uh,

1747
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,380
so go down to that red awning and turn
around.

1748
01:27:05,381 --> 01:27:07,120
First of all,
how dope is Google maps?

1749
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:11,590
It's crazy where we're traveling through
Baltimore right now on Jamie's

1750
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:13,240
computers.
This is madness.

1751
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,570
When we see in people's license plates
and shit,

1752
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:20,140
that's so weird that they can do that.
They could just zoom in if caught people

1753
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:22,750
coming out of whorehouse yeah,
they have.

1754
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:24,490
People have sued because the Google
cars.

1755
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,530
Yeah,
the Google car drove by right when

1756
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:28,740
they're just lighting up a cigarette.

1757
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,880
All right.
Face.

1758
01:27:30,881 --> 01:27:31,714
They'll left Jamie.

1759
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:35,800
Okay.
So this is a really dilapidated

1760
01:27:35,801 --> 01:27:39,280
neighborhood in Baltimore.
We don't need to necessarily see it,

1761
01:27:39,281 --> 01:27:43,660
but we're dealing with dea.
A space h o o d.

1762
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,850
okay.
I'm sorry.

1763
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:52,090
Go left it.
Go down the street a little bit more

1764
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,880
by the way,
since we're talking about Baltimore.

1765
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,340
Shout out to my brother John.
Rollo.

1766
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,400
Baltimore.
Alright.

1767
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:03,270
So this is one of my ground control mma.
Go there.

1768
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:05,340
Learn how to fight.
Right?

1769
01:28:05,341 --> 01:28:08,580
So I'm going to tell the story if I
could get my bearings right because it

1770
01:28:08,581 --> 01:28:10,260
doesn't seem like I'm going to be able
to pull it off.

1771
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,430
It's okay.
Alright.

1772
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,630
So anyway,
I'll just tell the story.

1773
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:18,420
So one of my favorite times ever,
best night ever had as a cop,

1774
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:24,870
we were working in major case squad and
we had been assigned a new vr.

1775
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,330
Oh,
which is a violent repeat offender

1776
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,780
target to go after.
You're going to hear a lot of these in,

1777
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:33,900
a lot of chiefs are starting to push
this out again,

1778
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,070
which is the violent repeat offender
where they have people with um,

1779
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:40,950
so they,
they do like this predictiveness that

1780
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:44,400
these are the people that were likely to
get shot or likely to do shootings or

1781
01:28:44,401 --> 01:28:45,234
something like that.

1782
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,210
So we want to focus all of our
enforcement efforts on them to get them

1783
01:28:48,211 --> 01:28:50,880
on anything.
It doesn't work.

1784
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:53,130
But regardless,
that's what I was doing at the time.

1785
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And we had a guy set up to the bar and
at the bar and we knew that this gang go

1786
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:04,530
in and out of this bar.
So we had a guy sit in,

1787
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:07,830
covert in a van and watch the bar
because we,

1788
01:29:07,831 --> 01:29:11,160
our whole intent was to take pictures,
take pictures,

1789
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,130
document who is going in and try and see
some associations.

1790
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:18,600
And me and another car.
We were hiding away,

1791
01:29:18,601 --> 01:29:21,540
just waiting to see what he reported.
Maybe we could follow somebody,

1792
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:25,830
things like that.
And we're talking and I spent hours.

1793
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:30,831
We're on like our 10 sitting there,
nothing going on and we had a secure

1794
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:34,380
channel so we could just talk back and
forth on our radio and they're talking

1795
01:29:34,381 --> 01:29:35,690
about sports or something.

1796
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,380
Had to be soccer,
baseball because it was so nice to give

1797
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:40,590
a shit about.
So everybody's bitching,

1798
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,230
going back on the radio,
just talk and trying to pass the time.

1799
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:45,990
And then the guy watching and covert,
he goes,

1800
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:47,700
finally here and coming here.
He said,

1801
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:49,350
God,
would you shut the fuck up?

1802
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,660
Shut up.
They're robbing the store next to me

1803
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,100
right now.
I'm watching them.

1804
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,810
I could see that it's a silver 38 into
dude's hand robbing the store.

1805
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,740
Shut the fuck up and get over here.
So we're like,

1806
01:29:58,770 --> 01:29:59,130
alright,
alright,

1807
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:02,010
alright.
So he's calling it out and these guys

1808
01:30:02,011 --> 01:30:04,770
running,
they get into a getaway car and go

1809
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:09,771
around the block and we get behind them.
So we're following them and they know

1810
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:13,290
this is a fresh robbery and so they got
hand guns in the car and everything.

1811
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,290
Do they know you're following?
Nope.

1812
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,600
So we have our cars and we're following
behind him and we're in this area where

1813
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:24,720
you have the one district to the left,
to the west,

1814
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:26,510
the southwest.
You have the western district in north

1815
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,220
and the southern till left.
So they called the Tri district but

1816
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:31,860
we're kind of in this area where
communications are going to be weird

1817
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:33,300
because these are all different
channels.

1818
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,840
So I'm riding with the sergeant.
I was a detective at the time and say to

1819
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:40,270
him,
uh,

1820
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,100
I'm going to get on southern channel.
You get on a southwest and coordinate

1821
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,810
that way.
We can call this out.

1822
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,270
So I get on the radio and I'm calling.
I'm like,

1823
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,220
I need a 10:31,
uh,

1824
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:52,920
on the southern channel and everybody
keeps talking.

1825
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,370
We're trying to follow him.
I need a 10:31 on the southern channel.

1826
01:30:56,371 --> 01:30:58,530
And I'm looking at him like,
why the fuck don't they shut up?

1827
01:30:58,530 --> 01:30:59,430
Like,
I don't understand.

1828
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,860
It's like the 10,
33 fucking asshole,

1829
01:31:01,861 --> 01:31:03,060
like Oh,
okay.

1830
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:08,080
So I'll get on radio 10:30 to 10,
31 is to this day three is an emergency.

1831
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:14,520
So I get on there and we're,
we're calling it out the car going

1832
01:31:14,521 --> 01:31:17,430
westbound,
Lombard and where we're following it and

1833
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:21,360
we're coming up to the shopping center.
Turns left on Thompson or the cars full

1834
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:23,760
of people.
It gets to the,

1835
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:26,670
goes through the shopping center and it
stops at a stop sign,

1836
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:29,310
but there's a car in front of it and
we're thinking,

1837
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:30,780
all right,
we're going to have to light it up here.

1838
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:35,220
But that car,
like it always moves right soon as we

1839
01:31:35,221 --> 01:31:36,054
hit the lights.
You can,

1840
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:41,330
you can bet that car is going to move.
So we had the lights anyway and the car

1841
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:46,370
stops in the front row so they can't get
past right.

1842
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:50,790
So they all bail out a one run.
So there's four people in the car.

1843
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:52,830
One goes one way,
one goes back the other way,

1844
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:56,250
one goes for,
one goes behind and I jump out of the

1845
01:31:56,251 --> 01:32:00,040
car because uh,
let's see.

1846
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:02,530
Alright.
So I leave my radio by accident and I

1847
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:05,230
drop it because,
let's be honest,

1848
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:08,710
I,
I see a guy running with a gun out of a

1849
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:12,310
car and I'm still like in Jack Rabbit
bowed,

1850
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:13,720
you know I'm,
I'm going on.

1851
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,080
That's when people shoot people,
right?

1852
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:16,510
Right.
I'm getting him.

1853
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:20,770
So I take off without the,
without my radio chasing.

1854
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:22,480
This dude going behind the shopping
center.

1855
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:27,400
The sergeant,
he forgot to put the car in park so he

1856
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:30,520
knows I don't have my radio.
He starting to panic about where I'm

1857
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:33,550
going.
He has to dive back into the car to put

1858
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:36,610
it on park so it doesn't hit the
suspect's car.

1859
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:39,310
And then the non suspect car in front of
them,

1860
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:43,810
the everybody goes running.
I'm chasing behind him and I've got my

1861
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:45,570
gun out and I'm running and I'm saying,
you know,

1862
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:47,850
hey,
I'm going to fucking shoot Yo.

1863
01:32:47,851 --> 01:32:51,100
You better stop now.
But I could tell he eat when he's

1864
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:53,860
running.
He's fucking pure panic.

1865
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,860
Like I had a moment of empathy for him
like you could.

1866
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,860
He was just like,
fuck fuck,

1867
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:00,880
fuck,
fuck.

1868
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:02,650
Running with that gun in his hand.
I'm like,

1869
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:03,640
Oh,
you better drop it,

1870
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:08,110
but running some guy comes out of the
woods for behind the shopping center.

1871
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,430
It's a fucking cop from the southwest
who heard us on the radio plainclothes

1872
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:16,450
cop.
So the guy froze the gun and he tries to

1873
01:33:16,451 --> 01:33:17,920
throw it up onto the roof of the
building,

1874
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:22,680
but it's pathetically just hits the
building and staff at,

1875
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:24,580
uh,
the guy coming out of the woods.

1876
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:26,410
I yelled at him to get him while I run
it back,

1877
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:29,070
go back and get the gun.
You got to get the gun first.

1878
01:33:29,071 --> 01:33:30,820
Uh,
if you're smart because that could end

1879
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:32,470
up with somebody else's hands or or
whatever.

1880
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:36,520
And we'll get him back.
And so at that moment,

1881
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:40,180
unbeknownst to me,
all those districts were like all

1882
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:43,360
coordinators,
like this moment of serendipity and

1883
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:46,300
policing,
southern district patrol came up and got

1884
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:49,960
one of the guys and like Western patrol,
got one of the guys and southwest

1885
01:33:49,961 --> 01:33:52,390
commander was in the area,
was there and that drug unit was there

1886
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:54,790
helping me.
And we caught every single person,

1887
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,030
bring them back.
We got like four guns.

1888
01:33:58,230 --> 01:34:03,230
We get everything rolling them over
fucking people we were looking for by

1889
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:09,250
mere coincidence,
half a gag that we were looking for to

1890
01:34:09,251 --> 01:34:14,251
go into the Bar,
robbed the store that was next to our

1891
01:34:14,261 --> 01:34:17,950
guy in covert and we started our case
there which ended up being completely

1892
01:34:17,951 --> 01:34:22,510
successful because we had this huge
jumpstart of just dumb ass luck.

1893
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,310
That does sound like dumb ass luck
because called 10:31 AM,

1894
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,720
10:33,
forgot to put the car in park.

1895
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:31,240
You left your radio behind that.
And that's typical,

1896
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,010
you know,
so that's the way it is and that's a

1897
01:34:33,011 --> 01:34:36,610
situation where you do shoot like people
shoot in that situation,

1898
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,090
but I think people think,
I haven't been there.

1899
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,720
Who you haven't been,
you know who they are.

1900
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:47,170
They're all over the internet,
the twitter trolls and stuff or people

1901
01:34:47,171 --> 01:34:49,070
who want to get credit to other cops,
you know,

1902
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:49,960
they think,
oh,

1903
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:52,660
you're just talking about Baltimore.
You've never actually done anything.

1904
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:55,510
What did you actually do?
And those are the situations where you

1905
01:34:55,511 --> 01:34:57,650
get into these shootings,
right?

1906
01:34:57,651 --> 01:35:01,520
Where you could have easily shot that
guy who was running with a gun and

1907
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:05,130
that's what the statistics show happens.
A lot of the time that would have

1908
01:35:05,131 --> 01:35:09,050
dramatically affected me,
dramatically affected him and everyone

1909
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:09,884
around.

1910
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:15,020
But what this kid was doing in the end
was being part of a drug deal,

1911
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:20,140
trying to do robberies,
trying to fucking eat and survive and

1912
01:35:20,691 --> 01:35:25,100
yet we had those guns.
So you have this poverty and you have

1913
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:30,101
this fighting for resources and so they
chose that to rob the store and to being

1914
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:34,130
in these gangs.
But if they didn't have those guns,

1915
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:38,360
how differently would that have been?
Probably quite a bit.

1916
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:39,160
Yeah.
So.

1917
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,950
So when you talk about saturation
mainly,

1918
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,440
look in that incident we got lucky.
Everything went fine and it had

1919
01:35:45,441 --> 01:35:48,380
potential to ballpark.
Luckily we were all competent in that

1920
01:35:48,381 --> 01:35:50,870
unit,
but sorta thanks.

1921
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:54,620
I was the youngest one was the rookie.
Cut Me some slack,

1922
01:35:55,460 --> 01:36:00,460
but you had 30 guns going around in that
situation and it's just like,

1923
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,000
oh,
you just don't.

1924
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:07,060
Like England doesn't do this.
You don't see other countries like this

1925
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:11,480
where this all could have just went
bonkers because we're trying to respond

1926
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:16,481
to a situation in a way go after people
and put them in cells because we have

1927
01:36:17,331 --> 01:36:18,920
this,
these guns everywhere,

1928
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:20,570
and they're fighting for these
resources,

1929
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:21,980
but that's where we have to stop and
say,

1930
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:23,810
well,
why are they here?

1931
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:27,260
What got us to this point?
Instead,

1932
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:31,490
what we continue to do is we just throw
that group into jail and the very next

1933
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:33,500
time it took us like six months to take
the whole group down.

1934
01:36:33,501 --> 01:36:36,740
We've got everybody federally indicted,
but as soon as we do that,

1935
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:40,660
the next group just steps up because we
didn't take a moment to look at the

1936
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:41,541
causation.
Well,

1937
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:42,740
you know,
the old argument,

1938
01:36:42,741 --> 01:36:45,200
if you outlaw guns,
only outlaws will have guns.

1939
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:48,110
Right?
Well,

1940
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,880
I mean,
that's circular logic to it is,

1941
01:36:49,881 --> 01:36:53,960
but when you're dealing with a supply
that already exists in the hundreds of

1942
01:36:53,961 --> 01:36:56,120
millions,
it's pretty logical actually.

1943
01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:57,800
Yeah.
I mean,

1944
01:36:57,801 --> 01:37:00,710
it's gonna happen,
but you have to go door to door and dig

1945
01:37:00,711 --> 01:37:03,320
into people's basements.
But if you make guns illegal,

1946
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,990
then uh,
then the only people that have guns are

1947
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,660
law abiding people.
What do you mean?

1948
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,790
No?
And completely legal.

1949
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:14,050
Completely legal.
So that's why what you mean?

1950
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:15,800
Yeah.
So that's why it's a circular logic.

1951
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:18,080
So because those are.
The criminals are still criminals.

1952
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:22,010
Even if the guns are illegal,
it's not everyone's on a law abiding

1953
01:37:22,011 --> 01:37:24,500
citizen that has a gun.
If you give a gun to a criminal,

1954
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:28,370
right.
But if you don't have the law in place

1955
01:37:28,371 --> 01:37:31,220
to make it criminal.
And that's the thing we're saying,

1956
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:34,640
well only bad guys will have guns if we
outlaw them.

1957
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:36,440
All right,
well yeah,

1958
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:38,900
because we outlawed them all.
I mean that's just,

1959
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:41,600
it's circular logic.
So if we have the law first,

1960
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:43,550
because you're not changing the gun
ownership,

1961
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:45,230
you're just changing the law.
Right?

1962
01:37:45,231 --> 01:37:47,990
But you're already.
We've already made it illegal for people

1963
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:52,530
that are felons to possess firearms.
Yeah.

1964
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,740
But when you have that level of
saturation,

1965
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:56,190
obviously it doesn't work.

1966
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,320
Right?
But it gets back to the same issue.

1967
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,750
Like how would you ever pass?
It's like trying to get,

1968
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:03,960
you know,
it's like taking a bucket of water and

1969
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:06,510
thrown it into the ocean and trying to
get that fresh water out.

1970
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:11,810
Like how do you get out the guns that
are in the stop adding salt so we can't

1971
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:16,950
instantly solve it.
We just have to stop doing it the wrong

1972
01:38:16,951 --> 01:38:18,150
way.
That's like the drug war.

1973
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:21,240
I mean you,
you've been into the drug war so you

1974
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:23,040
know,
without a doubt it doesn't work.

1975
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:25,800
But what are we still doing?
And like it's,

1976
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:27,330
I know we're slowly moving away from
that.

1977
01:38:27,331 --> 01:38:29,160
Sure.
I mean we should stop right now.

1978
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:33,510
I mean like you can literally just
stopped it just as quickly as we started

1979
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:34,380
it.
We can say okay,

1980
01:38:34,381 --> 01:38:37,500
we're not going to imprison people for
those offenses.

1981
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:40,170
If they get into crime and they shoot
somebody,

1982
01:38:40,171 --> 01:38:42,240
well then go after them for the
shooting.

1983
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:47,040
But what we do is we put that law in
there and we make it,

1984
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,200
you know,
with like we're creating this,

1985
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:52,110
we know what's wrong and we know to just
stop this.

1986
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:53,460
So with the guns,
you know,

1987
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:58,461
if he just stopped manufacturing them,
we'll get somewhere if you just stopped

1988
01:38:58,741 --> 01:39:02,340
locking people up for the drug war were
get somewhere and improving that.

1989
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:04,440
But we're not.
We're just keep doing the scenes.

1990
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:09,150
So it's been a year since I was here and
we discussed these drug war issues.

1991
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:13,110
We haven't really moved the bar much
more.

1992
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:16,890
The only thing that it is up for ballot
and several different states.

1993
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,840
Marijuana,
of course not,

1994
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:23,900
not other drugs and slowly but surely it
will become legal throughout the United

1995
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,580
States.
Most likely now Washington DC is legal.

1996
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:30,060
There's a lot of places that are illegal
now that weren't legal before and then

1997
01:39:30,061 --> 01:39:32,970
it's on the ballot in November in
California and several other states.

1998
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:37,971
I believe that other states as well.
But ca marijuana is just one really

1999
01:39:39,301 --> 01:39:41,520
benign law.
I mean it's really,

2000
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:44,370
it's,
it's a rather benign substance in many

2001
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:45,270
ways.
It's not,

2002
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:48,210
it's not a dangerous thing.
It's not a real threat or harm to

2003
01:39:48,211 --> 01:39:51,150
society.
Guns are way more dangerous.

2004
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:53,400
Sure.
So moving that,

2005
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,770
changing that.
But we're creating that,

2006
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,980
you know,
so we create the guns are being used

2007
01:39:58,981 --> 01:40:00,400
because of the drug war.
Right.

2008
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:05,250
And then we have people that are dying
of heroin overdoses because of the drug

2009
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:08,040
war and notice we've had a lot of
improvements when people were dying of a

2010
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:10,500
heroin overdose is now that it's in
Massachusetts and stuff.

2011
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:13,020
What do you mean?
In Massachusetts?

2012
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:16,380
Way are like the cops aren't arresting.

2013
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,840
There's a,
there's a chief there that decided he

2014
01:40:18,841 --> 01:40:22,530
was going to be smart and he wasn't
going to lock up the heroin users.

2015
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:25,680
He was going to get them into treatment.
[inaudible] has had excellent success

2016
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:31,160
with the heroin problem.
That was a one on one of those cnn shows

2017
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,290
was detailing what actually went,
went down.

2018
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,790
Oh,
it was Anthony Bourdain show.

2019
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:39,390
They were talking about how what,
what really happened was so many people

2020
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:44,391
got addicted to Oxycontin is because of
prescription drug companies pushing that

2021
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:46,510
shit where people,
you know,

2022
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,740
when people are like little small,
minor injuries and they're prescribing

2023
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:54,100
pills that are opiates and highly
addictive.

2024
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,650
They're no different than heroin.
Yeah.

2025
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:57,920
I mean like literally their heroin.
Yeah.

2026
01:40:58,230 --> 01:41:00,940
And so that's money in politics issue.
Again,

2027
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,450
we're not fighting the,
those drug dealers who are getting

2028
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:09,010
everybody hooked on heroin.
We're fighting the drug dealers that are

2029
01:41:09,011 --> 01:41:09,844
in the city still.

2030
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,590
Yeah,
that's a gigantic issue of course.

2031
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:14,090
Um,
and then these people,

2032
01:41:14,091 --> 01:41:17,060
when they started to crack down on
Oxycontin's,

2033
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:21,290
that is when heroin moved in to take its
place because these people are sick.

2034
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,960
They needed their pills,
they didn't get their pill.

2035
01:41:23,961 --> 01:41:25,340
So then they got heroin instead

2036
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:27,360
rent.
Yeah.

2037
01:41:27,361 --> 01:41:28,750
I don't know,
but I mean,

2038
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:33,250
so to move onto some reform measures are
what's being shown in the last year.

2039
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,113
Yeah,
definitely.

2040
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:35,230
Yeah.
Um,

2041
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:37,930
alright.
So let's talk about what happened as the

2042
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:39,390
years gone on.
Um,

2043
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:41,730
after I left here,
uh,

2044
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,140
obviously people picked up and I had
that,

2045
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,940
you know,
the Joe Rogan effect that they,

2046
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,820
everybody always talks about after they
talked to you,

2047
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:53,350
other people started to pay attention.
And I went back to Baltimore,

2048
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:58,560
um,
and his dude sends me an email and it

2049
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:03,040
says they arrange it through leap that
he's going to come visit me and he wants

2050
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,620
to talk about a movie.
Oh Jesus.

2051
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:10,790
And so he calls so they corrupt you,
it would get you and we talk about some

2052
01:42:11,171 --> 01:42:14,980
of these ideas,
a very good movie idea that he as trying

2053
01:42:14,981 --> 01:42:18,130
to kind of put some of these things into
an emotional appeal that people can

2054
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:19,960
understand and,
and comes close to them.

2055
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,830
But what that did was,
is it,

2056
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:27,910
it pushed me to get more involved in
Baltimore so I could get the other

2057
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:34,360
people involved in the project that
would have good ideas and would really

2058
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:38,230
know the streets well and with know the
activism path and what was going on with

2059
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:39,760
black lives matter and everything in
there.

2060
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:44,230
And so I reached out to a bunch of the
activists and we started forming these

2061
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:48,280
tight knit groups and come to find out
this dude doing the movie is matthew

2062
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:50,740
costs of Itch.
And I don't know if he's going to do it

2063
01:42:50,741 --> 01:42:53,530
yet or not,
but he's like this big star in France.

2064
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:56,170
And thinking about doing a sequel to
moving me.

2065
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:59,230
He may call Lehane,
which really talks about these kinds of

2066
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:02,110
things in France.
France had very similar hyper

2067
01:43:02,111 --> 01:43:05,200
segregation problems and ghettoization
20 years ago.

2068
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:10,201
And ended up having riots and they,
they did a lot to fix it and that's what

2069
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:13,450
he's kind of doing like a 20 year
reunion of that.

2070
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:19,260
But getting involved in Baltimore and
meeting everybody I really have been

2071
01:43:19,631 --> 01:43:24,631
like in a school,
I'm a of understanding of what the

2072
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:29,600
cities need and what people are trying
to fight for,

2073
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:32,800
what the black lives matter movement
really means.

2074
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:33,340
Um,
I,

2075
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:38,340
I just didn't,
I had all of those preconceived notions

2076
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,090
of like,
you know,

2077
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,570
being a white hero kind of thing where
you go and you help and like your

2078
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:48,190
bringing your skills down and you don't
realize the things you're saying and how

2079
01:43:48,191 --> 01:43:51,290
you play into privilege and things like
that.

2080
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,560
And getting them going in there with
them.

2081
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,670
Uh,
my,

2082
01:43:56,790 --> 01:44:01,340
my walls against Muslims got got torn
down because I ended up meeting Muslim

2083
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:06,341
activists who were really treat using
religion to do the right things,

2084
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:08,871
you know,
the good things,

2085
01:44:08,871 --> 01:44:13,871
the selective of course,
but getting involved in the movement to

2086
01:44:14,691 --> 01:44:19,310
the point where we're having these,
these groups and we're doing things

2087
01:44:19,311 --> 01:44:20,144
like,
uh,

2088
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,440
having panel discussions.

2089
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,650
And we did like a stop and Frisk for
people so that they would see what it

2090
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:28,400
was like to actually have somebody come
up on you and search through your

2091
01:44:28,401 --> 01:44:31,460
pockets.
And we've been doing documentaries,

2092
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:33,470
uh,
we've been doing protesting where

2093
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:38,620
there's a met this lady Twanda Jones,
who her brother was killed by Baltimore

2094
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:43,160
police officers a couple of years ago
and she's been protesting every single

2095
01:44:43,161 --> 01:44:46,880
Wednesday for two and a half years
fighting for her brother,

2096
01:44:46,881 --> 01:44:48,940
tyrone west and I guess why they do it
on Wednesdays.

2097
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,780
And He,
uh,

2098
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:54,050
he was beaten to death by Baltimore
cops,

2099
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:57,470
like literally beaten to death.
And we wanted to have things like where

2100
01:44:57,471 --> 01:45:00,470
we say,
why don't we have people protesting

2101
01:45:00,471 --> 01:45:02,300
good,
why is it always got to be like burning

2102
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:05,750
down the cvs or something like that.
Whereas all the good people and like I

2103
01:45:05,751 --> 01:45:09,620
was just flabbergasted that they were
everywhere in,

2104
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:12,260
in,
in what everyone thinks is the worst of

2105
01:45:12,261 --> 01:45:15,410
neighborhoods,
was just filled with people trying to do

2106
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:19,520
the right thing and trying to fight for
justice and doing it in the most

2107
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:20,090
peaceful manner.

2108
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:24,170
Her brother was beaten to death by cops
and what she does is peacefully protest

2109
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:27,890
every Wednesday for two and a half years
and doesn't get any attention for that

2110
01:45:27,891 --> 01:45:32,450
when they have other cops that were
those same cops beat this guy,

2111
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:33,870
Abdul Salaam,
uh,

2112
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:38,900
in front of his kid doing the exact same
kind of aggressive enforcement and it.

2113
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:43,580
But it opens up a kind of winded way of
going about it is I got to see the other

2114
01:45:43,581 --> 01:45:48,581
side and that really has affected me.
That being a cop,

2115
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:53,630
you lock them up and you put them into
the cell or are you taking the court and

2116
01:45:53,631 --> 01:45:58,631
the case goes or whatever.
You don't think about what that does on

2117
01:45:58,701 --> 01:46:00,680
the other end.
You never see.

2118
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:04,370
And then I got involved in the
communities and I saw the other side.

2119
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:08,780
I saw what it was like for a guy that
came back from being in prison in

2120
01:46:08,781 --> 01:46:13,781
solitary confinement for three years and
having no hopes of of resources like not

2121
01:46:14,331 --> 01:46:18,250
getting them jobs and having to fight
just to get anything because he had that

2122
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:22,160
that record you,
you get to see that those people you

2123
01:46:22,161 --> 01:46:24,410
locked up,
like they have families who were

2124
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:28,790
profoundly affected by everything that
happened and they're gone for these

2125
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:30,950
years and it's just,
it's been a really like

2126
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:37,790
I get like aggressive and when we're
talking about these conversations about

2127
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:41,030
guns and like because those deaths on
that other side of that equation,

2128
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:43,430
that should became real as compete to
me.

2129
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:48,490
Like those are people now that I know
and I know the families of the people

2130
01:46:48,921 --> 01:46:51,720
who were on the other side of that and
it's really pushing that.

2131
01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:53,030
That's what we,
we,

2132
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:55,560
we need to just really.
Do you guys stop being these tribal

2133
01:46:55,561 --> 01:46:59,910
creatures that can only see the,
those fellow humans that are right with

2134
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:02,100
us,
that we associate as being our team.

2135
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:06,090
Like we're all that team and we have.
We have to start having empathy.

2136
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:08,940
For what these things do to other people
and we have to see this.

2137
01:47:08,941 --> 01:47:13,941
Cops don't see what their actions do in
order to step up and say,

2138
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:15,630
hey,
we shouldn't be doing this.

2139
01:47:15,631 --> 01:47:19,950
We have to get out of this denial bubble
and being involved in the city has just

2140
01:47:19,951 --> 01:47:24,951
given me this huge check on,
on all my privileges and everything that

2141
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:29,940
we have.
We don't understand how much advantages

2142
01:47:29,941 --> 01:47:31,140
we have in life.

2143
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:34,170
It's ridiculous.
The amount of factors that people have

2144
01:47:34,171 --> 01:47:36,990
to fight against that we can't even
register.

2145
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,410
And this is all fairly new to you?
Yeah man.

2146
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:42,210
I'm like,
I saw it evidentially,

2147
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:47,370
but to see it in person,
like the work that.

2148
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:49,320
So the photographer,
Devin Allen,

2149
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:51,210
pull up,
Devin Allen,

2150
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:56,010
he.
He took a picture of my daughter that's

2151
01:47:56,250 --> 01:48:01,250
from a protest it's going to be in and
he's doing this project now where he

2152
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:06,270
took the time magazine cover shoot.
So if you ever saw the time magazine

2153
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:10,410
during the uprising or it says 19,
68 and it's crossed out and says 2016,

2154
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:15,330
because he took that picture as a,
as a a young black kid that used to be a

2155
01:48:15,331 --> 01:48:19,620
drug dealer who picked up a camera as
his identity project kind of thing.

2156
01:48:19,621 --> 01:48:21,450
He didn't know what an identity project
was at that time.

2157
01:48:21,451 --> 01:48:23,430
I didn't know what identity project was
at that time,

2158
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:27,390
but he picked up the camera and started
taking pictures and he got that picture

2159
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:32,720
and he's well known now,
but what he did was he took that and now

2160
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:38,240
he used the publicity from all that and
he gets this Devin Allen.

2161
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:43,980
He gets all these.
He started this project that this

2162
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:48,981
community development called Penn north
and he collects cameras now for all

2163
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:52,200
these kids.
Not that he's getting paid.

2164
01:48:52,201 --> 01:48:53,940
He collects cameras from around the
world,

2165
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:58,860
brings it in,
and now he runs a thing going through in

2166
01:48:58,861 --> 01:49:00,840
sandtown winchester where Freddie gray
was killed.

2167
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:04,290
He takes the,
takes those kids in and teach them

2168
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:07,830
photography and gives them that project
so they have something they can grip

2169
01:49:07,831 --> 01:49:10,950
upon on and they have some they can
build up on.

2170
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:16,050
What was sad about that is that this is
Devin who has no resources.

2171
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:21,140
Who is the kid who was a drug dealer who
has everything bothering him and he is

2172
01:49:21,271 --> 01:49:25,560
investing in those communities and
trying to provide those things to give

2173
01:49:25,561 --> 01:49:28,590
people that,
that identity where they can climb out

2174
01:49:28,591 --> 01:49:32,580
of it and they can become.
They can see that vision of being a

2175
01:49:32,581 --> 01:49:36,480
contributing member to society and like
that's what we all have to do to give

2176
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:39,540
back these neighborhoods.
That's part of the way of fixing it is

2177
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:43,380
if when people want to help,
you literally have to go down there and

2178
01:49:43,381 --> 01:49:46,140
say,
how can I help and do things like that?

2179
01:49:46,141 --> 01:49:47,980
Because what revealing is that?
We

2180
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,890
all have a skill.
His skill is photography,

2181
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:55,870
but your skill is is hunting or comedy
or talking or however you want to go.

2182
01:49:55,871 --> 01:50:00,130
You have these skills that you can teach
and you can pass on so other people can

2183
01:50:00,131 --> 01:50:01,720
see an identity.
Some people can,

2184
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:06,721
so some people can do whatever it is.
We all have these skills and that's how

2185
01:50:07,271 --> 01:50:09,400
we help.
If you want to be somebody that helps

2186
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:12,520
you cities,
you go down there and you help supply

2187
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:16,420
that identity.
I could just see how many white knights

2188
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:19,630
are saying,
I'm going down to the hood right now and

2189
01:50:19,631 --> 01:50:22,010
I'm gonna help gonna just,
well,

2190
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:25,630
I'm fucked up now pants,
but like teeth,

2191
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,630
so at Penn north we created this thing
that,

2192
01:50:28,631 --> 01:50:30,880
well,
they created this thing called the safe

2193
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:34,220
zone and what that is,
it was all worked out with everybody.

2194
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,500
You got to treat everybody like humans.

2195
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:38,380
They worked out with the with the drug
dealers and everything is going on and

2196
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:43,360
they participate in keeping this area of
the city completely safe so that

2197
01:50:43,361 --> 01:50:45,510
everybody can come down there and you
would.

2198
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:47,500
If you go to Baltimore,
you want to be a white knight,

2199
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:50,170
you come down and bought bottom and
reach out to an activist and you want to

2200
01:50:50,171 --> 01:50:52,480
help.
It's not dangerous.

2201
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:56,350
You will be fired and there are plenty
of people that will help you and guide

2202
01:50:56,351 --> 01:51:00,400
you through and what you can do to
contribute to make our society a more

2203
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:03,100
whole place will obviously Baltimore's
in another side of the country.

2204
01:51:03,101 --> 01:51:05,380
There's got to be places around here
that,

2205
01:51:05,381 --> 01:51:08,410
uh,
need some sort of a similar matter where

2206
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:10,240
you are,
they're all the same.

2207
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:15,300
All these cities are saying they're
facing all the same problems and that

2208
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,670
has helped me build this reform
measures.

2209
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:21,400
So my application for Chicago is
completely up.

2210
01:51:21,401 --> 01:51:24,570
If you want to pull up my website,
it's Michael Jr net.

2211
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:28,720
Let me ask you this.
Had you gotten the position in Chicago?

2212
01:51:28,721 --> 01:51:31,360
You were trying to be the police chief
of police in Chicago,

2213
01:51:31,361 --> 01:51:33,550
right?
If you had gotten that position in

2214
01:51:33,551 --> 01:51:35,530
Chicago,
what would you do?

2215
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:37,240
What is your idea?
I mean,

2216
01:51:37,241 --> 01:51:41,710
I'm sure you have a grand plan,
so it's 38 pages of that on this,

2217
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:44,150
but if you could kind of break it down
for us.

2218
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:47,650
Well,
the first thing we have to do is we have

2219
01:51:47,651 --> 01:51:52,420
to give that power away and I think
that's a condition that I have to have

2220
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,240
in order to take the job.
Now I have a friend,

2221
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,141
uh,
who was,

2222
01:51:56,141 --> 01:51:57,550
uh,
actually a driver,

2223
01:51:57,551 --> 01:52:02,551
Warren Chicago who's a cop and he told
me that what's going on in Chicago was

2224
01:52:03,851 --> 01:52:08,170
that they had some pretty high level
drug dealers and gang leaders and then

2225
01:52:08,171 --> 01:52:11,410
they caught those guys and imprison them
and when they imprison them and created

2226
01:52:11,411 --> 01:52:14,860
a power vacuum and in that power vacuum
over the last few years,

2227
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:19,690
you're seeing significant ramp up in
crime or people try to take over these

2228
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:24,610
areas that were under controlled by
other people similar to what happens

2229
01:52:24,611 --> 01:52:27,820
when you see,
when we take over countries like Libya

2230
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:32,890
creates this power vacuum and now you
have a case to almost you say,

2231
01:52:32,891 --> 01:52:35,290
well,
it's worse without Gadhafi than it was

2232
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:36,124
with him.

2233
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:40,630
That's sort of what this guy was telling
me about Chicago.

2234
01:52:40,631 --> 01:52:42,760
Is that accurate as possible?
Um,

2235
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:46,010
one of the big problems with policing is
we think we

2236
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,970
can narrow things down and we can find a
soul causation,

2237
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:52,380
and there just simply isn't any soul
causation.

2238
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:54,080
There has never sold causation in
anything.

2239
01:52:54,081 --> 01:52:56,090
When you're dealing with a mass amount
of human beings,

2240
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,920
uh,
everybody has different reasons.

2241
01:52:57,921 --> 01:52:59,840
You're not going to be able to do
everything perfectly.

2242
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:04,460
And those things can happen perfectly
plausible that it could have happened.

2243
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:09,850
A weird theory that I've started to
recognize is that actually in this

2244
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:12,290
study,
they,

2245
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:18,190
Stefanie Deluca study,
they talk a lot about how these kids are

2246
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:24,830
really more passionate now and they're
exposed to more and you can see that

2247
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:28,100
their work ethic is actually higher than
it was.

2248
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:31,910
We think that they're not working,
but they're achieving things at three to

2249
01:53:31,911 --> 01:53:34,640
400 percent of what their parents
achieved.

2250
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:39,440
So these kids are ambitious and so if
you don't have any other options around,

2251
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:43,760
you have a more ambitious population
that's now doing drug dealing and taking

2252
01:53:43,761 --> 01:53:44,600
over territory.

2253
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:47,870
What do you mean by they're achieving
things three to 400 percent more than

2254
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:49,460
their ranks.
So you have.

2255
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:55,330
So the average in
the nineties for,

2256
01:53:56,540 --> 01:54:01,460
for high school diplomas in college for
residents of a neighborhood like

2257
01:54:01,461 --> 01:54:03,890
sandtown or these east and West
Baltimore neighborhoods,

2258
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:07,940
worst that you can imagine in your head
as far as resources go.

2259
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:13,310
They,
these kids are actually achieving a.

2260
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:16,640
So say their,
their parents got 10 percent high school

2261
01:54:16,641 --> 01:54:19,370
diplomas.
These guys are getting 40 percent high

2262
01:54:19,371 --> 01:54:24,371
school diplomas that our parents were
getting a two percent college degrees.

2263
01:54:24,621 --> 01:54:27,440
These guys are at like 25,
30 percent college degrees.

2264
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:31,970
So they're really excelling but they're
not achieving because of all these other

2265
01:54:31,971 --> 01:54:33,920
barriers as you know.
Um,

2266
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:35,930
so uh,
a guy,

2267
01:54:35,931 --> 01:54:40,931
a black guy with a college degree is
slightly less likely to be employed than

2268
01:54:41,211 --> 01:54:43,790
a white guy with a high school diploma
and a criminal record.

2269
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:49,010
So even though they're getting these
promises that if they play by the rules,

2270
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:50,690
then they're get these things at the
end,

2271
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:54,580
just like poor white American,
West Virginia is at.

2272
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:56,780
And w what happens though is there were
being.

2273
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:00,770
They see these examples of with social
media or whatever,

2274
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:04,220
and they're understanding that if they
push hard,

2275
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:07,220
that's the told their push hard and
achieve these things,

2276
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:10,520
then they'll get these rewards,
but they're not getting these rewards.

2277
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:13,400
They're just not there.
So if you have a more ambitious

2278
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:16,520
population and they're turning to drug
dealing and to crime,

2279
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:21,350
well it's just as likely that they're
also more ambitious and dedicated to

2280
01:55:21,351 --> 01:55:24,680
their criminal endeavors as they were to
their college achievement.

2281
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:27,290
Right.
So they're better criminals because

2282
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:29,390
they're working hard on schools.
Generation improves,

2283
01:55:29,391 --> 01:55:30,270
right?
Yeah.

2284
01:55:30,450 --> 01:55:31,010
Is there,
but there.

2285
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:33,890
Is there any improvement in terms of
crime rates?

2286
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:37,490
Well,
I mean there are crime is still

2287
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,620
dramatically dropping and we are.

2288
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:42,950
We live in the safest era in human
history right now.

2289
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:46,680
We get caught up in a lot of this and
that that made sure that's a guy who can

2290
01:55:46,681 --> 01:55:48,990
say it's a weird argument for the gun
guys are they can just say,

2291
01:55:48,991 --> 01:55:51,240
hey,
we are in the safest environment time in

2292
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:54,030
history ever,
so we have to not get caught up in the

2293
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:55,650
fact that,
like you said,

2294
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:58,290
the odds of things happen,
especially compared to the rest of

2295
01:55:58,291 --> 01:56:01,080
history because of the sheer numbers
you're dealing with.

2296
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:06,030
Well it would seem like crime,
the percentage of people taking crime if

2297
01:56:06,031 --> 01:56:10,860
probably still are about the same and
then or or the amount or the same,

2298
01:56:10,861 --> 01:56:13,440
but the population has grown so you have
a lot,

2299
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:16,890
lot less crime percentage wise when you
ever have before,

2300
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:21,000
but if your criminals are that much
better,

2301
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:24,000
but there's still gonna be ambitious,
but are they that much better?

2302
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:27,360
It seems like it's so much easier to
catch them doing something now than ever

2303
01:56:27,361 --> 01:56:30,270
before,
other than physically catch them but

2304
01:56:30,271 --> 01:56:33,870
mean so much easier to know that that's
really contrary to evidence.

2305
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:37,890
So yeah.
I mean homicide clearance rates from the

2306
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:39,720
eighties were in 80,
90 percent.

2307
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:43,170
Now they're down to 30 to 45 percent.
What does that from?

2308
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:47,310
I think that's from a breakdown of
community relations because we think

2309
01:56:47,311 --> 01:56:48,780
that comps,
comps,

2310
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:52,560
comps aren't the answer.
The community is always the answer and

2311
01:56:52,561 --> 01:56:55,500
so if you want to solve a crime,
you have to have these good

2312
01:56:55,501 --> 01:56:59,430
relationships with your communities in
order for them to even trust you.

2313
01:56:59,431 --> 01:57:01,230
Otherwise the streets are just going to
handle it themselves,

2314
01:57:01,231 --> 01:57:03,420
right?
If the police don't provide justice will

2315
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:06,270
then they will.
So if he can't turn to the police,

2316
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:09,540
that's another factor you get.
There's tons of factors in here and a

2317
01:57:09,541 --> 01:57:12,090
lot of arguments can be made for what it
is,

2318
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:17,390
but the conviction rate has dropped
dramatically and the homicide clearance

2319
01:57:17,761 --> 01:57:18,990
rate has dropped dramatically.

2320
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:22,080
Police are not solving crimes at the
rate they used to.

2321
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,980
Now when you look at an area like
Chicago that has a lot of violence

2322
01:57:25,981 --> 01:57:29,310
connected to the drug war or to the drug
trade,

2323
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:34,370
I should say illegal drug selling,
it's also resources to those.

2324
01:57:34,501 --> 01:57:38,010
So the drug trade fulfills in for lack
of priests of very good point.

2325
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,990
And that's a point that doesn't get
addressed that often.

2326
01:57:39,991 --> 01:57:40,740
Right?
That's a,

2327
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:42,540
that's a very good point.
Now,

2328
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:45,990
what can be done,
what would you have done had you got

2329
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:50,660
that position as well?
So the first thing I have to do here,

2330
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:53,540
here's my model and my fundamental model
is,

2331
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,760
is uh,
I think if you had a business and you

2332
01:57:56,761 --> 01:57:58,380
have a board,
you know,

2333
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,150
yeah,
you have your board of trustees or

2334
01:58:00,151 --> 01:58:04,590
whatever you want to call it.
I want to be a civilian leader of the

2335
01:58:04,591 --> 01:58:07,360
police department,
like a CEO and I wouldn't have like

2336
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,630
officially 49 percent of the power of
the agency.

2337
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:13,830
And then we have like seven people on
this panel who come from the city who

2338
01:58:13,831 --> 01:58:15,270
live in these neighborhoods.
I don't,

2339
01:58:15,271 --> 01:58:19,110
not sure precisely how we pick them out,
can't appoint them because then they

2340
01:58:19,111 --> 01:58:21,170
just become cronies.
Um,

2341
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:25,290
we have some issues with voting that we
may have to work out the details on,

2342
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,510
but the,
the ultimate principles that we would

2343
01:58:27,511 --> 01:58:29,730
have,
the majority of that board would be from

2344
01:58:29,731 --> 01:58:34,080
the poorest of the neighborhoods around.
So you would create a board and what

2345
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:37,530
would,
what would be the picking criteria to

2346
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:40,230
create this board?
Would it be you and other police

2347
01:58:40,231 --> 01:58:41,320
officers?
Would be.

2348
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,010
This should

2349
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,470
be the civilians.
So it has to be the peons pick the

2350
01:58:44,471 --> 01:58:45,540
people that are on.
Yeah,

2351
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:47,020
I think we would have to pick them and
stuff.

2352
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:48,360
Steve.
I think we have to have a vote.

2353
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:51,180
This is,
I don't have that fault completely

2354
01:58:51,181 --> 01:58:52,014
outright.
Okay.

2355
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,760
Uh,
but the majority has to come from the

2356
01:58:53,761 --> 01:58:56,820
poor populations covering the base of
whatever is good for the weakest among

2357
01:58:56,821 --> 01:59:00,540
us is good for the strongest among us.
And then those boards,

2358
01:59:00,541 --> 01:59:05,100
while I run the agency,
I can only argue to them they have 51

2359
01:59:05,101 --> 01:59:08,580
percent of the control.
I have all these things I want to argue

2360
01:59:08,581 --> 01:59:12,600
for.
But it's fundamentally not my agency.

2361
01:59:12,890 --> 01:59:15,770
Okay,
so you would almost give most of the

2362
01:59:15,771 --> 01:59:20,771
control to the rest of the people and
they would work with you.

2363
01:59:21,740 --> 01:59:22,573
Right.
So there,

2364
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:24,200
I'm the CEO there,
the board,

2365
01:59:24,770 --> 01:59:27,050
they're going to come up with that.
We're all going to discuss how we want

2366
01:59:27,051 --> 01:59:30,140
to approach issues and I'm going to
bring my science.

2367
01:59:30,141 --> 01:59:34,340
I'm going to make my cases as much as I
can on the right way to do things.

2368
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:36,230
But if they want to do things another
way,

2369
01:59:36,231 --> 01:59:39,950
it's their agency and that's the.
That's what I would have been done

2370
01:59:39,951 --> 01:59:41,480
anywhere.
Not that I'm aware of.

2371
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:45,510
So your,
your idea is so radical and so way out

2372
01:59:45,511 --> 01:59:49,290
there and that's part of the problem
with getting people to accept it.

2373
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:53,850
So they would have to take a huge chance
and if it failed it would be their

2374
01:59:53,851 --> 01:59:56,970
failure.
Whereas if it fails right now,

2375
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:59,100
here's the trick joke.

2376
01:59:59,790 --> 02:00:02,220
Total cop out in a manner because the
failure.

2377
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:04,380
Is it my fault?
Why?

2378
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:08,240
But I'm saying you will be the board's
fault because they have the agency so

2379
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:10,340
interested.
The people are responsible.

2380
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:13,620
They can't bitch at the mayor.
Right,

2381
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:16,350
because they did it.
It's their agency.

2382
02:00:16,351 --> 02:00:19,530
It's my job to serve them.
It's not my job to serve a mayor.

2383
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:21,960
Right.
It's my job to serve them and carry out

2384
02:00:21,961 --> 02:00:25,170
with.
They want to achieve so I will work at

2385
02:00:25,171 --> 02:00:28,170
achieving with they want to achieve and
establishing the milestones and

2386
02:00:28,171 --> 02:00:31,440
incentives that they think are better
for their neighborhood because they may

2387
02:00:31,441 --> 02:00:36,441
do things which could dramatically have
impacts such as hiring like.

2388
02:00:37,681 --> 02:00:41,790
So right now guys won't hire because
they have a drug complaint or something

2389
02:00:41,791 --> 02:00:43,770
like that.
Or they have a prior arrest record.

2390
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,300
Well,
I think if you get all those poor

2391
02:00:45,301 --> 02:00:47,280
neighborhoods together,
they're going to say,

2392
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:49,770
look,
we know that's bullcrap.

2393
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:52,650
The bad arrest doesn't stop you from
being a good cop.

2394
02:00:52,651 --> 02:00:55,260
That's ridiculous.
And we can let those people in and they

2395
02:00:55,261 --> 02:00:59,310
can take that risk as a whole community.
We can decide these things.

2396
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:04,380
So you're saying make former prisoners
or former criminals turned them into

2397
02:01:04,511 --> 02:01:05,344
police officer?

2398
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:06,660
Not that far,
but sure.

2399
02:01:06,661 --> 02:01:09,270
I mean some of them.
So the difference between them and me,

2400
02:01:09,271 --> 02:01:11,670
we know as the color of my skin and in
the neighborhood I grew up in,

2401
02:01:12,210 --> 02:01:14,160
I could have easily had the criminal
record that they have.

2402
02:01:14,161 --> 02:01:14,800
Yeah,

2403
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,170
I think pretty much anybody could.
Yeah.

2404
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,370
Right.
I mean that's.

2405
02:01:17,371 --> 02:01:21,370
And that's a hard pill to swallow for
folks who have that pull yourself up by

2406
02:01:21,371 --> 02:01:24,700
your bootstraps mentality,
but a lot of who you are and what you

2407
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:27,400
are is luck.
Yep.

2408
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:29,440
Yeah.
Everything important in this country.

2409
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:31,490
One hundred percent shame.
Advantage.

2410
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:34,180
Yeah.
Being born poor in this country is

2411
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:38,740
really way luckier than being born in
the middle class and a lot of other

2412
02:01:38,741 --> 02:01:40,850
countries.
So this board that we have,

2413
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,430
how long do you think is going to take
before they end the drug war?

2414
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:45,590
It's going to take a day.
Yeah,

2415
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:48,020
but they can't do that because it's a
federal decision.

2416
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:49,880
Essentially.
You're talking about the city of

2417
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:51,920
Chicago,
which not even the state of Illinois.

2418
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:54,950
We can.
You can stop you.

2419
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,680
The federal government.
We don't enforce laws.

2420
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:00,590
We don't enforce your law period.
Boy.

2421
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:02,240
Good luck trying to pull that legal.

2422
02:02:02,350 --> 02:02:04,190
The feds have to come in and do it
themselves.

2423
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:06,890
The feds would have to come in and
enforce the law.

2424
02:02:07,230 --> 02:02:11,270
They didn't do it right.
They were doing in Colorado for a while.

2425
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:12,350
Yeah.
They tried.

2426
02:02:12,351 --> 02:02:16,190
That didn't work out well.
Colorado is a perfect example where the

2427
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:21,191
money was so good with the plan that was
initiated where they're making more

2428
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:25,880
money from taxes with marijuana than
they ever did with alcohol,

2429
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:27,890
which is bananas.
Beyond the money.

2430
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:32,720
You have a reduction in crime and in
juvenile usage of marijuana and in drunk

2431
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:33,570
driving.
Yes.

2432
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:35,960
Yeah.
Lowest incidences of drunk driving and

2433
02:02:35,961 --> 02:02:38,540
more than a decade.
It's pretty interesting.

2434
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:41,030
It's pretty interesting because it just
shows you that it was predictable.

2435
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:42,170
Yes.
Well,

2436
02:02:42,171 --> 02:02:45,370
for people like you or I,
but not for the people that were arguing

2437
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:47,330
against it,
they thought it was going to be chaos

2438
02:02:47,331 --> 02:02:50,630
and hippies and they got to like the
town on fire and fuck each other in the

2439
02:02:50,631 --> 02:02:53,060
streets and everybody thought it was
gonna be horrible,

2440
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:57,080
but you're talking about a different
drug when you're talking about Chicago,

2441
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,700
you're talking about heroin and you're
talking about cocaine.

2442
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:02,380
You're talking about methamphetamine,
you're talking to them about MTMA.

2443
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:06,290
These are different drugs and they have
health consequences as well,

2444
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:11,650
so the legalization or the prohibition
with what they have right now is

2445
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:18,860
obviously not working.
The real problem would be if they

2446
02:03:18,861 --> 02:03:23,360
decided to not enforce the drug laws and
they decided to in some way,

2447
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,530
you know,
air quotes,

2448
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,830
legalize these drugs,
what would take places?

2449
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:33,130
You're going to have some blame be
placed on some deaths on your new laws

2450
02:03:35,181 --> 02:03:37,880
and that's going to be paraded out in
front of you.

2451
02:03:37,881 --> 02:03:40,580
This is your responsible for the death
of this young girl.

2452
02:03:40,730 --> 02:03:43,190
She never tried heroin,
but because it was available at seven

2453
02:03:43,191 --> 02:03:45,350
slash 11 and she started snorting it and
then now she's dead.

2454
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:49,370
Somebody's going to get that.
You're going to get that.

2455
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:52,500
That's not the model.
The model.

2456
02:03:52,530 --> 02:03:55,800
So you have prohibition and we were like
we were saying earlier,

2457
02:03:55,801 --> 02:03:57,540
you know what,
what prohibition does,

2458
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:00,420
it's just the terming that they sell it.
Okay.

2459
02:04:00,421 --> 02:04:02,550
It takes the hands and puts it into the
black market.

2460
02:04:02,610 --> 02:04:07,050
Yes,
so well yet heroin is a terrible drug,

2461
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:12,140
but what makes heroin so bad is it's
lack of purity and the environment in

2462
02:04:12,361 --> 02:04:13,560
which you will you get it.

2463
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:15,560
Well also the addictive properties of
it,

2464
02:04:15,590 --> 02:04:18,740
which is why Oxycontin,
even though it's pure and very

2465
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:21,820
measurable,
still has a terrifying effect.

2466
02:04:21,850 --> 02:04:23,570
Right,
but what kind of consequences did you

2467
02:04:23,571 --> 02:04:25,520
say that was?
He said it was a health consequence.

2468
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:30,180
Well,
it has a criminal consequences will

2469
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:32,590
oxycontin's certainly do.
There's a lot of people that get

2470
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:35,630
arrested for illegally possessing and
selling and distributing.

2471
02:04:35,631 --> 02:04:36,590
It's a huge issue.
Right,

2472
02:04:36,650 --> 02:04:37,140
right,
right.

2473
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:40,530
Understand,
I mean the drugs period of health issue.

2474
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,870
Yes.
There are not a criminal issue.

2475
02:04:42,871 --> 02:04:46,350
They're not a prison issue.
There are public health issue,

2476
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:49,410
so we treat that with health
professionals,

2477
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:54,470
not with jail cells in and police.
So while May,

2478
02:04:54,471 --> 02:04:57,860
it's not like I'm saying that the drug
dealers can go out there and just deal

2479
02:04:57,870 --> 02:04:58,950
it.
That's not what I want.

2480
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:03,870
I want a doctor handling everything.
I want it moved into just no different

2481
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:05,520
than alcohol.
Well,

2482
02:05:05,521 --> 02:05:09,300
the problem with the doctor handling is
that's what happened in Florida and what

2483
02:05:09,301 --> 02:05:12,420
happened in Florida.
They developed this environment where

2484
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:17,160
they didn't have a database where they,
the doctors and the pharmaceutical

2485
02:05:17,161 --> 02:05:19,350
companies were all in cahoots and they
said,

2486
02:05:19,351 --> 02:05:21,240
look,
let's just sell the shit out of this.

2487
02:05:21,241 --> 02:05:26,241
And the statistics were staggering.
There was more prescriptions for

2488
02:05:26,341 --> 02:05:31,341
Oxycontin's and opiate pain killers in
Florida than the rest of the United

2489
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:32,390
States combined.

2490
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:35,640
I know that is nuts,
but what were they doing with it?

2491
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:38,440
They were selling it.
They were taking it or selling it

2492
02:05:38,441 --> 02:05:43,441
illegal around the oxycontin express a
documentary that showed that these

2493
02:05:44,761 --> 02:05:49,730
people were bringing it from Florida,
upstate into Georgia and Kentucky,

2494
02:05:49,731 --> 02:05:52,110
but they don't have that market.
They wouldn't have that market in

2495
02:05:52,111 --> 02:05:54,570
Chicago with me.
Right.

2496
02:05:54,571 --> 02:05:58,590
So Florida couldn't do that because you
wouldn't have a market to sell it in.

2497
02:05:58,650 --> 02:06:02,980
So the only reason that that's
the only reason take away the market.

2498
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:07,140
The only reason that exists is because
they can go sell it on the black market.

2499
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:13,470
So if you take away the black market as
being the distributor then so you would

2500
02:06:13,471 --> 02:06:15,420
allow people to just sell it?
No,

2501
02:06:15,421 --> 02:06:15,781
no,
no.

2502
02:06:15,781 --> 02:06:18,810
Only doctors.
Only doctors for those certain drugs

2503
02:06:18,811 --> 02:06:20,280
first.
So cannabis or something like that.

2504
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:25,281
We need to put in a model similar and we
have things in Portugal or what Portugal

2505
02:06:25,501 --> 02:06:28,380
does,
they just decriminalize it so they don't

2506
02:06:28,381 --> 02:06:30,960
put people in prison cells for
possessing it.

2507
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:34,320
And if you want to still go after the
dealers as a half measure,

2508
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:38,130
that's a half measure I'd have to
swallow that I don't completely believe

2509
02:06:38,131 --> 02:06:40,890
in,
but we can work those things out.

2510
02:06:40,891 --> 02:06:43,710
Me and you,
if you're the panel and I'm the CEO,

2511
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:47,850
we can work these things out and come to
a position where we're like,

2512
02:06:47,851 --> 02:06:49,470
okay,
let's try this and if you,

2513
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,630
if you want to go by the incremental
ism,

2514
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:56,610
then we see that that's okay.
Just like in Colorado already has proven

2515
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:59,790
that the cannabis model is fine,
right?

2516
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:03,690
So we can start with the cannabis model
and move that in and then we can say,

2517
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:05,820
alright,
well let's put cocaine into this model

2518
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,390
and then see how that goes.
If you want to be incremental about it,

2519
02:07:09,391 --> 02:07:12,840
I'm fine with that.
The cannabis model,

2520
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:17,770
the problem is the innocuous negative
effects are just.

2521
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:20,580
It's just really the.
There's almost nothing.

2522
02:07:20,581 --> 02:07:24,390
There's so little to fall on that,
but we don't make that case with alcohol

2523
02:07:24,391 --> 02:07:26,460
or tobacco.
That's true.

2524
02:07:26,461 --> 02:07:28,680
But tobacco is not a good one because
it's a long,

2525
02:07:28,681 --> 02:07:33,360
slow death as long as it's.
As long as it takes a long time.

2526
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:34,420
Yeah,
we can accept me.

2527
02:07:34,421 --> 02:07:36,010
And that's how we at it.
It's almost like what

2528
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,750
we're doing cost.
The costs of tobacco is extraordinary on

2529
02:07:40,751 --> 02:07:42,640
our healthcare system.
Oh no doubt about it.

2530
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:44,920
Right.
And when you think about alcohol,

2531
02:07:44,921 --> 02:07:47,890
that's the real argument because alcohol
is one of the easiest drugs to kill

2532
02:07:47,891 --> 02:07:51,010
yourself with people.
I think there's a staggering number.

2533
02:07:51,011 --> 02:07:54,940
I think it's like 10,000 people drink
themselves to death every year just in

2534
02:07:54,941 --> 02:07:58,600
this country,
which is really pretty shocking and that

2535
02:07:58,601 --> 02:08:02,770
doesn't count drunk driving,
alcohol related violence and all the

2536
02:08:02,771 --> 02:08:07,771
other things that go along with it.
The problem with making heroin or

2537
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:12,940
cocaine with decriminalizing it,
but then go after going after the

2538
02:08:12,941 --> 02:08:14,350
dealers is then,
well,

2539
02:08:14,351 --> 02:08:15,760
okay,
if these people get hooked on it,

2540
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,470
where are they going to get it?
Then

2541
02:08:19,730 --> 02:08:22,600
they have to go to a doctor.
I mean it's just the way we have to do

2542
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:24,010
it,
so it is not treatment,

2543
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:26,530
but it then becomes exactly like
Florida.

2544
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:30,850
But remember what we do know.
We do know that every million spent when

2545
02:08:30,851 --> 02:08:33,940
the demand side reduces by 100
kilograms,

2546
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:36,100
right?
So we have to keep focusing on

2547
02:08:36,101 --> 02:08:39,430
education.
I don't if those people that got hooked

2548
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:42,970
on oxy became heroin addicts,
if they had the education that this was

2549
02:08:42,971 --> 02:08:44,590
the path they were going to go,
one,

2550
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:48,460
you got to believe that a significant
percentage of them wouldn't have gone

2551
02:08:48,461 --> 02:08:49,600
that path.
Yeah,

2552
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:52,420
I mean now we're all aware of it and I
know plenty of people now that the

2553
02:08:52,421 --> 02:08:54,220
doctor says here's some oxy,
and they're like,

2554
02:08:54,221 --> 02:08:54,671
no,
no,

2555
02:08:54,671 --> 02:08:55,540
no,
no,

2556
02:08:55,541 --> 02:08:57,700
give me something else.
What do you do with people that are so

2557
02:08:57,701 --> 02:08:59,260
fucking dumb?
They just want to party.

2558
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:01,790
And you got some of those things that a
little bit harder,

2559
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:04,120
just like you gotta let them drink
themselves to death.

2560
02:09:04,210 --> 02:09:05,040
And what are you gonna do?

2561
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,390
Ooh,
that's a hard pill for people to

2562
02:09:07,391 --> 02:09:09,250
swallow,
but it's better than putting them in a

2563
02:09:09,251 --> 02:09:10,300
prison cell.
Yes,

2564
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:11,590
it is.
What have you got going on,

2565
02:09:11,591 --> 02:09:14,230
Jeremy?
Drinking too much.

2566
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:19,030
Excessive alcohol use lead to
approximately 88,000 deaths and two

2567
02:09:19,031 --> 02:09:23,290
point $5,
million years of potential life lost.

2568
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:26,440
What does that mean?
I guess like you're saying,

2569
02:09:26,441 --> 02:09:30,400
drunk driving now in the United States,
two point 5 million years of people's

2570
02:09:30,401 --> 02:09:34,060
lives.
That's a weird fucking statistic from

2571
02:09:34,061 --> 02:09:39,061
2006 to 2010 shortening the lives of
those who died by an average of 30

2572
02:09:41,441 --> 02:09:42,251
years.
Yeah.

2573
02:09:42,251 --> 02:09:43,900
Okay.
So it definitely,

2574
02:09:43,901 --> 02:09:45,340
okay,
that's life lost,

2575
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:46,870
meaning you,
um,

2576
02:09:46,890 --> 02:09:51,640
you drink yourself into an early grave,
that's a weird thing to argue,

2577
02:09:51,641 --> 02:09:56,641
but the 88,000 deaths over a period of a
four years,

2578
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:58,690
that's,
that's harsh.

2579
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:02,080
But that's what we were saying in.
It's essentially a little bit more than

2580
02:10:02,081 --> 02:10:04,210
what I was saying.
We also know the solution to that or a

2581
02:10:04,211 --> 02:10:06,340
solution to a significant portion of
that education,

2582
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:09,550
education and legalization of marijuana.
Yeah.

2583
02:10:10,350 --> 02:10:12,790
Empirically know,
we know those will improve the

2584
02:10:12,791 --> 02:10:16,510
situations,
but instead we continue to do things we

2585
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,160
know don't work.
Right?

2586
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:23,560
So I'm a scientist.
I am interested in what works.

2587
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:26,950
I'm going to argue for what works and
someone else can argue against it,

2588
02:10:27,190 --> 02:10:29,500
but that's going to be what I continue
to argue for.

2589
02:10:29,501 --> 02:10:33,700
I don't have an emotional position on I,
I'm,

2590
02:10:33,730 --> 02:10:33,980
I'm

2591
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,870
following the evidence,
right?

2592
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:38,240
We,
we literally know these things.

2593
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:41,780
Not only that,
there's also a drug that is illegal,

2594
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:44,510
that has a significant impact on
addiction.

2595
02:10:44,511 --> 02:10:48,800
It's called Ibogaine and Ibogaine,
which is being used in treatment

2596
02:10:48,801 --> 02:10:52,820
facilities all throughout South America
and Mexico with massive positive

2597
02:10:52,821 --> 02:10:54,350
results,
uh,

2598
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:57,080
is illegal in this country for no
apparent reason.

2599
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,600
And I've heard that the people that do
that are just like,

2600
02:10:59,601 --> 02:11:00,950
that's it.
As soon as they take it to like,

2601
02:11:00,951 --> 02:11:02,880
I don't want it anymore to carry out.
Well,

2602
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:07,940
it rewires the way your brain
concentrates or the way your brain is

2603
02:11:08,631 --> 02:11:11,960
affected by these substances.
It rewires addiction.

2604
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:15,170
I mean,
I'm not the one to explain how it works.

2605
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:18,320
Aubrey will be in this week and he'll
probably be the best person to do it.

2606
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,070
Got Another one.
This is from the Washington Post.

2607
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:25,510
This statistic of how many Americans
drink every week.

2608
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:29,470
So he's going to read that one little
thing right here,

2609
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:34,180
up to 10 drinks per day up to the top 10
percent of American adults.

2610
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:37,510
Twenty $4 million of them consume an
average of 74 drinks per week.

2611
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:41,170
Or a little more than 10 drinks per day.
Holy Shit.

2612
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:43,390
Compared to about 30 percent that don't
drink at all.

2613
02:11:44,110 --> 02:11:47,260
Holy Shit.
How many of them are doing that?

2614
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:50,260
Because cannabis is illegal.
Well,

2615
02:11:50,290 --> 02:11:52,210
I'm sure quite a few,
but quite a few,

2616
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,021
you know,
look,

2617
02:11:53,021 --> 02:11:54,340
there's a lot.
Obviously,

2618
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:57,490
you know,
I'm a marijuana enthusiastic.

2619
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:59,410
I love it.
I think it's awesome.

2620
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:02,500
I want to spark one up right now
thinking about it.

2621
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,780
I'm a big fan,
uh,

2622
02:12:04,810 --> 02:12:08,500
but some people don't like it.
They don't like the abrasively

2623
02:12:08,501 --> 02:12:12,070
introspective properties of cannabis.
They don't like the paranoia.

2624
02:12:12,430 --> 02:12:15,250
They don't like all the vulnerability
feelings that you get from it.

2625
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,950
I liked those.
Those are good for me.

2626
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:23,050
My personality.
I have to type a aggressive,

2627
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:27,760
you know,
I'm good with a substance,

2628
02:12:27,870 --> 02:12:32,710
a compound,
a that sort of like calms that down and

2629
02:12:32,711 --> 02:12:34,870
mellows me out.
It gives me a different perspective.

2630
02:12:34,871 --> 02:12:36,550
I enjoy it and I think it's good for
people.

2631
02:12:36,551 --> 02:12:38,980
I really do.
I think a lot of the things that people

2632
02:12:38,981 --> 02:12:43,270
associate with a negative aspect of
cannabis to particularly the paranoia.

2633
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:45,550
I think that's good.
I really do.

2634
02:12:45,551 --> 02:12:47,590
I do.
I think we need to feel more vulnerable.

2635
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:52,810
I think more feeling more vulnerable is
better for you because it enhances a

2636
02:12:52,811 --> 02:12:57,060
sense of community and friendship and
love and a lot of ways and it it,

2637
02:12:57,061 --> 02:13:00,400
it bonds people together.
I think this idea that you're an

2638
02:13:00,401 --> 02:13:02,680
individual,
that you are a,

2639
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:03,880
you know,
you were alone,

2640
02:13:03,881 --> 02:13:05,980
rebel out there kicking ass and taking
names.

2641
02:13:05,981 --> 02:13:09,340
You're doing it all by yourself.
That's all eroded instantaneously by

2642
02:13:09,341 --> 02:13:10,330
cannabis.
It just said,

2643
02:13:10,331 --> 02:13:10,691
no,
no,

2644
02:13:10,691 --> 02:13:11,230
no,
no.

2645
02:13:11,230 --> 02:13:15,490
You're a talking monkey on a spinning
ball flying through infinity fuckhead

2646
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:17,080
and you're like,
ah,

2647
02:13:17,081 --> 02:13:19,900
I'm fucking scared.
I'm going to die some day and I couldn't

2648
02:13:19,901 --> 02:13:22,300
agree with you more.
I think those are really important

2649
02:13:22,301 --> 02:13:27,190
qualities for our entire race.
The human race.

2650
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:32,280
I think they.
It enhances more community feelings and

2651
02:13:32,611 --> 02:13:37,200
thoughts and I think that's the opposite
of with some drugs like stimulants,

2652
02:13:37,201 --> 02:13:37,890
do.

2653
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:40,110
Stimulants.
I've always avoided stimulants.

2654
02:13:40,111 --> 02:13:43,650
I'm not a fan other than coffee.
I've never really tried them,

2655
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:47,130
but I've seen their effect on other
people and I've read about their effects

2656
02:13:47,131 --> 02:13:49,320
and it's not what I'm looking for.
I don't want to be cocky.

2657
02:13:49,321 --> 02:13:50,340
I don't.
Yeah.

2658
02:13:50,370 --> 02:13:55,370
I'm trying to fight whatever urges my
body and my personality have to sort of

2659
02:13:56,311 --> 02:13:58,950
lean towards that,
but I think that people that get

2660
02:13:58,951 --> 02:14:01,770
involved with speed,
people to get involved with coke,

2661
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:04,380
those are people that are like unduly
confident.

2662
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:07,260
It's A.
I think there's a bad drug for society

2663
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:11,430
and it's A.
It's a drug that is very selfish in its

2664
02:14:11,431 --> 02:14:13,080
effects like the,
the,

2665
02:14:13,081 --> 02:14:15,120
the,
the impact that it has on people's.

2666
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:18,420
They become really selfish and nasty and
I'm not into that.

2667
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:22,410
I think that alcohol for some people is
a,

2668
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:26,820
is an escape from the reality that they
find themselves in and they don't know

2669
02:14:26,821 --> 02:14:29,790
how to get out and I think education
like we were talking about before,

2670
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:35,540
allowing people to have access to the
stories and the,

2671
02:14:36,170 --> 02:14:36,710
the,
the,

2672
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:37,211
the,
the,

2673
02:14:37,211 --> 02:14:40,740
the consequences that other people have
experienced from taking that drug will

2674
02:14:40,741 --> 02:14:41,490
help them.

2675
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:45,420
What kept me from doing coke when I was
young was having friends that had

2676
02:14:45,421 --> 02:14:48,450
problems with it and that educated me.
I was like,

2677
02:14:48,451 --> 02:14:49,950
fuck,
I don't want to be like that guy.

2678
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:53,010
I don't want to have that happen to me.
I see what's happening to this person.

2679
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:57,480
Some people don't get exposed to that
and instead before they know it,

2680
02:14:57,481 --> 02:14:59,820
they're already in it.
They're trying it when they're 15,

2681
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:01,620
next thing you know,
they like it too much.

2682
02:15:01,621 --> 02:15:04,650
Next thing you know they're looking
forward to doing that because it

2683
02:15:04,651 --> 02:15:09,600
provides some sort of an escape from the
pressure of the consequences of pursuing

2684
02:15:09,601 --> 02:15:12,900
a dream,
of chasing down life or of not having a

2685
02:15:12,901 --> 02:15:14,460
direction.
That's another one.

2686
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,020
Not having,
like you were saying,

2687
02:15:16,021 --> 02:15:18,030
the the identity that you're focusing
on,

2688
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:21,480
whether it's this gentleman that was a
photographer or someone else that wants

2689
02:15:21,481 --> 02:15:23,460
to be an athlete or someone else who
wants to be an author.

2690
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:25,170
Whatever it is,
it's one thing that you're chasing.

2691
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:27,620
If you don't have that thing,
this,

2692
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:32,640
this sort of futility of life is very
overwhelming to some people and they

2693
02:15:32,641 --> 02:15:36,570
want to escape that pain.
The pain of not knowing what the fuck

2694
02:15:36,571 --> 02:15:41,190
you're doing and I think some of that I
just going to go way out there,

2695
02:15:41,191 --> 02:15:46,191
but I think some of that goes back to
the hunter gatherer genes that we have

2696
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:49,170
in our.
In our own bodies,

2697
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:54,440
I think we're in a lot of ways were a
prisoner to the needs of the past and

2698
02:15:54,601 --> 02:15:57,120
the needs of the past where we were very
goal oriented.

2699
02:15:57,121 --> 02:15:58,650
You have to go out there,
you know,

2700
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:01,350
to pick the right amount of foods that
you could eat.

2701
02:16:01,351 --> 02:16:05,370
You have to hunt the animals or catch
the fish and that was the goal and we

2702
02:16:05,371 --> 02:16:07,260
were very goal oriented in that way.

2703
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:10,170
You had to go out there and do that.
You had to work hard and then through

2704
02:16:10,171 --> 02:16:13,980
those goals you get this feeling of
satisfaction when you're just getting

2705
02:16:13,981 --> 02:16:16,200
food and it's.
It comes to you.

2706
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:20,370
When your job involves doing something
that's not rewarding in any way,

2707
02:16:20,371 --> 02:16:23,280
shape or form and this is what you have
to do to get that food.

2708
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:27,030
You've sort of taken out all the natural
reward systems that our bodies are

2709
02:16:27,031 --> 02:16:32,031
designed to sort of gravitate towards
and unless you find a passion,

2710
02:16:32,501 --> 02:16:37,501
unless you find an art or craft or a
trade or some sort of a thing that

2711
02:16:37,631 --> 02:16:42,550
excites you mentally and stimulates your
creativity and stimulates your ambition,

2712
02:16:42,910 --> 02:16:45,910
your left lost.
And there's a lot of people that are

2713
02:16:45,911 --> 02:16:50,890
just left last and unfulfilled and
unsatisfied and I think those types of

2714
02:16:50,891 --> 02:16:55,540
people gravitate towards alcohol and a
lot of other drugs as an escape.

2715
02:16:55,930 --> 02:17:00,340
And that's a part of the problem with
society was how we view drugs.

2716
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:05,020
We view drugs as an escape rather than
an enhancement or rather than a

2717
02:17:05,021 --> 02:17:07,530
perspective and an enhancer,
we,

2718
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:09,340
we view them as,
oh,

2719
02:17:09,341 --> 02:17:11,650
this guy's weak.
He needs a drug.

2720
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:12,860
Yeah.
I,

2721
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:14,810
I think,
I think you're spot on.

2722
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:16,890
I don't know how you could argue that,
but it,

2723
02:17:16,980 --> 02:17:20,810
it ties all together.
So I know you sound like liberal.

2724
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:25,790
I mean you plurally sound like liberal
hippies when you like start putting all

2725
02:17:25,791 --> 02:17:28,760
these things together,
but these things really do tie in

2726
02:17:28,761 --> 02:17:32,480
together so you have the alcoholism
because people aren't finding their

2727
02:17:32,481 --> 02:17:35,120
identities.
So we should be doing things.

2728
02:17:35,121 --> 02:17:39,080
So like help people create identities if
we want a safer environment.

2729
02:17:39,081 --> 02:17:41,240
Right?
So it's not about taking those people

2730
02:17:41,241 --> 02:17:43,650
and put them into prisons as you
articulate it.

2731
02:17:43,790 --> 02:17:48,080
It's about finding that passion or
educating them to do something.

2732
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:50,990
And,
and so if you want to help or police or

2733
02:17:50,991 --> 02:17:54,530
whoever want to help,
you have to be addressing those kinds of

2734
02:17:54,531 --> 02:17:58,220
issues.
And I think so people,

2735
02:17:58,910 --> 02:18:03,830
one thing we've noticed throughout,
throughout human history is that when

2736
02:18:04,550 --> 02:18:07,670
things are really tough and there's no
resources,

2737
02:18:07,910 --> 02:18:11,270
right,
the leaders of the oppressed,

2738
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:14,740
like so say it's really easy to use,
um,

2739
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:17,510
the black segregated neighborhoods right
now,

2740
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:19,020
you know,
it's easy example.

2741
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:21,100
Well,
it's not just easy as an example.

2742
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:25,010
So it's a very good exists.
So the masculine members of a society

2743
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:30,070
that can't achieve something,
they turned to making everything about

2744
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:35,300
masculinity and dominance and accepting
of the,

2745
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:39,080
of that lower realm,
and they start to treat,

2746
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:42,620
uh,
intelligence and education as a feminine

2747
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:43,750
or,
or weak.

2748
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:46,200
And,
and so you have that,

2749
02:18:46,230 --> 02:18:48,830
that,
that plays into the culture of where you

2750
02:18:48,831 --> 02:18:52,280
have the guns and everybody has to know
the disrespecting culture.

2751
02:18:52,281 --> 02:18:57,230
And this is my corner kind of culture.
So we have those kinds of benefits that

2752
02:18:57,231 --> 02:19:01,070
are a factor also in,
in leveling the playing field for

2753
02:19:01,071 --> 02:19:04,670
everybody and contributing.
So one of the things that we're doing

2754
02:19:04,671 --> 02:19:09,671
right now is we're building a studio
like this in Baltimore and it's called a

2755
02:19:10,970 --> 02:19:13,130
radio revolver and that'll be my
shameless plug.

2756
02:19:13,131 --> 02:19:18,110
So go fund me Radio Revolver and we
still need a few more thousand dollars

2757
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:19,970
to fix everything up.
What are you doing?

2758
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:25,120
So we are making it.
So we have a video recording,

2759
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:28,400
like skype session,
have the podcasts,

2760
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:31,310
the whole setup like this for with eight
Mike's.

2761
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:34,220
And we're trying to set everything up.
We have local artists that are painting

2762
02:19:34,221 --> 02:19:35,420
everything in the inside.

2763
02:19:35,490 --> 02:19:37,800
Let me stop right now.
A people are going to talk over each

2764
02:19:37,801 --> 02:19:39,480
other.
Never have more than two.

2765
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:40,500
Okay?
Okay.

2766
02:19:40,530 --> 02:19:44,250
We've made that mistake many times.
We have these fight companions with four

2767
02:19:44,251 --> 02:19:46,770
and they're my best friends and we're
all fucking yelling over each other.

2768
02:19:46,830 --> 02:19:48,450
I try to watch one of those the other
day I was like,

2769
02:19:48,451 --> 02:19:49,740
Oh my God,
I'm getting a headache.

2770
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:52,390
Sometimes those are pretty fun.
Uh,

2771
02:19:52,730 --> 02:19:53,620
we get hammered,

2772
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:56,780
they're ridiculous.
But I'm just saying if you have eight

2773
02:19:56,781 --> 02:20:00,620
people to really.
It's like you ever heard that expression

2774
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:01,740
one?
Um,

2775
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:05,780
one boy,
one boys work,

2776
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:07,910
two boys,
half boys work,

2777
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:11,270
meaning that like if you have two young
kids together and they're working on

2778
02:20:11,271 --> 02:20:12,770
something,
they're just going to start talking shit

2779
02:20:12,771 --> 02:20:16,970
and it's not going to get done.
And if you have one kid that's digging a

2780
02:20:16,971 --> 02:20:18,440
hole,
he's going to actually get that job

2781
02:20:18,441 --> 02:20:20,570
done.
But if you have like four people,

2782
02:20:20,571 --> 02:20:23,360
nothing gets done and that,
that's really the case.

2783
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,780
I'm definitely going to write that down.
You just ate people's to money.

2784
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:31,900
So one of the people that I met was a,
if you ever heard serial podcast,

2785
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:32,690
Jamie,
do you know that?

2786
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:33,710
Sure.
So,

2787
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:34,573
okay,
that's it.

2788
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:35,421
No,
I don't,

2789
02:20:35,421 --> 02:20:37,670
but I'm aware of it.
The first season is about it,

2790
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:39,830
not salaried,
who was wrongfully imprisoned right now

2791
02:20:39,831 --> 02:20:41,870
in Maryland and still,
right.

2792
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:45,170
So his Bentley wrongfully,
I think so w.

2793
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,270
well.
So regardless of whether you get a point

2794
02:20:47,271 --> 02:20:50,030
of whether he did or not,
I'm honestly unaware of the case.

2795
02:20:50,031 --> 02:20:51,290
What,
what was he accused of?

2796
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:52,153
So,
uh,

2797
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:55,360
in high school at 17 of murdering his ex
girlfriend,

2798
02:20:55,490 --> 02:20:57,980
a classmate at woodland high high
school.

2799
02:20:58,600 --> 02:20:59,750
Um,
the evidence,

2800
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:02,530
regardless of whether somebody was to
argue about whether he actually did it

2801
02:21:02,531 --> 02:21:05,660
or not,
the evidence is extremely clear that you

2802
02:21:05,661 --> 02:21:08,210
do not have the evidence to put this
individual in jail,

2803
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:08,900
period.

2804
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:12,680
It's not there.
His best friend is the partner with me

2805
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:17,710
for radio revolver and we ended up being
connected for it because I helped out on

2806
02:21:18,201 --> 02:21:20,140
that podcast for awhile and you know,
we've,

2807
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:21,890
we have this community that we formed
now,

2808
02:21:21,891 --> 02:21:26,891
so he's helping me with this and this is
an example of how you use your privilege

2809
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:31,220
and sensationalism.
So I was sensationalized by what I said

2810
02:21:31,221 --> 02:21:32,760
before,
right by the,

2811
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:37,310
the cops hitting people and all the
things they did and probably what I'm

2812
02:21:37,311 --> 02:21:41,570
most proud of is that I instantly
switched from that sensationalism to how

2813
02:21:41,571 --> 02:21:44,120
we fix things and what the reform
measures are.

2814
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:46,600
And we don't even talk about that
sensationalism anymore.

2815
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:49,200
But don't you think the sensationalism
was important because it,

2816
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:50,150
it brought you to people.

2817
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:51,840
It's critical.
Yeah.

2818
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:54,540
Right.
So the successfulness of turning that

2819
02:21:54,541 --> 02:21:58,920
around into something productive.
Part of that is this radio revolver.

2820
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:03,180
So if you have privilege and you have an
advantage or something which you have to

2821
02:22:03,181 --> 02:22:06,480
do is you have to build platforms for
other people,

2822
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:10,320
build structure so that other people can
rise not just for yourself.

2823
02:22:10,890 --> 02:22:14,260
And the idea behind this is we'll,
we'll have the network.

2824
02:22:14,261 --> 02:22:17,760
So it ended up being turnkey.
It's in a room that anybody can come in

2825
02:22:17,761 --> 02:22:21,270
at anytime and if the community,
the community members,

2826
02:22:21,271 --> 02:22:22,700
we already have them tied in.
I think we're,

2827
02:22:22,701 --> 02:22:25,980
we're going to have a problem with who
we cut out versus we're going to let in

2828
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:30,420
and we're in creating the entire
infrastructure under one umbrella for

2829
02:22:30,421 --> 02:22:34,230
them to come in and have their voices
heard and get their message out there.

2830
02:22:34,231 --> 02:22:38,580
They can build a podcast,
they can build a video like a TV show

2831
02:22:38,581 --> 02:22:42,180
type of thing and none of this is ever
going to cost any of them anything.

2832
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:45,420
And if they succeed and we ended up
getting to a point where we're in the

2833
02:22:45,421 --> 02:22:47,460
red,
then we just start taking all the

2834
02:22:47,461 --> 02:22:50,340
profits and distributed out to whoever
you know,

2835
02:22:50,341 --> 02:22:53,220
proportionately has the podcast that
does the best or whatever.

2836
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:57,090
But the point of that is if you have
that,

2837
02:22:57,091 --> 02:23:02,091
that is gonna enable at least 10 to 20
identity projects so somebody else has

2838
02:23:03,211 --> 02:23:08,211
to come in and do the other end of that,
take whatever you have and do that same

2839
02:23:08,851 --> 02:23:10,410
kind of thing.
If you have money,

2840
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:13,470
then we can take the money and we can do
something good with that.

2841
02:23:13,471 --> 02:23:16,140
If you have that skill,
then you can come into a place like

2842
02:23:16,141 --> 02:23:18,840
we're building or a place like penn
north and pass that on.

2843
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:22,050
That is really what we have to do as an
individual level.

2844
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:24,120
And if so,
I would always love it if people would

2845
02:23:24,121 --> 02:23:26,610
help me out with radio revolver so we
can get that finished.

2846
02:23:27,090 --> 02:23:28,640
So you're.
What you're going to do is

2847
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:33,860
put together a podcast and through that
podcast you're gonna have people tell

2848
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:38,871
their stories.
You're going to expose the world to the

2849
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:44,210
plight of these inner cities and the
positive stories about people rising out

2850
02:23:44,611 --> 02:23:46,500
of them and your friend,
the photographer,

2851
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:48,870
and a bunch of other people that you can
get exposed to.

2852
02:23:48,871 --> 02:23:53,790
So I think one of the most important
things for a young person is to believe

2853
02:23:53,791 --> 02:23:56,100
that they can somehow or another be
successful.

2854
02:23:56,730 --> 02:23:59,010
I remember when when I was young,
we were poor.

2855
02:23:59,310 --> 02:24:02,880
I always identified with being a poor
person and I never thought that I would

2856
02:24:02,881 --> 02:24:05,820
be anything other than a poor person
because I would see people that were

2857
02:24:05,821 --> 02:24:08,940
wealthy and they've always felt so
different than me.

2858
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:12,120
They always felt so anyone who is
successful,

2859
02:24:12,121 --> 02:24:15,890
I shouldn't even just say wealthy,
just a normal person like you know,

2860
02:24:15,891 --> 02:24:20,891
like someone who lives in a normal house
with a garage and that you know,

2861
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:21,691
like,
wow,

2862
02:24:21,691 --> 02:24:24,720
that's a,
that's a person that the America aspires

2863
02:24:24,721 --> 02:24:25,170
to.

2864
02:24:25,170 --> 02:24:28,470
They feel different than you if you're
from a broken home,

2865
02:24:28,471 --> 02:24:33,471
if you're from poverty.
And in my case obviously was nothing in

2866
02:24:33,481 --> 02:24:37,170
comparison to the extreme poverty that a
lot of people face,

2867
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:42,410
but I still remember feeling really
insecure and really I'm disconnected

2868
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:47,540
from successful people.
I think that mindset is a very difficult

2869
02:24:48,271 --> 02:24:49,950
to overcome.
It's very difficult.

2870
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:52,770
It's very difficult to believe that you
can achieve something.

2871
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:57,030
It's very difficult to believe that you
can rise from no matter where you are,

2872
02:24:57,060 --> 02:25:00,750
if you continue to work and you continue
to pursue your goals and you can avoid

2873
02:25:00,751 --> 02:25:04,230
all the pitfalls of the negative aspects
of society,

2874
02:25:04,470 --> 02:25:07,320
you can do better,
you can do better and you can feel

2875
02:25:07,321 --> 02:25:12,321
satisfied in that and to give people
these opportunities to see people who

2876
02:25:12,661 --> 02:25:17,550
have done the very thing that you're
aspiring to do is massively beneficial

2877
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:20,310
because it gives them sort of a like a
little bit of a blueprint.

2878
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:22,870
Yeah,
I mean and that's exactly the point

2879
02:25:22,871 --> 02:25:25,450
would say these things.
I mean you may as well just be me saying

2880
02:25:25,470 --> 02:25:27,160
that I,
I agree with you completely.

2881
02:25:27,161 --> 02:25:32,140
I mean it's critically important that we
set these up for people and they can do

2882
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:35,530
that and they do that now.
It just reminds me when you said that,

2883
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:40,770
like they come up to my house and like
that's like success to them and that's

2884
02:25:42,971 --> 02:25:46,090
what I am.
I'm a dude with a single family home in

2885
02:25:46,091 --> 02:25:48,370
a garage and not really.
Yeah.

2886
02:25:48,371 --> 02:25:49,204
I don't have any money,

2887
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:52,590
but it's honestly all anybody ever
really needs and wants.

2888
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:54,780
I mean,
you can get a giant ass fucking house,

2889
02:25:54,781 --> 02:25:57,150
but let me tell you something.
At the end of the day,

2890
02:25:57,151 --> 02:25:59,620
it's just your house.
You know that.

2891
02:25:59,630 --> 02:26:02,070
It's just where you live.
Is it comfortable?

2892
02:26:02,071 --> 02:26:03,280
Is it safe?
Yeah.

2893
02:26:03,330 --> 02:26:04,740
That's what everybody really wants.
Yeah,

2894
02:26:04,830 --> 02:26:07,470
definitely.
That's really what it's all about and

2895
02:26:07,650 --> 02:26:11,130
one of the most positive aspects of
doing this podcast is running into

2896
02:26:11,131 --> 02:26:13,200
people that I've met that said,
hey man,

2897
02:26:13,470 --> 02:26:15,690
I've been doing standup comedy for three
years now.

2898
02:26:15,691 --> 02:26:19,530
I'm actually a working comedian.
I did it from listening to your podcast.

2899
02:26:19,531 --> 02:26:22,620
I knew that I could do it because you
told me that anybody can do it if you

2900
02:26:22,621 --> 02:26:23,930
just try that you,
I,

2901
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,370
I used to suck and I tell everybody I
always,

2902
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:29,880
I was fucking terrible,
but you keep chipping away at it and

2903
02:26:29,910 --> 02:26:31,710
she's listening to your recordings and
all that jazz.

2904
02:26:31,890 --> 02:26:35,670
I've run into a million fucking people
that have started doing Jujitsu now.

2905
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:36,610
I mean it's.
I mean,

2906
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:39,090
it's not a million,
but it's not countable anymore.

2907
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:40,650
I've ran into so many people that,
hey man,

2908
02:26:40,651 --> 02:26:43,170
I just got my purple belt,
started listening to you guys.

2909
02:26:43,330 --> 02:26:45,750
You know,
now I'm competing my lifestyle.

2910
02:26:45,751 --> 02:26:47,670
So much healthier.
I eat cleaner,

2911
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:49,350
everything's better.
My life is just.

2912
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:51,540
I used to be depressed.
It's so much more positive,

2913
02:26:51,810 --> 02:26:54,670
so I take great,
satisfied.

2914
02:26:54,671 --> 02:26:56,010
I would say private.
It's not the right word.

2915
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:59,100
It's a great satisfaction.
It feels awesome to talk to people that

2916
02:26:59,130 --> 02:27:02,970
have looked at this little sort of
blueprint that I've laid out and said,

2917
02:27:02,971 --> 02:27:03,960
look,
anybody can do this.

2918
02:27:03,961 --> 02:27:06,750
You can do this,
like whatever patterns that you're

2919
02:27:06,751 --> 02:27:09,870
following because the people that you're
around are in these negative patterns.

2920
02:27:10,110 --> 02:27:13,440
You don't have to follow those patterns.
It's one of the beautiful things about

2921
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:15,990
social media and the beautiful things
about the internet.

2922
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:17,850
As you can kind of choose what you
follow.

2923
02:27:18,150 --> 02:27:21,030
I mean,
you could go and just follow negative

2924
02:27:21,031 --> 02:27:23,430
stuff all day long.
You could concentrate on negative

2925
02:27:23,431 --> 02:27:26,640
bullshit and you could be one of those
people who goes on twitter and just

2926
02:27:26,970 --> 02:27:31,380
bombs on people and Shits on people all
day and that's going to be your point of

2927
02:27:31,381 --> 02:27:33,810
focus,
but you're not gonna get any better at

2928
02:27:33,811 --> 02:27:36,090
anything doing that.
You're not going to have a better life.

2929
02:27:36,091 --> 02:27:38,520
You're not going to feel better.
You're not going to be happier.

2930
02:27:38,670 --> 02:27:40,830
You're not going to spread any,
any,

2931
02:27:41,010 --> 02:27:44,700
anything beneficial,
anything positive to anybody,

2932
02:27:45,030 --> 02:27:49,800
but you can take a choice to not do that
and a lot of times you need to see that

2933
02:27:49,801 --> 02:27:51,750
someone else has done that in order to
help you do it.

2934
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:54,500
I hope you're inspiring others because
you're kind of inspired me right now

2935
02:27:54,501 --> 02:27:59,501
like thinking about how many identity
projects that you lead even though they

2936
02:28:00,321 --> 02:28:05,321
were maybe not even been obvious to you
because you've gone and use this

2937
02:28:05,331 --> 02:28:08,660
platform to do these things,
I think is highly honorable of you that

2938
02:28:08,661 --> 02:28:12,770
you use this platform so that I can talk
about these things about blm black lives

2939
02:28:12,771 --> 02:28:14,690
matter and about police reform and
things like that.

2940
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:19,960
That's like the typical like prototype
of what what we're talking about you,

2941
02:28:20,651 --> 02:28:23,360
you were great work,
but by doing that,

2942
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:25,460
well it's helping me a lot too.
Honestly.

2943
02:28:25,461 --> 02:28:28,640
I mean I think everyone's life is a
constant journey.

2944
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:29,500
You're,
you're.

2945
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:32,960
I mean unless you just stay sedentary
and you don't go anywhere and you don't

2946
02:28:32,961 --> 02:28:34,520
take it.
Any new data your,

2947
02:28:34,521 --> 02:28:39,521
your life is all about reevaluating the
way you think or evaluating it or

2948
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:44,420
enhancing it or adding to it or removing
some negative aspects of the way you

2949
02:28:44,421 --> 02:28:47,900
think and one of the best ways that I've
found to do that as exposed myself to

2950
02:28:47,901 --> 02:28:52,700
interesting people like you or like any
of the other people that I've had the

2951
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:56,720
pleasure and the opportunity to,
to talk to on this podcast.

2952
02:28:56,930 --> 02:29:00,230
You get this.
I mean I've had three hour conversations

2953
02:29:00,231 --> 02:29:04,820
with 800 fucking will not 800 people,
but it's 800 times.

2954
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:10,450
And having those kinds of conversations,
it forces you to think it forces you to.

2955
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:12,140
Like.

2956
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:14,990
One of the things that Eddie Wong was
saying that really resonated with me is

2957
02:29:14,991 --> 02:29:17,570
that he likes to write.
He writes every day and one of the

2958
02:29:17,571 --> 02:29:22,571
things that the reasons why he likes to
write is it makes him solidify his own

2959
02:29:22,761 --> 02:29:24,980
thoughts.
He thinks about his own thoughts and it

2960
02:29:24,981 --> 02:29:28,490
really sort of like it.
It allows him to really,

2961
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:33,760
really kind of examined them and go in
depth as to how he really truly feels

2962
02:29:35,001 --> 02:29:38,870
about something and really get a cleaner
perspective instead of just,

2963
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:41,690
I think a lot of people,
me included,

2964
02:29:41,691 --> 02:29:44,210
I've been guilty of this in the past.
We operate on momentum.

2965
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:47,840
We just get a path.
You're on it for some whatever reason

2966
02:29:48,050 --> 02:29:51,470
and then just sort of stuck and you just
sort of behave that way and think that

2967
02:29:51,471 --> 02:29:56,471
way and you don't ever examine it and
writing allows you to really pause and

2968
02:29:57,261 --> 02:30:00,260
look at that.
Podcasting does the same and a lot of

2969
02:30:00,261 --> 02:30:02,300
ways.
It allows me to pause and really think

2970
02:30:02,301 --> 02:30:05,970
about some of the things that I've
attached myself to or not attached

2971
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:06,823
myself.

2972
02:30:06,970 --> 02:30:09,290
And it's recorded.
We're going to be able to

2973
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,980
recorded the shits live,
right?

2974
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:12,981
So it is,
whew,

2975
02:30:12,981 --> 02:30:13,900
it is you,
it's you.

2976
02:30:13,901 --> 02:30:14,960
It's who you are,
you know,

2977
02:30:14,961 --> 02:30:18,370
and all for good or for bad,
and you get to see negative aspects of

2978
02:30:18,371 --> 02:30:21,490
the way you think and the way you talk
and then you get to see the

2979
02:30:21,491 --> 02:30:23,680
repercussions of those and you get to
consider like,

2980
02:30:23,681 --> 02:30:26,350
why did I think that way?
Was I just,

2981
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:31,600
was it just a knee jerk reaction?
Was it just was tired that day?

2982
02:30:31,870 --> 02:30:36,870
Was I not respecting the medium?
Was I not respecting the power of these

2983
02:30:37,871 --> 02:30:41,920
thoughts and these conversations?
Most likely a combination of all those

2984
02:30:41,921 --> 02:30:46,180
things,
but through the personal growth that is

2985
02:30:46,181 --> 02:30:51,181
a been afforded me by the podcast.
It's helped me in as much as it's helped

2986
02:30:53,291 --> 02:30:54,220
anybody.
It's,

2987
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:58,150
it's helped me tremendously and having
these kinds of conversations with people

2988
02:30:58,151 --> 02:30:59,470
like you are a giant part of that.

2989
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:03,590
Oh thanks.
I don't know how to take the stuff that

2990
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:06,620
relates to that,
but I don't know.

2991
02:31:06,630 --> 02:31:08,130
I can't.
I can't sing your praises enough for

2992
02:31:08,131 --> 02:31:13,131
having that kind of mentality and being
the Alpha male that is vulnerable and

2993
02:31:13,381 --> 02:31:15,320
lets other people see that it's okay
though.

2994
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:16,900
Those things are important.
Uh,

2995
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:19,020
it's okay for,
for the tough guys,

2996
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:23,970
is that to let their guard down and be
introspective and to be people that are

2997
02:31:23,971 --> 02:31:28,230
willing to help and reach out.
It's entirely admirable.

2998
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:31,080
I'm like,
chunk is another person that I've gotten

2999
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:34,350
closer.
You've had him on here and say his name.

3000
02:31:34,351 --> 02:31:36,030
Right.
I'm glad that you say right.

3001
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:36,750
He,
he,

3002
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:39,120
he jokes about that.
How like people that have known him his

3003
02:31:39,121 --> 02:31:40,890
whole life,
right?

3004
02:31:41,090 --> 02:31:42,360
It's Jank,
right,

3005
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:43,300
Jay,
right.

3006
02:31:43,300 --> 02:31:43,810
Yeah.

3007
02:31:43,810 --> 02:31:46,990
Well the young Turks with what they've
done is they've developed a sort of

3008
02:31:47,050 --> 02:31:51,550
alternative media platform that's
outside of the mainstream media,

3009
02:31:51,551 --> 02:31:56,551
but it has arguably as much impact when
you look at what they've been able to do

3010
02:31:57,071 --> 02:31:59,260
on youtube and they're one of many,
you know,

3011
02:31:59,261 --> 02:32:03,400
there's a lot of people that are pushing
unusual ideas on the internet.

3012
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:06,100
Um,
the amazing atheist is another one.

3013
02:32:06,101 --> 02:32:08,530
I've really enjoyed a lot of his stuff
lately.

3014
02:32:09,340 --> 02:32:14,230
Tj is a fucking really bright guy and he
puts out some really interesting,

3015
02:32:14,231 --> 02:32:16,570
well thought out videos.
You GotTa pee or something.

3016
02:32:16,790 --> 02:32:18,850
That was,
that was giving them that address.

3017
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:23,150
Just talking about we got James Jesus.
He's good.

3018
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:25,940
I got to go see him this week.
Just don't call it chain.

3019
02:32:27,210 --> 02:32:28,250
So,
uh,

3020
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:31,260
putting our money where our mouth is.
We got locked up this year.

3021
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:34,230
You guys got locked up in DC?
Arrest it.

3022
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:36,910
Have you got the pictures of it?
Jack did too.

3023
02:32:36,911 --> 02:32:38,930
He got arrested.
He got arrested together.

3024
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:40,740
Do you arrested for,
for sitting in,

3025
02:32:40,741 --> 02:32:43,830
for democracy spring.
Is that a serving or protecting?

3026
02:32:43,960 --> 02:32:45,020
Um,
how does that work?

3027
02:32:45,030 --> 02:32:45,860
Would have been serving.

3028
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:46,630
Do you?
Um,

3029
02:32:46,630 --> 02:32:47,161
do you,
will you?

3030
02:32:47,161 --> 02:32:49,940
Yeah.
Do you guys get 'em of rec arrest

3031
02:32:49,941 --> 02:32:50,774
records for that?

3032
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:53,210
Okay.
So you still get in Canada?

3033
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:58,270
I guess Jake does a real legit.
I just record so I fought it because it

3034
02:33:00,201 --> 02:33:01,330
was in DC.
Right,

3035
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:03,590
because it close to you close to me.
I can find it.

3036
02:33:03,950 --> 02:33:06,380
So they ended up dropping the charges on
me.

3037
02:33:06,650 --> 02:33:07,483
Okay.
Um,

3038
02:33:07,880 --> 02:33:12,490
we had got a phone call that there was
no way they were going to put me a

3039
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:16,010
chance to speak in a,
a record it public forum.

3040
02:33:16,011 --> 02:33:18,770
What's that?
They said they dropped my case.

3041
02:33:18,950 --> 02:33:22,010
What were you protesting?
The get money out of politics.

3042
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:27,040
So I'm,
we're not people like jake and I are not

3043
02:33:27,770 --> 02:33:30,050
just talking out of our asses on this,
we,

3044
02:33:30,070 --> 02:33:34,520
we mean it.
And so we went and we participated in

3045
02:33:34,521 --> 02:33:37,910
the march and got arrested in Washington
DC.

3046
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:39,890
Why did you get arrested for,
what was the charge?

3047
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:42,240
Like loitering or some bullshit?
Uh,

3048
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:43,910
I forget how they completely worded it.

3049
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:48,720
And so it's because you were protesting
in a public area and blocking traffic or

3050
02:33:48,721 --> 02:33:49,250
something.

3051
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:51,950
That's what they said.
There was nobody trying to go into or

3052
02:33:51,951 --> 02:33:53,900
out of the capital and that's where we
were.

3053
02:33:54,110 --> 02:33:56,450
Right.
But they wouldn't be able to if they did

3054
02:33:56,451 --> 02:33:59,330
want to because you guys were away.
Oh,

3055
02:33:59,420 --> 02:34:00,680
okay.
Well that's kind of loitering,

3056
02:34:00,681 --> 02:34:03,560
right?
But that does get attention to what

3057
02:34:03,561 --> 02:34:05,840
you're trying to.
The largest mass arrests in DC history.

3058
02:34:05,841 --> 02:34:08,360
It was like a 200 and some of us that
got arrested the first day.

3059
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:10,610
Wow.
Like 450 overall.

3060
02:34:11,420 --> 02:34:12,420
Um,
so we have,

3061
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:16,760
we have some good pictures of it.
If Jamie that website's not working.

3062
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,360
I don't know,
it's maywood photography.

3063
02:34:19,361 --> 02:34:23,740
M a e l w o o d o,
that's my phone.

3064
02:34:23,741 --> 02:34:25,190
I'm sorry.
Um,

3065
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:28,590
so what were the cops like when they
arrested him?

3066
02:34:28,591 --> 02:34:29,231
They're like,
I'm sorry,

3067
02:34:29,231 --> 02:34:31,150
this is bullshit.
We got a restaurant or they're being

3068
02:34:31,151 --> 02:34:34,340
dicks.
Some of them are still being text,

3069
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:38,620
unbelievably considering it was a.
When you see this crowd,

3070
02:34:38,710 --> 02:34:42,010
so they were treating you like an actual
criminal even though it's pretty obvious

3071
02:34:42,011 --> 02:34:45,670
you're trying to campaign against
something that's something that nobody

3072
02:34:45,671 --> 02:34:48,030
really thinks is a good thing.
Money and politics.

3073
02:34:48,070 --> 02:34:49,510
The lieutenant said,
Hey,

3074
02:34:49,511 --> 02:34:51,010
I'm glad that you guys are out here
doing that.

3075
02:34:51,290 --> 02:34:52,570
Really,
the lieutenant said,

3076
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:55,720
Holy Shit,
these are capital police.

3077
02:34:56,190 --> 02:34:58,450
Um,
I've sang their praises before,

3078
02:34:59,350 --> 02:35:02,420
but they don't face a lot.
So they hadn't.

3079
02:35:02,421 --> 02:35:03,500
There's,
there's jake.

3080
02:35:06,210 --> 02:35:09,130
So that's a captain,
Ray Lewis.

3081
02:35:09,131 --> 02:35:11,800
He also was arrested and he wears his
uniform,

3082
02:35:11,801 --> 02:35:13,390
do it.
He's a retired Philadelphia,

3083
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:17,080
a police officer,
and he wore his uniform and he got

3084
02:35:17,081 --> 02:35:20,920
arrested in his uniform and they took it
sign and threw it away and they charged

3085
02:35:20,921 --> 02:35:21,161
it.
Say,

3086
02:35:21,161 --> 02:35:25,630
what does the sign say?
Massive civil scratched out.

3087
02:35:25,930 --> 02:35:28,990
Disobedience is next.
Warning.

3088
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:31,420
Massive disobedience is next.
What does that mean?

3089
02:35:31,570 --> 02:35:35,110
Well,
because I'm assuming what he means by

3090
02:35:35,111 --> 02:35:37,600
this,
but right now the disobedience is civil,

3091
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:39,450
right?
So we're protesting.

3092
02:35:39,451 --> 02:35:44,451
We were doing things like this,
but like I'm flabbergasted that the

3093
02:35:44,741 --> 02:35:48,730
black community in these neighborhoods
hasn't really said enough,

3094
02:35:48,731 --> 02:35:52,310
is enough yet.
Like the idea that we,

3095
02:35:52,740 --> 02:35:55,970
they have children and family members
dying in the streets.

3096
02:35:55,971 --> 02:35:57,430
They're probably scared to get arrested,
man.

3097
02:35:57,500 --> 02:35:58,800
They are.
But I just,

3098
02:35:59,030 --> 02:36:00,850
there's a breaking point that's coming
and that's,

3099
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:02,050
that's what he's trying to say is.

3100
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:06,430
And what I've tried to don't scroll.
What's up with the dudes with the nose

3101
02:36:06,431 --> 02:36:08,110
ring?
The fuck's going on there?

3102
02:36:08,230 --> 02:36:08,861
Oh,
he's a,

3103
02:36:08,861 --> 02:36:10,720
uh,
he's an actual,

3104
02:36:10,770 --> 02:36:13,300
uh,
I can't remember tribe he's from and he

3105
02:36:13,301 --> 02:36:16,090
participates in a lot of these things
and what to do with the Musket.

3106
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:19,270
Scroll down there.
J side.

3107
02:36:19,380 --> 02:36:23,230
I don't know what that looks like.
A musket when I was only seeing the tip

3108
02:36:23,231 --> 02:36:24,310
of it.
What?

3109
02:36:24,850 --> 02:36:28,480
The tip of the.
I thought it was a just a musket tip.

3110
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:29,970
Never just a tip.
Don't fall.

3111
02:36:29,980 --> 02:36:31,320
So,
uh,

3112
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:34,420
I don't know what you're saying.
A dollars in.

3113
02:36:34,421 --> 02:36:36,580
What does that scroll down?
Dollars in politics.

3114
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:40,420
Grass ranch out,
so it's essentially just a bunch of

3115
02:36:40,421 --> 02:36:43,030
people standing in a place where the
government didn't think you should be

3116
02:36:43,031 --> 02:36:44,400
able to stand.
Right.

3117
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:47,620
And we kinda keep drawing attention to
this money in politics because I really

3118
02:36:47,621 --> 02:36:49,480
think that's the root.
It's the root of everything.

3119
02:36:49,481 --> 02:36:51,250
We can't end the drug war because of
this.

3120
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:56,520
We can't move anything forward.
We can't do police reform because of

3121
02:36:57,281 --> 02:36:59,770
this democracy spring.
They're calling it.

3122
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:00,700
Yeah.
That was the one day.

3123
02:37:00,701 --> 02:37:01,990
Different groups,
different days.

3124
02:37:01,991 --> 02:37:04,720
So it was a whole week long.
This was the first day was the biggest

3125
02:37:04,721 --> 02:37:08,020
day and you'll have me in handcuffs at
the end eventually.

3126
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:12,760
But.
So how long did you have to stay in jail

3127
02:37:12,761 --> 02:37:15,860
for the night?
Oh no annoying.

3128
02:37:16,270 --> 02:37:17,900
Well it wasn't snoring.
It wasn't a real jail.

3129
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:22,120
There were so many people that it was
just like they were keeping us in like

3130
02:37:22,130 --> 02:37:25,640
animal pens and felt like a.
So we would just be like panned off.

3131
02:37:26,030 --> 02:37:29,010
Like they I think took us to a different
place and had like a,

3132
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:32,740
like fences,
like portable fences and they will punch

3133
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:35,900
you like.
So it's not like you really couldn't get

3134
02:37:35,901 --> 02:37:37,700
out,
you could get out if you want it to.

3135
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:39,320
I guess I could have if I really wanted
to,

3136
02:37:39,321 --> 02:37:41,900
I wasn't going to go for an escape
charge.

3137
02:37:43,300 --> 02:37:47,120
This is so silly,
but seems like so the dumb way to handle

3138
02:37:47,121 --> 02:37:48,740
it.
Everybody's smiling,

3139
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:52,970
getting handcuffed as you see.
It's a pretty white crowd.

3140
02:37:53,310 --> 02:37:54,143
Oh,
it's fun.

3141
02:37:54,210 --> 02:37:56,990
So I think that helps on the way the
police act.

3142
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:59,290
Like some people just psyched to be
hanging out with Cenk.

3143
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:01,900
Yeah,
no.

3144
02:38:02,330 --> 02:38:05,300
Weird.
So that's an example of another thing.

3145
02:38:05,330 --> 02:38:07,460
I mean you can go and you can
participate in these things.

3146
02:38:07,530 --> 02:38:12,080
So if that is a passion of yours,
I think that's another identity thing

3147
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:13,400
that we have.
You can,

3148
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:16,520
you can go and see these groups.
There's all these groups out there and

3149
02:38:16,521 --> 02:38:19,970
like you're saying that these people
feel lost and they're turning to two

3150
02:38:19,971 --> 02:38:22,670
other things.
But we have all these things out there

3151
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:26,420
and if you don't have one,
create one.

3152
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:30,110
There are out there like the tyt family,
like your family,

3153
02:38:30,111 --> 02:38:33,740
like black lives matter.
We have tons of of movements going on

3154
02:38:33,741 --> 02:38:36,110
that,
that you can do something positive with

3155
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:37,550
no matter who you are.
Okay.

3156
02:38:37,551 --> 02:38:41,510
So tell us one more time,
what's the name of this podcast and when

3157
02:38:41,511 --> 02:38:43,130
do you hope this thing's going to start?

3158
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:46,640
So name of the podcast or the radio
right now it's called,

3159
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:49,040
it's called radio revolver.
And that's just the umbrella.

3160
02:38:49,070 --> 02:38:52,600
Why Radio Revolver about guns?
Yeah,

3161
02:38:52,610 --> 02:38:55,100
we finally had that place.
So I revolving door,

3162
02:38:55,101 --> 02:38:57,080
like a prison cell is how I envisioned
it.

3163
02:38:57,081 --> 02:38:58,670
They wanted to use like a gun logo and I
was like,

3164
02:38:58,680 --> 02:38:58,941
no,
no,

3165
02:38:58,941 --> 02:38:59,181
no,
no,

3166
02:38:59,181 --> 02:39:01,460
no,
you can't do that radio revolver,

3167
02:39:01,461 --> 02:39:03,080
podcast network.
Right.

3168
02:39:03,081 --> 02:39:05,840
So here's some of the friends that I've
made that are activists around and

3169
02:39:05,841 --> 02:39:07,340
there's definitely be ones that are in
there.

3170
02:39:07,341 --> 02:39:10,970
We were doing a serial show and we took
that picture and so the donating is for

3171
02:39:10,971 --> 02:39:15,170
equipment and for rental space.
The space was donated by sod.

3172
02:39:15,300 --> 02:39:18,500
It's basement of his house all blocked
off and done.

3173
02:39:18,501 --> 02:39:20,660
So that's not an issue.
We have that done.

3174
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:21,920
Um,
what do you need to.

3175
02:39:21,980 --> 02:39:23,570
We're still just getting the last bit of
equipment.

3176
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:26,570
We have some of the local artists
painting the walls now.

3177
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:29,180
Oh Great.
And so we're close.

3178
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:31,950
We don't,
I mean like maybe $3,000 and I'm a and w

3179
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:35,630
we're were set.
Well let me know when you guys launch

3180
02:39:35,631 --> 02:39:38,720
and I will absolutely tweeted out and
let everybody be aware of it.

3181
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:42,680
The first one is going to.
So again,

3182
02:39:42,681 --> 02:39:46,010
part of the part of the thing that we're
going to do is we take advantage of,

3183
02:39:46,050 --> 02:39:51,050
of me right in the publicity.
So the first one is going to be a joint

3184
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:56,290
project with undisclosed who is a
affiliate with serial story and all and

3185
02:39:57,980 --> 02:40:01,520
that one's going to be a misconduct
which is going to be one of the series

3186
02:40:01,521 --> 02:40:03,380
we have.
So there's gonna be multiple podcasts.

3187
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:05,690
Okay.
One of them is going to be misconduct

3188
02:40:05,691 --> 02:40:07,620
and then you'll have like the
photography warner,

3189
02:40:07,630 --> 02:40:10,020
you have a public health one like doc
large brown is,

3190
02:40:10,190 --> 02:40:11,570
is going to do a public health one.

3191
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:14,310
So you're essentially building a whole
whole station.

3192
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:15,060
Okay,
great.

3193
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:17,070
Right.
And so everybody that wants in,

3194
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:18,540
you know,
as long as you learn what you're doing

3195
02:40:18,541 --> 02:40:20,040
and everything,
you will be able to have your voice

3196
02:40:20,041 --> 02:40:23,310
heard in whichever manner you want.
That's a great idea because you know,

3197
02:40:23,311 --> 02:40:27,460
this is one of the easiest ways to get a
message out and the message that you

3198
02:40:27,470 --> 02:40:27,960
know,
you,

3199
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:29,940
you,
when you hear someone talk man,

3200
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:34,560
and you hear their words and you get to
know them through the hours and hours of

3201
02:40:34,561 --> 02:40:37,200
conversations,
you get to know him in a really deep,

3202
02:40:37,201 --> 02:40:39,600
intimate way.
You're assigning example ivy,

3203
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:42,140
you walk around and everybody to know
you.

3204
02:40:42,330 --> 02:40:43,880
People hugged me.
I don't even know my baby.

3205
02:40:43,890 --> 02:40:45,360
What's up?
Right?

3206
02:40:45,361 --> 02:40:48,420
So the first one's called misconduct,
which is going to be a series and I'm

3207
02:40:48,421 --> 02:40:51,690
going to do the first one and it's going
to be the killing of Freddie Gray.

3208
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:55,530
So we're.
What we're going to do for that is go

3209
02:40:55,531 --> 02:40:59,550
through the story.
And when we first go through the story,

3210
02:40:59,610 --> 02:41:03,270
the first episode will start and we
start telling what happened.

3211
02:41:03,271 --> 02:41:04,920
Like,
so these cops are in this neighborhood

3212
02:41:04,921 --> 02:41:06,780
and Freddie gray is in this.
And then we go,

3213
02:41:06,781 --> 02:41:08,940
but wait,
why does it look this way?

3214
02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:14,130
And then so like somebody like doc brown
will come in and we're go over through

3215
02:41:14,131 --> 02:41:17,190
the history of segregation,
how the neighborhoods are formed,

3216
02:41:17,191 --> 02:41:19,530
the way they are,
why the cops were all white,

3217
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:24,560
why the citizens are all black,
and we'll go explain that story and then

3218
02:41:24,631 --> 02:41:28,710
the next episode I'll start over again,
start telling the story and when we hit

3219
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:31,710
the next hurdle,
which will be something like,

3220
02:41:31,711 --> 02:41:33,720
well,
why are they going after him for the

3221
02:41:33,721 --> 02:41:36,360
drugs and why are they chasing him?
So,

3222
02:41:36,380 --> 02:41:40,200
so then we're breakdown the history of
the laws and why the why that is done

3223
02:41:40,201 --> 02:41:42,210
the way it is.
What policing philosophies of led to

3224
02:41:42,211 --> 02:41:44,610
this.
Until we finish out the entire story and

3225
02:41:44,611 --> 02:41:49,200
everybody can understand the nuance to
what happened behind the murder of

3226
02:41:49,201 --> 02:41:50,910
Freddie Gray.
All right man.

3227
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:51,773
Well listen,

3228
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:53,350
thank you very much.

3229

thing with my friend Justin.

3231
02:41:57,491 --> 02:42:01,450

down up in this bitch.
